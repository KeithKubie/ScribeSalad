00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Good afternoon.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.760
I think it's 12:01.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.690
So we're going to start the
program because she has a lot

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.220
of things to cover and then
want to talk to you about.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.020
So, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.320
Good to see you all.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.970
My name is Sonya Lee,
Korea Reference Specialist

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.490
at the Asian Division,
Library of Congress.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.080
Today's lecture is
for the Moral Science

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.600
in Postwar North Korea
by Dr. Dafna Zur.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.150
So Dr. Dafna Zur is assistant
professor in the Department

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.560
of East Asian Languages
and Cultures

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.490
at the Stanford University.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.580
She teaches course
on Korean literature,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.140
cinema and popular culture.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.270
Her book, "Figuring Korean
Futures: Children's Literature

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.350
in Modern Korea" published by
the Stanford University Press

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.540
in 2017, traced the
effective investment

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.050
and quoted aspiration
made possible

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.020
by children's literature in
colonial and postcolonial Korea.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.800
She has published
numerous articles

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.370
on North Korean science
fiction, Korean War in North

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.980
and South Korean children's
literature, and children

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.860
in cinema and Korean
popular culture.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.160
So now without further ado,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.510
please give a big
welcome to Dr. Dafna Zur.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.630
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.930
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: All right.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.430
Well, thank you all so
much for being here.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.290
This is the fanciest
venue I've ever spoken at.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.170
And I think from now
on, it's just going

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.470
to be downhill for me.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.310
So I'm going to try
and just, you know,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.780
milk it for what it's worth.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.050
Thank you to my dear
friend, Sonya Lee,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.500
who has worked tirelessly
for all these years

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.890
to make this Korean
collection just

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.630
such a fantastic collection.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.310
It should be kind of a
world destination as far

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.710
as I'm concerned for
anyone who is interested

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.050
in North Korean especially
Cold War period.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.970
And of course, to all, thank you
to all the guests today, my aunt

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.580
and uncle are here,
as well as friends.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.340
And I'm just so honored today
to be speaking with you today

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.480
and to have a chance
to introduce my work.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.390
So what I'm going to do today
is to briefly introduce some

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750
of the materials that we have
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.000
In fact, I have a slide.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.600
I'm going to talk a little bit
about how we study North Korea.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.440
Those of us who are
studying especially--

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.480
and from my historical
perspective, what are the tools,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.190
how do we go about doing that?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.640
I'm going to then talk about the
Library of Congress collection

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.890
and what it has to offer.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.200
And lastly, I'm going to
talk about my own interest

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.610
in North Korean science
and science fiction

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.250
and tell you a little bit about
how I came to study this topic

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.360
and I will end with a
little bit more sort

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.560
of in-detail examination
and share with you some

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.880
of my recent findings.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.940
So how do we study North Korea?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.870
I mean, this may seem like a
very simple question but many

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.600
of us can't travel
there including myself.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.000
I have not been to North Korea.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.760
A lot of my-- as I was telling
this one before, a lot of the--

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.970
my European colleagues in fact
go quite frequently there,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.370
of course also limited
into the kind of materials

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.000
that I-- they have access to.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.300
But we can't go, right.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.880
And we don't have
access to their archives,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.060
whatever those might look like.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.940
We also can't do what we
call fieldwork or we can't go

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.460
and interview people or
get a sense of, you know,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.260
how people live and
how they interact.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.600
So much of our knowledge
is built

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.730
through printed materials,
right.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.500
We try and get as much access
to a broad range of materials,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.010
magazines, newspapers,
leaflets, school textbooks,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.280
whatever we can get
our hands on basically,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.230
to try and piece
together a sense of kind

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.300
of the lived reality and
that, you know, on the ground

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.180
in North Korea, you know.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.700
So we-- everything
is fascinating

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.610
and everything can
really help us, you know,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.800
from literary sources to popular
sources, specialized, general,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.010
anything we can get
helps build this kind

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.830
of more complete picture
of North Korea for those

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.170
of us working on this
historical period.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.640
So I want to talk a little
bit about what the range

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.490
of materials out there are.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.790
So one of the big sources
or the important sources

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.470
that have served a lot
of the historians working

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.050
on North Korea are the-- what's
called the captured documents

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.040
that are held in the National
Archives, that were collected

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.490
by the US Army during
the Korean War.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.660
And these archives--
I myself have not been

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.960
to those archives and seen them.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.150
I have talked to a lot of
my colleagues who have.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.780
They're basically boxes and
boxes of papers that were taken

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.460
by the US military
during the Korean War.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.790
They sit there and historians
go and they just sort of try

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.230
and piece together this very
chaotic kind of archive.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.970
And so that archive has served
as a foundation for studies

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.610
of history for example
by Professor Suzy Kim

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.020
from Rutgers University,
Professor Charles Armstrong

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.450
from Columbia University
are a few

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.230
and also I'm sure
there's a couple of books.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.330
So these archives in--

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.330
the National Archives have
really served to create a kind

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.710
of a foundation for
understanding what was going

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.740
on on the ground in
North Korea in the 1950s.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.960
But as I said, they're very,
very-- as I understand,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.030
they're very chaotic, you know,
these are loose papers lying

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.850
in boxes and you have to kind of
really spend a long time trying

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.150
to make sense of them.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.840
The next kind of source that we
have are former Soviet archives.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.500
So, you know, this is,
you know, I always think

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.410
if I could do it all again, I
would learn Russian and Korean,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.430
as well as, you know,
many other languages.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.160
There's never enough time.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.450
But my colleagues who
have traveled to Moscow--

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.470
I'm going there in May, so
I'm very excited about that,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.490
but there's a national library
there with great archives.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.930
I have colleagues
working, you know,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:47.060
in other former Soviet
languages that have access

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.250
to foreign service
documents, and so on.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.600
So those are also really
great places to mine

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.640
for documents relating to
early North Korea, 1950s,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.580
1945 to 1955, 1960, et cetera.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.520
And we have also-- I did say
before that it's hard for us

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.110
to travel to North Korea and
talk to North Koreans but,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.120
you know, as we know, there are
increasing number of defectors

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.100
that are settling-- most of
them are settling in South Korea

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.170
but a lot of them also find
their way to the United States

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.380
and to other countries
in the world.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.980
And they are very
important sources

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.490
for understanding what
life is like at the moment.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.570
There are some challenges
with these oral histories,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.590
mostly that there are not that
many defectors and they are--

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.550
they have what we call
interview fatigue.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.790
They can often get, you
know, interviewed by many,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.190
many number of journalists,
of scholars, anthropologists,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.020
people working on North Korea.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.340
And so it's, you know, they're--
We don't have enough of a range.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.420
Also a lot of the
defectors do tend to come

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.520
from let's say Pyongyang.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.060
They come from a certain class.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.890
And so they do give insights
into certain place and time

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.280
but their-- the range can
be a little bit limited.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.980
So oral histories are important
and they're getting done

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.080
but they also are not--

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.250
cannot give at this
time a complete picture.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:17.470
And lastly, the published
materials that we can find

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.720
in library collections
around the world.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.290
So I mentioned Moscow before.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.310
Many of you may be surprised
or not surprised to know

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.250
that South Korea
actually does not have a--

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.130
Oh gosh, I'm being recorded.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.300
Their collection is more
limited, shall we say?

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.230
And it may not be surprising to
those of you who know something

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.440
about South Korean laws and the
way that there has just been--

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.430
the access to North Korea has
been really, really limited

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.820
in South-- limited
in South Korea.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.540
So right now, the only place
that you can get access

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.360
to North Korean printed
materials in South Korea is

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.960
on the fifth floor of
the Seodaemun doseogwan

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.090
which is the main library or
the central library in Seoul.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.420
You go in there, you-- Well,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.960
and much like the Library
of Congress, I guess.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.340
Well, actually, you have
to give your passport.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.870
You have-- they take down all
your personal information.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.740
They want to know
exactly who is coming in

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.710
and out of that library.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.490
And their collections tend

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.470
to be a little bit
more limited in scope.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.090
They have a lot more,
I think, sort of 1980s,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.260
post 1980s materials, some
from the '60s and '70s.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.780
But that's a much more
kind of limited collection.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.220
In United States, I
would say the two biggest

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.360
or the largest collections
are at Harvard,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.490
at the Yenching library, and
by far, this wonderful library,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.310
the Library of Congress.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:50.170
And so, as I said-- And I
actually don't know as much

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.240
about the history
of this archive.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.790
Maybe Sonya Lee can
fill me in later

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.180
or maybe add to the discussion.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.370
But what I know is
that we have here

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.670
in the Asian reading room just
down the hall, 274 journals

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.710
from North Korea,
going all the way back

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:12.060
to what we call the
liberation space of 1945.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.130
It is the largest collection
of North Korean serials

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.490
from the 1940s to 1960s, so
really the most exciting,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.910
as far as I'm concerned,
period of North Korean history,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.740
including recent
publications of North Korea.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.120
So it's not only a
historical archive.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.650
It's also very, very current.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.440
And so, next slide.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.610
And even more exciting,
just as of, I think,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.390
a couple of days ago, it
has been made known to me

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.390
that we now have-- thanks to a
generous grant, the beginnings

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.610
of a database of
searchable articles

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.920
in the North Korean serials,
not all of them just a number.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.230
But just the fact that we-- you
can type in keywords, you know,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.220
I'm interested in articles
having to do with agriculture

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.440
or with nuclear, you know,
nuclear development or you know,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.440
women's rights or whatever,
you can plug in those keywords

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.970
and you will get access to
in a much more focused way.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.670
While as, you know, until now,
it's the good old fashion.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.110
You go in there, you take
out, you know, 50 books

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.670
and then you just sit and start
going through them and looking

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.360
for a needle in a haystack,
although that's actually--

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.870
usually yields a lot of fun
things as I'll talk about later.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.570
You usually find
things by accident.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.720
That's another real
advantage, I think,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.090
to not really knowing
what you're looking for.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.350
So these articles give us
insight into policy, economics,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.940
political, social, historic,
military, legal, financial

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.240
and governmental issues.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.240
So it's really, like I
said, a rich, rich archive.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.650
There's something for everyone,
but you have to read Korean.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.470
And as I said, it's
searchable articles right now

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.320
from only 18 journals.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.620
What do we say?

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.120
We have 274, so this is
just a small sampling

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.110
of important journals.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.860
So it's a wonderful beginning.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.430
And if anyone knows of any, you
know, well-intentioned donor

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.090
who wants to help us build
this archive then you--

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.440
I'll give you Sonya Lee's email

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.370
and we can keep working
on that archive.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.970
That database is
extremely important.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:26.060
OK. So that's, until now,
just kind of introduction

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.890
to what we have here at the
Library of Congress which,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.200
you know, it's just a gem for
those of us who are interested

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.210
in early North Korean history.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:40.240
And so a little bit about
how I came to this field.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.860
So in 2007, I was looking
for a dissertation topic.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.730
Those of you who know in
the process of doing a--

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.400
getting your PhD,
the all important,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.250
what is my dissertation
going to be, what's going

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.820
to be my territory, you
know, my mark in the field.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.440
And I had different ideas.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.630
I kind of came to Korean
studies via circuitous route.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.650
I grew up in New York
and in Israel and my--

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.190
was a soldier but I also did
martial arts and I got to Korea.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.760
And I had a lot of
different interests.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.850
I was very curious
about travel literature.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.910
I'll talk a little bit about
that today but as a traveler

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.140
and as a person who has kind
of lived in different places,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.070
I was really interested
in how people kind

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.420
of understand what
traveling means

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.850
and what they're
actually looking at,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.150
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.060
So I was looking for a different
topic for my dissertation.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.950
But I-- at that time, my
older son was two years old,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:47.620
and my parents had saved
all my children's books

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.420
from when I was young,
when I was very little.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.330
And they brought it over.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.630
I was in Vancouver at the time.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.850
And I was reading my old
books to my children.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.970
And it occurred to me,
my husband is Korean,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.910
and I have a big Korean
family, but it occurred to me

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.440
that I knew nothing about
Korean children's literature.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.330
And I was just really
curious what is out there.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.260
So, you know, I just started by
thinking about what's being--

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.320
what are published
now, or picture books.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.310
I looked a little bit at-- I
was interested a little bit

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.540
in the Korean War and how
that was being portrayed

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.080
in children's literature.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.200
But soon enough, I got sucked
into the colonial period

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.090
and that was where I spent
the last 10 years thinking

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.660
about how children's
literature emerged in Korea

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.600
under Japanese colonial rule
which was from 1910 to 1945.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.700
But the first journal
or magazine

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.530
for non-adult readers came
out in 1908 so I was really--

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.180
became interested in what
children's literature is

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.610
in Korea and how it
emerged and how it--

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.020
kind of what was
the relationship

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.500
between this literature and the,
you know, the following four,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.980
five decades of both
colonial rule

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.450
and ideological fracturing
and whatnot.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.350
So I became interested in
literature for children

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.800
and that became the topic of
my dissertation and other book

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.980
that was published in 2017.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.040
But one day, I was, you know,
I got an email that goes

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.000
on to this Korean
studies LISTSERV

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.230
and there was an announcement
about a special grant to go

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.130
to the Library of Congress
and check out the archives.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.610
And I had not realized
that there were going

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.750
to be Korean language materials
in this library and I looked,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.050
you know, I went
into the website.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.230
You know, I was at the
University of British Columbia

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.780
in Vancouver, UBC it's called.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.930
And, you know, there's no money
there for graduate students.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.490
So I'm like, someone is
going to give me money

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.790
to go check out an archive.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.090
I got to see what this is.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.740
So I went into the
website and I just typed

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.160
in children's literature,
Adong Munhak in Korean.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.840
And a page popped up and
there were multiple books

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.060
and magazines that showed up.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.750
And I thought, oh, this
is really interesting.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.050
I noticed and I realized

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.320
that they were published
in Pyongyang.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.090
And so I thought, oh my
gosh, I hit a goldmine.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.030
I had not heard of this.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.930
You know, the-- You know, no
one that I knew was working

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.410
on children's literature.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.550
I never thought that we would
have something on North Korea.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.500
So that was the first time
I came to this library,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.140
went to the Asian reading room.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.970
Sonya at the time and the
other librarians brought

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.630
out all these materials.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.490
And it was just, you know,
kind of such an eye-opener.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.860
So that's what I mean,
when you look for something

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.200
and you find something
else by accident,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.100
that turns out to be the
really kind of exciting stuff.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:42.540
And so, see where I am.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.370
So when I came to the Library
of Congress and I was looking

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.960
for these materials, this
Adong Munhak magazine,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.000
I at the time was really
interested in the Korean War.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.390
I, you know, just found
it to be such a tragic

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.660
but also really fascinating
conflict.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.170
And-- So I was just
interested in--

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.230
I guess, growing
up also in Israel

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.130
and having my own fair share of
exposure to amounts of conflict,

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.450
so I'm just really interested in
how this shows up for children.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:16.770
And so lo and behold, I found
picture books of all kinds,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.570
both from the 1950s and '60s
in this children's magazine

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.430
but also more from the
'80s and even '90s.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.170
And so at this juncture,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.030
I was able to put
together a publication.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.850
It was my first article.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:37.550
And it helped me understand how
the Korean War has been narrated

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.050
in picture books and
fiction for young readers.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:46.010
And I was trying to understand
how these picture books mobilize

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.010
certain sentiments
through these images.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.980
And also, you know, to
try and gauge whether

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.520
or not I can read a little
bit of kind of nuance

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.370
or resistance or, you know,
not just to read them sort

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.860
of top-down, this is the
way you're supposed to think

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.200
and nobody would ever think
otherwise but just to try

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.670
and see how I can put myself in
the shoes of the readers and see

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.650
if I can kind of understand
or find any nuance.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.100
But in any case, I'm
going to share some

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.590
of the images with you.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.890
So I was looking for example
at images of South Koreans

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:27.450
and how they were represented as
perhaps, you know, not perhaps,

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.870
but groveling and
hapless, and impotent and--

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.010
so you know the South
Koreans are painted

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.350
in this extremely
negative light.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.390
They are mostly, as you'll
see in this next image,

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.820
basically puppets at the
hands of the Americans.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.380
So the Americans of
course are painted

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.860
in extremely negative
ways, you know,

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.380
with these grotesque features.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.040
They, you know, they
basically just boss

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.870
around the South Koreans.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.330
They are morally depraved.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.160
This is one of my
favorite images.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.250
It's actually North Koreans
disguised as South Koreans.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.550
This is really interesting.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.940
And they walk in on the
American base and of course,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.120
there they are drunk with some
kind of cans opened and there's,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.770
you know, the bottle is
surely is kind of, you know,

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.080
alcohol and they're sleeping.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.820
And there's a picture,
I love this.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.950
If you'll notice on
the left hand side,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.610
the picture there
seems to be of a nude.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.640
So, you know, all these
ways in which, you know,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.050
the Americans are portrayed in
these very, very negative ways,

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.870
and so on and so forth.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.930
So it's really trying
to understand, OK,

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.500
how are these images
making their way into the,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.250
let's say national imagination
and how North Koreans are raised

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.860
to think about this conflict.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.910
I also became really interested
maybe because of my kind

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.780
of morbid sensibility but I
became really interested in just

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.900
in portrayals of
violence in general.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.710
You know, and trying to
understand where this was coming

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:06.140
from and what the purpose
of such violent images were.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.610
You know, and of course all
of this is within a context

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.610
of you know, this postwar period

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.110
in which the United
States reduced North Korea

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.620
to rubble with, you
know, constant bombing.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.310
And these images I found or I
argued really helped to sort

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.660
of dehumanize the
American enemy.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.660
Desensitize a reader I
think to a certain extent

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.780
and really sustain sentiments
of hostility in a context

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.400
where there's so
little context, right?

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.790
I mean this is-- We're 70
years now after the Korean war

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.270
and there has not been-- I mean
there have been hot conflicts

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.960
around the DMZ and, you know,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.850
God forbid that there shouldn't
be anything more than that

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.570
and hopefully-- or anyway.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.740
So-- but there is-- so
I think that these kinds

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.370
of images serve a
certain function of trying

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:04.300
to maintain a kind of, you
know, attitude or stance

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.250
when in the absence of a
kind of outright conflict.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:15.060
And so what I try to show in
some of my early publications is

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.360
that the Korean War--

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.220
these images from children's
literature really help us

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.750
understand how-- you know,

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.850
even over 70 years this
conflict can be made meaningful

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.310
and feel fresh to
North Koreans who are--

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.630
so many of whom are growing

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.950
up without living
memory of the war.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.310
And so-- and especially in
light of what you would think

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.160
of you know how's children's
literature does tend

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.610
to sanitize certain more-- you
know, more difficult content,

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.980
I found this to be
extremely interesting.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.070
And I focused in particular on
this one image at the end of one

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.410
of the books that I covered
where you have this--

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.890
a young North Korean soldier
named Seung-hwan [assumed

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.390
spelling] whose picture here
moments before his death.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.560
He survived a torture
that was dealt to him

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.810
by these menacing American
captors and their threat is sort

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.020
of accentuated by their
darkened shadows behind them,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.150
their faces are so grotesque.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.770
But he has these, you know, rosy
cheeks, this kind of sharp look

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.350
in his eye, looking
into the distance.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.740
He's very beautiful.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.270
And so, it's trying to kind of
understand the sort of physical

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:24.250
and spiritual transcendence that
a lot of these images embody

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.990
as models for the desire of or
kind of unity and renewal and--

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.140
and into the conflict.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.670
And so I argued that
the graphic violence

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.880
in North Korean illustrations,
both violence that's dealt

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:45.880
to the enemy and that is
inflicted upon these youngsters

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.260
is a, you know, turns them into
martyrs and it becomes part

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.160
of this performance where
the ultimate goal is the sort

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.880
of regeneration of the
North Korean nation.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.210
So that was one of the
early publications.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.900
But as I was doing this work,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.680
I happen to come
across these images.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.470
They caught my eye and I just
sort of did a double take.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.000
I said, what is this?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.730
And it was really, again,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.660
I wasn't looking
for this material.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.210
I was just kind of focused on
Korean more related materials.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.550
And I found these
images in Adong Munhak,

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.630
in the children's magazine.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:25.390
And yes, this is science
fiction from North Korea.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.370
And so I found that
science fiction narratives--

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.550
This led to a publication
that came out in 2014

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.220
out of the Journal of Asian
Studies called "Let's go

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.120
to the Moon" and I found

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.490
that science fiction narratives
set a period in this magazine

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.560
from 1955 in translation
from the Russian and then

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.280
on from 1956 they have
these original short stories

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.460
and longer novels.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.150
And I argued that they bear
witness to certain extent

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.520
to the significant
Soviet influence

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.440
in the formative period
of the Soviet Union.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.020
But rather than just talk about
these images as imitations

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.120
of Soviet materials, you
know, that it's just kind

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.110
of a derivative, I tried instead

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.110
to locate science
fiction narratives

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.420
within North Korean discourses
on children's literature

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.450
that was preoccupied
with the role of fiction

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:27.320
as both a reflection
of the real, of reality

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.490
and also a projection of
the eminent utopian future.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.120
So through closed readings
of science fiction narratives

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.110
from this period, I underscore
the way that science, technology

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.190
and the environment
are implicated

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.800
in North Korean political
discourses of development

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.680
and point to the way in which
these works resolve the inherent

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.370
tension between the desirable

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.140
and seemingly contradictory
qualities of the ideal scientist

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.980
who is both an obedient
servant of the collective

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.350
and tireless questioner of
received and accepted truths.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.090
And thus these North
Korean narratives

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.300
of science fiction
established the child scientist

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.100
as the true kind of protagonist
of the-- of North Korea.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.390
And so I started there
with this publication.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.360
Wanted to just give you
also a taste of some

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.720
of the fun findings on the--

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.440
on the right had side is
Adong Munhak, a picture of one

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.100
of my favorite novels from 1960.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.880
And to the left is a
suspiciously similar image

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880
from 1954 from the
Soviet magazine Pioner.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.440
So you can really see that there
is a borrowing, there is a kind

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.310
of intertextual references.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.740
You know, this image on the
right did not credit the image

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.920
on the left but you
know, there's--

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.190
They're very open
about the relationship

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.760
with the Soviet Union and their
interest in exploring you know,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.700
outer space and going into deep
sea exploration and whatnot.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.720
And so, this really kind of
gave me an opportunity to think

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.290
about North Korea to
appreciate how truly global

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.910
and international North Korea
was in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.950
Of course you know, with the
Soviet bloc but, you know,

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.120
there was so much exchange,
scientists going back and forth.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.400
That is really just
a fascinating period.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.420
And more recently, I have
looked into some translations.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.710
So I was able to track down--

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.620
Actually it started with this
publication on the far right.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.760
This was something I found
in Library of Congress

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.680
in my last visit
last May or April,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.220
I don't remember
when I was here.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.650
But it was a short story in
two parts called you know,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.600
"Flight to the Moon" or
"Travel to the Moon" and it said

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.650
in very small letters that
it is a Soviet translation

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.620
of a Soviet novel.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.200
And so with the help
of a wonderful student

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.050
in the Slavic department
at Stanford I was able

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.450
to trace both the
original cartoon from 1953

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:21.080
and the 1955 script and
then this translation

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:27.070
from 1956 helped me not
just again not just to say,

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.850
oh North Korea is just copying
or it's just a derivative

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.200
of Soviet materials, but
to actually look at the way

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.590
that the Korean text played
with and changed and, you know,

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.880
and tweaked and transformed
the original Russian

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.440
to suit its own--
its own purposes.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.060
So you know, again
you don't want--

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.480
those of us who do work with
translation, it's always very,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.330
very interesting to
do these comparisons

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.860
because you realize that, you
know, of course, you know,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.160
those of us who translate
know this

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.240
but translation is
interpretation, right?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.950
I mean these translators are
interpreting the original

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.110
and they are making
more, you know,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.450
and making of it
something of their own.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.160
OK, so in the remaining time--

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.430
and I do want to leave time for
questions, but I want to share

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.270
with you my new project

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.010
which I'm really,
really excited about.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.220
This is coming-- again this
is all materials that came

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.940
out of the Library of
Congress collection.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.500
And this new article
that is coming

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.800
out in September is titled
"Making Science Moral:

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.110
The Story of Data in
Postwar North Korea".

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:38.370
So in the-- in 1953, North Korea
was a budding nation seeking

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.580
to rebuild itself
from the rubble up.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.560
And it pinned its hopes on
engineers and scientists.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.460
Ambitious goals could be set
but without collective resolve

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.800
or the skills necessary to turn
these visions into reality,

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.470
these goals were meaningless.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.530
So to this end, the new
government worked quickly

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.180
to eradicate illiteracy,

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.980
establish a compulsory
education system

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.730
and to cultivate
institutions of higher learning.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.340
The injection of foreign capital

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.630
from socialist countries
was also instrumental

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.370
to North Korea's postwar
development of science

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.730
and technology, as
was the integration

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.110
of experienced scientist

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.750
from overseas including
from South Korea.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.510
The Soviet inspired
[foreign language] or Academy

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.600
of Sciences was established
in 1952 in order

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.680
to ensure the speedy development
of science and technology

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.000
and to centralize its
research activities.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.310
So what I find really
interesting is that at the risk

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.690
of stating the obvious,
the scientific--

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.950
I'm talking here about science,
the popular science magazines

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.770
for young readers
in North Korea.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:46.030
The scientific is always
framed in ideological terms

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.770
but ideology is shot
through with morality.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.270
So ideology in its broadest
terms is a set of conscious

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.480
and unconscious political
beliefs that are produced

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.440
and reproduced symbolically
and that help preserve power

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.380
and dominance of
certain interest groups.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.000
But ideology is inherently
normative,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.050
meaning that ideology
establishes behavioral norms

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.160
and guides the way that social
actors make sense of their world

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.680
and determine what's
good and evil.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.810
So I set out on this project
to understand the relationship

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.430
between the ideological and
the moral through science

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.310
and general interest
magazines for Korean youth.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.780
And in this article, I
take note of the manner

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.080
in which scientific and--

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.820
the scientific and the
ideological content came

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.200
to acquire a moral cadence

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.420
in these magazines published
in the '50s and '60s.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:40.220
And so in my article,
I make three arguments.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.530
First, I argue that the moral
landscaping of youth was seen

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.980
as vital to North Korea's
future and that science

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.140
in general interest
magazines were useful tools

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.480
for teaching morality

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.190
and restructuring two important
relationships in moral terms,

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.110
youth and nature and
youth and community.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:03.540
And I call this section
"Making Science Moral".

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.810
Second, I argue that the
moment that science moves

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.130
through language and
is organized in textual

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.020
and visual narrative
is the moment

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.100
that science becomes
both rhetorically potent

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.600
and also potentially volatile.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.660
So I call that section
"The Story of Data".

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.550
And third and last I argue
that it is this volatility,

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.080
that this volatility was
traced to the youthful mind

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.080
or the space of the
imagination or fantasy.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.650
And it was the most illusive
and therefore the most--

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.340
or in most urgent
need of restructuring.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.810
And so I call this last section
"Fantasy the Final Frontier".

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.690
And so, I mean to show that
it was not just the logic

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.390
of ideology but morality
that was invoked in order

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.420
to secure a scientific,
political and social utopia.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.210
So as I said, this is based

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:56.150
on these wonderful
materials gathered

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.830
from the Library of Congress.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:02.820
These are just some of the just
wonderful, wonderful covers.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.010
We have four different
magazines here [inaudible]

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.030
or Science World
is on the far left.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.130
And then we have [foreign
language] right next

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.260
to it, so junior science.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.320
Sonyeondan is-- translates
roughly as boy scouts or scouts.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.620
And then [foreign language]

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.200
or new generation
is on the far right.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.990
So the exception of the one on
the far left, [foreign language]

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.660
which was aimed, excuse me,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.160
at a general audience
not youth per se.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.810
The other three are aimed
at school-age readers,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.680
middle to high school
and even college.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.520
And so they differ according
to their intended audience,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.930
in their focus, detail,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.440
the number of illustrations,
the overall tone.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.070
But they share an attempt to
turn the specialized knowledge

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.430
of science into commonsense.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.210
So [foreign language]
for example, again,

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.670
one on the far left, had
monthly features titled "Science

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.940
in Everyday Life" or "Science
as Hobby" or "Science is Power".

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.980
Some of these also had columns
that were called "Commonsense"

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.130
where they try to explain common
social and scientific phenomena.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.400
So in their own words they
attempted to liberate science

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.010
from the mystery in which it
was shrouded and to demonstrate

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.290
that science was a practical
skill that could be taken

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.250
up by anyone, anywhere.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:28.000
So I'm going to give a couple
of examples now and I think

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.550
that what I find that's
really interesting

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.650
when I present this material, I
just presented it the other day

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:37.580
at the Association for Asian
Studies, is that there are--

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.980
And, you know, I'd be curious
to hear from you as well.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.350
Some of these are really
recognizable to people who grew

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.650
up out within South Korea,
maybe the United States as well.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.800
So I think there's a really a
kind of common Cold War culture

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.100
that I think emerges
from these magazines

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.350
which I think is really
interesting to think about.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.970
So that's why those of us who
study North Korea always have

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.350
to study it within the broader
context, both of the Cold War

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:09.030
and the socialist kind of bloc.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.640
But also within, you
know, this divide of both

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.350
across the iron curtains
have-- are also looking at--

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.600
The way science developed,
for example, in South Korea

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.150
and the United States, and there
are many, many similarities.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:27.820
So for example, in a this
essay "Let Us Raise the Flag

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.170
of Science and Move Forward",

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.200
the noun science here is
modified by the adjective true.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.220
So here I'm talking
more about how, again,

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.320
science becomes couched in
this kind of moral language.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.450
So here's a quote
from this essay.

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.090
"Above all we must first study
and learn true science so as

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.270
to dedicate all of
our power to it."

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.790
Here the author is not referring
to a particular discipline

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.110
of science but rather
in approach to science

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.880
that involves observation for
the sake of uncovering the laws

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.310
of nature that will lead to
social and economic development

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.570
that will benefit
the collective.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.760
The essay contrasts the way
that science is practiced

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.990
in South Korea, which is for
its own sake, unsystematically,

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.530
driven by futile
fantasy, ambition,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.670
superstition and spirits.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.020
By contrast, science in
North Korea is called

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.230
"sincere science"
that must be practiced

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.390
with a sincere attitude,
tenacity

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.910
and with refined
patriotic ideology.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:26.610
The frequent use of the term
[foreign language] or refined,

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.160
refined values, refined
patriotic ideology,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.570
it functions both as aesthetic
and also as a moral term.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.870
Index is a sophisticated
understanding

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.140
of social relations and the
unwavering and noble commitment

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.960
to advance science
that will bring

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.370
about development for everyone.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.210
And I think that that's one of
the things that really comes

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.730
out of these materials
if we talk about,

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.280
you know, socialist science.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.660
What is being brought up
here is that this is science

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.630
that is dedicated
both to improve

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:58.410
or to improve the
quality of life

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.330
for everyone not
for a relative few.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:05.170
And so it's about democratizing
and spreading knowledge

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.190
that used to be the privy
of a small elite group,

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.520
making science available to
all, but also creating a kind

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.980
of development that
will raise everyone

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.080
and not just benefit a small,
you know, a number of a--

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.290
you know, or this
elite group as I said.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.420
So how did writers themselves

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.450
of these magazines
talk about morality?

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.970
So in their words, I quote.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.750
"Morality is a set of life
norms that instructs us on how

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:34.710
to behave in the social world,
a set of values that aims

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.520
at true liberation
developed by and among worker,

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:42.510
ours is the most progressive and
noble morality in the world."

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.980
So, science in general interest
magazines were particularly

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.310
useful, I argue, for teaching
morality and more specifically

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.120
in restructuring, as I said,
two important relationships

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.460
in moral terms, youth and
nature and youth and community.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.810
And I'm going to give you
a couple of examples now.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:01.310
And I'll try and wrap up soon.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.910
So the restructuring
of the relationship

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.310
between the individual
and collective

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.580
and moral terms took place
in magazines in the 1950s

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:14.040
and they were reinforced in--
in such sections as this one,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.390
which is called the
"binocular core" or [inaudible]

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:21.800
which was a monthly
section that kind

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.790
of through a binocular
spotlight on positive

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.240
and negative behavior.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.220
And so you can see here just
from this one example that--

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.970
Sorry, this is really
small, that's really small,

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.850
I'm sorry about the, you
know, it's hard to see

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.480
but I'll hopefully be
able to describe it

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.270
to you a little bit more.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:45.640
But on the left hand side, you
have positive behaviors, right?

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.750
And again this is all about how
one should relate to the group

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.420
and also how one should relate
or should be in the world.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.410
So it's both interpersonal but
also kind of an environmental--

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.390
how to behave with
stuff around you.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:05.150
So on the left hand side,
you have a positive example

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:11.180
of someone who is treating
communal property with respect,

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.650
everyone is cleaning
together and working together.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.640
And on the right hand side,
you have kids sitting on desks

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.140
with their legs spread,
their shoes are

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.540
on the desk, it's terrible.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.670
Then the one under that, you
have on the left hand side,

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.300
instructions that you
should be always walking

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.510
on the left had side
of the street.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.460
And then on the right hands
side, you see what happens

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.800
when you don't respect the
environment and you don't comply

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.290
to that order, you bump
into a really nice halmoni,

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.650
a nice grandma who is
just walking on the--

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:42.600
you know, where she needs to be.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.900
And then the bottom most
image, you have, you know,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.820
the caption there
reads, you know,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.080
your desks are not
paralleled bars,

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.510
so doing your calisthenics
is very important.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.870
You have that on
the left hand side.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:00.900
On the right hand side you see
a kid that's fooling around

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.600
and not doing what he's
supposed to be doing.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.300
So I find this also interesting
visually where you know,

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.140
the right-- the proper behavior
on the left hand side is also,

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.140
in terms of the visual
layout is very geometric

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.220
and you have the horizontal and
vertical lines and things kind

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.770
of are sitting where they
should be sitting in the image.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.960
While as on the right hand side,
you have a lot of vertical--

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.650
diagonal lines, you have-- you
have stars, you have squiggles,

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.950
you have, you know, the--

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.490
you know, all of these are
very disruptive angles.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.040
And so, it's really sort of
illustrating visually this kind

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.850
of grammar of order
and disruption.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:42.800
OK. So up until now-- And
this now is in that magazine,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.100
[foreign language]
new generation

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.950
which also had also a
lot of this scientific

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.250
and philosophical text.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.960
So until now I'm trying to
show how morality finds its way

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.410
into a lot of this
early material.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:40:04.560
So, OK, I'm going to try
and go a little bit faster.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.060
So in this section
I talk is called--

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.180
the title is "The
Story of Data".

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.750
And here I draw more
on narrative theory

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.520
which concerns itself with the
relationship between an event

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.320
and the representation of
that event in language.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.930
So when we talk about science
writing, I mean this is one

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.410
of the really fun things about
this new project that I'm doing,

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.570
is that I get a chance to
think about science not just

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.420
as presenting representation of
data that is completely stripped

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.800
of any kind of linguistic
energy.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.570
That's a kind of maybe fancy
way of saying that, you know,

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.180
we tend to think about science
as really just for scientist.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.260
But in fact what we sort--

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.620
scholarship has shown is
that even scientist working

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.280
on scientific papers and,
you know, or publishing

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.800
in scientific journals,
they use language in a way

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.070
that is also assuasive,
that also carries

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.070
with it certain cultural
assumptions.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:04.860
And so, therefore we
are justified in looking

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.520
at even a seemingly
straightforward article

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.820
like this which is,
you know, travel to,

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.780
you know, to the universe.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.030
That's talking about the
launch of the satellites

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.650
by the soviets in 1962.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.880
It details the experience
of the pilots.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.700
It describes their
daily routines

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.410
and it conveys their
personal greetings

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.710
to all socialist nations.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.600
So this is a kind of very
straightforward essay.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.040
And so I think, OK,
what can I do with this?

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.910
Well, how is this material for
me to study a kind of moral

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.210
or assuasive language?

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.730
So, sure enough,
you know, I read it

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.290
and then there's a
sentence there about how

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:48.200
with this double launch the
soviets have basically left the

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.840
Americans in the dust.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.620
And they use this very kind

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.030
of strong expression
[foreign language].

00:41:55.030 --> 00:42:00.590
You know, it's really sort of
dismissive of the Americans.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:04.010
And so here you have
instances where seemingly

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.420
as I said straightforward
reportage actually has a lot

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.880
of this moral and also
ideological language.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.140
And so it helps me kind of
understand how knowledge

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.130
about the world is being built.

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:21.110
And so the question that I'm
asking going forward is what

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.600
happens when science
passes through language,

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.900
when scientific content is
presented in narrative form?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.470
The process of embedding science
and writing both fictional

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.600
and nonfiction demands a
moral framing that was central

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.810
to North Korea's nation
identity in the 1950s.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.420
Without science and technology,

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.690
material recreation would
not have been possible.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.360
And without material
progress, the social

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.640
and political projects
would fail.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.470
So it was in the
narratives of magazines

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.900
for young North Korean
readers that the scientific

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.760
and the moral could
be brought together.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.170
But the power of
language in narrative form

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.090
to shape the moral landscape

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.200
of young readers is also
what rendered it volatile.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.810
This was because language
open itself to interpretation

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.240
and also because
there was a space

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.070
into which language did not have
access, and that was the space

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.700
of the mind, the
field of imagination.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.450
What they called
[foreign language].

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.600
The frontier of the imagination
was the ultimate target

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.390
for moral and scientific
narratives

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.970
because it proved both the sight
of the greatest hope and also

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.790
of the greatest anxiety.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.270
For science and morality
to be effective,

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:31.100
young people's imagination
had to be primed and guided.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.390
and that is my third and final
argument and will I just,

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:38.960
you know, say-- I'll just read
this quote and end with that.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.260
Yi Ki Yong was a very
important writer in north Korea,

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.920
writes in 1959 in a
magazine, says the following.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.790
"As the protagonist of
the Chollima generation,

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.820
you students must dream big
about the goals of tomorrow.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.740
Spread the wings of fantasy, get
in step with the new generation

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.390
of space travelers, and together
take an active role on the stage

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.030
of science and creativity."

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.730
And so what I show in this
last part of the article,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.360
which is coming out, so you'll
be able to read it, you know,

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.040
later, is that there was all
this anxiety about fantasy.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.210
Because fantasy was really
important but because

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.670
as I argue with, it's
in the space of the mind

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.610
that language and, you
know, that's not reachable.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.340
It was very, very
important to make sure

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.060
that fantasy is structured
in imagination

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.210
and structured properly.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:32.480
And so in postliberation
North Korea the urgency

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.020
to build a socially cohesive

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.120
and technically advanced
country was predicated, I argue,

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.200
on the moral structuring
of the young.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.960
Scientific content and science
and literary magazines prove

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.190
to be an effective
site for this goal.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.210
In particular the power of
narrative and its mobilization

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.580
of language showed itself

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.370
to be an effective
conduit of moral behavior.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.750
But the anxiety over the
slippage of language and the pre

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.730
or extra linguistics site
of imagination showed itself

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.280
to be a persistent
source of concern.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.690
A focus on the narrative
devices that worked

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:09.070
to reshape a moral thought
and to conquer the frontier

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:13.180
of fantasy demonstrates the way
in which the war for science

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.770
and technology was waged
with the power of story.

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:24.260
So that is the material that I'm
interested in and just finally--

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.630
I have put some images here
of the many, many magazines

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.620
that we have here in the Library
of Congress and I will end now

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.130
and open the floor for question.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.510
So thank you very
much for listening.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:38.750
[ Applause ]

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.050
Yeah. I'll just take questions.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.350
Yes, sir? Yeah.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:43.380
&gt;&gt; I would be willing
to bet that North Korea,

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.110
with well established
scientists,

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:49.550
are probably more willing to be
engaged in actual communication

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.290
with the general population.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.120
In the United States
there has been

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.220
in many instances a situation

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.700
where really established
scientists are [inaudible]

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.850
if they knew that too much.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:06.610
I think of Carl Sagan who was
a great adviser of science

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.410
in our country and was very
effective but according

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:13.250
to some reports was denied
election to the National Academy

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.480
of Sciences because even
though subsequently he had the

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.130
credential, popularization
aspect have [inaudible].

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.550
But I think it's
different with North Korea

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.850
but I don't really know.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.150
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:26.450
No. That's a great point.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.650
I mean I-- Again, I'm really
focused on the '50s and '60s.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.670
I can't really speak about
contemporary North Korea.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:33.740
I mean that would
be fascinating but--

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.740
So I can't really speak
to how the situation now

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:41.060
but I can only say that indeed,
I mean what makes this period

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.120
so interesting is this push for
the popularization of science

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.060
and the people that are being
represented, the scholars

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.830
that are writing
in these magazines

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.090
for young readers
are the president

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.390
of Kim Il-sung University.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:57.340
They are-- They're politicians,
they are community members,

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.950
they are teachers,
they're professors.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.920
And so they are writing these
essays for young readers.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.920
So I think that in fact it
is the case that their--

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.640
the popularization of
say making science--

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.970
giving access to science for all
of the North Korean population,

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.330
along with quickly eradicating
illiteracy and getting kids

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.830
into schools was
really, really important.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.130
So, thank you for that comment.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.430
Yes?

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.230
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] a couple of
things at the beginning, one,

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:34.680
you're not able to go to the
[inaudible] visit North Korea.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.770
Although there are certain
terms that allow people to go.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.070
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:41.370
&gt;&gt; Things like Library

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.750
of Congress would have
been into that category.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.050
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:51.900
&gt;&gt; But even if you got there and
in connection to the defectors,

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:57.490
obviously many defectors
there are already familiar

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.440
with these materials
that you study.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.740
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Right.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.290
&gt;&gt; This come also
from North Korea

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.420
and walking out of [inaudible].

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.720
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: That's right.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.850
&gt;&gt; What is the thoughts on
what exist, it's stored,

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.400
and [inaudible] the situation?

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.990
It's all three [inaudible]
today.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.290
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Right.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.620
&gt;&gt; Were any of this
information that exist--

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.660
Have you heard anything
from other folks [inaudible]

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.330
or they've got access to
the material that exist?

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.630
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:31.930
&gt;&gt; Or is that all
in [inaudible]?

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.230
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:34.530
Well, you know, I would venture
to guess that the Library

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:37.600
of Congress-- I mean if one day
hopefully there will be peaceful

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.830
resolution and, you know,
and North Korea will be open

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.840
to this kind of archival
research, I would venture

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.040
to guess that what we have
here is probably, you know,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.110
more and better preserved
than what is in North Korea.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:55.190
And I think that because the
regime has proven to really want

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.700
to rewrite and revise
its history based

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.480
on who is in power.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.710
And so it wouldn't-- I
wouldn't be surprised if a lot

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.680
of this earlier material,
especially this kind of material

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.220
that lends itself to
multiplicity of voices.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.220
You can read, you know, the--
I mean this is that what--

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.440
what's so exciting about this
period is that you can read

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.470
into it ways in which North
Korea is still trying to figure

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:21.670
out what, you know, what some
of the possibilities are.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.960
There's a kind of a polyphony I
would say of ideas and stances

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.370
that perhaps would not
fit later on with regime.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:31.210
So I hope I'm wrong and I hope
that once we do get access

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.310
that there's going to
be a wonderful library

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.690
where all these materials can
be stored because, you know,

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.220
while we have a lot here and
as I'm going to Moscow in May

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.690
and I'm hoping to see other
materials that we don't have,

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:39.010
it would be wonderful to
have it all in one place.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.310
But I think that what
we have at the Library

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.610
of Congress is probably
the most complete picture

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:43.510
that we will ever get access
too, so-- But I hope I'm wrong.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:50.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.260
Yeah. So, China and especially
[inaudible], so this is the area

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.450
that is across from North
Korea, they also tend

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.750
to have a lot of materials.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:04.040
I'm not sure how strong their
earlier historical material is.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.470
The colleagues that I
collaborate with and work with,

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.490
Andre Schmidt from the
University of Toronto

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.930
and Suzy Kim from Rutgers and
Charles Armstrong from Columbia,

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:17.050
and others that are
working on North Korea,

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:20.550
[inaudible] Australian National
University, we've all sort

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.800
of come to the conclusion
that the materials

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.380
at the Library Congress
and Moscow seem

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.990
to be among the most complete.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.470
But there are pockets, there
are places, and so that's part

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:35.090
of our job is to kind of figure
out where these places are.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:39.350
But those seem to be the
"easiest" places to get access.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:43.180
Yeah, thank you.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.540
Yeah, right there.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:50.340
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your presentation.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.350
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:54.050
Thank you.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.650
&gt;&gt; So, I'm really fascinated

00:50:55.650 --> 00:51:01.010
by the [inaudible]
production in North Korea.

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:12.710
I can get a sense that there's
a wide readership but I'm not--

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.880
the idea of [inaudible]
there is really strange

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.190
and [inaudible] me.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:21.510
So, could you give us some
background on, you know,

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:27.390
what your sense of being a
writer in North Korea was then

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.440
and how that occupation
has [inaudible].

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.020
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah, that's
a great dissertation topic.

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:38.250
So I-- If you want to write
it, I will fully support it.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.100
Yeah. No, this is a
really great question

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.230
and it's unfortunately
again, it's one of the--

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:50.110
one of the challenges of working
with an archive like this

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:56.340
that has not been looked
at really anywhere is that,

00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.530
you know, I don't-- When
I come across these names,

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.030
unless they're identified in
the text, I don't know a lot

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.240
of the times who
these people are.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.940
And so it's a great question.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.650
And the question of, you
know, who are these writers

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.480
or how they came to write
for, you know, what they're--

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.140
you know, how the
editing process worked,

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:20.550
how the materials were
circulated, these are all things

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.170
that I, at this point,
I'm not able

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.770
to really get a good sense of.

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:30.300
I think that-- but I should
say that I have a colleague

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.390
at the University of
Binghamton, Immanuel Kim,

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.540
who just published a
book out of Hawaii Press

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.560
about North Korean literature.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.570
So, it's one of the--
we have two books

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:43.410
on North Korean literature
and his is this brand new one.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.110
He actually has a
relationship with one

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:51.410
of the North Korean authors
that he writes about.

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:54.710
And just the other
day, we were talking.

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:59.470
He was telling us about how
when he traveled to North Korea,

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.320
he gets-- he met with
him several times

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.570
and he had submitted
questions in advance,

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:09.730
and the author had
responded to the questions.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:13.110
And when they met in
North Korea in Pyongyang,

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:14.940
they were accompanied
by the minder.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.800
There's-- We always has
these minders that, you know,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:23.280
are there to make sure that,
you know, the information

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.650
that gets passed is,
you know, transparent.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:35.290
But the author had
apparently typed out 60 pages

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:40.760
of his responses and the
minder just sat there

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:48.140
and Immanuel just went through
and he was deliberately very,

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.140
very slow because
he was, you know,

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:53.930
hoping that the guy would
just say, the hell with it,

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.340
just take it and read
it on your own time.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.620
But the minder waited.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.900
He sat three and a half
hours with him to go

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.200
through every single page.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.250
And so, I think at
this time, you know,

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:10.270
questions about readership
would be much, you know,

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:11.870
much better posed to
my colleague Immanuel,

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:13.170
but it's a great question.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.930
Unfortunately, I don't
have a good answer to it.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.300
I'm sorry.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.460
Yeah. So, did you want
to ask a question?

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.890
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you so much for
this fascinating presentation.

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.190
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Thank you.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.490
&gt;&gt; My question is, to what
extent was international

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:24.790
relations and politics woven
into the moral education.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.090
For example, when they were
promoting, learning science,

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.390
did they talk about, you
know, the Soviet Union is

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.690
to be respected and
we work them.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:29.990
Or was it more like,
oh, self-reliance

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:31.290
and Kim Il-sung is god and
you figure that yourself.

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.590
You know, what--

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:33.890
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Right.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.190
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious about that.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.490
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Yeah.

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:37.790
No, great question.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.090
So, the reason again I love
working on the '50s and '60s

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.390
that it is more of the former
and less of the latter.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:41.690
And so, absolutely, when
you read the magazines

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:42.990
from the 1950s in North
Korea, it is so international.

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.290
There are travels, you know,
all over the Soviet bloc.

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:45.590
There are-- As I said there
are Soviets that are scientists

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:46.890
that come into North Korea.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:48.190
There are North Koreans
going overseas.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.490
There's so much exchange.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:50.790
It's so rich.

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.090
And so absolutely
there is a sense

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.390
that North Korea is
extremely international.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.690
It's a proud-- yeah, proud
part of the socialist bloc

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.990
and it is very much kind of up
in step with what is happening

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.290
in the Soviet Union
in other countries.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:58.590
So, the children
that are reading

00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.890
or the young reading these
magazines are definitely made

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:01.190
to see themselves as a part of a
broader, you know, a broad kind

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:02.490
of republic of socialist
children on the world.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.790
So, yeah. Thank you.

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:05.590
Yes.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:16.650
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:18.860
Right. Great question.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.210
And again, you know, I'm not in
a really good place right now

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:23.880
to be able to answer
it completely.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.230
But my understanding from
what I've seen until now,

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.420
there are no private
publication.

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.160
These are not commercial
enterprises.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.950
These are all public
institutions and the process

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:39.740
of publishing, as it was
in South Korea as well,

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.850
is controlled very closely
and there are censorship,

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:45.810
there are multiple steps
in which writers have

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:47.110
to submit their writing.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.060
And so, you know, it's I
would say non-for-profit.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.810
You know, these are magazines
that are looked at very,

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.990
very closely and
are-- they're only--

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.360
and they're public
or I would say kind

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.170
of national publishing houses.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:06.030
So, you know, again
that's to say

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.560
that there is very strict
censorship that is controlled,

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.220
but it's also the case for
South Korea where, you know,

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.370
especially with the
American military government,

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:19.110
they watched South Korean
publications very closely

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.230
to kind of smell out any sort

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:25.240
of pro-communist kind
of, you know, tendencies.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:30.080
So, you know, they-- I'm
not an expert on this period

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.700
of the kind of the publishing
industry as I would like to be

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.540
but my sense is that, yes,
the cases that this was--

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.370
there was no private publishing.

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.510
Sir, in the back, did
you have a question?

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:52.730
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:54.530
Right.

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:57.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.070
Right.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:05.020
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.010
Right. So, again, you
know, these are things

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.060
that I think are a little
bit more difficult to gauge,

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.920
barring a kind of more extensive
research on reader reception

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.540
in North Korea from
the '50s to '60s.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.160
You can imagine that's a
little bit challenging.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:23.790
I mean my answer to that is that
we can tell to a certain extent

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.390
that there is reader
participation

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:30.240
because you get these-- in every
issue there are always reader

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.820
letters that are
sent to the editor.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:36.590
So, you get voices from
readers and they're always--

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:37.890
they're at-- the place--

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:39.680
The location from which they
are writing and the name

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.480
of their school and their
age is written down.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.780
So, you kind see that, oh,

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.550
a lot of these magazines are
being picked up by young readers

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:51.020
from all over the
country and so--

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.500
But we don't have
circulation numbers.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.360
You know, there's not been
that kind of research done

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.290
on these magazines quite yet.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.970
So, I can't say, for
certain, but the--

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:05.430
within the magazine as I read
them, I see that they are kind

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:09.220
of talking about the
importance that they view

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.350
in as their materials as
supplementary to school.

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.930
So, the sense is that
yes, there are textbooks.

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.710
Yeah, the children
are in school,

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.140
but these magazines
are meant to kind of--

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.010
as enrichment, as
further studying.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:25.890
And again, with reader
letters that are embedded

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.310
in these magazines,
you get a sense

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:31.510
of how broad geographically
these readers are spread out.

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:41.690
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:46.950
Yeah. You know what, I
can't really speak now

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.830
because my interest sort of--

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.220
I've bracketed them at
the 1960s, but my guess--

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.480
Oh, and I don't have that
image here as to that.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.110
I have a guide that I know
who is in North Korea,

00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:59.890
who works with one
of these tour groups.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:03.370
And he has recently sent me
this fantastic collection

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:07.750
of postcards from the science--
There's a science center,

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.590
like a science world or
whatever in Pyongyang

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:13.350
that is delightful and colorful.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:16.800
And so, my sense is that
scientific education

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.760
and [inaudible] science and
STEM is as important now

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.220
in North Korea as
it has ever been.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.920
So, I'm sorry, I
can't take more.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.220
Can I take more questions?

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.520
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: Sorry.

00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.820
I feel like I'm a parent
who's trying to send the kids

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.960
to bed and, mom, we want
to stay longer, you know.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.260
I feel awful.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.750
But we have to-- we
better wrap it up.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.640
Maybe she will hang
around a few minutes.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.940
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Sure.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.240
Absolutely.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.540
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: So, you can ask
later but we have to close up.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.630
So, it's just-- So, thank
you to Dr. Dafna Zur

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:44.730
and share her journey
and then insight with us.

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.030
It's so marvelous.

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.330
Give--

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:48.630
&gt;&gt; Dafna Zur: Thank you
very much [applause].

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:49.930
Thank you.

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:53.680
&gt;&gt; Sonya Lee: And thanks again
for coming for the event.

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.920
Actually I think most
of-- put your name signed.

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.730
If you have not, please
do so because that kind

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:03.340
of justify we need to have
this kind of event more often.

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.640
Thank you.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.940
Have a wonderful afternoon.

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.240
