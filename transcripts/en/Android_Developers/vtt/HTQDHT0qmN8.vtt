ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
once again to "Android

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.070
Design in Action." As always,
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.550
ADAM KOCH: Hey guys,
Adam Koch.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.510
NICK BUTCHER: And here in
London, Nick Butcher.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.200
ROMAN NURIK: And today, we're
going to talk about--

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.720
what are we going
to talk about?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.650
We're going to talk about
fitness apps,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.790
personal fitness apps.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.740
Actually this is one of Nick's
favorite categories, so he'll

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.470
be doing lots and lots of
talking today about Endomondo,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.090
which is the great app that
we'll be highlighting today.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.810
And then after we cover
fitness apps, and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.760
specifically, actually, some
tablet stuff about fitness

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.340
apps, we'll jump into modern
UIs and, more specifically,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.980
some patterns that constitute
modern UIs beyond just what

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.460
you've seen on the
design guide.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.460
So with that, let's jump
in with Endomondo.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.610
So I'm going to hand
it over right to--

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.490
oh, we've got some flickering
going on.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.410
Should we try to--?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.920
Let's see if we can just
unplug this and

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.480
plug it back in.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.620
NICK BUTCHER: Are you
channelling the spirit of "The

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.206
App Clinic" from last week?

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.730
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.490
Still happening.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.895
ADAM KOCH: This is
a Y-Cast restart.

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:13.060
Yeah, should we restart?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.370
OK.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's restart.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.370
We'll get back to you in
one second, folks.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.630
All right, so I think
we're back.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.600
And hopefully the flickering
has stopped.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.540
I think that's a little bit of
the demo gods that haunted the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.260
app clinic for so long
giving us a little

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.820
taste of their medicine.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.670
But anyway, with Endomondo, I
guess we should start with

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.530
Nick, since Nick, this is
one your favorite apps.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.130
Do you want to talk about
in Endomondo?

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.070
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, this is one
of my most frequently used

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.652
apps, I would say.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.440
I do a little bit of triatholon
in my spare time

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.980
away from Android development.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.340
So I use this application
to track my training.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.160
And I'm a bit of a stats
nerd about it.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.699
So if you've used a fitness
app, it offers the common

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.830
functionality of tracking your
workouts, using TPS, and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.440
logging it, and so
on and so forth.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440
But one of my favorite aspects
is that they've done a really

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.630
nice job of following the
Android UI guidelines and also

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.120
integrating some fun stuff like
contact badges and so on

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590
that integrate deeply
with the Android UI.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.620
So here, the screenshot we're
looking at, we can see, for

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.600
example, an activity feed, and
your local history of the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.720
workouts that you've done.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.530
And I think you can see, they've
done a pretty decent

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.842
job of following our
UI guidelines.

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:41.610
ROMAN NURIK: You
can see here--

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.870
just to interrupt you, Nick--

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.240
this is a very, very pitiful
version of history.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
I don't actually do running,
or cycling, or anything.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.820
That's really Nick's
line of work there.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.880
But this is just one example
of like what it could look

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.380
like after you capture an event,
what it looks like.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.690
But obviously, in a real world
scenario, you'd see a full

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.800
list of things.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.140
Sorry, go on, Nick.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.270
NICK BUTCHER: That is
a very sparse list.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.450
Did you have a comment you
wanted to make about the Tap

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.040
to Refresh pattern we're
seeing here?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.600
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, yeah, so I
actually want to throw it out

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.440
to you guys, like, what are your
thoughts on the sort of

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.580
Pull to Refresh or Tap to
Refresh kind of pattern?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.990
Personally, I actually like
seeing the refresh icon in the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.600
Action bar, which is over to
an indeterminate spinner,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.180
while the refresh is going,
but I don't know.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.570
What do you guys think?

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.570
NICK BUTCHER: So just explain
the pattern, as is, because

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.040
it's not clear from
the screen shot.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520
It's kind of a variation on the
Pull to Refresh pattern.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.690
So here on the right, you can
Roman's activity would

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.050
actually be flushed to the top
until you Pull it Down.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.520
And then it reveals an extra
option to Tap to Refresh.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.900
So in my opinion, this isn't
working terribly well because

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.030
Pull to Refresh, I guess has
some convenience, that it's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.750
just one gesture.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.890
Whereas this is, like, a
gesture and then a tap.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.890
So you may as well just have
the Refresh button.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.110
For me, I prefer, like you said,
Adam, the Refresh button

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.790
in the Action bar, which
turns into an

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.010
indeterminate progress--

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.190
mostly because, in Android,
lists aren't springy.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.740
I can see this is the pattern
from Tweety, on iOS.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.430
And it works pretty well on
that platform because each

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.290
list has this kind of springy
characteristic to it.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.290
And so it works really well
to overextended it

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.250
to kind of do something.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.390
Whereas Android, you
don't have that.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.206
The expectation is to have some
kind of force field, some

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:27.335
kind of indication that you've
reached the end of the list.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.465
So to then reveal an extra
option doesn't fit with the

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:30.976
mental [? model ?] for me.

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:32.480
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I
definitely agree.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.840
I think that if you use
something like Tap to Refresh,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.420
or I guess, Pull to Refresh,
really, our recommendation has

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.780
been, if you use it, then use
it in addition to something

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.900
like a Refresh button
in the Action bar,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.980
or even in the overflow.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.110
If refresh is automatic, or if
it's something that users

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.110
aren't really going to use all
the time, then putting it into

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.685
the overflow is totally
acceptable.

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.470
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I think, in
this case, there's plenty of

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.530
room to show an actual
Action item there.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.880
Sometimes it may not
be possible.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.490
You'll have to put it in
the overflow menu.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.330
So maybe Pull to Refresh might
be more obviously to users

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.470
then, I guess.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.440
But in this case.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.645
I personally would think it
would be a good addition.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.690
NICK BUTCHER: OK, should
we push on, then?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.620
So these two screens are the
history and kind of the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.560
activity stream and
the news feed.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.970
If we go ahead to next, there,
some of the cool functionality

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.750
it has, which I really
like, is the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.020
ability to find routes--

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.810
so routes that other users have
created, which is awesome

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.170
if you're traveling.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.020
So if I come out to California
and visit the Mountain View

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.980
mothership, I've used this
functionality to find running

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.970
routes in an unfamiliar area,
which is fantastic.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.126
ADAM KOCH: Nick, do you mean
roots or routes there?

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:40.540
NICK BUTCHER: [LAUGH]

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.205
I'm pretty sure I
mean "roots."

00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:42.680
ADAM KOCH: [LAUGH]

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.055
OK, just checking.

00:05:45.055 --> 00:05:47.550
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, and as well
as just seeing the route

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.962
itself, you can have this
concept of a champion, you can

00:05:49.962 --> 00:05:51.325
try and beat someone's
time, or that kind of

00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:54.860
stuff, all fun stuff.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.780
So these are fun features we
want to put out and highlight

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.050
from the phone app.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.104
So as Roman said, I'm a heavy
user of the app--

00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:04.350
a couple times a
day, normally.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.840
So I've been pretty happy with
using the application.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.355
But what I really feel
like it's lacking

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.840
is some tablet features.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.000
So if we look at what the
functionality of the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.280
application offers on the
website, there's actually some

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.220
really, really useful
functionality, which I feel

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.220
would be perfect to pull into
the tablet application.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.740
So here, for example, is the
base workout screen, which you

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.740
can use to track
your workouts.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.680
And I find this really
motivating because you get

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.810
this month view, which shows
tiny little avatars of the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.920
activities you've done.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.030
And for me, this is one of the
things that keeps me coming

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.320
back, and keeps me using
the application.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.300
Like, if I miss a couple of
days-- and there's no way you

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.680
can come back and fill
in those squares--

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.400
I love it when you browse back
and see a fully populated

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.910
month and see how consistent
your training's been.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.880
ROMAN NURIK: Nick, you're
a workout-aholic,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.780
just looking at this.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.500
I mean, more than one item of
exercise per day, that's kind

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500
of impressive.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.870
NICK BUTCHER: Well, I kind of
commute to work on my bike,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.980
which is cheating, maybe.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.230
There we go.

00:07:08.173 --> 00:07:10.440
Yeah, so I think this is a
really important piece of

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.100
information which I thought
would be super handy, to pull

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.270
on the larger real estate that
you get on a tablet.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.910
And going on to the next screen,
I think the other

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.063
thing we wanted to talk about
was some stats that

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:23.960
you can pull out.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.190
Like I said, I'm a bit of a
stats nerd, so I love being

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.145
able to pour over my workouts
and seeing, you know, am I

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:32.570
improving, have I done more
mileage, have I done faster

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.880
average times, all that stuff.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.751
So I feel like there's a real
opportunity to pull out some

00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:39.570
of this information when
you have more room.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.566
When we talk about tablets, no
one is suggesting that you're

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:44.470
going to go running with a Nexus
10 strapped to your arm

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.712
or in your back pocket.

00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:46.080
That's ridiculous.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.930
ADAM KOCH: Maybe a
Nexus 7, though.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.020
NICK BUTCHER: Even a Nexus 7.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.780
pulled up a good point,
actually, I hadn't really

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.280
considered is-- kind of sat in
a gym, on an exercise bike,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.650
for example.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.070
So you're using your tablet to
watch a movie or catch up on

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.470
the latest Android development
on YouTube.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.150
But you might want to
be a flick over to a

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.830
tablet-optimized interface on
your workout app to capture

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.780
that awesome workout
you've just done.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.652
But for me, I think the biggest
things I want to do be

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:14.155
able to do is kind of consume
the news feed, see how I'm

00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:18.331
doing, pour over my stats, and
also plan ahead, like look at

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.430
the different routes
that are available.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.030
So this is the major aspects
that we've tried to

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.855
incorporate into a re-imagining
of the

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:27.950
application.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.260
ROMAN NURIK: And one thing I
want to just point out--

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.659
there's this really small part
of this website, I guess, in

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:38.429
one of the panes on the side,
that shows you, I guess, the

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.309
individual types of workouts
that you've done as well as

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.890
for how long you did them this
month, as well as how many

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:46.790
calories you've burned.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.230
And I feel like that kind of
summary information is fairly

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.270
interesting to see on a
month-to-month basis.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.350
So having that readily
available, I think, also would

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.620
be something that's interesting
in a tablet or a

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.455
larger-screen UI.

00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:01.470
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.770
ROMAN NURIK: I think there
was one more, oh no.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.800
We don't, OK.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.260
So we took a look at Endomondo,
and, actually, I

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.570
talked to Nick about how he uses
the app and what he would

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.760
want from a tablet experience.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.600
And we took a look at what it
could look like on a tablet.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.200
And specifically, more of a
consumption experience,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.600
providing more of a
consumption flow.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.410
You're sitting on your couch,
and you're planning what to do

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.650
for the rest of the week--

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.060
you kind of want to just see
what your current stats are.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.810
As well as, like Nick said,
if you happen to arrive in

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.400
Mountain View visiting the
mothership, I guess, what are

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.270
the nearby routes, and
how to browse them in

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.470
a very visual way?

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.700
So we took a bunch of these
things and we decided to

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.970
create something that's like
a really nice dashboard.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.240
And not a dashboard in the sense
that it's just kind of

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.170
showing you navigational
options, like the dashboard

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.800
pattern where you'd see like
four or six icons that would

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.260
show a new piece of content.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.570
This is really like a
content-forward dashboard that

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.500
shows you different aspects of
the app, different aspects of

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.960
the service, all
on one screen.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.420
So we focused on, I guess, the
information hierarchy here is

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.700
really like--

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.100
your current workouts.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.730
That's the primary pane here.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.380
It's the center pane.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.470
And then I guess the second
most important item on the

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.320
screen is the social activity,
whether somebody commented on

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.670
one of your events, or if
somebody posted that they've

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.210
just ran near a route
near you, or

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.240
"root" near you, I guess.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.650
You want to see these things
in a nice, easy-to-consume

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.830
feed in the right.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.200
And what we've done is, we've
basically taken the existing

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.850
feed from those handset screens
and we've kind of

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.910
enriched the individual
content items.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.810
So each piece of content here,
you'll notice, has more than

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.240
just a piece of text.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.170
It has the time.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.360
It has clickable objects, like,
you can touch on Han to

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.500
see details on Han, a full
profile page for Han.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.870
And then if it's a route that
you may be interested in,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.870
maybe you expand the route
into this kind of like a

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.680
token, or content expando
that's in there.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.410
The other thing I wanted to
point out is that, to take

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.660
action, in the current
app on handsets, you

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.540
can comment on something.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.910
There's this kind of comment
button next to each list item.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.460
But there's no way
to like anything.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.660
I think liking or +1-ing or
such, is kind of a lighter way

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.100
to interact--

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.310
to say, oh yeah, this is
great, congratulations.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:57.720
So just offering commenting
versus liking seemed kind of--

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.260
NICK BUTCHER: I think the
app has that, actually.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.450
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, OK, oops.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.070
NICK BUTCHER: It's not entirely
clear from the UI

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.690
because the UI is just a plus
and a common bubble, but if

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.690
you click that, it gives you the
option to like a comment.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.960
ROMAN NURIK: Got it.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.500
So what we did here, is,
instead, we used a different

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.110
affordance, basically, the
overflow affordance to

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.590
indicate that, hey, there are
actions, there are multiple

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.100
actions you can take on this.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.380
And obviously, you should be
able to long press to select,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.350
to take action--

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.450
like multiple posts.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.660
But here, to take action on a
single item, you can either

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.480
long press to show the
contextual Action bar, or just

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.110
touch this overflow to show that
there are multiple items,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.160
or multiple actions there.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.900
And this is very similar to
what Google Now does.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.910
So in Google Now, you have
a bunch of cards.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.250
To look at settings for a card
or to take action on cards,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.900
along with action buttons at the
bottom, you can actually

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.960
see this overflow next
to each card.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.290
And then, lastly, we've done
this kind of unique

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.280
presentation of nearby routes.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.520
So let's say this app has
information about the top

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.580
three or four routes
near you that you

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.360
haven't starred or favorited.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.820
This is a method of bubbling
up content.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.090
It's a constant discovery
mechanism.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.130
So you'd be able to swipe left
and right between the

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.290
different nearby routes, showing
a little bit of data

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.150
about how long they are, what
percentage of users like them,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.690
and then what's the
best time on that.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.500
And this is all data that's
already accessible in the app,

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.150
as far as I know.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.670
So this is a 10 inch
landscape.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.310
Actually, there's one
thing I missed.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.550
On the left here, you have
this kind of summary

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.060
information, like this month,
these are the activities

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.370
you've done, this is how many
calories you've burned, this

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.680
is how much time you
spent working out.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.840
Anything else you wanted
to add, Nick?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.395
NICK BUTCHER: Controversial
use of the bold and light

00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:55.630
pattern that is being a little
bit of a love it or hate on

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.866
the new 4.2 lock screen.

00:13:57.866 --> 00:14:00.220
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and there's
actually a combination of a

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.400
condensed here, so
there's condensed

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.510
and light, I believe.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.060
There's bold, light, and
condensed versions of Roboto,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.660
so there's lots of typography
going on throughout these

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.230
[? mugs. ?]

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.290
NICK BUTCHER: My general
feeling is, I love it.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.420
Like, I really like the three
major sections that you've

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.890
broken it up into.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.590
So when you had a 10 inch UI,
a 10 inch tablet with space

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.240
enough to display this thing.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.520
So you get this instant view
of what's going on, you get

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.760
these three major topics that
I'm really interested in

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.560
looking at, from the
first thing.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.350
I'd love to be able to tap
through some of these

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.360
statistics on the left, and I
can I imagine seeing some of

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.400
those graphs, which are
available on the website,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.943
being available on the
device as well.

00:14:39.943 --> 00:14:41.100
That'd be wonderful.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.573
But yeah, I think you've done a
nice job of bubbling up the

00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:46.540
things I really care about.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.650
ROMAN NURIK: And it's important
to note that this

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:49.990
dashboard is very interactive.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.680
It's content-forward, and the
content is manipulable.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.130
So if you want to touch into
snowboarding, to see all the

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.130
different stats for your
snowboarding for this month,

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.585
you can do that.

00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:02.230
You should be able
to touch that.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.520
The other thing I'll mention is
that this app had more than

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.920
just these three sections.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.680
So what I've done here is, I've
offered an Action bar

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.820
spinner to show you other
parts of the app.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.120
So if you want to jump into
other sections, for example--

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.720
not settings, because that
should be in the action

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.180
overflow-- but maybe like, I
don't know, if you actually

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.880
want to start capturing data
on a tablet, maybe that's

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.890
something that you should be
able to do from the spinner.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.110
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think
it's really important to

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.410
stress that, that this is the
same application as we just

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.200
saw on the phone.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.560
I think it's completely OK to
have a completely different

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.470
dashboard, a completely
different home screen, when

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.420
you're running in an entirely
different context.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.535
It's the same information that
we're going to present through

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:46.540
the application.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.000
It's just a completely different
visual treatment or

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.920
priority, as it were.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.190
ROMAN NURIK: So in the interest
of time, let's skip

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.510
through a few of these
other screens.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.820
So this is basically the
portrait version.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.570
And what we've done is, we've
really tried to think, what

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.570
does this screen look like in
multiple orientations as well

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.010
as on multiple sizes?

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.420
It's not just a 10
inch landscape

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.120
tablet world out there.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.540
There's portrait devices, there
are 7 inch devices, and

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.840
they're probably going to vary
in size and screen resolution.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.020
So this is just an example of
what a 10 inch portrait

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.910
mock-up can look like.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.610
What we've basically done is,
we've taken a linear approach

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.800
to laying out this content.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.180
So the hierarchy is
still maintained.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.010
The very top most
item is the most

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.410
important thing, your calendar.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:34.040
The second item, the second
row in the screen, is this

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.770
horizontally pannable
social feed.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.750
And the presentation here,
I'll admit that it's not

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.720
really refined.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.050
There's definitely a lot of
work to be done here, but,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.620
it's just one way you can start
to think about this.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.950
And then that Nearby Routes
section at the

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.220
bottom is still there.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.626
So it's kind of taking up the
same amount of space as it

00:16:54.626 --> 00:16:55.540
normally would.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.905
But again, all these sections
are fairly flexible.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.520
Actually, let me just talk
about that in a bit.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.960
Let's look at the
7 inch layout.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.554
And this is where I want to
mention that that top section,

00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:10.869
that calendar, it's flexible.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.339
You can potentially show another
row of days at the

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.170
bottom or the top.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.359
In this case, you're seeing
another row from February.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:23.390
And then you should be able to
scroll up and down to change

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.900
the current month.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.369
And then you can rearrange the
content from the left to the

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.970
bottom, this summary section.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.550
And the most important part of
the screen, I guess, is that,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.280
on a 7 inch UI, you don't
necessarily have all that

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.150
space as you do on
a 10 inch UI.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.980
So one of the things that
you can do for these

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.460
dashboard-type screens is to
switch over into tabs.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.130
And they should be horizontally
swipeable.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.120
So since there's no real
horizontal interaction here,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.280
it should be fairly
straightforward to allow

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.310
swiping on the entire screen
contents to switch between

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.390
your workouts, your news
feed, and your routes.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.136
And those should all be
laid out vertically.

00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:04.850
NICK BUTCHER: I just want to
call out as well that it's

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.310
absolutely fine to use
this margin point.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.810
I really like the way you've
done that in the 7 inch

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.040
landscape, for example.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.230
Some people feel like you have
to absolutely fill every inch

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.170
of space on the screen.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.470
And that's just not the case.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.280
I mean, if you couldn't stretch
this calendar to be so

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.990
much wider-- that it would start
to feel like the wrong

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.790
aspect ratio.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.390
It'd feel ungainly.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.400
And it's absolutely fine to
introduce a margin point here

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.818
and to just give enough room
for it to breathe.

00:18:28.818 --> 00:18:30.770
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and it's
definitely a little more

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.470
comfortable, on a lot of tablet
UIs, to have some extra

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.750
breathing room on the sides.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.320
I forgot who it was that
mentioned this.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.890
There was a great post that
talked about this.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.400
It was specifically around
typography--

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.680
especially when you're laying
out type, it's not only about

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.030
the measure, the amount of
words per line or your

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.170
characters per line, but it
really eases the strain on the

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.020
eye to have nice, generous
padding when you have lots of

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.840
heavy content, especially
text.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.170
So don't be afraid of
too much space.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.890
Worry more about too
little space.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.725
I think that too little space
is more dangerous.

00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:06.880
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, and
also, where the

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.990
space is on the screen.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.740
You don't want to have things
on the outer edges of the

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.240
screen, like some list views
which might automatically

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.360
stretch out from a phone UI.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.610
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, you
definitely want to have a

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.735
great distribution.

00:19:16.735 --> 00:19:19.930
You want to stand back from the
screen, and be able to see

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.780
a nice mosaic of content--

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.890
not just stuff thrown
into the left edge.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.750
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, have a
squint at it and see where the

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.420
weight of the content lies.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.990
ROMAN NURIK: So I think that
was it for-- and oh,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.430
nevermind, we have some lock
screen mock-ups from Nick.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.110
Nick, do you want to talk about

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.310
the lock screen mock-ups?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.850
NICK BUTCHER: Yep, this is
my number one request.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.320
Endomondo guys, please
make this.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.290
I love the app, but
it needs this.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.100
Lock screen widgets are finally
here, and I think this

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.100
is a perfect use case for it.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.610
So we just quickly mocked up
what it could look like.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.730
So here I am, out on a run,
and right there, with my

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.180
sweaty hands, I don't have to
unlock the device just to see

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.787
how fast I'm going,
how far I've

00:19:57.787 --> 00:19:59.710
traveled, or to take action.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.890
So I've just mocked up here,
just showing three of the

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.190
major pieces of information when
you have the collapsed

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.180
view of the lock
screen widget.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.180
It's telling my distance,
pace, and total time.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.673
And then, if you were to swipe
down to expand out the lock

00:20:12.673 --> 00:20:15.770
screen widget, you would
get the following view,

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.830
take action as well.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.508
So you can pause, stop, or
resume, if you've already

00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:22.980
paused the workout straight
from here.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.890
So you don't have to--

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.540
you're out of breath, you're
quickly trying to stop the

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.850
time so that you don't miss
your PV or whatever.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.560
So I think this is a
really fun use case

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.780
for lock screen widgets.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.480
ROMAN NURIK: And just to point
out, I really like what you've

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.850
done here, Nick, with
the use of white.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.273
So you'll notice here that
everything is either white, a

00:20:43.273 --> 00:20:46.060
shade of white, or it's
transparent white, or

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.190
transparent entirely.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.850
And the reason we can do this
is that, since you're on the

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.040
lock screen, it always
dims the background.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.980
So even if the background was
pure white, the dimming would

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.500
actually make any white text or
iconography on top of the

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.760
lock screen still very
much legible.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.600
So you definitely have the
opportunity to use single

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.800
color, monochrome icons and UI
elements on this screen.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.470
And I really like what you've
done with taking the Play the

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.320
Stop buttons from the app,
which, if you look at the app,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.930
they are actually green,
and they're stylized.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.280
And taking that and adapting
it to what the lock screen

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.310
looks like, which is really
just white on transparent.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.440
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it can be
scary, as a designer, as you

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.030
don't have any control
of these.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.336
There's wallpaper,
obviously, so you

00:21:33.336 --> 00:21:34.200
don't know the backdrop.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.310
So yeah, exactly that, I didn't
want to have some crazy

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.110
clashing color-- if you're going
to have a green button,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.020
it wouldn't really work.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.210
So I just went for a really
clean white to go over.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.880
I think it's about 45% opacity
black over the top of your

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.120
wallpaper, to dim it down,
to achieve this effect.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.450
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.130
OK, and the last screen is what
it would look like if

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.740
you're actually, I guess, in
the paused state or a pause

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.120
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.400
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, the
resume state, yeah.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.410
So it gives you the
option to pause.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.990
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so with
that, let's jump into--

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.170
we have about seven
minutes left.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.960
Unfortunately, well, maybe
sub-fortunately or

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.640
unfortunately, we don't really
have much, or zero, design

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.160
news today.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.180
So we'll just talk about some
UI patterns that are beyond

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.450
just the ones that you've seen
in the design guide.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:24.500
So we've been talking about
Action bars, and responsive

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.980
design, and using typography
a lot.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.940
So you guys have been probably
fairly well exposed to these

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.010
types of UI patterns, especially
horizontal swipe,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.060
swipe to dismiss.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.850
We did some mock-ups
in weeks past that

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.050
included those UI patterns.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.370
So let's look at some of the
less commonly known patterns.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.600
And these aren't necessarily
official patterns.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.870
They're really just community
patterns-- things that the

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:58.800
community have been using and
things that modern UIs should

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.925
definitely take advantage
of if it makes sense.

00:23:00.925 --> 00:23:02.770
NICK BUTCHER: And by community,
we mean the

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.900
incredibly productive Mr. Nurik
has made most of these.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.192
So you're very humble,
but thank you, Roman.

00:23:09.192 --> 00:23:11.720
ADAM KOCH: Single-man
community.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.340
ROMAN NURIK: So the code behind
these, I've definitely

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.940
written up a bunch of the code
snippets to show how to

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.690
implement this, but they're
really following some of the

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:24.040
design practices from Android
apps, from, I guess, first

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.600
party apps, from system apps, as
well as from the community.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.560
But yes, we do have code samples
for all of these.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.240
So if you have questions on
how do you actually get to

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.670
implement these, then let
us know after the show.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.130
So first, let's talk about
done and discard.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.130
We've featured this
in the past.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.470
Basically, it removes the
Action bar entirely and

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.870
replaces it with a very
similar-looking Done and

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.030
Discard bar.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:55.740
So in really simple screens,
where you're just editing a

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.420
form, like filling out some
simple information or making

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.700
some changes to a contact, for
example, you could have Save,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.340
and Cancel, and Up, and Back.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.320
But one of the alternatives is,
really, to just show this

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.100
very simple, straightforward
Done and Discard, or Done and

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.680
Cancel bar at the top.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.430
I guess, do you guys have any
other comments on this?

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.380
I mean, we've talked about
it in the past.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.230
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we
talked about it.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.930
I like it a lot because it's
compete unambiguous as to

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.170
what's going to happen.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.210
I feel it stays true to what
the Action bar offers, but

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.977
this visual treatment just makes
it super clear what's

00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:34.065
going to happen.

00:24:34.065 --> 00:24:36.290
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and there's
an alternative where the Done

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.470
button appears in the top left,
and then Discard is

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.270
something like in the
action overflow.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.510
And that's more useful if you
have other actions that you

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.790
want to show besides
just Done and

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.070
Discard or Done and Cancel.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.700
Or if you really don't
expect or don't

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.100
want people to cancel.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.555
Like if you're saving a contact,
chances are, you're

00:24:56.555 --> 00:24:59.230
going to make the change.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.540
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that's
a good point.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.310
For example, take a look at, in
this system, in the people

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.580
[? are looking at ?] editing or
creating a contact, and I

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.110
think, also, the same
for creating a

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.830
calendar event, right?

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.005
And they'll give you
examples of this.

00:25:10.005 --> 00:25:11.660
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I was just
going to say that that other

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.900
form sort of makes it more
obvious what, say, hitting the

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.260
back button might do.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.840
It would obviously save the
content in that case.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.920
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so Done and
Discard, we recommend this

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.770
for, again, simple
editing forms--

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.250
screens that you're really
just editing a piece of

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.780
content, not something that's
terribly complex.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.870
Then Pin and Progress.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.710
And this is something that I'll
be very briefly cover

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.950
because it's kind of
less often used.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.670
And ideally, you save everything
to your device.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.150
You cache everything and cache
opportunistically.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.810
But in cases where you have
movies or large files, where

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.300
it's clear that the action of
caching or saving to your

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.860
device is pretty heavy weight,
you may want to give the user

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.700
an explicit way to save or to
pin content from the cloud

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.760
onto your device.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.735
And so this is basically a
little UI element, this little

00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:12.240
Pin button, it's kind of like
a check box, where, if it's

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.940
checked, then this
should be pinned.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.060
And then in the background,
it shows the

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.140
progress of the pinning.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.570
So if it's like a 300 meg
download, and the app has

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.970
downloaded 200 megs, then this
pie chart should be somewhere

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.210
about 2/3 of the way full.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.410
So very, very simple little
UI widget that you can use

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.970
throughout your apps if you're
dealing with very, very heavy

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:38.130
content pulled from the cloud.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.830
NICK BUTCHER: So I really like
this element as well because

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.530
some people go down a really
explicit route of saying, am I

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.235
in offline mode, am I in online
mode, where I'm going

00:26:49.235 --> 00:26:50.475
to stream or pin?

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:52.440
And I think that's the
wrong way to go.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.880
I think you should really have a
single UI and then just hint

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.700
to the user whether or not
it's available offline.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.245
And picking up and following the
cues that the Play store,

00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:04.180
and the music app which comes
on most devices, [? views ?]

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.530
is going to be a good way
to represent that.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.410
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so we have
about two minutes left.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.920
Let's fly through some
of these others.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.490
Does anybody want to
talk about Undo

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.800
bars, or inline Undo?

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.060
Who wasn't to do it?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.060
Adam.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.680
ADAM KOCH: I feel like Nick
likes this one, especially the

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.520
inline one.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.550
NICK BUTCHER: So there's a
great section the design

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.510
guidelines talking about when to
prompt for confirmation and

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.390
when to kind of offer undo.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.970
And so I'd work through that
flow chart, but the essence is

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.920
that prompting for confirmation
for everything is

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.935
kind of like a road block.

00:27:39.935 --> 00:27:42.640
You can't really perform many
actions very quickly.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.210
So preference to that is, if
you have a way to recover,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.160
then to offer this kind
of undo action.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.710
So yeah, as the name implies,
this offers a way to recover

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.320
from an operation you've
just done, like

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:54.925
archiving and email.

00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:57.640
It lets you undo to restore
it back into your inbox.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.870
And, as Adam says, this work, I
feel, really, really well in

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.630
conjunction with the Swipe to
Dismiss pattern, where, when

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.000
you swipe an item out of the
list, say, it gets replaced

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.560
with an inline Undo button which
lets you bring it back

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:10.970
in from the side.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.470
I think that works
really nicely.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.562
Take a look at the latest
version of the Gmail app on

00:28:14.562 --> 00:28:16.135
Android 4.2 for an
example of that.

00:28:16.135 --> 00:28:17.890
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, I think if
anyone's actually used one of

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.800
these, you breathe a
big sigh of relief.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.740
Like, I deleted something, I
don't know where it went, and

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.020
then typing Undo to quickly
bring it back is a great

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.930
experience.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:30.980
ROMAN NURIK: OK, let's go
to the next pattern.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.880
And this is a pattern,
I guess, we've--

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.870
Nick and myself-- we've dubbed
this Quick Return.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.840
There's no real, official
name for it.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.500
But the idea is that--

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.290
this is Google Now.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.170
It's a screenshot
of Google Now.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.710
This is the idea that you want
to have something that's

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.765
persistent, that's always
available, something like in

00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.130
Google Now, like
the Search bar.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.870
But you don't necessarily want
to take up some of that

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.570
precious vertical real estate.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.230
So what you can do is, that bar
can scroll off the top of

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.780
the screen as you start
scrolling down.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.510
But as the user starts
scrolling up, ever so

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.540
slightly, that bar, wherever you
may be in the scroll area,

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.990
that bar slowly starts
inching back.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.980
And then, as you kind of start
scrolling further, the bar

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.090
becomes fully visible.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.980
And it almost gives the
impression that it's floating

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.480
above the rest of the content,
whether by using a drop shadow

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.820
or whatever.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.060
It's really kind of pinned to
the top without actually

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.750
always being on screen.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.150
So it's readily available,
but not always visible.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.660
It's kind of this nice
duality there.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.340
Let's jump to another
UI pattern.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.210
This is Tokenized text fields.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.890
And I realize we're running a
little short on time, so we've

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.220
got to fly through this.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.940
The idea here is that, rather
than typing out email

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.540
addresses and dealing with lots
of free form text, be

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.270
smart about it.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.660
And if you see something that
is a piece of rich content,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.100
like it actually resolves to
some object, replace it in the

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.550
text field so that the user can
interact with it like it's

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.613
a real object and not just a
bunch of character of text.

00:30:04.613 --> 00:30:06.230
NICK BUTCHER: I'm going to have
to go, guys, I'm getting

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.860
kicked out.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.700
ROMAN NURIK: You're getting
kicked out?

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.510
All right, see you, Nick.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.590
I think that was the last--
oh no, we have one more.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.570
The last one is Bezel swipe.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.700
This is Nick's favorite
UI pattern.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.620
Basically, when you have
horizontally scrollable or

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.160
interactive content in the core
layout of your screens,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.340
you obviously can't really use
that for switching between

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.190
tabs or exposing things like
side [? jars ?] or navigation

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.540
[? jars ?].

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.700
So the idea here is that you
use the Bezel, the leftmost

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.710
and rightmost about 16 dps of
the screen, where if you

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.550
initiate your swipe
from there, it's

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.580
treated as a Bezel swipe.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.550
So you're almost like pulling
the content from off the edge.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.542
And this is what Chrome does,
Chrome frames it.

00:30:51.542 --> 00:30:52.810
ADAM KOCH: That's a good
example, yeah.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.950
ROMAN NURIK: And actually, this
is something that the new

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.510
lock screen does as well,
as far as I know.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.960
So yeah, so this is another
great pattern for always

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.570
making horizontal content
accessible using swipe, but

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.010
also having horizontal

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.570
interaction within your screens.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.150
I think that's the last one.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.250
So we're a little
over on time.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.725
But I guess, thanks again
for joining us on

00:31:14.725 --> 00:31:16.370
Android Design in Action.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.015
As always, I'm Roman.

00:31:18.015 --> 00:31:20.930
ADAM KOCH: See you guys, Adam
Koch, and Nick Butcher, who

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.515
just left us from London.

00:31:22.515 --> 00:31:24.660
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so we'll see
you, not next week, but

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.630
probably in a few weeks.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.250
So see you guys, have
a great break.
