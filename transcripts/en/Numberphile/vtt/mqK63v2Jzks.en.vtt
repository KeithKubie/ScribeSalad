00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
PHIL MORIARTY: Right I've got
my trusty guitar on my back.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.180
Last few months I've been
working on a special musical

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.570
collaboration related to a very

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.635
important number in nature.

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.310
We're about to head off down
the road to meet this

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.940
collaborator for the very
first time, and I'm very

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.190
excited about it.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.850
We're at the studio of Mr.
Dave Brown, here--

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.970
DAVE BROWN: Hi!

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.270
PHIL MORIARTY: Yes, with his
trademark "hi," who's a very

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.229
talented musician, producer.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.190
So we're writing a song, a math
metal song about phi.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.500
Math metal's a genre which
is very sort of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.910
mathematically-based
riffs, I guess.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.270
Very, very syncopated,
very technical.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.450
And after we filmed a video on
pi for Numberphile, a few

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.650
months, Dave got in touch and
was keen to collaborate and to

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.700
really take that idea
and push it further.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.070
And so what we've done is we've
based a song around to

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.970
the number phi, based the
rhythms, based the melody-- if

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.690
you can call it that--

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.440
based the lyrics, all around
phi, the number phi.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.910
DAVE BROWN: First riff I've
got in the song--

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.220
it's a nice clean one.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.040
[MUSIC PLAYS]

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.630
DAVE BROWN: Before we punch
you in the face.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.700
And that's derived from a
riff Phil came up with--

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.120
as you can see here, quite
conveniently--

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.370
from the different
digits of phi.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.090
PHIL MORIARTY: What we also want
to do as well as mapping

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.890
the digits of phi on to the
melodies, on to the riffs, and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.760
on to the rhythms, is also
somehow embed the geometry of

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.310
phi in the song.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060
And the way we're gonna do that
is we're going to take

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.030
the guitar string, length of the
guitar string, and we're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.220
going to pick out the note which
defines, or the position

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.550
on the string which defines the
golden ratio, the note of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.630
the golden ratio, as it were.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.690
And so what we're doing is--

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.180
this is a guitar string,
from here to here.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.390
The fundamental definition
of the golden ratio

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.760
is you've got AB.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.370
So you've got a length A and
you've got a length B here.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.360
So A plus B over A is equal
to A over B, and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120
that's equal to phi.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.380
What we're going to do now is
use your wonderful golden

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.350
ratio calipers--

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.060
where have they gone--

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.170
to define where that note is.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.600
It's going to be a note that's
not going to match up exactly

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.690
with to where-- though
it's not too far--

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.840
where we have a fret
on the guitar.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.050
It's just slightly below
the 17th fret.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.920
And then what we're going to do
is we're going to overdub

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.700
on top of that, or maybe build
it up-- we'll see.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.540
As Dave suggested, what
we're going to do is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.700
then build this up.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.740
So we'll go from that, just
below the 17th fret.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.550
Then we're going to choose
another note, which as you can

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.480
see is just around about where
the screws in the pickup are.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.340
And then we're going to
subdivide that down again,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.710
each time building up and each
time defining the note of the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.490
golden ratio geometrically.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.850
DAVE BROWN: OK.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.780
So this next riff, I thought
it'd be quite cool if we took

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.760
the number of chugs that a
guitar plays-- technical term,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.830
a chug is when the guitar
goes chnnh.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.940
Sounds like-- it's
onomatopoeic.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.840
And we took a number of
them and put a gap in

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.030
between each one.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.850
And if you count the number of
chugs between each gap, you

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.620
actually get the number phi,
which is quite cool.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.580
So take a listen.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.235
[RIFF PLAYS]

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:29.660
So there was one chug, six
chugs, one chug, eight--

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.060
yeah, you get the idea.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.530
PHIL MORIARTY: So these are
gold nanoparticles, two

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.240
nanometers across, in water.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.890
We're not going to really
use the nanoparticles.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.895
What we are going to use
is the vial that the

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:42.260
nanoparticles are in.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.260
But of course, it's gold.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.630
It's the golden ratio, so
we thought it was apt.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.980
Well, I thought it was apt.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.060
DAVE BROWN: Next up, we get to a
riff that's kind of like the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.100
pi video that you guys did,
where Phil mapped the digits

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.760
of pi onto a scale.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.540
We did that with phi onto the
B-flat harmonic minor scale.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.200
I'm not really good
at musical tech.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.945
I do it by ear.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.015
Could I get him shouting
into the mic?

00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:21.314
I need to get a level,
unfortunately.

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:23.850
I'll give you some volume
so you can do it, but.

DAVE BROWN: (SHOUTING)

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.360
PHIL MORIARTY: I've done
this for a long, long

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.190
time, over 20 years.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.130
So I was in a band while
I was a student.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.440

as well.

a lot of fun.

with the song.

I think we've done some very
interesting things.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.740
We've gone beyond--

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.550
people talk about math metal,
but math metal, those riffs

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.390
sound complicated, but they're
not really mapped onto maths.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.780
In this case, we've actually
gone beyond that.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.610
And there's only one other
band, to the best of my

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.873
knowledge, that has attempted
anything like this before, and

00:05:48.873 --> 00:05:50.932
that's a band called
After the Burial.

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:54.470
(SINGING) The proportion
is divine.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.650
DAVE BROWN: So phi is 1 plus the
square root of 5 over 2.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.590
So we decided to be a bit
clever, and we have got 1 in

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.240
this by the open string on the
guitar, representing that.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.270
And the other notes being played
by the guitar are the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.200
digits of square root of 5.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.100
And then over 2, we go into
half-time drums partway

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.028
through this, which I thought
was quite clever, so.

people might

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.440
not consider it beautiful.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.420
I think the way that the maths
are embedded throughout the

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.890
song, yeah, has its own
bizarre beauty about.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.751
Yes.

a similar thing for

very famous mathematician,

developed calculus independently
of Newton.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.340
And he has this wonderful quote,
which is that music is

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.320
the human mind counting
when it doesn't

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.230
know that it's counting.

those so tightly as we
