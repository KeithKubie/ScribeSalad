00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.210
NARRATOR: Pacific
Palisades, California.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.380
July 17, 2015.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.380
5:00 PM.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.290
Police were alerted
that inside an abandoned

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.380
SUV parked on a residential
street is a dead body.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.500
The badly decomposed corpse is
sent to the coroner's office

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.540
so that identification of
the victim can be made.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.420
Although foul play
is not suspected,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.750
as police continue
to investigate,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.210
the case takes a bizarre turn.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.500
[siren]

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.670
The body is identified
by his fiancee

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.880
as 60-year-old
Jeffrey Alan Lash.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.380
Los Angeles police find more
than 1,200 guns and seven tons

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.420
of ammunition, along with
numerous militarized vehicles

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.080
and $230,000 in cash
inside of his home.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.250
His fiancee reports
that Lash had

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.620
proclaimed to be an
alien hybrid secretly

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.290
working for the government.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.290
It's the weirdest story
I think I've ever heard.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.750
His girlfriend-- and she seems
to be pretty normal and legit--

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.790
claims that he's
an alien hybrid,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.710
that he was placed
on this planet

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.460
to do something specifically.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.210
Nothing adds up about his case.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.080
Nothing.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.880
NARRATOR: When
examining the body,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.380
the coroner's office could
not find any fingerprints

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.120
even though fingerprints are the
last skin tissue to decompose.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.080
Lash apparently
had no fingerprints.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.120
His fiancee believed that
he was an alien hybrid.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.500
And we have to wonder
who this guy was.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.830
Was he really an alien
hybrid, as he said?

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.920
Why did he have
all these weapons?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.080
Within the UFO
research community,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.500
there's been a great deal
of controversy surrounding

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.830
Lash's story, because
there's been a suggestion

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.290
that his father, Jeffrey
Lash, may have worked

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.000
on the Roswell incident crash.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.670
That's to say he was a scientist
who may have been brought

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.290
in to study the wreckage.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.790
And so for that
reason, the story's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.000
been elevated to an
even bigger level,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.170
that there was some
sort of infiltration

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.210
of society going on.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.330
DAVID CHILDRESS: A number
of people who have claimed

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.880
that they've been abducted
by extraterrestrials

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.960
also claim that they've
witnessed what they

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.960
say are alien-human hybrids.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.880
And this would indicate that
the extraterrestrials have

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.040
a program of manipulating
people and their DNA

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000
to genetically
alter us slightly.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.290
And perhaps this has been
going on for thousands of years

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.380
and that, even as we are
today, we've been manipulated

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.540
subtly by extraterrestrials.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.330
And this is still going on.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.540
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that there are already

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.920
aliens living among us
and that our governments

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.710
are fully aware of this?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.330
Could this be the
culmination of years

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.420
of extraterrestrial abductions?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.000
DAVID WHITEHEAD:
Our decisions here

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.750
as a species could
very well be affecting

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.080
these other civilizations.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.000
So they may be, in
a sense, intervening

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.670
on their own behalf.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.380
They might not really care
about whether we make it or not.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.210
[whooshing]

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.750
LINDA MOULTON HOWE: If invasion
and takeover of the planet

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.880
were the goal of
these extraterrestrial

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.460
biological entities,
they are so advanced,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.790
it could be done easily.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.040
Therefore, invasion and
takeover of the world

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.250
cannot be their goal.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.920
And if that is not the
goal, then what is the goal?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.120
What is the alien agenda?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.920
[whooshing]

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.420
DAVID CHILDRESS: You have
sort of a dichotomy of,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.120
are we being invaded by
terrible extraterrestrials who

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.960
are trying to take
over our planet,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.420
or are the extraterrestrials
really trying to help us?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.620
And that this has
been an ongoing thing

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.920
for many thousands of years.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.620
I think these
abduction stories

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.830
are all part of a
larger plan, a plan

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.750
going on for a very long time.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.000
This, what we are
experiencing now,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is the next step, where we are
now learning that we are not

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.330
alone and that
they soon will come

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.330
back, because that is what they
promised in the ancient texts.
