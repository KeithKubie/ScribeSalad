00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.935
Speaker 1: Hello,
and Mozel Tops.

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:04.637
It's your friends at
the Reno Sheriff's Department,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.839
and this year
we're making a real effort

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.273
to respect all cultures.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.242
All of them.
Even some of the Asian stuff.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.810
Speaker 2: The Reno Sheriff's
Department

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.847
has always celebrated different
and diverse cultures,

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.148
as far as anyone knows.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.883
Speaker 1: Oh sure.
This outreach

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.784
is not just part of some lawsuit
by those (expletive deleted)

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:21.554
at the ACLU, and that limousine
liberal like Tim Robbins,

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.023
Speaker 2: Expletive deleted.
[inaudible]

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.156
Speaker 1: But
a lot of folks wonder,

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.591
why is Jewish New Year

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.526
not the same
as white people New Year.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.162
Speaker 2: Huh.
It's a gosh darn conundrum.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.731
When do I say
Happy New

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.300
Year to Junior says
names of Jewish friends here.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.202
Well, the Jewish calendar
operates on the moon,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.803
like witches.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:42.174
Speaker 1: For example.
Today is [Tevit] 5,779.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:43.709
It's easier than you think,

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.778
once you know this
simple way to remember it.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.215
Speaker 2: So, we all know
the Jewish year is called

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.517
Rosh Hashana or Yom Teruah,

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.886
and it starts on
the first day of Tishrei

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.789
and it's ends
on the second day of Tishrei,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.024
which is the first month
of the Jewish civil year.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:01.093
But not on the first day
of the ecclesiastical year,

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.863
which is the month of Nisan,
but don't panic.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.831
You can always tell
what Jewish year

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:10.036
it is simply by adding
on 3,671 to the year.

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.337
Yep, it's that easy.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.272
Speaker 1: Yep, it's that easy.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:16.008
Speaker 2: So Happy New Year
everybody.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.443
And to our Jewish friends,

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:18.844
Happy Monday night.
Speaker 1: [inaudible]

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:20.179
Speaker 2: Spit it out,
spit it out.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.581
Speaker 1: No, Junior. I wasn't.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.249
Speaker 2: Spit it out,
spit it out.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.683
Speaker 1: Junior, I wasn't.
I'm not choking.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.285
Speaker 2: It's okay, it's okay.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.121
Does anybody know
the Heimlich maneuver?

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.523
Speaker 1: Ahhh. Hm, don't stop.
This feels good on the buns.
