00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.370
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Good morning.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.160
And welcome to this our third
Cancer Moonshot Program.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.710
I tell you, I said, "How am I
going to warm the [inaudible],"

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.230
because I thought you're going
to come in here, you know,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.080
some people come running
on the stage to the music.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.380
I won't do any of that.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.730
But I do pledge to you
that when you leave here,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.630
you will be much more informed,
better informed and feel

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.430
so edified, as well as fulfilled
that you now understand why all

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.610
of this focus on research,
why is it that we're spending

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.150
so many dollars in trying

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.110
to do these scientific
programs and research.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.360
And the great thing is, this
being the third program,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.860
we did the first one explaining
all about Cancer Moonshot,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.920
because it was actually
fabulous the way it was timed,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.340
because our program
occurred the day

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.580
after Congress passed the Cures
Act, which actually is going

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.780
to be funding this and many
other avenues of research.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.440
So it was very timely.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.810
And then last year we did the
Cancer Genomics Program showing

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.090
you how far we had come
with that research in terms

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.090
of precision medicine and moving
towards personalized medicine.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.250
And so today we thought
we must keep this going.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.810
And so we're doing
translational medicine.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.010
Sounds nice and lofty, right?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.460
And it's pretty much
it's been [inaudible]

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.600
to bench-to-bedside, basically.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.380
And so it's the why
of all the research.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.360
Why are we doing this?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.120
Because at the end of the day
we could have a lot of papers

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.010
and a lot of findings, but
unless we can translate

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.710
that into something usable,
where we can help patients,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.390
then it does not
quite meet its goal.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.690
And the legacy of the
Apollo landing back

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.760
in 1969 was the coining
of the term "moonshot."

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.530
To speak to something that is
so audacious that it would aim

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.760
to do something that
seemed virtually impossible

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.840
and beyond the realm
of all possibility.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.950
And so that alone gives
us a sense of hope.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.210
Not trying to create vain
hope, but trying to have people

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.370
to understand that all this
complex science can be distilled

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.570
into something very useable.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.300
And that is why in our
program today we have not only

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.820
clinicians, but also
our experts, scientists

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.680
and researchers, and
our patient advocates.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.720
So I think you're
in for a real treat.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.110
And I would like to ask my
colleague, Dr. Mary Mazanec,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.790
the director of the
Congressional Research Services

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.440
to come and welcome
you to this program,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.720
and prepare you to
hear our speakers.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.510
So thank you so very much.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:24.580
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Mazanec: Thank
you, Dr. Charles.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.150
So I am -- I think I
just broke the mic here.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.980
What a way to start.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.970
I'm very excited to be
here with you today.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.460
And it is my pleasure to
welcome all of our guests here

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.510
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.580
As Dr. Charles noted, this
is the third in a series

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.460
of discussions centered on the
Cancer Moonshot Initiative.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.100
The Cancer Moonshot Initiative
was initially authorized

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.640
in the 2016 Cures Act.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.650
And the ultimate goal of this
critical initiative is really

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.110
to identify and develop
new therapeutics

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.750
to diagnose and treat cancer.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.470
Now, despite all the
advances in medical science,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.610
cancer remains one
of those diseases

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.180
that still poses a major health
threat to so many Americans.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.920
I think it's fairly
accurate to say

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.520
that cancer affects
virtually everybody.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.210
Many of you probably know
someone whose life was forever

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.520
changed when they received a
diagnosis of cancer, or you,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.040
yourself, may have had your life
turned inside out and upside

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.420
down when you received
a cancer diagnosis.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.230
As some of you know, I'm a
physician, I'm a pulmonologist,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.970
and before I came to D.C.
when I was seeing patients,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.060
I took care of many
patients who had lung cancer.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.590
And lung cancer back then
was pretty much a diagnosis

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.740
that ultimately resulted
in death.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.510
But I saw firsthand the pain and
suffering that my patients went

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.180
through after the diagnosis

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.890
through the various
courses of therapy.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.950
As some of you probably
appreciate,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.170
cancer is the second
leading cause of death,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.590
both in the United
States and worldwide.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.030
And then, although
scientific breakthroughs,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.770
some of which you
have witnessed,

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.540
I witnessed over the
last several decades,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.610
have actually improved the
diagnosis and the survival rates

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.460
of individuals with cancer.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.690
There's so much more to be done.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.440
And we're not there yet
in declaring victory

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.070
over all types of cancer.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.660
So recognizing this,
President Obama, basically,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.030
tasked the former vice
president, Joe Biden,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.790
who had just lost his
son to brain cancer,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.170
to lead a new national
initiative termed the

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.650
Cancer Moonshot.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.870
Congress has been on board
from the very beginning,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.230
and has led the charge
towards conquering cancer

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.900
by consistently working
in a bipartisan manner.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.550
This is one of the areas
where I think there is

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.940
bipartisan agreement.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.200
And they have grappled
with numerous policy issues

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.380
in the area of science,
technology and medical research.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.950
But, as we all know,
advancements are costly.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.560
There's a price tag associated
with medical research.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.240
And Congress has been
aggressively funding research

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.720
in the areas of medical
science that are needed

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.710
to precipitate clinical
progress.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.240
So, just for example,
in fiscal year 2019,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.370
the appropriations
included 5.74 billion

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.880
to the National Cancer
Institute,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.170
which was a $79 million increase

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.370
over the previous fiscal
year to fund research.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.340
As Dr. Charles said, this is the
third in the series of seminars

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.110
that she has organized focused

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.660
on the Cancer Moonshot
Initiative.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.420
The first one was done shortly
after the bill was passed,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.690
and brought together
scientists, healthcare providers

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.020
and patients in a
dialogue surrounding this

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.820
major initiative.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.520
The library hosted its second
seminar in October 2017.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.160
And I had the opportunity to
participate in that one also.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.760
The topic of that one
was cancer genomics.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.870
Cancer genomics dictate how
a tumor behaves, and whether

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.670
or not it responds to treatment.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.420
As many of you realize,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.350
the mapping of the human
genome was a major step forward

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.240
in biomedical research, and
it really opened the door

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.820
to a whole new area of
research and approach

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.040
to treating many
diseases, including cancer.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:44.040
It also heralded the
dawning of personalized

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.550
or precision medicine, where
treatments are actually targeted

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.900
or individualized
to a given patient.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.880
So recent genetic breakthroughs
have actually expanded our

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.940
understanding of cancer.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.490
And this has resulted in new
ways to diagnose cancer and,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.540
hopefully, pick it up early on
in the course of the disease

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.030
when it's still very
treatable and curable.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:21.160
And it has also precipitated
this paradigm shift away

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:28.680
from traditional therapeutics
to more newer approaches,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.830
many of which use
one's own immune system

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.670
to target cancer cells.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.580
Now, today we're going to hear
from a very distinguished panel

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.420
of experts, and from
the individuals

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.950
that are patient advocates

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.820
who have actually
experienced cancer themselves,

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:56.110
to probe more deeply into this
area of research, which is,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.770
basically, based on a
translational medicine approach.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:06.270
Now, as Dr. Charles explained,
translational medicine seeks

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.760
to improve the health and
wellbeing of patients by,

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.950
basically, connecting the
dots between what's happening

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.980
in the laboratory at the
bench with basic research

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.680
to the clinical practice
of medicine.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.560
Now, in a former life
before I came to Washington,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.880
I actually spent
quite a few hours

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.030
at the bench doing research.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.340
And my hope was that at some
point what I was doing would

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.240
have an impact on patient care,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.730
and would improve the
lives of individuals.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.680
So this whole area

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.390
of translational medicine
is a major interest of mine

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.380
that I've followed over the
years here in Washington.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:11:00.360
As I said, it's been described
as a bench-to-bedside approach

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.340
where discoveries in the
laboratory are leveraged

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.730
and "translated" or
developed into new therapies.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.570
But in order for this to happen,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:17.110
you have to the scientists
actually doing the work,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.250
speaking to, collaborating
and sharing information

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.800
with clinicians and
medical care providers

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.720
who are actually
taking care of patients.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.370
And this is what the Cancer
Moonshot is intended to do.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.480
And I'm going to quote
Vice President Joe Biden

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.080
who explained the purpose

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.040
of the Cancer Moonshot
Initiative with these words.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.210
"The Cancer Moonshot Initiative
is to better understand

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.700
and breakdown the
silos and stovepipes

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.350
that prevent the sharing of
information and impedes advances

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.080
in cancer research
and treatment,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.070
while building a focused

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.850
and coordinated effort
at home and abroad."

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:10.040
So, in this sense, translational
medicine is a tool.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.170
It's an approach that is
central to the success

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.440
of this major initiative.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.490
It has both the power and
the potential to be the force

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.550
that drives us towards,
ultimately,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.660
crossing the goal line in
finding a cure for cancer.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.600
The National Cancer
Institute has a lead

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.030
and a central role
in this effort.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.180
They actually have a program
called the Transitional Research

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.160
Program at NCI.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:50.230
And this program sponsors
grants in research excellence

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.470
that actually tries to
promote the collaboration

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.800
between clinicians
and basic scientists

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.550
to discover new approaches to
attack diseases such as cancer.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.210
So I think I've spoken enough,
or I've taken up too much

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.150
of the time already,
because I really want to hear

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.210
from our distinguished
panel of experts.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.630
They are going to share their
various perspectives with us.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.900
And we are joined
today by Dr. John Tsang

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.850
from the National Institutes
of Health, who is an expert

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.510
on human immunology
and systems biology.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.570
We also have Professor
Elizabeth Platz

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.300
from John Hopkins University,
the School of Public Health,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.080
who is a leading
cancer epidemiologist.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.660
We also are joined
by Dr. Susan Bates

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.210
from Columbia University Medical
School, who is a clinician

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.970
and a cancer epidemiologist.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:59.570
And we have two patient
advocates, Ms. Juanita Lyle

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.440
and John Bauer, who are also
cancer survivors themselves.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.540
So I'm going to turn the
program over to them.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.510
And, again, welcome.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:32.500
[ Applause ]

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.570
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen:
Welcome, everyone.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:39.880
This event was co-sponsored
with the Science, Technology

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.520
and Business Division.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.870
You can see this, we
organized [inaudible] lectures.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.520
And you can see videocasting,
this page.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.710
And also we had two previous
Cancer Moonshot videos

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.010
are there.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.700
And also we invited several
Nobel laureate to talk

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.470
about translational medicine.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.450
And that video is there as well.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.110
So I hope you enjoy it.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.680
Okay. I can't fix this.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.350
Okay. I'm Tomoko Steen at
the Science, Technology

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.170
and Business Division.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.370
It's my pleasure to
introduce our speakers.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.820
And the first speaker
is Dr. John Tsang.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.350
And he is at the National
Institute of Allergy

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.240
and Infectious Diseases.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.450
He leads a project,
and is also co-director

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.820
of the NIH Center
for Human Immunology.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:46.340
And Dr. Tsang has training
in computer engineering

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:54.460
and computer science, and also
a biophysics Ph.D. from Harvard.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.490
So he has received many prizes

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.650
from the National
Institute of Health.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:08.840
And one of the highlights of his
program is OMiCC, and he's going

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.050
to talk about that in his talk.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.090
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.390
Thank you.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.260
[ Applause ]

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.550
&gt;&gt; John Tsang: Good morning.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.850
Good morning.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.390
Thanks for having me here.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.930
It's an honor to speak.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.720
So, as Dr. Steen mentioned, I
work on the human immune system.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.910
So today I'm going to tell
you a bit of my perspective

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.860
and highlighting the
feel of immunotherapy.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.640
And so the title of my talk is

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.300
"Towards personalized
immunotherapies: Predicting

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.040
and understanding the immune
responsiveness of individuals."

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.620
So I don't think I
need to convince you

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.130
that the immune system
is very important.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.100
And it's been implicating
a large number of diseases.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.730
So, therefore, understanding

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.700
and knowing how it
works is very important.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.980
So, aside from infection
and autoimmunity,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.280
[inaudible] you may of heard of,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.720
the immune system has been
implicated in, for example,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.740
metabolic issues, for
example, obesity, diabetes,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.790
also neurological disorders.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.200
So you name any disease, you
can always find a connection

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.820
to the immune system.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.760
And, of course, cancer, being
such a devastating disease,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.900
it's a huge connection
to the immune system.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.200
So you may have heard that
most recently the Nobel Prize

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.550
in medicine was awarded
to two immunologists

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.920
for their discovery of cancer
therapies by inhibition

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.770
of negative immune regulation.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.990
Right? So today I'm going
to give you an overview

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.260
of the science behind this,
and also that sort of leads

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.580
into my perspective
on how we need

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.020
to move towards a more
personalized approach

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.500
to immunotherapy.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.540
So the immune system, broadly
speaking, it looks for,

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.460
basically, dangerous signs
and signals and attacks.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.890
So here's a video showing if you
induce damage at a tissue site,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.120
you can see immediately the
red, those are neutrophils,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.420
a type of immune cell, they
would immediately sense

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.700
that damage, and come
and swarm that site,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.550
and then try to repair
the damage.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.470
Right? So that's one example.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.770
And then the green ones,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.960
they are another immune cell
type called macrophages.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.190
So there they're interacting
with the neutrophils

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.990
in this case to perform
the repair.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.950
So, in general, there's a
type of cell called T cells.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.810
It's a type of immune cells

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.110
that they are the
soldiers, basically.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.610
You can think of the
soldiers of the immune system.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.360
They can remember and also
recognize harmful things

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.130
such as pathogens and tumors.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.190
So these T cells
would look for things

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.490
that are harmful in your body.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.790
They circulate around
and patrol.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.920
Right? And then they scan
for cells, and then they try

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.830
to distinguish between
normal and abnormal cells.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.130
So these abnormal
cells, typically,

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.430
sometimes they raise a flag,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.510
and they will just
display certain patterns

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.230
that the immune system
can sort of tell, "Oh,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.740
this is likely some cell
that's either infected,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.460
or it has some aberration
inside the cell."

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.590
And then once it's detected
that potentially harmful cell,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.910
the T cells would try to
destroy those cells, basically.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:37.020
Right? So here's a very basic
picture on how T cells work.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.310
On the left is what we
call a cytotoxic T cell.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.090
So these are the cells
that can kill these harmful

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.420
or dangerous cells.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.180
And on the right is a tumor cell

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.700
or a viral infected
cell, for example.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.360
So these are dangerous
to our body.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.270
So these cells, they can
present or they can show

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.540
up on their surface
something called an antigen.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.420
So that's, basically, a
signal for the immune system.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.650
The antigen is something that
the immune system can recognize

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.840
as "Oh, this is foreign,"
for example, to the body,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.360
or "This is something that
the body shouldn't have."

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.940
Therefore, the cytotoxic T
cells would recognize that,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.680
and then start to interact
with these cells, and,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.030
eventually, trying
to destroy it.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.670
So that's the very basics of
how cytotoxic T cells work.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.610
Right? So how does
the immune system find

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.910
and kill tumor cells?

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.700
Right? So the very first
step, it's the tumor cells,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.500
they have to display
these signs and antigens.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.620
Right? So that's
the very first step.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.820
Basically, this is going from
-- the tumor cells would die,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.720
for example, and then they would
release these kinds of antigens.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.820
So that would allow the
immune system to start to pick

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.430
up these signs, and start
presenting them to the T cells

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.730
that I was talking about.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.560
So now these T cells, they're,
like, in training, basically.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.810
So they can be trained now
to recognize these antigens

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.010
or signals from these
tumor cells.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.920
So once these cells are
trained, the step three,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.480
it's called priming
and activation.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.700
So what the the green guy,
right, this green guy is,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.050
basically, kind of
like a messenger.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.720
They pick up these signals
from these dead cells,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.910
and then they start to go
and talk to their colleagues,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.210
in this case, the T cells.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.980
Right? So the T cells
are the soldiers.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.540
So then these soldiers are now
trained by the green guy now.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.020
Right? So now they
become activated soldiers.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.500
They now know what to look for,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.670
because the green guys
convey the information

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.340
about these antigens
to these soldiers.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.370
So now these soldiers are
walking through, basically.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.520
In this case, going through the
bloodstream, searching for cells

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.270
that are displaying
those signals, basically.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.290
Right? So then they
enter the tumor.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.390
They have to cross multiple
bridges before they can get

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.690
into the tumor.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.990
You can see these bad guys.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.630
Those are the tumor
cells, the red guys.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.470
Right? So these soldiers
are now going in,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.350
and then they would
recognize them based

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.930
on the principles I
mentioned earlier.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.200
And then they can kill
these cells, basically.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.990
And this is a fairly specific
process, as you can imagine,

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.350
right, because these
cells are not just looking

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.340
for some random cells,
because they are instructed

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.640
by the step one, basically.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.290
When antigens are released from
these sort of tumor cells dying,

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.920
or they're not so happy, they
are releasing these things

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.780
into the environment,
get picked up, basically.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.310
So this is a very
fairly specific process.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.510
So this is precisely why
this holds a lot of promise,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.900
because the person's
immune system can adapt

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.320
to the tumor characteristics
that's fairly unique

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.620
to that individual.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.920
Right? So that's the key here.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.210
So when you think about cancer,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.770
it's really not a
single disease,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.300
even within an individual.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.080
So here's an example of
sort of a conceptual picture

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.010
of what really is in a tumor.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.000
So going from left
to right, it's time.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.910
So, initially, you may
have some clones of cells

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.570
that somehow something
went wrong inside of them,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.870
and they keep dividing.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.400
Right? So that's the
basis of a tumor.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.550
But as it goes through over
time, these things start

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.980
to mutate, meaning they are
changing their genetic material

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.280
and instructions.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.680
And then some of the changes
would allow them to proliferate

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.840
or rapidly divide even faster.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.080
Right? So now you have
different clones, as indicated

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.380
by the different
colors of cells.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.330
So over time, you have
lots of, basically,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.650
different tumors in your body.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.760
And so in the case of more
classical non-immune therapies,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.170
even very specific
targeted therapies,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.940
they may be targeting a
subset of these clones,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.090
but as the tumor evolves over
time, it's actually very hard

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.350
for these drugs to kill
all the different clones

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.900
within the tumor.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.000
So that's where the immune
system is really holding a lot

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.980
of promise, because
T and B cells,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.000
they have enormous
diversity, so they're the kind

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.700
of cells I just told you about.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.290
Right? They're not static.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.590
They're not fixed.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.300
They're learning all the
time about what's going on.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.600
And they have a lot
of diversity.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.840
So they're like a personal
targeted drug factory.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.760
So you don't need to
instruct it to what to do.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.340
If it sees some harmful things
in the body, it starts to react

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.430
to it, and then clone
themselves.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.860
In a way it's like your
anti-tumor clone army.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.460
Right? It's like cloning
itself making sure

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.500
that it has enough numbers
to destroy the tumors.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.820
And it's massive.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.750
And this is actually
very fascinating biology.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.310
If you look into a T cell, also
a B cell if it's another type

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.020
of immune cell, they're the
only cell that's in your body

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.100
where there's parts of the
DNA that can be rearranged.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.250
So they can rearrange
in a fairly random way

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.580
to generate lots of diversity.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.730
So they can, basically,
recognize almost anything,

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.320
be it in the pathogen
or in the tumor.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.870
Right? So that's what gives
them a lot of the ability

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.670
to recognize all sorts of
mutations in your tumors.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.810
So, well, is that it?

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.110
I mean, that's great.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.410
We have this system.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.710
Right? It could kill
these tumors.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:52.130
But there are actually
many inhibitory factors

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.670
that actually make it
impossible for the T cell

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.320
to kill the cancer cells also.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.160
And when you really
think about it,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.640
that's because the immune system
also needs to be regulated,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.940
right, because that's,
for example,

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.390
why we have autoimmunity.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.090
Right? So you cannot just let
these T cells to go out there

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.510
and just replicate indefinitely
once they see some antigens,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.340
and start to kill lots of
cells, because you still need

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.120
to pull it back also
at the same kind.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.420
So that's called resolution.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.830
So that's why the immune
system has evolved ways

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.070
to regulate these
cells at the same time.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.200
But those regulations,
of course,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.700
can be taken advantage
by tumors.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.000
So the tumors are not stupid.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.300
Right? They are pretty
smart as well.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.430
They also evolve.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.900
So that's exactly what Jim
Allison and Dr. Hangzhou

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.350
and others in the
field have discovered.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.060
It's a way to inhibit these
kinds of negative regulation

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.360
to then allow to, basically,

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.250
release the brake,
to allow the T cells.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.400
So in this particular
case, on the left here,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.920
you can see the T cells that
I mentioned in the blue,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.600
and then the other
one is the tumor cell.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.040
So the tumor cell in this
case has evolved a way

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.350
to display a signal
on their cell surface

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.290
to tell the T cell
to stop, basically.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:58.140
So the T cell would then go,
basically, idle once it sees

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.090
that signal, because that's
the negative regulatory signal.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:07.990
Right? So Jim and Dr. Hangzhou,
what they did is they figured

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.650
out ways to block those signals

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.660
so that the tumor can no
longer instruct the T cell

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.960
to stop, basically.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.470
So, therefore, the T cell
can now become more active

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.270
and kill these tumors.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.010
But despite that advance,
if you look at the response

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.190
to immunotherapy, so
here's what's called a

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.490
Kaplan-Meier plot.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.100
So on the x it's time over time.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.380
So you, basically, enroll
a group of patients,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.060
give them the therapy, and then

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.200
on the x it's the
percent of survival.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.110
So here there are two curves.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.110
On the red it's looking

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.990
at a [inaudible] immunotherapy
called anti-CTLA-4.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.830
So that's the approach that
Dr. Jim Allison discovered.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.210
So in this case you can
see that over time a lot

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.530
of the patients actually
don't respond, as you can see.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.370
And they approach a steady state

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.980
of about 25% survival,
basically.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.520
And that seems to be a
fairly constant number.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.990
So if you now look at
these trials, typically,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.450
about 25% of the
patients actually respond

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.750
to that therapy.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.080
The rest don't respond
to that therapy.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.870
Yes, by the way, these are
metastatic melanoma patients,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.200
a fairly aggressive
form of cancer.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.810
On the blue here, it's showing
you some recent advances

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.560
where they combined
multiple immunotherapies.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.300
And that has done really
well, as you can see here

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.120
in this particular
type of cancer.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.930
It gets to about a
60% response rate.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.730
Right? But still, a good
35-40% of the patients,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.220
they don't respond at
all to that therapy.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.540
So the question is why.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.780
Right? So what factors may
predict and, potentially,

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.920
determine whether a person will
respond to that therapy or not?

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.300
Right? So that's one
of the major questions.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.590
So there's some known
indicators of responsiveness.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.770
For example, whether there's any
T cells at all in these tumors.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.770
Right? So that's a major factor.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.380
There are tumors that
there are no T cells.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.160
Basically, it's like a desert.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.640
And then we're still figuring --

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.940
I mean, the few are
still figuring

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.710
out why that's the case.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.190
And also there may be T cells
that they may be blocked

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.610
from entering into the
relevant sites in the tumor.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.570
So there are images showing,
for example, T cells, basically,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.930
they're fairly active,
but they're all

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.230
in the periphery of the tumor.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.690
They just couldn't get in.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.520
The other factor is whether
the tumor is hot or cold.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.000
I mean, there may be T cells,
and there may be the tumor,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.350
they may be interacting,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.670
but there may not
be enough signals

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.970
[inaudible] inflammation.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.300
So, basically, the immune system
relies on inflammatory signals

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.810
for it to act, basically.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.150
So there may not be enough
signal to tell the T cells to,

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.210
"Ha, activate yourself
and kill these tumors."

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.610
Right? So these are all
found in different patients.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.610
So one patient may
not have the T cells.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.440
Another may have the T cells,
but the T cells may not be able

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.130
to enter the tumor, or they may
all be interacting, mixing up,

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.320
but there's not enough
external signals

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.470
to instruct the T
cells to go in.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.700
And the other factor
is also, of course,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.750
going back to the picture
I showed you earlier,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.150
are these tumors hiding the
fact that they're tumors,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.800
or are they actually
presenting these antigens,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.550
or are they making antigens for
the immune system to be trained.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.960
Right? So that's
another key factor.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.640
But there's much
remaining to be discovered.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.710
There's many different types
of tumors, as you can imagine.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.060
I just showed you an
example on melanoma.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.660
And there's many
different types of patients,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.140
and many different
activation thresholds.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.290
The immune system, at the end
of the day, is very complex.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.850
Right? So you may want to
now go to your doc and ask,

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.150
"How's my immune system?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.290
Is it good enough to fight
off a tumor, for example?"

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:41.990
Right? Unfortunately, right now
we actually don't have a lot

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.640
of ways to tell patients how
well our immune system is doing.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.130
I mean, typically, you can get
what's called a complete blood

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.660
count so you can get
the frequency and level

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.960
of different immune
cells circulating

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.460
in your body, for example.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.250
That's quite informative,
like, for example,

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.110
to tell whether you have
an infection or not.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.090
But it's far from
sufficient to give you a sense

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.990
of how well the immune
system is working,

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.140
or how responsive the
immune system would be

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.410
if it encounters some
danger or harmful signal.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.710
Right?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.730
So that sort of leads to
my perspective on the need

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.830
to measure the immune
and then tumor status

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.650
in the human population.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.860
So the immune system is
quite unique in the sense

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.150
that it's a system in
your body that is far

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.530
from completely dictated or
specified by genetics alone.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.740
So early when one is a baby,

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.710
a lot of that may be
specified by genetics.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.160
But actually over time, because
of the environment and exposure,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.510
there's accumulating evidence
suggesting that the state

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:43.650
of the immune system is
far from just explaining

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:44.950
that by genetics alone.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.550
So you need to know a lot
more about the immune system

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.670
than just knowing
somebody's genome, basically.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.250
So, fortunately these days,

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.960
there's rapid advances
in technology.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.380
So, for example, you can
now go into immune cells,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.850
and look at the activity
of the genes.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.130
You can now do what's called
sequencing, which is also used

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.430
to look at the human genome.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.380
But you can now use to look
at the immune cell diversity,

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.300
like different T
cells and B cells.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.100
And you can also, of course,
look at genetic changes

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.770
in tumors at the same time
within that individual.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.710
There are a lot of
fancy machines

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.920
that can now really look at the
properties of the immune cells

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.990
in a fairly high
throughput manner.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.140
Right? So now from a drop
of blood from a patient,

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.080
you can actually generate tens
and thousands of data points,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.800
potentially informative
of our immune system.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.520
So this now then becomes more
of a data science problem.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.350
Right? So you have lots of
data points per individual,

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.560
and you have lots of different
individuals with different types

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.760
of tumors, and different health
and statuses, for example.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.860
So this is where the machine
learning aspect would come

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.170
in to help us to find
markers of responsiveness.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.290
Right? So you start
off, as I mentioned,

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.280
you have the immune
measurements of an individual

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.900
in a large population, so
these various characteristics,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.840
including the ones
I mentioned already.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.300
And now the question you want
to ask is actually what feature

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.760
out of your tens and thousands

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.300
of data points may help
you predict whether

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.250
that particular individual,
right, will respond well or not,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.920
or how they will respond,

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.840
or how the individual
actually will respond

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.290
to a particular type
of immune therapy.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.280
So there are rapid advances in
[inaudible] of machine learning

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.580
and computer science,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.920
where these techniques are
now fairly applicable due

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.610
to this kind of problem.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.890
And so one example, which is
coming from work in my lab

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.010
in the Center for Human
Immunology at the NIH,

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.250
where we're asking
a similar question,

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.570
but in the context of vaccines.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.560
And it turns out that when
somebody gets vaccinated to,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.350
for example, the seasonal flu,

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.360
our responses can
be very different.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.990
So some individuals may
not respond at all in terms

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.090
of antibodies, which are
the mediators of protection.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.710
Some individuals may not
have a gigantic response.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:59.350
But what makes one person
respond much better compared

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.650
to another?

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.270
Right? So we did a study where
we kind of took the approach,

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.700
I told you, we generated lots of
data points for each individual,

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.130
and then asked the question
whether we can find some sort

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.960
of set point or baseline,

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.760
meaning before the individual
even got the vaccine,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.130
then we used their
immune statuses

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.830
to predict how well they
respond to the vaccine.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.160
Right? So on the right here is a
cartoon showing you may have hot

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.400
individuals, they respond well.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.680
While the colder ones, they
may not respond as much.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.320
Right? So what we found is
what we call a signature

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.840
or a predictive signal in these
individuals that we were able

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.620
to replicate, in this case,
across different populations

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.410
of people who got the
vaccine, so in this case.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.000
So I'm just showing you sort
of a summary of the result

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.150
without going into the
details, on why it's sort

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.980
of like the immune
responsiveness score.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.860
Right? So that's what you
want to compute in a way

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.160
for your patients,
also cancer patients,

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.150
when you give a [inaudible]
immunotherapy,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.890
you want to find a
way to combine data

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.740
from multiple modalities,
be it cells or genes

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.530
or gene activities,
derive such a score,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.700
and that score should
allow you to delineate.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.000
So in this particular example,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.350
I'm showing you the
low responders

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.490
versus the high responders
to a vaccine.

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:11.870
But you can imagine a good
versus a bad responder

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.720
to immunotherapy as well, right,

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.050
such that you can now see
this had to work, be applied

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.300
and applicable across
different populations.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.350
So in this case across different
seasons of vaccination.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.600
And this is I'm showing
you also on the right,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.200
it's even extendable to look
at different types of vaccines.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.420
So in this case, yellow fever
is another type of vaccine.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.580
Right? So this is sort of
an example showing sort

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.120
of the applicability and
potential extensibility

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.820
of such signatures to be
applied to the broad population,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.540
but also to different
types of interventions.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.280
So moving forward,
my perspective is

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.300
that we require two kinds
of science to build the kind

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.220
of framework and to
push things forward.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.690
One is citizen, and the other
one is team science, basically.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.680
So as you can imagine
to generate the kind

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.330
of data I mentioned
that requires a lot

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.640
of patient participation, right,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.230
to help with the data
generation, we need to look

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.560
at different tumors,
we need to look

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.040
at different personal
characteristics, we need to look

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.260
at different immunotherapies,
and we need to look

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.660
at the very diverse
immune system statuses

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.050
that I mentioned.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.500
The other is team science.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.940
It's becoming complex,
these problems.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.210
So it's not simply collecting
data from five patients,

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.070
and look at them in
the lab for six months,

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.450
and then publish a paper.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.990
But rather that we need
to collect these data,

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.290
and you need a lot

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.680
of collaboration
among the clinicians

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.180
and computational
biologists, immunologists,

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.670
software engineers to build
a software infrastructure,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.440
and also a lot of technology
that's needed to advance

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.740
to make these the sort

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.040
of measurement technologies
I mentioned.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.400
Right? They are working well
in the lab, but to push those

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.020
into the clinic, and
make them relevant,

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.160
and make them cost-effective,
there's still some way to go.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.690
So with that I just want to wrap
up, give you sort of a vignette.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.760
It's a mix of citizen
and team science.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.000
So the traditional way that
scientists do their science is,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.630
typically, we generate a
hypothesis, we may say that,

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.230
"Well, I hypothesized
that neutral fields

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.600
of a particular type of
immune cell may be able

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.270
to kill a particular
type of tumor."

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.780
So that's a hypothesis
I just made.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.080
It may not be true.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.470
So, well, then what I do is I
go out and I think about it,

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.230
and then I design an experiment,

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.780
and see if I can start slowly
making progress to either prove

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.780
or disprove the hypothesis
I just made.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.270
Right? And then you generate
data to test the hypothesis.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.570
This goes in cycles.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.360
So that's how science
is, typically, done.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.930
So what I would like to propose
is a slightly revised paradigm,

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.120
given the kind of data that we
have already made available now

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.480
in the public domain actually.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.920
So NIH sponsors a lot

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.730
of large-scale data
generation projects that some

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.060
of these data you can
download them actually.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:53.820
So instead of jumping right
in to design a new experiment,

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.890
you could think about
generate your hypothesis,

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.610
and utilize these existing data
as much as possible, right,

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.670
to explore and then refine your
hypothesis before you go again,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.240
and go back to the
traditional paradigm

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.610
with designing your experiment,
then go back and do this again.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.580
But to enable this,
you need tools.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:18.670
So that's where this sort of
evolved out of our project

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.320
in the lab, because we have a
mix of computational biologists

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.160
in the lab, but also bench
experimental biologists.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.130
The bench folks, they
are always envied

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.830
of the computational
folks who can just kind

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.210
of wrangle the data off the web,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:34.290
and start generating
some new hypotheses.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.560
So they started asking
me, "Can we do better?

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.560
Can we have some tools that
allow us to do this faster?"

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.530
So we ended up having
something internal development,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.760
and then eventually we
decided this is useful

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.740
for the general public and
for the scientific community,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.040
so we released it.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.060
So this provides readily usable,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.980
in this case, gene
expression data.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.200
It's a type of genetic data
that's fairly widely available.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.500
And there's lots of them.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.690
So you can look at the activity
of genes, and different cells

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.490
and different tissues
and different people.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.980
And you don't have to do
any programming or wrangle

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.280
with the data in this case.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.580
It's all done for you already.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.640
So what you can do is, by
point-and-click, you can say,

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.720
"I want to compare, let's
say, melanoma patients,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.520
the blood gene expression
profile of those patients,

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.820
versus healthy people.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.950
I also want to look at
lung cancer patients.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.030
I want to look at
breast cancer patients.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.260
And now I also want to combine
them all together, and ask,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.760
'Are there any common things
that I can find across all

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.250
of those different datasets?'"

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.490
So that you can all do
within this platform.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.000
And the other thing
that it allows you

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.780
to do is what I call
citizen science.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:43.600
It allows you to share all the
metadata and the annotations.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.090
All of those are done in
what I call a structured way,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.740
meaning they're not just
free text, they're structured

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.070
in a way that's reusable.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.410
Right? So now others can come in
and look at what you have built

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.170
in terms of, let's say,
the one I just mentioned

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.470
about tumor comparison.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.770
So now you want to say, "Well,

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.160
I want to compare these
tumor data to infection."

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.460
That you can do.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.760
I mean, if that's your question.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.170
You can now get grab
some infection data,

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.750
and now combine them with the
tumor data that's already built

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.440
by another person, and put
them together, and ask,

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.740
"What are the differences,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.370
what are the similarities,"
basically.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.220
So that's the idea.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.070
So we actually experimented
with this idea

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.720
to see whether it could
work with a group of people

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.960
with no prior training in
computational biology at all.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.060
So we, basically, just sent
out an email to a mailing list

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:32.590
at the NIH, and told them that
there's an opportunity for you

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.110
to learn how to deal with a lot

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.320
of the large-scale
public datasets.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.450
In return, can you
come here for a day?

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.130
You can learn about the tool,
but at the same time we're going

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.690
to give you a topic of research,

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.810
and we'll see what you can
do in a day, basically.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.580
So we call this the
OMiCC Jamboree.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.880
So they came.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.490
And most of them
stayed for eight hours,

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.840
because we gave free
lunch and lots of donuts.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.660
So about 29 of them came from
13 different institutions.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.720
Right? So we divided them into
ten groups, asking them to look

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.020
at human autoimmunity.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.320
Right?

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.190
So we happened to look at five
different autoimmune diseases,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.480
in this case, in both human
and also mouse models.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.790
Right? So in a day
they collected

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.760
over a hundred [inaudible]
versus healthy comparisons.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.290
And you can ignore some of
the details in the table.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.480
They gathered more
than a thousand,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.820
basically, samples and datasets.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.020
And then when we sort of
quality control them later,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.200
look at them, about 75% of
them were really well formed.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.380
So in a way you gather 29
people for eight hours,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.470
so that's like about 230
FTE hours in the day.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.770
They got a lot out of it.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.070
They felt like they
learned quite a bit.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.950
At the same time we actually
got something out of it, too,

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.560
because from the research we
almost answered a question

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.080
that generated quite a bit of
hypotheses about these diseases,

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.440
especially what were common

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.840
across the five model
diseases we looked at.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.170
Right? So you're welcome
to look at a website.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.470
We have a website
for this as well.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.230
And you can sort of look at the
details if you're interested.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.800
So I borrowed lots
of images on the web

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.100
to make this presentation.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.030
So these are some
additional image credits

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.350
for the pictures I've shown you.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.540
And then with that, I would like
to thank you for your attention

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.030
and the folks in my lab.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.830
Thank you.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.730
[ Applause ]

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.080
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: We
take the questions

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.950
at the end of the speech.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:19.370
Sorry. Thank you.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:24.870
The next speaker is my dear
friend, Dr. Elizabeth Platz.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.870
She's a professor at Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.850
of Public Health.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:34.760
And she has a joint appointment
with the Department of Oncology

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.580
and also Urology at Johns
Hopkins Medical School.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:44.890
And she received her doctorate
in epidemiology from Harvard.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:48.970
And also has done a postdoctoral
research at Harvard as well.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.600
That's where I met her.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.090
And she has been
working on molecular

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.440
and genetic epidemiology.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:03.460
And she's focused in
translational findings

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:08.130
to practicing and
preventing cancer,

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.510
especially her area
is prostate cancer.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:18.060
[ Applause ]

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.360
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz: All right.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.180
Let me see if I can
get the next slide up.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.480
That's all right.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.780
[inaudible] do it.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.310
Okay. So thanks so much
for having me here today,

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.510
Tomoko and your colleagues here
at the Library of Congress.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.060
So I am a translational
researcher.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.740
I'm a population scientist and
epidemiologist by training.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.310
And I spend a lot of my time
collaborating with investigators

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.570
from other disciplines,
whether it's on prostate cancer

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.900
or other types of cancer.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.790
So I should indicate
I have no disclosures.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.010
So today I'm going to talk a
little bit about what we've done

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.930
to discover cancer
risk, protective

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.960
and prognostic factors.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.160
So these are all
translational opportunities.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.320
So all that we do is
multidisciplinary.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.200
We collaborate, we
come together.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.490
The areas I'm going to cover
today are opportunities

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.940
for cancer prevention, so drugs
used for other indications,

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.090
and whether or not they're
related to prostate cancer risk.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.320
So I'll cover a few common drugs
for cardiovascular indications.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.620
I'll also talk a little bit

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.710
about periodontal
disease and cancer risk.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.810
And then, finally, I'll
talk about opportunities

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.430
for improving prostate
cancer prognostication

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.600
by using a biomarker
telomere length

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.950
and variability in
telomere length.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.410
So here are the disciplines
that we tend to collaborate

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.820
with for our prostate
cancer research.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.180
You can see there are
clinical disciplines,

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.210
there are basic science
disciplines,

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.330
there are very focused
disciplines like pharmacology,

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.250
and then my discipline,
epidemiology,

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.550
as well as biostatistics.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.090
And we all come together to try

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.230
to solve the problem
of prostate cancer.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.910
You saw an iterative
process like this

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.640
on one of John's slides.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.560
So in our field we do
exactly what he said.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.800
We test our hypotheses.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.450
Our basic scientists are really
great at developing, testing

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.660
and discovering fundamental
pathways that are integral

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.570
to the development and
progression of cancer.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.450
But the question that they often
pose is what's the relevance

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.580
of what they found
for human disease.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.880
So they'll come to
me and they'll say,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.910
"Can you study this
discovery within people,

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.580
within populations, populations
of people at risk for cancer,

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.110
populations of individuals
with cancer?"

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.390
So we then test these
hypotheses.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.570
And then sometimes we
have interesting findings

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.660
that may be different from
what was hypothesized.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.470
So the iterative process is then
to go back into the laboratory

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.080
to try to discover
mechanisms underlying,

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.380
and then come forward again.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.210
And then eventually, when we
have what we think is an answer,

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.320
and when we can confirm it,
not just through basic science

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.740
and one epidemiologic study,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.450
but maybe several epidemiologic
studies, we may feel confident

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.330
that we have an association
that may be causal

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:19.140
and could be acted on.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.400
So here's the first example
that I want to share with you.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.470
So this was a collaboration
across all those disciplines

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.890
that I showed you
including pharmacology.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.600
What we wanted to do
was something called

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.900
drug repositioning.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.150
We want to be able to identify
drugs for other indications

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:36.720
that may be helpful
for the prevention

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.840
or treatment of prostate cancer.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.360
So I have a couple of my
colleagues shown here,

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.600
Bill Nelson, who's our
Cancer Center director,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.870
and Vasan Yegnasubramaniun,

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:50.180
who's a cancer biologist
at the Cancer Center.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.590
So, again, the goal was to
identify drugs that are used

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.290
for other indications that may
be helpful in the prevention

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.520
or treatment of prostate cancer.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.000
And this approach is
called drug repositioning.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.210
So what we did was we used
a multistage strategy.

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:11.940
So we started in the laboratory
performing a drug screen.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:16.530
So our institution has a library
that has over 3,000 compounds

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.930
in it, almost 2,000
are FDA-approved drugs.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:23.180
So in the first screen they
used two different cell lines,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.060
prostate cancer cell lines,
and they looked for those drugs

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.460
that seem to be cytotoxic.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.940
That is, they reduce the
proliferation of those cells,

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.020
reduce the multiplication
of those cells.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.100
And based on that
screen, those that showed

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.620
at least a 50% inhibition
of proliferation,

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.760
they moved on to the
secondary screen,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.350
which included many more
prostate cancer cell lines,

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:48.430
both androgen-independent
and dependent cell lines.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.930
And then based on the top
hits, we then identified those

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.130
that we thought had the
greatest cytotoxic potency.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.360
That is, the lowest
concentration,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.820
the greatest inhibition,
and also were drugs

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:02.180
that were commonly used in the
U.S. so that we'd have a chance

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.180
to be able to study
them in the context

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.580
of a prospective cohort study.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.160
And that was stage two.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.360
So when we scanned through all
the drugs, we noticed that many

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.020
that came up were
antineoplastic.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.850
So that is, they're already
used for chemotherapy.

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:18.310
So those are not the drugs we
wanted to be able to study.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.380
So then we looked for
those that were not known

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.740
to be chemotherapeutic agents.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.430
And actually the
top one that popped

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.190
up was disulfiram, Antabuse.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.490
We weren't able to
study that one

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.360
within our prospective
cohort study.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.260
But the second one that
popped up was digoxin.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.710
Digoxin is an old drug.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.030
It's used to treat
congestive heart failure

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.990
and also certain arrhythmias.

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.290
Again, it's an old drug.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.410
It's not used very
much these days.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.560
It is a sodium potassium
ATPase inhibitor.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.740
What we noticed was there
was a second drug that popped

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.850
up that acted on
the same pathway.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:52.370
And then among those that were
not FDA-approved there was

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.640
another that ranked fairly high.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.840
And so we thought, "We can
study digoxin within one

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.190
of our prospective
cohort studies."

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.130
It was a common enough drug
used in older adults, again,

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.820
for the two indications
that I mentioned.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.860
We were excited by that.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.250
But then, as we looked through
the list of the top hits,

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.830
we also noticed that
there was another class

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.440
of drugs that popped up.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.740
And these are the statin drugs.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.320
So these are
cholesterol-lowering drugs,

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.850
very commonly prescribed in
the U.S. And this made us think

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.190
that our approach might
have some reasonableness,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.090
because we had previously
studied statin drugs based

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.550
on their actions for fatal
and advanced prostate cancer,

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.690
and found that men
who took these drugs,

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:43.330
especially for a longer
term had a much lower risk

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.740
of developing advanced, meaning
metastatic prostate cancer,

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.810
or dying of their
prostate cancer.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.390
I mean, a substantially
lower risk.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.600
And this was taking into
account other known risk factors

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.280
for prostate cancer, as
well as other cardiovascular

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.950
and other commonly
used medications.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.780
So we thought this
approach had some legitimacy

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.000
from a scientific perspective.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.810
So then we looked at
our top hits, so, again,

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:10.060
digoxin and related drugs.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.820
We found that men who tended
to use these drugs had

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.840
about a 25% lower risk of
developing prostate cancer.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.760
And this was true including
for more aggressive disease.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.310
And then if we looked
at the duration of use,

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.960
men who used the drug longer
tended to have a lower risk

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.130
of prostate cancer, whether
that disease was organ-confined,

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.820
localized to the prostate,

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.230
or the disease was
advanced or lethal.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:38.990
So metastatic or caused death.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.030
So we thought this was a
very exciting approach.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.330
It was two-staged.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.470
It was clearly
multidisciplinary.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.780
We think this approach
actually helps reduce false

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.080
positive hits.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.650
So if we had just taken the
drug screen and left it at that

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.690
and picked a few, we wouldn't
have known whether or not

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.000
that was just a false positive.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.160
They had more than 3,000
drugs in that screen.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.020
But by doing this two-staged
we reduced the likelihood

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.320
of false positive hits.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.330
So we thought that
was super exciting.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:08.270
This was the cover
of the article.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.570
And this is to remind me

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.220
that the drug is derived
from the foxglove.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.350
So it's a beautiful plant
that grows out in the west.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.270
Okay? So we think this is
a super exciting approach.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.570
And then just to tell you,

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:23.070
statin drugs continue
to hold up.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.300
So as our colleagues have
looked, as we've looked

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.520
in our other cohort
studies, we continue to find

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.240
that statin drugs tend to be
associated with a lower risk,

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.690
especially of fatal
prostate cancer.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.690
So in that cohort that
I showed you before,

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.840
that was the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.320
We also continue to see
it in the ARIC Cohort,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.000
which is a cardiovascular
cohort, the Atherosclerosis Risk

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.590
in Communities Cohort study.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:49.990
And I show the first
author's photo here.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.810
You can see that she's
a young investigator.

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:53.110
And so we're very proud of her.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.750
This paper just came
out this week.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.050
And here are the results.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.810
So she sees an inverse
association

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:02.920
for fatal prostate cancer
for both users of fewer

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.660
than ten years, as well as
users for more than ten years.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.290
And then for total
prostate cancer,

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:09.160
and this has not
been seen before,

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.090
because most cohorts don't
have this much follow-up time

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:15.910
to be able to look at very long
use, those who used the drug

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:20.150
for more than ten years also
had an inverse at a lower risk

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.040
of total prostate cancer.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.410
And, again, this is taking into
account the number of factors

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.180
that are correlated with
both statin drug use

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.110
and prostate cancer.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.630
So another drug, it's a very
commonly used drug, aspirin,

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.430
for cardio protective reasons,
as well as for pain reduction

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.660
and reduction in
inflammation as well.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.560
So it's been well recognized
for a couple of decades

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.510
that aspirin use
seems to be associated

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.990
with a slightly reduced risk
of developing prostate cancer.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:53.560
But there's not much work
on whether it's associated

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.640
with a lower risk of
fatal prostate cancer, or,

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.280
in men with prostate cancer,
whether it's associated

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.930
with a lower risk of dying
of their prostate cancer.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.530
So this is work done by
another young investigator,

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.840
Lauren Hurwitz, who's now
a cancer prevention fellow

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.840
at the National Cancer
Institute.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.560
And what she found
was that, indeed,

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.110
men who are regular aspirin
users have a lower risk

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.340
of developing prostate cancer
that ends up killing them.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.050
And this was true both in white
and black men in this cohort.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.890
We took into account, again, the
number of factors are associated

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.290
with risk of developing
prostate cancer,

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.400
as well as use of aspirin.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.670
And you might ask, "Well,
what about aspirin use?

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:34.990
It's still associated

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.000
with a reduced risk
among statin drug users."

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.670
As I've just told you, the
statin drugs are protective.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:45.660
So, indeed, in fact, even among
those who didn't take a statin,

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.540
there's still an aspirin effect.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.640
Now, interestingly enough,
NSAIDs that are not aspirin,

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.150
so other non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.680
such as ibuprofen,
were not associated

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.770
with risk of fatal disease.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:00.660
Okay? And then among men
who have prostate cancer,

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.350
if they took aspirin, they
also had a lower risk of dying

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.220
of their prostate cancer.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.720
So we think these are
exciting findings.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.290
Aspirin is not indicated

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.350
for cancer prevention
except in one situation.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.410
And that's actually
colorectal cancer

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:19.520
in middle-aged individuals

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.420
who have a slightly
higher cardiovascular

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.670
or higher cardiovascular risk

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.690
for whom aspirin has
already indicated.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.310
And the reason why aspirin use
at this time is not indicated

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:33.050
for cancer in general is because
of the side effects of aspirin.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:38.910
So GI bleeds, for
example, and also stroke.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.460
Okay? So now on to
periodontal disease.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.220
So why study periodontal
disease?

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.360
Well, it's clearly an
inflammatory disease.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.930
There's an immune
component to it.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.370
And so we wanted to know,
this is a collaboration

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:55.110
with a colleague up at
Tufts, she's an expert

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.110
in periodontal disease
and cancer,

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.680
as well as with dentists.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.920
So this was a new
collaboration for me.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.880
So I'm used to collaborating
with basic scientists

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.180
and urologists and
oncologists, and now we've moved

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.310
to collaborating with dentists.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:12.190
And so we were fortunate,
because one of the cohorts

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:16.620
that we work in, they conducted
a dental examination on all

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:21.400
of their participants at one
of their visits, visit four.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.600
So most cohort studies
do not have dental exams

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.240
as an integral component
of the work.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.960
So we were super excited
to be able to collaborate

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.450
with the dentists who
had performed this work.

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:37.110
And so what did we find?

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:41.860
We found that individuals
who had periodontal disease,

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.110
especially severe periodontal
disease, and edentulism,

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:49.060
meaning not having any
teeth, which is often caused

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.450
by severe periodontal disease,
had a higher risk of cancer,

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.350
very modest, but there
was a dose-response.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:58.420
And then, in particular,
there were clear patterns

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:02.220
for colorectal cancer
and lung cancer.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.170
This was taking into account
the number of factors related

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.610
to periodontal disease
and to cancer,

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.360
including colorectal
and lung cancers.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.760
So we were excited about
these findings until you stop

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.380
and think, "What is a major risk
factor for periodontal disease?"

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.680
It's smoking.

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.220
Smoking is also a major
risk factor for cancer.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.580
So what we did is we didn't
just adjust for smoking,

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.320
we looked in the never-smokers,
not the non-smokers,

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.800
but the never-smokers.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.040
And, sure enough, the patterns
were still there, not as strong,

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.040
right, not as clean, but the
patterns were still there.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.490
So we were very excited
about these findings.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:38.840
And at the end, I'll
tell you a little bit

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.760
about what our next steps are.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.270
And so the last story
I want to tell you

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:48.440
about is developing a biomarker
for prostate cancer prognosis.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.790
So prostate cancer is
a very common cancer.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:53.420
It's the number one
cancer in U.S. men.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.330
It's the number two cause
of cancer death in U.S. men.

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:02.770
At this time, we have few
tools to help us distinguish

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.620
which men have disease that's
so aggressive that it needs

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.540
to be treated, and which men can
have either a less-aggressive

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.870
treatment plan, or
just be watched.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:20.170
Okay? So, typically, what's
done is on biopsy the patient,

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:24.300
along with his providers,
will determine whether

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.940
or not the morphology
of the tissue is

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:30.310
such that the man is
likely to have a higher risk

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:31.820
of progression or not.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.120
And it's a value judgment

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.540
for that man whether he
wants to undergo treatment.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.320
Now, if it's a super aggressive
disease, it's metastasized,

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.620
that's a different issue.

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:43.040
But if it's early, so
it's working confined,

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.470
and the disease doesn't
look particularly aggressive

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.640
under the microscope,
there's complexities.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.190
The man has to decide with
his provider what to do

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.580
about treatment or
non-treatment.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.800
It would be much
better if we had a tool

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.680
that could complement,
it could help men

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.250
with their decision-making,
and help providers be able

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:04.700
to give the best option for
management of that patient.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.430
And so years ago
we had a thought.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:11.440
And this came out of a
discovery in my colleagues' lab,

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.790
Angelo De Marzo and Alan Meeker,
Alan is up here, here's Angelo,

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:22.650
where they identified that
throughout the natural history

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.810
of prostate cancer there
was increased shortening

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:27.110
of telomere length.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:31.460
Okay? So the pre-cancer cells
even have shorter telomeres

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.160
than the normal cells.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.310
And so they asked the
question, "Could information

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:37.610
about telomere length," --

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:38.910
and telomeres are the
ends of the chromosomes,

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:43.220
and when they shorten that can
lead to chromosomal instability.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.860
And so they asked the
question, "Could information

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.640
about how short the
telomeres are

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.300
in individual cancer cells
tell us about prognosis?"

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:57.130
And so we came together
to do a cohort study.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:00.920
So this is a population
science design using real people

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.870
who have cancer who are
participating in a cohort study,

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.030
the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study.

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:09.110
We came together to be
able to make measurements,

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.620
and then relate these
measurements to risk

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.820
of progression to lethal
disease, to metastasis

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.330
and death from prostate cancer.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.070
This took a big collaboration.

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:21.370
So it wasn't just our team.

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.670
We collaborated with Harvard,

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:25.690
where the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study is located.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.940
My colleagues, Alan
Meeker and Angelo De Marzo,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.620
had developed a technique.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.910
This technique allowed us
to look at individual cells,

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:37.870
so not looking across the tissue
as a whole, but to be able

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:41.370
to look at individual cancer
cells, individual cells

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:43.180
that are non-cancer cells.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.850
And when I say individual cells,

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.530
I mean not just the
individual cell,

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.530
but of specific cell types.

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.620
Which then allowed us
to explore in detail

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.020
which cells are the ones

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.620
that were providing
information about prognosis.

00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:57.420
And what we found was it
wasn't telomere length

00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.860
in the cancer cells
that mattered.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.880
It was the variability in
telomere length from cancer cell

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.170
to cancer cell that provided
information about prognosis,

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.660
along with how short
the telomeres were

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:15.290
in the stromal cells
adjacent to the tumor cells.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.070
And so the stromal cells
were primarily fibroblasts

00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:20.060
and smooth muscle cells.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.760
And so what we were able
to do was evaluate about 30

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:28.110
to 50 cells per type,
using a fish approach.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:31.290
And so these are
beautiful fluorescent scans.

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:34.630
And you can see the pink
dots are the telomeres

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:35.950
and the normal tissue.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:37.250
And then you can see

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.730
in the tumor the pink
dots are very faint,

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:41.310
in some cases you
don't see them at all.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:44.130
So that indicates the
telomeres are very short.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:46.260
So here are the original
findings that we had

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.300
that were published
a few years ago.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.270
And so I'm going to
draw your attention

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:53.690
to prostate cancer death.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.630
So, again, these are all men
who have prostate cancer.

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:01.860
And what we found was, compared
to men who had less variability

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.640
in telomere length
among their cancer cells

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.660
and had longer telomeres
in their stroma,

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.140
that's the reference group,

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.220
those men who had shorter
telomeres in their stroma

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.980
and greater cell excelled
variability in telomere length

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:19.900
in their cancer cells, had the
highest risk of progressing

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.200
to prostate cancer death.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.500
And this is after taking

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.360
into account the known
prognostic indicators.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.890
Men who had the other two
combinations had intermediate

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:31.970
risks of progression.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.830
We found the same pattern for
lethal prostate cancer, but,

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.470
interestingly, not for
biochemical recurrence.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.910
A biochemical recurrence
is when the prostate cells

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:44.280
that have escaped from the
prostate before surgery,

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.610
I should say all these
men had a prostatectomy,

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.730
those cells that escaped in
some men later they start

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.950
to produce PSA, prostate
specific antigen.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:56.070
And while there may not
be evidence of metastases,

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.750
this is an early
indication that it's possible

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.660
that this man might
eventually develop metastases.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.550
But in most cases they don't.

01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:05.420
And so what we want to
be able to do is figure

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.910
out which men are most
likely to actually progress

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.880
to metastases and death.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.890
So we've now repeated
this work in a number

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:13.300
of additional studies.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.110
And we've put all
the data together

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.140
in a form called
a meta-analysis.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.280
And you can see that the
pattern remains the same

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.550
for prostate cancer
deaths and for metastases.

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.210
And for recurrence, we
don't see the same pattern.

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.930
What's popping out
is information

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:33.520
about the variability
in the cancer cell,

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.250
but not the stromal cells.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.880
So we're super excited about all
the studies that I've shown you.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.760
These are great examples of
collaboration across disciplines

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.210
to discover cancer
risk, protective

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:47.140
and prognostic factors.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.120
And perhaps the most important
part of what I'm going

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.870
to tell you is what the
translational opportunities are,

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.790
what are the next steps that
our teams together are taking

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:59.110
to take the results that I just
showed you to the next step,

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:02.390
so that we can actually
get these risk

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:04.900
and protective factors
and prognostic factors

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.090
to the population for
prevention, or to patients

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:10.500
to help with better
decision-making.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.330
So with respect to statin
drugs and periodontal disease,

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:19.260
our next steps are additional
basic science research.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.830
So we have currently
funded projects to go back

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:23.930
into the laboratory
with respect to statins.

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.910
It's to understand how statin
drugs influence a cell that's

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.530
related to what John talked
about, T regulatory cells.

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:36.100
T regulatory cells hold back
that autoimmune response.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.930
So they're immunosuppressive.

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.180
And we have evidence
from our colleague,

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.930
who's an immunologist, that
statin drugs may, in fact,

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.160
reduce the immunosuppression
by those T regulatory cells.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.590
So we're going to test with
him directly that hypothesis.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.060
And then for periodontal
disease, with our colleague,

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.970
Dominique Michaud up at
Tufts, we received funding

01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:00.710
from the American
Association for Cancer Research

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.610
to more directly test
whether periodontal pathogens

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.820
and the immune response
are related

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.740
to lung cancer in particular.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:12.310
And then the next one for
translational opportunities,

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.550
I didn't show you
research we've done to look

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:19.250
at how common risk factors for
cancer development may relate

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:23.220
to cancer outcomes in
people who have the disease.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.760
And, in particular, we've had
an interest in obesity in men

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.060
with prostate cancer, and how

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.330
that may relate to
their prognosis.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.580
And so what we've found
over several studies is

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.040
that obese men, and
especially men who gain weight

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.080
from before their
diagnosis to after,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.260
have a much higher
risk of progression.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.240
And so my colleague
just received funding

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.630
to conduct an intervention
study to take men

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:49.140
who have prostate cancer,
who have early recurrence,

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.220
that's biochemical
recurrence, and then she's going

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.240
to randomize them to a lifestyle
intervention for weight loss

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.130
versus standard of care, and see

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:01.350
if that affects their
outcomes with prostate cancer.

01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:04.020
So that's developing and
testing strategies to intervene

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.160
to reduce the burden of cancer.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.970
Another example is the
telomere biomarkers.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.270
So what are we doing next?

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.570
We've developed the biomarker.

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:14.910
We've actually optimized
it for use.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.550
The question is, "Well, what is
the use beyond just being able

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.750
to say to a man, 'Here's what
we think your prognosis is.'?"

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.120
Does it have any role in helping
for treatment decision-making.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.800
And we actually think
that it does.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.250
We think the biomarker
is telling us something

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:29.930
about disease biology.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:32.410
So we've just submitted
a grant application

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.930
to determine whether the
telomere biomarker will give us

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:37.920
information about which men,
who've started to recur,

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.140
the PSA has gone up again,
which men would benefit

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.780
from simple salvage
radiation therapy,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.240
and which men would benefit

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.070
from additionally having
anti-androgen therapy on top.

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.980
And the reason why not all men
are given anti-androgen therapy

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.260
in the first place when
they start to recur is

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.900
because it does have
side effects.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.750
And so to figure out
which men would benefit

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:01.310
versus which men would
not would be an advance

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:03.190
in the care of those men.

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:04.990
And then the last
one, as I mentioned,

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.770
we have optimized the
telomere biomarker.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.040
And we had funding to do that.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.390
So thank you for listening.

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:13.910
Here are the acknowledgments,
the funding

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.940

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:23.200
and our population
scientists who come together

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.080
to study the problem of cancer,

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.980
and in particular
prostate cancer.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.780
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:38.090
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen:
Thank you so much.

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:40.250
Thank you so much.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:45.120
So our third speaker is
very close to our patients.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.970
Actually she's a clinician.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:49.240
She's a [inaudible]
clinical investigator,

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:55.150
Division of Hematology
and Oncology.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:06:00.490
And she's also director of the
Translational Cancer Medicine,

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.850
and head of the [inaudible]
Therapeutic Section

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:06.900
at Columbia Medical School.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.420
And she was at the
National Cancer Institute.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:16.220
And she has done significant
discoveries and studies.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.330
And her work is epigenetic
modification agents,

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:24.230
as well as her group
received approval

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.210
by the FDA for [inaudible].

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:31.890
That was a medicine originally
developed by Japanese scientists

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:37.830
for the antibiotics purpose,
but it was too potent.

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:42.980
And her group got approval for
[inaudible] T cell lymphoma,

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:48.390
as well as peripheral
T cell lymphoma.

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:53.520
And she has been working now
at Columbia still a combination

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.900
of laboratory studies
and clinical studies.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:03.440
So she has a goal to
translate the ideas

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.160
from the laboratory
to clinical trials.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.880
So, Susan, thank you so much.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.180

you very much.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:14.240
Thank you.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.350
I really enjoyed
those last two talks.

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:24.010
And I hope we can find
the third [inaudible].

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.310
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:35.380
So what I've been
doing since I went

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:44.000
to Columbia is actually working
more on pancreatic cancer.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.620
It's a very, very
difficult disease.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:49.490
And I have learned an
enormous amount about it.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:54.090
And I wanted to just talk
to you some about that.

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.980
That is completely
translational,

01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:01.320
trying to identify strategies
to try to bring to patients.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.990
Anyone know anyone who's
ever had pancreatic cancer?

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:08.060
So you've known some people.

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:13.010
So it's not a commonly
diagnosed disease as others,

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:17.680
as you can see here on the
slide, where only 3% of patients

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.980
who are diagnosed with it,

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:25.300
of all 1.7 million cancer
diagnoses expected this year.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:29.960
But, in fact, it accounts
for a larger fraction

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.050
of patients who die from cancer.

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:36.290
And it's on target to become
the third leading cause of death

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.660
from cancer in general.

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:43.740
So it is very important that we
try to start figuring out how

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.760
to solve the problems
of pancreatic cancer.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.820
This is the five-year survival
from -- oh, my goodness.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.620
Sorry. I don't know
how that happened.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.290
Oh, my. This is the
wrong version.

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:03.900
This is completely
the wrong version.

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.690
So I'm going to have to give
you a different version.

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:08.990
I'm sorry.

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.290
[inaudible] to do that.

01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:13.280
I guess we can keep talking.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.470
This is totally the
wrong version.

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:17.420
I apologize.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.030
So I had my husband
give me some edits,

01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:24.400
and all he ever edits is font.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.770
The font, that's
all he ever edits.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.680
So the problem with
pancreatic cancer --

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.050
I'm going to get
my computer open

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.510
and I'll talk at the same time.

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:58.290
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:00.820
So the point about
pancreatic cancer is

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:06.930
that it's a big problem
because of the local disease.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:08.350
Yeah, you can [inaudible].

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:14.850
It has the local disease,
it has distant disease,

01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:17.810
and it is drug resistant.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:19.680
And then we have
problems with --

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.770
and we have made progress
in precision medicine

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:27.010
and immunotherapy, but
we have not made the kind

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:28.930
of progress that
we need to make.

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.130
And that's what we'll
be talking about.

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:34.570
So the local disease,
probably the pancreas,

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.960
is it's nestled right
up under the --

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.680
right up under the liver --

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:53.620
It's going to be the
last [inaudible].

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.800
Right up under the liver, where
the bile drains from the liver,

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.770
part of the digestive process,
into the small intestine.

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.660
And the pancreas sits
here, right nestled

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:05.960
in behind the stomach.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.640
And then when you
get a cancer there,

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.690
it's actually sometimes
diagnosed very early,

01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:14.560
unlike other cancers
in the body.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.790
It can be diagnosed when
it's one or two centimeters,

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:21.810
because it is in such
a vital location.

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:26.210
But that doesn't seem to make a
big difference in what happens,

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:32.260
because the recurrence
rates are very, very high.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.510
The recurrence rates --

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:46.500
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.160
Recurrence rates are very high.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.820
And the reason they are high
is that it is a distant disease

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.380
from the very beginning.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.150
So while people think, "Oh,

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:58.350
this is a two-centimeter
pancreatic cancer,

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:01.270
I should be able to get that out
and cure the patient," in fact,

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:05.660
what happens is that the tumor
cells have already escaped

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:08.700
into lymph nodes, this is
a drawing of a lymph node,

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.580
escaped into the bloodstream
and traveled to the liver,

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.540
and set up what we call
micrometastatic disease

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.650
in the liver and in the lung.

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:21.600
And, in fact, 75% of patients
are not candidates for surgery,

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.710
because it's already invaded
into those local structures,

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.800
because it's right next
to everything that matters

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.040
in your digestion, and
also because it very soon,

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.100
very rapidly travels
into the bloodstream.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.500
So 75% don't get surgery.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.710
And I tell this to
patients all the time,

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.890
"You're in the lucky
25% of those

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:47.150
who do get to go to surgery."

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:51.340
And then I try to gently tell
them, "But there's a 75% chance

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.950
that you're going to die
of this disease anyway."

01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:58.570
So that makes that 8%
5-year survival a reality.

01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:00.230
It really is a death sentence.

01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:03.020
This is a very difficult
disease.

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:09.190
So it's drug sensitive, but
we do have drugs for it,

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.970
like we do with other cancers.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.470
Which for many years, when I was

01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:14.650
in medical school,
there were no drugs.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.970
No one thought that
pancreatic cancer would respond

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:18.270
to anything.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:20.040
But now we have found,
eventually,

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.610
that there are a couple
of treatment regimens.

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:25.690
And these are a bunch
of different patients,

01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:29.300
where we have response of the
tumor, it shrinks in size,

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.030
and then it grows back.

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:34.180
Response, grows back, response,

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.080
grows back, response,
grows back.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.540
So you can see that the majority
of the time it grows back

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.310
by about -- it really
starts turning

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:45.090
around by 100 to 200 days.

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:47.880
So that means three
to six months.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.000
So by the time I'm
kind of relaxing

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.170
and I think I've got this
patient on autopilot,

01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.280
they're getting their
chemotherapy,

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.280
the scan comes back and tells
me I've got disease progression.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.190
And I have to start all over.

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:03.100
And that is the life of the
patient with pancreatic cancer.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:08.240
Once you start down that road,
it's a never-ceasing source

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.790
of the cancer's going to respond
to treatment, but it's going

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:16.030
to come back, until eventually
we run out of treatment.

01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:18.580
So there it took
actually research.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.180
The concept of how
difficult it is

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.310
to do clinical research
sometimes amazes me.

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.380
And I've been doing it
for all these years.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:32.290
But I sat down once and I added
up all the patients enrolled

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:37.790
in the clinical trials
that it took to find

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:42.600
that one drug combination
called for Folfirinox was better

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.520
than Gemcitabine, and
a two-drug combination,

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:51.700
Paclitaxel with Gemcitabine, is
better than Gemcitabine alone.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:55.390
So these are our two
leading drug combinations.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:58.060
So better than a single agent.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:03.530
It took, basically, 40 clinical
trials and 14,000 patients

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:06.640
to get to the point of
proving that, because over

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.120
and over again we tried and we
failed, we tried and we failed.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.800
And we, finally, got
two regimens to try

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.600
to treat these patients with.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:29.100
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.980
My computer's so full.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:36.040
And this is just the benefit
that we got out of these two,

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.560
that in terms of survival.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.750
That's how we measure
overall survival

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:45.860
and how we measure a
benefit in pancreatic cancer.

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.990
We don't have to measure how
good does this drug work,

01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:51.290
how to shrink the tumor.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:54.420
We just have to measure did it
make you live longer or not.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.730
And that's a devastating
comment in itself.

01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.830
The FDA has spent
enormous effort trying

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:06.180
to accept other endpoints for
other diseases, tumor shrinkage,

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.970
a disappearance of
tumor, various things.

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:12.450
And pancreatic cancer
is one thing.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:14.470
It doesn't make you live longer.

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:18.290
And so these are the
two chemotherapies.

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:21.870
And this is for people
who couldn't go to surgery

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:25.090
where the disease was
spread outside the pancreas.

01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:29.360
So in those patients, it made
you definitely increase survival

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:35.110
by four months, live from,
basically, seven to 11 months.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:41.950
And this is one of the reasons,
it's not the only reason,

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.880
but you heard about lymphocytes

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.380
and lymphocytes being
in cancer cells.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.570
So this is one example
of a pancreatic cancer

01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:52.760
where there are plenty of
lymphocytes or immune cells,

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.000
those T cells, and up
here is the cancer.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.300
But what you can see is

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:01.310
that there's a lot
of fibrous material.

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:03.910
It's actually called
hyaluronic acid.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:07.010
Dermatologists use it to
make your cheeks puffier

01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:10.370
when you see people that
have been to dermatologists.

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:13.020
And it actually prevents
those --

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.840
we think prevents
those lymphocytes

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.390
and from getting
into the tumor cells.

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:25.000
So the question is, "Can we do
better with precision medicine?"

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.510
And that's where -- okay --

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:51.320
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.140
Well, we'll see.

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.900
I'll just talk when I
-- I have such lovely,

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.520
better slides than this.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.800
It might be that I
sent you two versions.

I probably send you the
correct one the first time.

that on your flash drive.

I sent you this morning?

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.010
Because maybe I sent
you -- it was very --

01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:28.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:30.870
They were identical?

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:34.120
Okay. Anyway, so what
we're going to be talking

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.390
about now is precision medicine,

01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:39.820
and how that relates
to pancreatic cancer.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.020
So what we've done
in oncology is,

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:46.730
as a result of the Cancer
Moonshot, as a result of a lot

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.500
of fabulous progress that
you've heard about already,

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.430
we've learned to figure
out specific changes

01:18:53.430 --> 01:19:00.790
in patients' cancers that lead
to help drive that cancer,

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:03.490
and that we can identify
a drug that will target

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:08.060
that cancer, and have succeeded.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.280
So that's called
targeted therapy.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.020
That's how we've
come to call it.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.050
Precision medicine and
targeted therapy are,

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.950
basically, the same thing.

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:20.000
And a lot of, for example,
the American Cancer Society

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.340
in trying to explain
what is targeted therapy,

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.730
they say these drugs target
certain parts of cancer cells

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:29.220
that make them different
from other cells,

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.580
or they may target other cells
that help cancer cells grow.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.960
But it's a specific target,

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.510
as opposed to our traditional
chemotherapy, which --

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:45.220
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.380
So that's different from
traditional chemotherapy,

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:51.460
which binds DNA, binds
tubulin, binds something

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:53.730
in the cancer cell,
and the cancer cell has

01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:56.000
to be more vulnerable
to being killed.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.930
This is something that
makes the cancer a cancer.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:04.040
And that's the reason why
we call it targeted therapy.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.120
So it is clearly a validated
treatment in some tumors.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.990
This is just an example
that I got from a website

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:15.450
where they're showing if we take
a number of patients who have,

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:18.720
for example, lung cancer,
we know that some are going

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.060
to have what we call an
EGF receptor mutation,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:26.010
some are going to have what
we call an ALK mutation,

01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.750
different changes in cancers
that lead them to be different,

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:35.160
so they're alterations that
lead them to be susceptible

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.500
to different treatments.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:47.090
So the key here, though, is that
this person has to be identified

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:51.350
as having had the EGF receptor
mutation, and this person has

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:54.910
to be identified as
having an ALK mutation.

01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:57.390
So we have clear examples

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:01.240
where it's become a real
cancer medicine by doing that.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.760
We know that in chronic
myelogenous leukemia we can

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.690
treat patients with Imatinib
that inhibits this protein.

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:12.140
And patients now are not
even dying from the disease.

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.390
It's turned it completely
into a chronic disease.

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.730
We know that in breast cancer
patients with HER2-positive,

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:22.700
that's a mutation or an
amplification of HER2,

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.160
they have very good, very
long treatment responses

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.410
with an antibody against that.

01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:29.810
Erlotinib and Gefitinib.

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.920
And I'm going to show
you more about that.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.280
And then a melanoma
mutation against BRAF

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.740
that I'm sure you've
seen in the news.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.300
So here's the mutation.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:44.670
EGF receptor signals
cancer cell proliferation,

01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:46.490
cancer cell survival.

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:47.840
It makes the cancer grow.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.450
It's a ghost signal for
the cancer as a whole.

01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:56.080
And that EGF receptor
mutation is the one

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.480
that we can specifically target
with EGF receptor inhibitors,

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.270
Erlotinib, Gefitinib, drugs
that are FDA-approved.

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:05.840
These make people live longer.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.130
It converts their disease,
at least for a time,

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:12.040
into a responsive disease.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.150
And then other cancer drivers
have been eventually recognized.

01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:23.560
Targeted therapy for all of
these has been developed --

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.300
for most of these
has been developed.

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.670
Not for all of them.

01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:29.460
But they are effective.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:30.760
They're not curative.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.140
But it has been a
watershed for lung cancer.

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.670
It completely changed it from
the kind of disease we talked

01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:41.880
about earlier where no benefit
to a disease where we have drugs

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:46.930
that target it that
hold the disease at bay.

01:22:46.930 --> 01:22:52.720
So if we don't get to the
end of it, we'll be okay.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.920
You think you've got it loaded?

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.140
Okay. [inaudible], but
let's wait and see.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.300
Maybe I somehow just got
the whole thing tangled up.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.560
So what people have done
then, and now this is

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.740
where personalized
medicine, basically,

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.140
went out into the community,
before we were completely ready

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:16.930
for it to be there, but it went
because every patient wanted

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:19.500
to know what was in
their cancer genome,

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.600
what caused my cancer,
what is my cancer.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.010
So many different institutions
have developed their own 500

01:23:26.010 --> 01:23:27.680
cancer gene panel.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.800
There's agreement that about
400 genes are cancer genes.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.750
And the people took it on their
own to develop their own panel

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:38.520
for whole genome sequencing.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.640
Columbia has its own.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.720
Memorial Sloan Kettering
has its own.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.680
University of California
San Francisco has its own.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:52.010
FoundationOne is the
most widely used.

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:56.210
And so these actually cost
an enormous amount of money.

01:23:56.210 --> 01:23:58.780
And patients want to
know, and they hope

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.540
that that will give
them information

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:04.910
that will lead them
to a treatment.

01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:09.510
Now, what comes back on
these cancer panels --

01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:12.360
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.570
Okay. So can we switch to the --

01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:20.920
can we switch over to the other
[inaudible] that she saved?

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.220
I'm sorry.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.020
I know this is taking
[inaudible].

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:49.040
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.340
I'm sorry.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:55.140
And that's the last time I let
my husband work on my talk.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.420
[inaudible] a big [inaudible]
like that [inaudible].

01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.150
He's also a physician.

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:07.580
So what those 500 gene
panels do is they are looking

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.340
for all different
kinds of mutations.

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.550
They're looking for
many more things

01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:13.420
than just individual mutations.

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:17.330
But the thing that we look
the most for is where,

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:21.270
at the DNA level, you have
one base change that leads

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:23.210
to a change, potentially.

01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:25.730
It can be [inaudible]
in the RNA,

01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:29.190
and leads to a change
in the amino acid.

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:30.960
Those are called missense.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.480
It doesn't, we think, really
hurt if it changes a base

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.110
that doesn't change
the amino acid.

01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:40.370
Sometimes it causes
a change that leads

01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:42.370
to the protein not
being synthesized,

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.360
and the loss of a protein.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.090
So these things can all
be related to cancer.

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:52.150
And that's what we get back
from our 500 gene panel.

01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:54.900
So this is a patient of
mine with pancreatic cancer

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.480
who we ran the Columbia
panel on.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.490
This is the kind of
result we get back.

01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:02.200
Four hundred and
sixty-seven cancer genes.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:09.520
We have mutations in KRAS,
TP53, SMARCA4, CDKN2A.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.090
So a whole bunch of genes.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.740
Some I don't even
know what they are.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.830
I don't know what
all these genes are.

01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:18.210
And that's what your
doctor is getting back

01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:21.530
when you sent your
thing to FoundationOne,

01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:24.680
he's getting back a report
just like this with all kinds

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.270
of genes that you don't
actually know what it has.

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:31.430
And so you get the report back,

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.620
and they classify these
variants, and they say, "Well,

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.210
some are unknown mutation,"

01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:38.050
like the EGFR mutation
that I showed you.

01:26:38.050 --> 01:26:40.920
And there's an FDA-approved
drug for it.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.260
And if you have lung cancer,
it's an FDA-approved indication.

01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.580
So in that situation,
bingo, you're settled.

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:51.540
But many of them are
it's an EGFR mutation.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.890
There's an FDA-approved drug,
but it's a different tumor type.

01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:57.320
Is that the same thing?

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.150
We actually don't know.

01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:03.740
And sometimes it comes
back a known mutation,

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.880
but there's no FDA-approved
drug.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.860
And sometimes, as with many
of these, I have no idea what

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:13.750
that gene is, or what the
mutation is doing there.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:17.170
So the problem with that
is that it's a $5,000 test.

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:20.970
And we're, basically, running
$5,000 worth of experiments

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:24.630
on lots of patients without
actually knowing the outcome.

01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:27.500
So the precision
medicine strategy is

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.710
to take a newly diagnosed
cancer, and find out which

01:27:30.710 --> 01:27:32.660
of these categories
it really fits in.

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.440
Is it a known mutation
in a known tumor type

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.760
with an approved drug?

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.630
Great. Or is it a known mutation
in a different tumor type,

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:43.810
in which case the doctor has
to work hard to get the drug

01:27:43.810 --> 01:27:46.520
and off-label use,
but you can do that.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.820
I've done that.

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.360
And I actually did
it for that patient.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.780
And I picked this one because
there's a breast cancer drug

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.380
called palbociclib.

01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.930
Now, I could have picked this
one, but there's a drug that's

01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:00.130
in clinical trials that
might work against that.

01:28:00.130 --> 01:28:01.700
That would be a lot
harder for me to get

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.510
that than an FDA-approved drug.

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:06.890
But you see I have no
data for either choice.

01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:11.340
And then there can be a
completely unknown mutation.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:13.790
So I've already alluded
to some of the problems

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:15.910
with where we are with
precision medicine.

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:17.630
It sounds great.

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:18.930
We all want it.

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:20.760
We all absolutely want it.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.460
Every day when I see patients,

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.800
I want to order the
tests for the patients.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.290
But the truth is
knowing the mutation,

01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:32.870
it may have a different role
in the tumor I'm looking at.

01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:35.930
Many mutations can be
found, not just one.

01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:38.920
We don't have drugs
for most mutations.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.260
And when we direct a patient
toward a targeted mutation,

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.860
we direct that patient away
from the proven therapy.

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.040
It's new. It's expensive.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.990
And patients and insurers
pay precious dollars

01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:53.280
for what's effectively
an experiment.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.330
Now here's where I'm going to
show you how it's an experiment.

01:28:56.330 --> 01:29:01.260
So BRAF in metastatic
melanoma, a fabulous discovery,

01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.260
that most melanomas have BRAF.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:07.300
It's driving the cancer to grow.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.510
And when we treat with a
drug called vemurafenib,

01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:13.450
or BRAF inhibitor, it
turns off the signaling.

01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:16.790
It went from bright
on this glucose scan,

01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:20.750
all these are spots that
patient had all over his body,

01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:22.050
and now they resolved.

01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:25.270
It doesn't work forever,
but it works.

01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:27.170
And this is the whole patient.

01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:29.630
This is the way we
show patient responses,

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:33.680
called a waterfall plot, where
it's the percent shrinkage.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:37.970
So patients didn't have
100% shrinkage, typically.

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:41.530
Some did. But many had a
fraction of that percentage.

01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:44.850
I mean, this is a
fabulous waterfall plot.

01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:47.370
And it made people live longer.

01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:51.440
Those who got the drug lived
longer than those who didn't.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.650
So then they said,
"Well, this mutation shows

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:56.410
up in lots of other cancers.

01:29:56.410 --> 01:29:58.870
We're going to practice
precision medicine

01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:02.130
on those other non-melanoma
cancers."

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.190
So the biggest group that
also has this BRAF has

01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.850
colorectal cancer.

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:11.030
And, in fact, there were six
patients that had shrinkage.

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:14.180
Nothing like you saw in
the waterfall plot before.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.990
This looks totally different.

01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:20.290
And, in fact, they all returned
to baseline by one month.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:23.070
It wasn't by 11 or 12 months.

01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:25.250
So this did not succeed at all.

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:27.200
This was a total failure.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:33.340
And, in fact, a number of
people said they took a broader

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.990
approach and they said, "I'm
going to do the FoundationOne

01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:38.690
in a variety of patients,

01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:41.480
and then give them all
the best drug I can think

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:45.500
of with the FoundationOne
precision medicine strategy.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.020
And I'm going to see
if they live longer."

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.850
And so they collected
all those patients.

01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:55.890
And, really, there's very little
difference between those curves.

01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:58.870
It has a ratio of
.88 is, basically,

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:01.840
saying almost no difference.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.170
So precision medicine,
we have to think about --

01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:08.660
we cannot think of that right
now as the answer to everything.

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:12.570
What we have to do is keep
looking for actual targets

01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:15.870
in tumors that are
drivers in most tumors.

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:18.070
So this is pancreatic cancer.

01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:22.950
And this is a sequencing
of about 400 patients.

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.100
And these are a variety of genes
that were found to be in one

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.080
or two percent of
those patients.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.510
But there is a gene called KRAS.

01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:33.160
Very similar to that
EGF receptor.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:39.120
It drives growth, drives
size, drives metabolism.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.640
It's found in pancreatic
cancer almost always

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.940
at the very beginning.

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:46.110
It's the first gene
that changes.

01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:47.870
So it is a key gene.

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:49.830
And the NCI actually has set

01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:52.600
up something called the
RAS Initiative to try

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.310
to find a drug for this.

01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:57.090
But we don't yet have one.

01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:59.710
Now, RAS signals
a lot of things.

01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:05.590
It signals through ERK,
which is in that BRAF.

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:10.590
But it signals down to
a protein called MYC.

01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:13.510
MYC is highly expressed
in pancreatic cancer.

01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.680
And when it is expressed
at very high levels,

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.290
you actually have a lot
more patients dying.

01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:22.230
This is a survival curve.

01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:26.170
This is more survival,
this is less survival.

01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:29.670
So patients with pancreatic
cancer have less survival

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:32.590
when you have active
signaling through MYC.

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.130
So one of the things my
laboratory now is working

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:39.640
on is a compound that will turn
off MYC in pancreatic cancer.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.590
And you can see here,
this is a western blot

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:43.890
of protein expression.

01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:46.820
You can see very
high MYC expression,

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:49.290
and then you see
how it's turned off.

01:32:49.290 --> 01:32:53.660
Very high and how
it's turned off.

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.220
It also kills those cells,
at least some of them.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.720
Some are not very sensitive.

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.080
This is a killing curve

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.980
of pancreatic cancer
cells in the laboratory.

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.690
And we start out at 100%.

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.540
And at least two
of the cell lines

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.120
that we study are very simple.

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.570
But we're stuck in this research

01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:15.540
because we need $50,000
to make this drug.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.870
And we don't have it.

01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:19.480
And we keep putting in
grants over and over again.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.940
And we still aren't
getting a grant back

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.840
to finish this research.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.200
So if any of you
have any influence

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.710
over directing dollars toward
pancreatic cancer research,

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:33.290
think about that.

01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:36.320
So my patients always come
back and they say, "Okay,

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.760
what about immunotherapy?

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.060
I want a treatment.

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.960
I want immunotherapy."

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.010
And you saw this a
little bit earlier.

01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:46.190
The way I think about this --
see here's the big tumor cell,

01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:49.690
the little bitty T
cells, which is amazing.

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.460
All these drawings,
the T cell is no match

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:55.340
for the cancer cell
in terms of size.

01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.900
There's this handshake.

01:33:56.900 --> 01:34:01.310
I call it a handshake
that is, basically,

01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:05.670
this tumor telling this
T cell not to be active.

01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:09.470
You saw the inflammation
that we talked about earlier

01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:10.960
that you need to have.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.580
Well, when we add those new
drugs that are FDA-approved,

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:20.170
you block that handshake, and
then you get T cell activation.

01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:22.190
And the tumor dies.

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.210
So the T cell feeds things

01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:28.090
into this tumor cell
that make it die.

01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:33.120
And so we want to block the
handshake that turns off

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.760
so that the T cells can
attack the tumor cell.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.520
Well, this is what -- I
got this off of Google

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.440
and then I couldn't refine it,
but someone had drawn it showing

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.560
that immunotherapy -- it's
a great time in oncology

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.660
because of immunotherapy.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:52.430
You can see that they've drawn
this 100% survival curve,

01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:53.730
dropping [inaudible].

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:57.900
So 80% of patients are living
because of immunotherapy.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.570
Whereas without it,
patients die.

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.060
Whereas this is so much better

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.960
than traditional
cancer treatment.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.690
Right? How many believe this?

01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:13.610
I've got some land in
the swamp to sell you.

01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:18.280
So, okay, there are patients
who've done amazingly well

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.580
with immunotherapy.

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.840
But it is not 80% of patients.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.390
The reality is far closer
to this than it is to this.

01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:30.870
So that's one problem we, who've
developed small molecules have,

01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:35.320
"Well, your grant doesn't
even have immunotherapy in it.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:38.020
You just want to develop
a small molecule."

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:42.030
So the reality is that
immunotherapy is not helping.

01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:44.200
Only in melanoma is it able

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.270
to even approach the
majority of patients.

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:51.740
Every other disease, it is
much closer to this reality.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.900
But I'm not trying
to be negative.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.110
There are lots of
other handshakes

01:35:56.110 --> 01:35:57.550
that need to be studied.

01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:59.670
And all the things that
you talked about --

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:02.620
Dr. Tsang talked about in terms

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:07.570
of why people respond,
why they don't.

01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:09.450
But too much in -- to my mind,

01:36:09.450 --> 01:36:11.420
there's too much energy
currently invested

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:15.370
in immunotherapy, and not
enough back in small molecules,

01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:20.090
back making the precision
medicine dream a reality.

01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:24.630
There are still other oncogenic
drivers that need drugs.

01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:27.260
And that's the work I
think is so important.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.580
So we have 361 clinical
trials, including ten that are

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:35.780
in exactly the same category
of the exact same handshake

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.450
that we already have very
good drugs FDA-approved for.

01:36:39.450 --> 01:36:43.460
So we need new immunotherapy,
different immunotherapy.

01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:47.250
And we need more small
molecules to be developed.

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:49.780
So just to sum up,
pancreatic cancer's on track

01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:53.120
to become the third leading
cause of death from cancer.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.330
Surgery's not enough.

01:36:55.330 --> 01:36:58.250
Responsiveness to
chemotherapy, yes, it's there,

01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.930
but it rapidly develops
resistance.

01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:02.230
Precision medicine

01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:04.910
and immunotherapy are
works in progress.

01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:06.750
And research funding is critical

01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:09.560
to make progress
in this disease.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.270
So to sum up, I have a lot
of people that have helped me

01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:15.740
with all the work that we do.

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.540

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.210
Welcome back to our third
Cancer Moonshot Program.

01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:14.710
It gives me great pleasure to
be here in the midst of progress

01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:21.250
that I had hoped to
see and continue.

01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:25.000
I have surpassed the
time of being a recipient

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.830
of such a wonderful
good news time

01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:31.640
with the Cancer Moonshot
Initiative.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.790
I came from times
that things were still

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:44.010
in the research process
and sheer experimentation.

01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:49.650
Now everything to be here --

01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:55.340
to be now progress with
this Cancer Moonshot.

01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:01.160
Now it's today it's more about
the treatment of the patient

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.160
than the treatment of the
patient with the disease.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:12.650
So I welcome aboard today
John Bauer, [inaudible] club

01:39:12.650 --> 01:39:16.870
of the big little c. I told John

01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:20.120
that the reason why I
called it the big c is

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.760
because it becomes the little
c as we go through the process

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:28.240
of beating the disease itself.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.730
Meaning sometimes it
looks too big to defeat,

01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:35.820
but when you do it, it
becomes something little

01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.480
to kick to the curb.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.730
John Bauer has walked
the journey

01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:48.320
of the c. He started working
in the Library in 2010.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:51.680
He started his journey in 2014

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.720
with thyroid, head
and neck cancer.

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:01.410
Fortunately, they were
treatable and curable.

01:40:55.510 --> 01:41:55.230
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:41:55.230 --> 01:41:57.990
&gt;&gt; John Bauer: So I can't
offer any cures for cancer.

01:41:57.990 --> 01:42:01.670
But there's no -- I know
nothing about telomeres

01:42:01.670 --> 01:42:07.310
or [inaudible] or any of that.

01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:11.180
But I do offer a
perspective from a patient.

01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:19.030
And, hopefully, offer a better
engagement on physicians' part

01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:21.400
and researchers'
part with patients.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.810
And also to offer patients
a better ability to cope

01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:28.260
with the situation at hand,

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.770
which can be devastating,
of course.

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:34.510
So I just borrowed the
title page here from --

01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:58.100
[ Inaudible Speakers ]

01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.400
Got it. Thank you.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.190
Okay. I'm an IT guy.

01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:04.760
I don't do too many
presentations.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.530
So, anyway, that slide's
just to start it up.

01:43:07.530 --> 01:43:09.730
I didn't know --
the guidance was

01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:14.110
to convey my own
personal experience,

01:43:14.110 --> 01:43:17.220
but also to emphasize
the engagements

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.440
with medical personnel
along the way.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.580
So I thought how do I do this in
an engaging and thoughtful way?

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:28.160
Cancer is kind of
in the same category

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.570
as 9/11 or the Holocaust.

01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:32.910
And it's just, you
don't joke about it.

01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:36.800
It's just too dreadful
and it's pernicious.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:39.820
And as affected as
people are by it,

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.570
it certainly doesn't lend
itself to standup comedy.

01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:44.960
But, nevertheless, I did try
to put together something

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.330
that was entertaining
and thoughtful.

01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:49.630
So here we go.

01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:52.560
Here's my dad and I
in the early '60s.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.250
And then my dad was swept up
in 1969 in the Vietnam War,

01:43:56.250 --> 01:43:59.340
and he was exposed
to Agent Orange.

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:03.190
Myself, I was doing
okay until 1985.

01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:06.610
When Chernobyl hit,
I was studying German

01:44:06.610 --> 01:44:09.890
in a small German village.

01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:12.020
And Chernobyl happened.

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.320
I knew it happened.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.620
I didn't know exactly
how serious it was.

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:15.920
Nobody really did at the time.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.430
They just picked up some sensors
in [inaudible] had picked it up.

01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:23.430
And the cloud was rolling
across Eastern Europe.

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:27.120
And it was really unsure
how serious it was.

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.650
The German politicians were
assuring everybody [foreign

01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:30.950
language], don't
worry about anything.

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:32.680
Everybody stay put.

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.230
How are you going to evacuate
millions of people anyway?

01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:38.050
So I thought, "Okay, I'm
going to sit this one out."

01:44:38.050 --> 01:44:41.150
But then I saw my classmates
coming back up from Switzerland

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:42.450
from hitchhiking,
[foreign language],

01:44:42.450 --> 01:44:44.750
which is okay to
do in Switzerland.

01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:48.090
And half their face
was completely burned,

01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:49.830
just burned to a crisp.

01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:53.310
And the other half was
completely unaffected.

01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:56.570
So I knew something -- that
was the side that was pointing

01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:58.030
where the cloud was rolling in.

01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:01.160
So I thought, "Okay, it's
time say auf wiedersehen

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.460
and jump on the plane."

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.140
So my Iceland air flight, my
chief Iceland air flight I had,

01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:07.400
I wasn't due to return
until months later

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.420
after the study concluded.

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:10.970
I found myself up in Iceland.

01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:12.270
I thought, "Oh, great.

01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:14.470
Up in Iceland, I'm home free."

01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:17.790
The cloud's not going to
make it up here, certainly.

01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:19.370
But then when I discovered later

01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:21.050
that Iceland took a
really big hit, of course,

01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:22.470
I was outdoors admiring
waterfalls

01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:24.450
and doing all the
Icelandic things.

01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:27.780
So if I had to take
a guess of what --

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:29.110
have the thyroid
cancer [inaudible].

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:30.410
I tried to get iodine.

01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:31.710
Of course, nobody spoke English,

01:45:31.710 --> 01:45:33.020
and there wasn't
any iodine on hand.

01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.740
What they had went
to Icelanders.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:36.040
I couldn't get iodine.

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.130
Okay. So in any event -- because
I know iodine, of course,

01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:42.690
soaks up the radiation,
it flushes it

01:45:42.690 --> 01:45:44.690
out without it affecting.

01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:47.180
Okay. Fast forward to 2004.

01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:51.110
My dad, by the way, his cancer
started in the early '90s.

01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:55.000
And his second wife
was a Thai doctorate

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.930
who had professional
commitments back home.

01:45:57.930 --> 01:46:00.180
So he moved with
her back to Bangkok.

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:06.340
And I get this call, it was
actually May 2004, late May.

01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:09.040
My twins were born by
in vitro fertilization.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.470
That's a different story.

01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:14.010
August 2004 I get
the dreaded call

01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:17.900
that every son or
daughter dreads.

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.940
I'm in the shower
and getting ready

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.290
for work on a Monday morning.

01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:24.160
And my wife comes running
in, "John, come quick.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.460
Your dad's in trouble,"
et cetera.

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.430
So I hop on the next
plane to Bangkok.

01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:30.960
I was by myself at the
Faculty of Medicine

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:39.850
at Ramathibodi Hospital, where
my dad had formed friendships

01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:41.680
with the research staff there.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.770
And he would grade
their papers --

01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:47.720
he would edit their
research papers in return

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.200
for them keeping him alive.

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.670
And it was a good
exchange, a good arrangement.

01:46:52.670 --> 01:46:54.010
They keep him on
the latest drug,

01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:55.380
and until that drug
stopped working.

01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.680
Then another one
would come along.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.510
And they managed to prolong
his life for ten years

01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:59.910
because they caught -- back

01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:03.810
in America they caught
his condition late,

01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:05.330
so it had progressed.

01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:08.950
And here they are
here, the physicians.

01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:10.320
They used Mr. Robert.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.210
They addressed you
by your first name.

01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:13.510
This is the ICU chart.

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:14.940
He was in ICU when I arrived.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.600
This was taken later
so I'm smiling.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.440
And, of course, everybody
in Thailand smiles.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.440
So she's the ICU nurse, the
hardest job in the entire world.

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.040
And I went back to
thank her afterwards.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.360
So this is a bit
of a staged photo.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.170
This didn't happen as I arrived.

01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:30.580
It wasn't [inaudible] arrival.

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.050
The IXU chief at one
point, as my dad had a tube

01:47:33.050 --> 01:47:35.810
down his throat, and he
had a needle in his neck

01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:37.110
because they would have

01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:39.210
to transfer [inaudible]
every couple of days.

01:47:39.210 --> 01:47:42.660
And they were just, basically,
artificially keeping him alive.

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.530
And the ICU chief -- this
went on for several days.

01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:47.830
And his heart was strong.

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:49.320
And I, you know, "What do I do?

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.490
I never -- in a new
situation -- you had to know."

01:47:51.490 --> 01:47:55.290
The ICU chief pulls me aside,
and he laid down the law

01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:56.670
with his, read me the riot act.

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:57.970
And he said, "There
comes a point

01:47:57.970 --> 01:47:59.370
at which we're no
longer extending life,

01:47:59.370 --> 01:48:02.040
that were prolonging death."

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.340
And I said, "Right."

01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:06.080
So I took a walk around
Bangkok with his doctors.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.700
And I said, "What do I do?"

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:11.330
And they said, "Well,
do what we all do,

01:48:11.330 --> 01:48:13.490
and just make the
hard decision."

01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:15.850
And I said, "Okay, when
would you like to do this?"

01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:18.330
She said, "Whenever you like."

01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:20.130
And I said, "Well,
how about tonight?"

01:48:20.130 --> 01:48:21.430
"Yeah, okay, great."

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:22.730
So they put out the word.

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:24.830
All his friends, every friend he
had in the world at that point,

01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:28.390
gathered in the ICU room.

01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:30.570
And a fellow came
in with a syringe,

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:33.590
and I held his hand
as he passed.

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:37.400
And I had a certain amount
of engagement with him

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.700
when his eyes were still open.

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:40.500
And I was able to communicate
everything I needed to say.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.720
But it was certainly a one-sided
conversation with a tube

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:47.020
down his throat, there was no
argument or anything involved.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.470
But, anyway, so here's
the temple.

01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:52.960
I'm going to blast through
these quite quickly just to kind

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.780
of show you what it involved.

01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.000
And on this thought
everybody says, "Well,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.300
we're praying for you."

01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:04.940
Regardless of religious belief,
it's more of a coping mechanism

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.810
on their part, really,
because what can people say?

01:49:07.810 --> 01:49:09.690
I mean, this person has
cancer, for heaven's sake.

01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:14.920
You don't want to say, "You're
going to be fine," or, "Well,

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.900
you shouldn't have
this to drink.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.490
You shouldn't of
drank Gatorade."

01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:19.840
I don't know.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:24.620
But, really, the discomfort
was in everybody being required

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.460
to confront their own mortality.

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:28.540
And I think it's
really more for them.

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:29.840
I said, "Oh, thank
you, thank you.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.140
I'm not a religious person.

01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.440
[inaudible] a spiritual person.

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.740
Thank you, thank you."

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:35.040
But just to hedge my bet I
did have prayer groups going

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.340
in all major world religions
pulling for me there.

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:37.640
And, ultimately, it worked.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.940
So, again, here's
back in my day.

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.240
This is [inaudible] momento
where we flashed back

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.540
and flashed forward [inaudible].

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:42.840
You never really
know where you are

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.140
in the presentation at the time.

01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.440
But I managed to get the
point across at the end.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:46.740
So here's a [inaudible].

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.040
I had it [inaudible],
sorry, picture of him.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.340
I think it was midsummer
heat, Bangkok, Thailand.

01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:50.640
Full uniform, he's got
a cigarette hanging

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.940
out of his mouth.

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.240
He's doing his work.

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.540
Look, I don't get it.

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.840
His job is to cremate.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.140
So they arrange the
bones in a certain order,

01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.440
sprinkle some nice roses
and pebbles on them.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:49:59.740
And then they box it up.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.040
And it wasn't all bad.

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.340
This was back when I ate meat.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.640
This is a fish.

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:04.940
Well, it was a fish.

01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.240
And it was just delicious.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.540
Anyway, fast forward to
2014, and I'm diagnosed.

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.840
And I said [inaudible]
first commenter was, "John,

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.140
we're just in a state
of disbelief

01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.440
with your list of
health hang ups.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.740
You're the last person that
this should happen to."

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.040
I agree, because since college
days ended, since I met my wife

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.340
and got serious about life,

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.640
I tend to follow a fairly
healthy diet regime.

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:17.940
I certainly never smoked.

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.240
Drinking was a thing
of the past, et cetera.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.540
So, anyway, I find
myself several surgeries,

01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:21.840
27 lymph nodes, 36
radiation treatments

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.420
and various chemotherapy
appointments later,

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:30.560
I find myself in this
treatment program here.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:32.420
So here are the kids.

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:35.610
And it was another everybody
says is, "Oh, you're so brave."

01:50:35.610 --> 01:50:36.910
And I'm thinking, "Right.

01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:40.020
[inaudible] my choices
are exactly?"

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:47.080
So kind of as a patient, you're
kind of along for the ride.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:55.760
And I was really actually
measuring up the pine box,

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:59.470
because I personally
didn't expect to survive.

01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:07.030
I was, like, they say
prepare for the worst

01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:11.380
and hope for the best.

01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.630
So there I was.

01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:17.640
And it's a bit like they did
[inaudible] in the foxhole,

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.280
the battlefield, when
they hear the charge,

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.430
and you can't see
in the foxhole.

01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:27.670
You've got to advance.

01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:28.970
So this is a [inaudible].

01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:30.970
So they locked and bolted me

01:51:30.970 --> 01:51:36.830
in in one these [inaudible] my
little custom-made headset here

01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:38.620
where they bolted you in.

01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:40.370
And, of course, just
what I needed

01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:42.520
after Chernobyl was
more radiation.

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.820
But, anyway, [inaudible].

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.670
And these are the
fellows that helped.

01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.970
There I am after it.

01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:49.750
You see the sunken eyes
and just thin as a bone.

01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:52.760
I mean, just absolutely
-- just absolutely --

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:56.640
and the kids they [inaudible]
the best they could.

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.940
[inaudible] the Legos.

01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.240
It was actually [inaudible]
where they took me away

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:01.750
and where they put out
the call for prayers,

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:03.150
because John may not make it.

01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:05.640
There was blood on the wall
where I'd walked into it,

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.480
and I just had no memory of it.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.450
And I just -- it
was [inaudible].

01:52:10.450 --> 01:52:12.610
I just want to [inaudible] say
cancer affects not just the

01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:16.490
individual, but instead
the whole family.

01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:17.790
And it's the cancer patients

01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:19.170
that have a support
structure in place.

01:52:19.170 --> 01:52:20.470
But the caregivers don't.

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:24.160
So it really affects the family,
really most of the family.

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.910
The patient, himself or
herself, is really just kind

01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:28.410
of along for the ride.

01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:32.530
And maybe I'll survive
this and maybe I won't.

01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:34.770
But let's give it my best shot.

01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:37.310
You see, here's my youngest son.

01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:38.970
He's about 11, ten
or 11 at the time.

01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:41.970
And he's giving me the
feeding tube there.

01:52:41.970 --> 01:52:44.110
And here's my little guy.

01:52:44.110 --> 01:52:48.370
Evidently any fertility
issues were overcome in 2010,

01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:49.860
the same week I joined
the Library,

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:52.430
coincidentally, it
was a good week.

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:55.240
When he was born on
my 48th birthday.

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.820
So, anyway, the kids
would take [inaudible].

01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.120
They wouldn't do this now,

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:00.580
because the twins
are 14 [inaudible].

01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:03.670
But back in the day they would
keep me warm and whatnot,

01:53:03.670 --> 01:53:05.610
because I was suffering
temperature issues.

01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:06.920
This [inaudible] certificate.

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.940
I barely squeaked
through college,

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.900
freshman-level chemistry.

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:15.580
So I'm the least qualified
person to grace the stage today.

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:20.260
But, obviously, my
talents lie in other areas.

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:24.830
But of all these certificates
and awards and diplomas

01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:27.190
and whatnot that are
on my wall of shame,

01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:29.670
this is probably my
hardest earned, was this.

01:53:29.670 --> 01:53:31.740
And it talks about a
hero at the bottom.

01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:34.170
It says here [inaudible]
it says, "Here was a person

01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:36.110
that takes personal risks

01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:38.040
through their own
life to save others."

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.830
And that never really occurred.

01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:41.470
I was just kind of in
it for what I could get

01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:42.870
out of it, basically, surviving.

01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:45.190
Here's a little guy
ringing the gong

01:53:45.190 --> 01:53:46.770
in the radiation
oncology waiting room

01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:48.540
at the end of treatment.

01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:51.160
Okay. Now, 2015, this is
another very important point.

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.840
Recovery is way harder
than treatment.

01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:55.430
Again, in treatment you're
just along for the ride.

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:56.730
You do what you're told.

01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:58.030
And you take what's given you.

01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.750
But recovery, you're,
basically, on your own.

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:02.270
That's when you have -- you're
suffering this chemo brain,

01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:03.680
and you're sitting
in meetings at work,

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:05.800
and you just can't string
two thoughts together.

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:08.200
And it's like you can't
formulate sentences.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.430
And it's just life
is very difficult.

01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:13.060
And you're still
smelling burning flesh

01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:14.360
from the radiation.

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.970
And it's just getting these
chemicals out of the body,

01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:18.590
because I really, like I
say, [inaudible] vegetarian,

01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:20.980
you're drinking filtered water

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.280
and never drinking
bottled water.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.110
There's some hang
ups a mile long.

01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:28.680
But the point is that I tried to
run a clean ship, and suddenly,

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.850
as the chemotherapist told
me, he said, "You've been,

01:54:30.850 --> 01:54:33.070
basically, poisoned with
the nastiest stuff known

01:54:33.070 --> 01:54:35.220
to man to get rid of this."

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.520
This was all for a good cause.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.820
Here's the [inaudible].

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.640
This is, again, a staged
shot after the fact.

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.770
And the radiation oncologist
said something to me

01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:47.580
at one point in the treatment,
"You have to prepare yourself

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.280
for a life after cancer."

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:51.960
I just thought that's
a radical thought.

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.950
I'm prepared to die
here, and you're talking

01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:55.250
about life after cancer.

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:57.970
I can't see beyond
the next appointment.

01:54:57.970 --> 01:55:00.160
So that was just
a radical thought.

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.830
And I took it upon myself to
really make those extra 100 days

01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:06.870
or 200 days or whatever,
providing you don't have a tube

01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:09.370
down the throat, providing
they're mobile and [inaudible]

01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:12.220
and whatnot, it's worth
it, so they can wring

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.520
that extra little
bit out of life.

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.380
I don't mean to go all
Joseph Campbell on you,

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:18.080
the hero's journey sort
of thing, but, really,

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.380
that's what it amounts to.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.400
So, basically, I sprinkled this.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:23.670
I thought, "What do I
do to keep [inaudible].

01:55:23.670 --> 01:55:25.850
Photographs, sprinkle
it with metaphors,

01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:27.150
various quotes and whatnot.

01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:28.940
Get my point across and
it will all come together.

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.170
Great." So here we
are, me and the twins.

01:55:32.170 --> 01:55:35.130
The little guy he said he
had to stay home with Mama

01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:37.010
because I knew from
visiting [inaudible] before

01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:40.270
that he would not be able
to navigate squat toilets.

01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:44.050
Here's the daughter
busting a move here,

01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:45.350
she's a little yoga [inaudible].

01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:47.690
There she is at the Taj Mahal.

01:55:47.690 --> 01:55:48.990
Little fellow.

01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:50.290
Okay. These guys, [inaudible].

01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:54.100
Basically, they don't have
any family or any job,

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:58.990
and they just, basically, embark
on this internal quest in life.

01:55:58.990 --> 01:56:02.040
And they don't have
any sort of home.

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.860
They're accounted for
as homeless people.

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.950
But they dress up in really
bright colors, a lot of makeup,

01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:10.090
and they they smoke
a lot of dope.

01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:11.700
I mean, a lot of dope.

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.060
And they're constantly stoned.

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:14.440
It's like Elon Musk says,

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.740
"That's why they
call it a stone,

01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:18.520
because you sit there
like a stone."

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:21.080
Okay. So, anyway, the
oncologist's initial consult --

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:24.030
okay, now, they've already
exhausted conversationally the

01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:28.140
introduction and the how do
you do's and the qualification.

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:30.500
Okay. Then the possibility

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.900
of genetic treatment
has been set aside,

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:35.490
because that's not going to
work [inaudible] conventional

01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:36.790
[inaudible] getting it.

01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:39.410
He shows me a laminated flow
chart showing cancer type

01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:41.630
and stage, easily
accepted surgery, radiology

01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:43.170
and chemotherapy protocol.

01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:44.470
So I thought, "Okay, right,

01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:45.770
we're going to do
this the old way.

01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:47.070
We're going to cut it out.

01:56:47.070 --> 01:56:48.370
We're going to burn it out.

01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:49.670
And we're going to poison it.

01:56:49.670 --> 01:56:50.970
Right?" And I'm thinking,
"Okay."

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.270
So he shows me on this chart,

01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:53.640
and it was very comforting
actually, you are here.

01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.940
You can expect trouble
swallowing

01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:57.450
and talking here
elsewhere on the chart.

01:56:57.450 --> 01:56:59.210
Since we can't operate
during treatment,

01:56:59.210 --> 01:57:00.510
you'll need a feeding
tube starting here.

01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:03.870
And I thought, "Oh, my God,
you're not going to be able

01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:05.520
to swallow your food."

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:06.820
So okay, great.

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.120
I said, "I see."

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:10.030
And I just -- I don't know, it
seems like it's all in the news,

01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:11.690
this medical marijuana,
miracle [inaudible].

01:57:11.690 --> 01:57:12.990
I live in Virginia.

01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:14.670
It's going to be last
state in the union

01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:15.970
that [inaudible] marijuana.

01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:18.660
But I said, "What about
medical marijuana?"

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:21.340
And he says, "Look, I
don't want to be known

01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:23.250
as the doctor who
prescribes pot."

01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:24.830
So it's all about reputation.

01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.130
And I get it.

01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:28.450
"And the last thing I need
is a paranoid patient calling

01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:29.870
the office."

01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:31.690
And I tried to make
the case here.

01:57:31.690 --> 01:57:33.380
I argued, "Look, I'm
already losing weight.

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:35.150
I understand Drabinol,
I've done all my research,

01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:36.730
which every doctor
hates probably.

01:57:36.730 --> 01:57:38.580
It stimulates the appetite.

01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.330
Because already my
pants were falling off.

01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:42.290
So I had to drill
extra holes in my belt.

01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:44.220
My co-workers said,
"Hmm, you might want

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:45.520
to get that checked out."

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:48.340
Anyway, he said, "Rest assured,
you'll get whatever you need

01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.640
to get you through this."

01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:50.940
So I found that very comforting.

01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:55.710
So here we are, morning
sunrise on the Ganges, goats,

01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:57.550
interacting with the
folks from [inaudible].

01:57:57.550 --> 01:58:00.980
This was done on a budget,
I want to emphasize,

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:02.280
a backpacker's budget.

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.580
We only flew to where
there weren't roads,

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:06.210
or where there were bandits,

01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:09.020
or 1,000-drop off
cliffs or something.

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:11.680
So mostly by train.

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.980
Okay. Here we go.

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:17.110
This was another quote,
excuse me, "We're all dying.

01:58:17.110 --> 01:58:19.360
Cancer patients just
have more information."

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.100
And there may be some comedy
in that, a little dark humor,

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.400
I know, but it's true.

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:25.730
You've got all the
information in the world.

01:58:25.730 --> 01:58:27.450
You've got every test in the
world coming at you and saying,

01:58:27.450 --> 01:58:28.990
"You can expect to
live this long.

01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:30.780
This percentage, you've got
all these stats coming at you."

01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:32.080
It's like, "Okay.

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.380
I can -- ."

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:34.680
It's the first time
in your life,

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:35.980
and your only time
probably ever,

01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:37.280
you'll have that much insight
into your own mortality.

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.580
And here's some healing bowls

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.250
where they're dinging
in the sides.

01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:43.770
They call her the
camel whisperer.

01:58:43.770 --> 01:58:46.130
This camel had some issues from
being mistreated in the past.

01:58:46.130 --> 01:58:47.430
She was calming it down.

01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:51.030
The castle on the right
was 3,500 years old

01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:54.220
when Alexander the Great
unsuccessfully attacked it.

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:56.310
Just to give you
perspective timewise here.

01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:57.610
We're just here for
a short journey.

01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.660
And whatever we can do to make
that journey more worthwhile

01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:04.070
or extend the journey, make
a positive impact on others,

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:06.320
I think that's the
name of the game.

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.460
Okay. Food.

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:11.280
I'm in the ENT's office
mid-treatment, I'm emaciated,

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:12.770

to sustain weight.

records, she's reviewing them

01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:19.740
and showing substantial
weight loss plus the current

01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:21.040
medications I'm on.

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.440
First question, "All right.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.310
Who prescribed the marijuana?"

01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:26.920
I said, "Well, Dr. so and
so, but he asked me not

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.220
to broadcast that fact.

01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:29.520
I insisted on it.

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.820
It was my idea.

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:33.920
I was feeling that an
appetite stimulant might help."

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.770
She's a short-statured
woman, but 100% no nonsense.

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:39.450
She looks me in the
eye, points directly

01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:40.750
at me, she's up like this.

01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:43.580
She says, "I want
to see proteins,

01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:48.340
I want to see carbohydrates,
I want to see fats."

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:51.200
So she was trying to, in
her way, fatten me up.

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.500
[inaudible] stage.

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.800
We didn't -- yeah.

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.170
Okay. Okay, now, my thoughts
on exploitation of elephants

01:59:57.170 --> 01:59:59.470
for tourist purposes
have evolved since this.

01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:00.770
I wouldn't do it again.

02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:02.490
But they do, in fact, like
being covered with chalk,

02:00:02.490 --> 02:00:06.230
and European girls rubbing
their noses and whatnot.

02:00:06.230 --> 02:00:07.530
It's calming for them.

02:00:07.530 --> 02:00:08.830
Here are the kids at
the end of it all.

02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:11.210
Okay. It's 2017, it's
the little guy's turn.

02:00:11.210 --> 02:00:12.510
We go to Iceland.

02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:14.780
My first trip back to Iceland
since the Chernobyl days.

02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:16.240
Blue Lagoon.

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:18.650
Yes, that military
cargo plane that crashed

02:00:18.650 --> 02:00:21.060
on a black sand beach in 1973.

02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:23.610
One of my yoga instructors
said to me

02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:25.850
that you enter life
taking a breath,

02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:28.080
and you leave life
breathing, or breath out.

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.510
And so everything in
between is really a gift.

02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:34.900

with the waterfall.

my life and helping me out.

02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:41.820
So we've had quite a morning.

02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.330
And I think I delivered
on my pledge.

02:01:45.330 --> 02:01:49.840
You've been stimulated,
informed, entertained.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.210
And, really, it's been revealed

02:01:52.210 --> 02:01:55.780
to you just what an
integral part each

02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:57.670
of the people represented
here play

02:01:57.670 --> 02:02:02.100
in this whole journey,
this whole Moonshot.

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:06.910
This is trajectory that we
are taking to overcome cancer.

02:02:06.910 --> 02:02:10.830
Time for questions and answers.

02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:13.620
I've heard so many things.

02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:17.820
And John sort of brings it
home, because John and Juanita

02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:22.310
as patient advocates represent
the why in all of this.

02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:25.300
Why are Dr. Tsang, Dr. Platz

02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:28.020
and Dr. Bates doing
what they're doing?

02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:30.090
And these are the why.

having heard the full plethora

of things going on, anyone

02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:46.990
with a burning question before
I pose one to the panel?

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:24.680
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz:
That's a great question.

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:25.980
Is this on?

02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:27.280
Can you hear me?

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.580
Okay. Terrific.

02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:31.780
If we think about ecology,
and think about survival

02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:34.400
of a species, if you have all

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.430
of the animals being exactly the
same from a genetic perspective,

02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:41.720
and there's something
catastrophic that happens,

02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:43.020
all of the animals could die.

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:46.930
But if there's more variability
in the characteristics

02:03:46.930 --> 02:03:50.310
of those animals, some
may die, some may live.

02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:53.560
We actually think it's the
same thing in the cancer cells.

02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:56.250
If they have different
telomere lengths,

02:03:56.250 --> 02:03:59.790
they may have other changes that
are correlated, and maybe some

02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:02.410
of those cells are more likely
to live, which is a bad thing

02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:04.350
in the case of cancer,
versus those

02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:06.040
that are more likely to die.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:07.660
And so we think it's
related to that.

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:09.680
And I should, I guess,
be clear when I talked

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:12.730
about telomere shortening
and chromosomal instability,

02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:15.180
why is chromosomal
instability important

02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:17.480
in the context of cancer?

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:20.930
Well, when you have
chromosomal instability,

02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:25.390
there's also higher chances
of there being crossing over,

02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:29.500
exchanges of pieces of DNA,
which then increases the risk

02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:32.690
of cancer becoming
even more aggressive.

02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:35.070
So we think it's
probably a marker.

02:04:35.070 --> 02:04:37.750
It may be involved in the
cancer process, but, certainly,

02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:42.340
it's marking just more
aggressive subsets of cells.

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:45.980
Now, the stromal cell, a
shorter telomere length,

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.480
that's an interesting question,
too, because it turns out that

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.800
that relationship
was independent

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.320
of the cancer cell relationship.

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.650
Together they give
us information,

02:04:53.650 --> 02:04:56.290
even more information
than either one alone.

02:04:56.290 --> 02:04:58.950
But when we look separately
at the variability in length

02:04:58.950 --> 02:05:02.530
in the cancer cells and at the
length in the stromal cells,

02:05:02.530 --> 02:05:05.320
they both provided
independent information.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.080
So what is a hallmark
of an aging cell

02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:10.770
that maybe a senescence?

02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.190
Shorter telomeres.

02:05:12.190 --> 02:05:15.130
Well, what is it about
senescence stromal cells,

02:05:15.130 --> 02:05:16.890
for example, senescence
fibroblasts

02:05:16.890 --> 02:05:20.100
that may influence
cancer progression?

02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:22.580
Well, it turns out some
of those fibroblasts,

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:24.850
when they're senescent, they
change what they elaborate,

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.530
they change what they secrete.

02:05:26.530 --> 02:05:30.540
And in some cases they
start secreting cytokines,

02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:32.580
which ordinarily immune cells
would produce, but we're talking

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:33.880
about fibroblasts now.

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.800
And they might also
secrete survival factors.

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.290
And so if you have short
telomeres in the stroma

02:05:41.290 --> 02:05:43.220
that could be related
to senescence

02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:47.870
and this phenotype called the
senescence associated secretory

02:05:47.870 --> 02:05:49.850
phenotype, which then
acts on those cancer cells

02:05:49.850 --> 02:05:51.500
to make them even
more aggressive.

02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.190
So it's a great question
that you asked.

02:05:53.190 --> 02:05:54.490
Yeah. Thank you.

02:05:54.490 --> 02:05:57.800
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And
that sort of is underscored

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:02.010
by a quote attributed
to William Osler saying,

02:06:02.010 --> 02:06:04.880
"Worry not for the
individuality of patients.

science and not an art."

back here.

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz:
I'll take this one,

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.640
too, if that's all right.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:55.190
So for many years we had a field
called nutritional epidemiology,

02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:57.890
where we tried to
identify individual foods,

02:06:57.890 --> 02:07:01.620
individual nutrients, and
sometimes food patterns,

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:05.220
that are associated either with
an increased risk of cancer, or,

02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:06.610
more importantly, protection

02:07:06.610 --> 02:07:07.910
against the development
of cancer.

02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:11.180
And I think we've come
to a point where we think

02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:14.830
about more a general
pattern of lifestyle

02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:18.430
as being potentially beneficial,
not just for protection

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:21.090
against cancer, but protection
against other chronic diseases,

02:07:21.090 --> 02:07:22.460
like cardiovascular disease.

02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:28.850
So the general strategy
that is probably appropriate

02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:31.230
for everyone is don't smoke.

02:07:31.230 --> 02:07:32.870
I know that's not food,

02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:34.400
but that's the number
one cause of cancer.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:35.700
Don't smoke.

02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:39.650
The second one is
avoid weight gain.

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:43.960
And if you've already
gained weight, lose weight.

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:47.380
So many cancers are
related to obesity.

02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:50.120
And, certainly, there's now
emerging evidence that those

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:55.860
who have cancer and are gaining
weight during that timeframe --

02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:57.530
now I know, John,
you were telling us

02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:59.790
about massive weight loss
that you experienced,

02:07:59.790 --> 02:08:03.500
but for some cancers that is
not the typical situation.

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:09.510
And so those who gain weight
just because of dietary factors,

02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:12.120
have a higher risk
of later recurring,

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:16.100
even after they apparently
were cured following treatment.

02:08:16.100 --> 02:08:19.100
So don't smoke, avoid
weight gain,

02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.840
lose weight if you've
gained too much weight.

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:23.710
And then eat a well-balanced
diet.

02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:25.750
And so the old story
of everything

02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:28.480
in moderation is
probably the right answer.

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.900
Big trials that have tried

02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:35.600
to test individual supplemental
nutrients, so selenium,

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:37.980
vitamin E, have failed.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.280
Right. They haven't
protected against cancer.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:44.140
Except in those who
are truly deficient.

02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:45.560
So looking in subgroups,
every now

02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:48.240
and then there are
patterns that are found.

02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:50.720
But most people living
in the U.S. are replete,

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:52.100
they're not deficient.

02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:55.890
So making sure that your
diet is very well balanced,

02:08:55.890 --> 02:08:57.850
eating fruits, eating
vegetables.

02:08:57.850 --> 02:09:00.940
You know, the logic of eating
colorful fruits and vegetables

02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:04.090
so you get a wide
array of nutrients.

02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:05.540
Not overdoing meat.

02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:08.270
And, John, you said
you're a vegetarian.

02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:09.970
There are many other
sources of protein

02:09:09.970 --> 02:09:11.270
that are non-animal-based.

02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:13.440
And that's absolutely
appropriate, too.

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.190
Avoid eating, basically,
empty calories.

02:09:17.190 --> 02:09:18.490
Right? You don't
want to gain weight,

02:09:18.490 --> 02:09:21.200
so you want to make
sure you eat foods

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.430
that are providing
nutrients, not just sugars.

02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:27.080
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: I saw
something recently, though,

02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:28.980
that said that "junk food,"

02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:33.590
processed food was
not good for you.

02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:35.580
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz: So IARC,
the International Agency

02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:38.670
for Research on Cancer, has
concluded that a certain type

02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:42.700
of processed food, which is
processed meat and red meat,

02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:45.510
is supported as a risk
factor for colorectal cancer.

02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:49.250
So it's not to say that there
aren't some specific factors

02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:51.120
that are agreed to, but,
in general, we just want

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.310
to make sure that we
minimize the chance

02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:56.680
that we develop cancer,

02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:59.170
these sort of bigger picture
strategies are appropriate.

02:09:59.170 --> 02:10:00.470
And, by the way, processed meat,

02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:02.450
do you know what
processed meat includes?

02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:03.750
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Bacon.

02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:05.050
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz: What's that?

02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:06.350
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Bacon.

02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:07.650
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz: Bacon.

02:10:07.650 --> 02:10:08.950
Bacon, yeah.

02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:10.250
Lunchmeat.

02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:11.550
Right? Nitrates, nitrites.

02:10:11.550 --> 02:10:15.090
And then also there's some
laboratory-based evidence,

02:10:15.090 --> 02:10:19.570
not so much human
evidence, that meats cooked

02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:22.580
at high temperature may --

02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:24.700
well, actually they do produce
mutagens, so that's clear

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:26.000
that they're mutagenic.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.700
But it's unclear if the
amount that we typically eat

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:32.440
of grilled food, meats I mean,
cooked at high temperature,

02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:34.240
whether those are
cancer risks or not.

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:41.260
&gt;&gt; Juanita Lyle: From
the patient's standpoint,

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:46.110
John and I both shared the
fact that I didn't smoke,

02:10:46.110 --> 02:10:49.600
I didn't do any of the
things to get cancer.

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.890
I had a very good diet,
did all the right things,

02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:55.980
but I got cancer anyway.

02:10:55.980 --> 02:11:01.410
But one of the things
that, because I'm now,

02:11:01.410 --> 02:11:05.780
from the first time that I
had cancer, 42 years ago,

02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.750
stage 3 breast cancer,
one of the things

02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:15.160
that my doctor told me is the
reason why my survivorship is

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.790
such after having
cancer four times was

02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:23.000
because I had a good
diet, I did fitness,

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.580
I did all sorts of things.

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:27.520
So diet does help.

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:29.230
Even though you might
get cancer,

02:11:29.230 --> 02:11:31.610
it does help your survivorship.

02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:34.230
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Okay.

02:11:34.230 --> 02:11:36.750
Well, thank you.

02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:42.750
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:44.420
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz: Yeah,
that is a good question.

02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.640
So that is an emerging
area of research.

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.900
So trying to understand how the
microbiome influences cancer

02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:53.440
development, and
then, given cancer,

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.090
how that might influence
progression

02:11:57.090 --> 02:11:59.720
in long-term survival.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:05.520
So probably the most studied
location of the microbiome

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:11.520
for men and women together
is the gut microbiome.

02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.730
So, again, it's an
emerging area.

02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:18.740
We don't have consensus yet.

02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:23.210
Typically, what's been looked
at is the variety of bacteria

02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:27.930
that are present, as well as
sort of the general amount

02:12:27.930 --> 02:12:31.500
of each type, or the
proportions present.

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:35.240
We don't have final
details, like I said,

02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:38.900
yet for the gut microbiome
and colorectal cancer.

02:12:38.900 --> 02:12:44.580
There's some, of course,
information on the cervix.

02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:47.270
Right? We understand
HPV, but not bacteria.

02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:50.770
Right? So a virus, we understand
that relationship very clearly.

02:12:50.770 --> 02:12:54.750
But are there other
bacteria that may be present

02:12:54.750 --> 02:12:56.710
in the [inaudible]
that relate to risk?

02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:58.480
That's an area of study.

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.830
For men, understanding
the bacterial environment

02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:04.860
that may influence
prostate cancer risk.

02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:06.190
That's an area of active study.

02:13:06.190 --> 02:13:09.050
But I'd say at this time we
don't have clear evidence

02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:10.870
that the microbiome, in general,

02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:13.810
is protective or
a cause of cancer.

02:13:13.810 --> 02:13:16.140
There's great variability
in moment

02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.160
to moment in one's microbiome.

02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:20.190
And, typically, the kinds of
studies that we do that are

02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:23.880
in large cohort-type studies,
where you might have 50,000,

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:27.330
100,000 people in it, we,
typically, only have the money

02:13:27.330 --> 02:13:29.560
to measure at one point in time

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.990
to collect the right
specimens and measure once.

02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:35.890
And, really, what you'd
want is long-term exposure,

02:13:35.890 --> 02:13:43.060
not just in adulthood, but
perhaps earlier in life.

02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.250
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And talking
about translational medicine,

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:48.080
a lot of people have
translated that information

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:55.820
into overindulging in prebiotics
and probiotics, and a number

02:13:55.820 --> 02:14:00.900
of different microbiome
containing foods.

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:03.310
So everything, again,
in moderation.

02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:08.060
And we have to be sure that
we aren't overdoing it just

02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:09.840
because we hear one story.

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:13.120
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz:
That's right.

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.510
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Any other
questions from the audience?

02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:18.270
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:20.070
Please.

02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:47.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:48.340
&gt;&gt; John Tsang: Thank you.

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:49.640
Yeah, that's another
good question.

02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:53.880
So I actually visited
Watson a few years ago,

02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.490
and they showed me
sort of, at that time,

02:14:56.490 --> 02:14:58.000
the most recent progress.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.610
And at the time, my
understanding was that they,

02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:03.430
basically, ingested, right,
and digested I suppose, too,

02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:07.120
knowledge-wise, a lot
of the information

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:08.460
in clinicaltrials.gov.

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.200
So a lot of, basically,
textural,

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:13.230
natural language-based
information sources.

02:15:13.230 --> 02:15:17.540
And then they tried to develop
tools to help oncologists

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.250
to make sense of the, for
example, mutational profiles

02:15:20.250 --> 02:15:24.860
that you saw from Susan, because
often they would get, basically,

02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:30.670
gigantic amounts of
information for each patient,

02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:43.740
especially those who
went through a lot

02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:47.770
of sequencing studies and other
types of OMiCC's analysis.

02:15:47.770 --> 02:15:59.070
So the idea is to integrate
the existing knowledge

02:15:59.070 --> 02:16:02.460
with this individualized
information, basically.

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:08.190
And I think it made some
good progress at the time,

02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:12.600
especially in terms
of reducing --

02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:28.000
sort of shrink the space through
which the oncologist had to look

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.660
through in terms
of the information.

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:36.490
Right? But I think the
major challenge remains,

02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:45.180
which is that a lot of
those gene mutations,

02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:51.280
and also expression profiles --

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:56.990
and we don't have much
information out there yet.

02:16:56.990 --> 02:17:02.430
So drawing on existing databases
and existing publications

02:17:02.430 --> 02:17:07.370
on what these complex
profiles could mean,

02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:12.230
it's through a daunting
challenge, basically.

02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:16.170
And especially in terms
of combining them,

02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:25.570
because you may look at one
mutation and look at a couple

02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:28.270
of mutations, and
you can say, "Well,

02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:34.190
this looks like it
may predict this."

02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:38.330
But together, how they
all give you information

02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:46.090
on how the patient will do in
terms of therapy and response

02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:51.430
to therapies, it's still
very difficult, basically.

02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:56.820
So I think we need a
lot more data, in a way,

02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:02.710
to start to discover
some of the associations,

02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:08.250
starting with associations,
and then eventually getting to,

02:18:08.250 --> 02:18:09.550
hopefully, causation as well.

02:18:09.550 --> 02:18:10.850
Yeah.

02:18:10.850 --> 02:18:12.150
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: And I would
just add one thing to that.

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:15.080
That was a very good
answer actually for that.

02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.420
The problem with the
mutation profiles is

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:18.720
that it's quite variable.

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:20.740
One cancer type will
have anywhere

02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:22.210
from 20 mutations per tumor,

02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:26.790
to another cancer type may
have 300 or even 3,000.

02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:28.420
So when you have
that, you have to say

02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:31.340
which of these are relevant.

02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:36.810
And you really have a difficult
time figuring that out.

02:18:36.810 --> 02:18:40.830
The pancreatic cancer
example I gave you

02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:46.330
where we have a founder mutation
from the very beginning,

02:18:46.330 --> 02:18:50.820
that's highly likely
to be important.

02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:56.610
But it doesn't mean that
when we have a drug for it

02:18:56.610 --> 02:19:03.600
that that will work, because by
then you've accumulated other

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:04.900
changes in the cancer.

02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:06.540
Every single time
you make a discovery,

02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:09.270
you have to validate it
in the clinic with a drug.

02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:11.720
And so it becomes a very
time and long process.

02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:15.740
You can make a prediction,
but then you have to be able

02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:17.090
to target it to make
a difference.

02:19:17.090 --> 02:19:18.390
So that's why it
should be a Moonshot.

02:19:18.390 --> 02:19:19.690
That's a great way to think

02:19:19.690 --> 02:19:20.990
about precision medicine,
including immunology.

02:19:20.990 --> 02:19:22.290
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And I wanted
to direct a question to you,

02:19:22.290 --> 02:19:23.590
Dr. Bates, because
pancreatic cancer,

02:19:23.590 --> 02:19:24.890
though the numbers are
swollen in terms of incidence,

02:19:24.890 --> 02:19:26.190
it is a growing incidence
of pancreatic cancer.

02:19:26.190 --> 02:19:27.490
And maybe, particularly for our
audience, the patient advocates,

02:19:27.490 --> 02:19:28.790
we're getting feedback from
patients who are survivors.

02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.090
How can we help in terms
of improving the database

02:19:30.090 --> 02:19:31.390
that you have to do some of
the research that you're doing

02:19:31.390 --> 02:19:32.690
with pancreatic cancer?

02:19:32.690 --> 02:19:33.990
What things can help and
maybe stimulate funding

02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:35.290
of that $50,000?

02:19:35.290 --> 02:19:36.590
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Exactly.

02:19:36.590 --> 02:19:37.890
That's a really good question.

02:19:37.890 --> 02:19:39.190
I mean, I think it's
important for patients

02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:40.490
of pancreatic cancer to try
to go on clinical trials.

02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:41.790
That's been something of
a challenge, because many

02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:43.090
of the -- I showed you
two lines of therapy.

02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:44.390
What we don't have is a
third line of therapy.

02:19:44.390 --> 02:19:45.690
So patients will be still fit
enough for a new treatment

02:19:45.690 --> 02:19:46.990
at the end of the two
lines of treatment,

02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:48.290
and we don't have one.

02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:49.590
So that's the point
in which we need more

02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:50.890
and different clinical trials.

02:19:50.890 --> 02:19:52.190
But it's difficult to get
patients onto clinical trials.

02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:53.490
There's a movement to try

02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:54.790
to improve the eligibility
criteria,

02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:56.090
to decrease how tight it is.

02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:57.390
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Right.

02:19:57.390 --> 02:19:58.690
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Many
patients have problems

02:19:58.690 --> 02:19:59.990
with liver test abnormalities,

02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:01.290
or they were getting a
treatment just last week,

02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:02.590
and don't really want to wait
six weeks to go on the next one.

02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:03.890
So there needs to be more
work done to make it easier

02:20:03.890 --> 02:20:05.190
to get cancer patients of all
types, but, in particular,

02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:06.490
pancreatic cancer
on clinical trials.

02:20:06.490 --> 02:20:07.790
You need to be able to pick
up the phone, and have them

02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:09.090
on a trial the next week.

02:20:09.090 --> 02:20:10.390
That's a huge unmet need.

02:20:10.390 --> 02:20:11.690
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Is
there any ongoing work

02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:12.990
at any level to enhance that?

02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:14.290
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: To?

02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:15.590
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles:
To get patients

02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:16.890
into these clinical trials?

02:20:16.890 --> 02:20:18.190
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Yeah.

02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:19.490
I mean, well, there are
clinical trials everywhere.

02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:20.790
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: But in terms
of bringing them in, and --

02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:22.090
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Yeah.

02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:23.390
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Informing
the community at large?

02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:24.690
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: I mean, NCI has
developed a lot of platforms

02:20:24.690 --> 02:20:25.990
where you can search

02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:27.290
for clinical trials,
clinicaltrials.gov --

02:20:27.290 --> 02:20:28.590
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Right.

02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:29.890
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Has
gotten very good.

02:20:29.890 --> 02:20:31.210
And I actually tell patients
to start looking at it,

02:20:31.210 --> 02:20:34.620
start lining up what
we're going to do next.

02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:37.900
That would really
be the best thing.

02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:42.590
I think that information
is out there.

02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:47.060
It just requires some
energy to come up with it.

02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:48.360
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Yes.

02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:52.610
I've been struck by just reading
about translation medicine.

02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:57.080
And it struck me that what
you said about immunotherapy,

02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:00.490
because, of course,
that is a thing now.

02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:04.030
Immunotherapy's supposed to
do it all for almost anything.

02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:05.330
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Incorrect.

02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:07.470
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And clearly
that's not always the case.

02:21:07.470 --> 02:21:10.540
And one of the things I
was reading also was from,

02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:13.500
I think it was the
Microbiology Society,

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:16.590
which said we're
doing all of this

02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:19.940
with translational medicine, but
we cannot forget basic science.

02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:22.810
We cannot forget those
foundational pieces

02:21:22.810 --> 02:21:24.520
that lead you to
do the research.

02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:27.920
And so that sort of resonated
when you made your statement

02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:29.720
about dealing with
the small molecules

02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.560
and not just with immunotherapy.

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:36.800
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Yeah, that is a
flaw of medicine is that we tend

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.580
to -- when something
works, it's not medicine.

02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:44.520
It has to do with profits and it
has to do with where people --

02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:47.420
investors don't want
to invest in failure.

02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:52.090
So they will invest in
companies that are more likely

02:21:52.090 --> 02:21:55.760
to make the second of the
drug that already worked,

02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:57.680
than they are to invest

02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:00.810
in something that's
completely unknown potential.

02:22:00.810 --> 02:22:03.500
And if there were one
thing we could change

02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:07.520
about the research paradigm, it
is so much driven by investors

02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:11.600
and by pharmaceutical companies.

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:13.590
So that's why I showed
you that list

02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:15.120
of ten different [inaudible] --

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.420
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: The same --

02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:17.720
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: Inhibitors.

02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:19.020
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Area.

02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:20.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: We
do not need that.

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:21.620
We have, I think,

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:22.920
four [inaudible]
FDA-approved, maybe five.

02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:26.270
So somehow that paradigm
needs to change.

02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:30.210
But that's virtually impossible
to keep people from investing

02:22:30.210 --> 02:22:34.810
in what was already proven,
already proven therapies.

02:22:34.810 --> 02:22:36.960
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: So for
any young investigators

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:39.590
and researchers in the
audience, you heard it.

02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:40.890
Go ahead, please.

02:22:40.890 --> 02:22:42.190
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:43.990
Please.

02:22:43.990 --> 02:23:02.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:05.910
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: You
mean radiation therapy?

02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:07.210
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz:
[inaudible] radiation.

02:23:07.210 --> 02:23:08.510
Yeah. Do you want to -- sorry.

02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:09.810
You go ahead.

02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:11.110
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: No,
I mean [inaudible].

02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:12.410
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Platz:
We'll both do it.

02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:13.710
So I'm an epidemiologist.

02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:15.010
So I'm not an oncologist.

02:23:15.010 --> 02:23:16.310
I'm not a urologist.

02:23:16.310 --> 02:23:18.560
So it depends on the
patient's situation.

02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:22.690
So it may depend on how
many cores were positive.

02:23:22.690 --> 02:23:25.190
So, typically, 12
cores are taken.

02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:28.300
If only one core is positive
and only a tiny percentage

02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:32.880
of that core is cancer,
and the morphology,

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:35.700
typically called
the Gleason score,

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:39.770
if the Gleason score is
low and the man's older,

02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:42.000
he and his provider may decide

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.560
to do something called
active surveillance.

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:47.670
If the man is young,
maybe he's 50 years old,

02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:50.220
he and the provider might
make a different decision.

02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:53.320
That man may not want to
undergo active surveillance.

02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:57.490
That man may want to have a
prostatectomy, with the idea

02:23:57.490 --> 02:24:00.960
that the surgeries done
with curative intent.

02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:05.870
If more cores are positive
and a greater proportion

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:09.320
of the core is positive, and
the Gleason sum is higher,

02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:11.700
which is a poorer prognostic,

02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:14.080
especially if that
man is an older adult

02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.240
and he has many comorbidities,
that man

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:19.200
and the provider may together
discuss radiation therapy.

02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:23.110
So it highly depends on
the clinical situation

02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:28.010
of the patient, the man's own
values, and what he cares most

02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:31.420
about for his other
aspects of his life.

02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:36.560
So it's not is it prostatectomy
or is it radiation therapy.

02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:41.000
There's far more that goes into
the conversation and decision.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.400
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: And there are
clinical trials currently.

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:48.000
They're open where you can
enroll and be randomized,

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.420
one versus the other,
or you can choose

02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:52.510
and then the data is collected

02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:55.530
versus patients show
undergo surgery.

02:24:55.530 --> 02:24:57.350
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Okay.

02:24:57.350 --> 02:24:58.650
Please.

02:24:58.650 --> 02:25:01.740
&gt;&gt; John Bauer: Is there
international sharing

02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:04.470
of information with
other countries

02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:06.550
who may have a different
funding paradigm for research

02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:08.510
that you can build on?

02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:09.810
&gt;&gt; Susan Bates: There's a lot

02:25:09.810 --> 02:25:12.290
of international
sharing [inaudible] a lot

02:25:12.290 --> 02:25:15.630
of other countries, because
they have a more centralized

02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:19.060
healthcare system, actually
do a better job than we do

02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:22.220
of developing clinical
paradigms that ought

02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:24.940
to be followed for treatment.

02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:30.560
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Well,
one last question and we're

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.380
at the end of our program.

02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:35.150
&gt;&gt; Juanita Lyle: Now, I
would just like to say

02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:39.950
about clinical trials, the
good of clinical trials,

02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:44.790
because I was placed in a
clinical trial back in 1977.

02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:49.660
And there were 814 of us
women who had breast cancer.

02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:52.790
And there is probably
less than two-thirds

02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:56.310
of those women who
are now living.

02:25:56.310 --> 02:26:00.830
And in that clinical trial, one
of the things that made me go

02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:04.470
and do the clinical
trial was simply

02:26:04.470 --> 02:26:07.500
because you're followed
so closely.

02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:11.510
And a lot of people had the fear
of going into a clinical trial,

02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:14.090
but it's a bigger
benefit to going

02:26:14.090 --> 02:26:18.210
into the clinical trial rather
than just going as a patient,

02:26:18.210 --> 02:26:22.140
taking all of the chemotherapy
and doing radiation,

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.760
because it's a powerful
situation

02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:27.580
where you can actually
talk to your doctor

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:31.040
on a level that's totally
different, I think,

02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:33.190
than if you're not
in a clinical trial,

02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:36.790
because everything is
being tracked so closely.

02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:42.790
So I would say for anybody
here who is in that situation,

02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:46.710
clinical trial is a real
benefit to the patient.

02:26:46.710 --> 02:26:50.380
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: We
get a lot of questions

02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:54.430
about the clinical trial
possibilities by cancer patients

02:26:54.430 --> 02:26:56.350
at the Library of Congress.

02:26:56.350 --> 02:27:00.050
And often the question
comes to me.

02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:04.340
So over 30 years I was
dealing with cancer patients

02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:07.040
as a clinical pharmacologist.

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:10.280
And I didn't think this
progress is coming.

02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:15.220
And I'm so excited about the new
change and the future progress.

02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:17.510
Thank you so much for coming.

02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:21.620
