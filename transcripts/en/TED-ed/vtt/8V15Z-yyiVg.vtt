00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:08.875
Conventional wisdom about diets,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.036
including government 
health recommendations,

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:13.771
seems to change all the time.

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.895
And yet, ads routinely come about

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:19.917
claiming to have the answer 
about what we should eat.

00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:22.781
So how do we distinguish 
what's actually healthy

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.516
from what advertisers just want us
to believe is good for us?

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:30.533
Marketing takes advantage of
the desire to drop weight fast,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.892
and be stronger,

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:32.665
slimmer,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.047
and brighter.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:37.656
And in the big picture, diet plans
promising dramatic results,

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:39.495
known as fad diets,

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:43.644
are just what they seem:
too good to be true.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:46.116
So where do diet fads even come from?

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:47.794
While the Ancient Greeks and Romans

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:52.231
rallied behind large-scale 
health regimens centuries earlier,

00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.530
this phenomenon began in earnest
in the Victorian Era

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.025
with crazes like the vinegar diet

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.958
and the Banting Diet.

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.248
Since then, diets have advised us 
all sorts of things:

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:06.110
to excessively chew,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.939
to not chew at all,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.161
to swallow a grapefruit per meal,

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.061
non-stop cabbage soup,

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:14.247
even consumption of arsenic,

00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:16.825
or tapeworms.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:19.780
If the idea of diet crazes 
has withstood history,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.108
could this mean that they work?

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:24.682
In the short term, 
the answer is often yes.

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:26.157
Low-carbohydrate plans,

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:29.182
like the popular Atkins 
or South Beach Diets,

00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:32.312
have an initial diuretic effect.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:35.628
Sodium is lost until the body
can balance itself out,

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:39.063
and temporary fluid weight loss may occur.

00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:42.584
With other high-protein diets,
you might lose weight at first

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:44.670
since by restricting your food choices,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.893
you are dropping 
your overall calorie intake.

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:53.396
But your body then lowers 
its metabolic rate to adjust to the shift,

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:55.838
lessening the diet's effect over time

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:59.959
and resulting in a quick reversal
if the diet is abandoned.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.987
So while these diets 
may be alluring early on,

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:06.879
they don't guarantee long-term benefits
for your health and weight.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.967
A few simple guidelines, though,
can help differentiate between

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:13.927
a diet that is beneficial 
in maintaining long-term health,

00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:17.410
and one that only offers temporary
weight changes.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.983
Here's the first tipoff:

00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:22.234
If a diet focuses on intensely cutting
back calories

00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.621
or on cutting out entire food groups,

00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:27.219
like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates,

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.597
chances are it's a fad diet.

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:32.218
And another red flag is ritual,

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.532
when the diet in question instructs you
to only eat specific foods,

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:38.523
prescribed combinations,

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.621
or to opt for particular food substitutes,

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:45.130
like drinks, bars, or powders.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.768
The truth is shedding pounds
in the long run

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:51.235
simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution.

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:54.808
Not all diet crazes tout weight loss.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:03:00.313
What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,
and other body-boosting solutions?

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.893
Marketing emphasizes the allure

00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:05.852
of products associated with ancient 
and remote cultures

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.878
to create a sense of mysticism
for consumers.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.414
While so-called superfoods,
like blueberries or açaí,

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:14.958
do add a powerful punch of nutrients,

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.979
their super transformative qualities
are largely exaggeration.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.525
They are healthy additions 
to a balanced diet,

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:26.873
yet often, they're marketed
as part of sugary drinks or cereals,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:30.059
in which case the negative properties
outweight the benefits.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.307
Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation

00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:35.950
since they can assist 
with jumpstarting weight loss

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.033
and can increase the number of fresh
fruits and vegetables consumed daily.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.803
Scientifically speaking, though,

00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:45.058
they've not yet been shown to have
either a long-term benefit

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:51.047
or to detox the body any better than
the natural mechanisms already in place.

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:52.497
Everywhere we look,

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:55.263
we're offered solutions 
to how we can look better,

00:03:55.263 --> 00:03:56.646
feel fitter,

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:58.674
and generally get ahead.

00:03:58.674 --> 00:04:00.223
Food is no exception,

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:04.686
but advice on what we should eat is best
left to the doctors and nutritionists

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.812
who are aware of our 
individual circumstances.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:11.388
Diets and food fads 
aren't inherently wrong.

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:14.380
Circumstantially, 
they might even be right,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.527
just not for everyone all of the time.
