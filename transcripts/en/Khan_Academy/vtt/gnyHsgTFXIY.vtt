00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.080
So we have this bar chart here.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.580
This says Scores on
Midterm and Final Exams.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.330
So this axis, the vertical
axis, is the scores.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.890
And then it's by student.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.160
And the blue bar is the
midterm, and the yellow bar

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.320
is the final.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070
And the question they ask
us is by how many points did

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.660
Nadia's score improve from the
mid-term to the final exam?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.639
So let's look at Nadia.

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:23.430
So this is who we're
talking about-- Nadia.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.500
And we care about how
many points did she

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.540
improve from the
midterm to the final.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.340
Midterm is blue,
final is yellow.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.460
So on the midterm, it
looks like she scored--

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.980
and if I were to eyeball
it, it looks like 75 points.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.030
And on the final, it
looks like she scored 80.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
It looks like she
scored 85 points.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.435
So it looks like her score
improved by 10 points,

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.690
so 10 points.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.890
Let's try one more.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.870
How many students improved
their scores from the midterm

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.530
to the final exam?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.780
So to improve from the
midterm to the final, that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.830
means that the yellow
bar for a given student,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.710
which is the final, is going to
be higher than the midterm bar.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.876
That's the only way you can
improve from the midterm

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:04.670
to the final.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.740
So Brandon improved from
the midterm to the final.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.550
Vanessa improved from
the midterm to the final.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.720
Daniel improved from the
midterm to the final.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.180
Kevin improved from the
midterm to the final.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.850
William got a lower score on
the final than the midterm,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.784
so he did not improve.

00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:20.950
So the number of students
that improved their scores

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.910
from midterm to final are
one, two, three four students,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.873
so 4 students.
