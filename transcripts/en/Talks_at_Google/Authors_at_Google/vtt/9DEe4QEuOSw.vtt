00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.310
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.080
The man I'm here to
introduce and interview

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.600
really needs no
introduction as you can

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.940
tell by how full the room is.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.850
But I'm going to
give him one anyway.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.530
According to Wikipedia--

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.540
--professor Richard
Dawkins is a pathologist,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.567
evolutionary
biologist, and writer.

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:22.400
He's also made a bunch
of documentary films.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.510
Unlike President Obama,
Professor Dawkins

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.436
actually was born in Kenya.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:30.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
His father was a civil servant
in the British Colonial Service

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.540
in what is modern day Malawi.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.170
He studied zoology
at Oxford where,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.810
after a stint at UC Berkeley,
he returned to teach.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.430
During this period, he wrote
his first popular book,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.950
"The Selfish Gene."

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.170
In this work, he argued strongly
that natural selection does not

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.600
occur at the species
population or individual level,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.250
but rather at the
gene level itself.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.280
In 1995, after several more
successful publications,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.010
he was appointed to be
the Simonyi Professor

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.030
for Public Understanding
of Science, which

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.010
is a position created
by Charles Simonyi,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.307
the man behind Microsoft Office
and the Hungarian notation they

00:01:08.307 --> 00:01:09.015
use at Microsoft.

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:11.515
So all you ex-Microsoft
folks that are here.

00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:13.890
And the position was created
with the express requirement

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.500
that Professor Dawkins
be its first holder.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.900
He wrote many popular
science books, including

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.720
"Climbing Mount Improbable"
and "The Ancestor's Tale,"

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.767
in which he took
complicated concepts,

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.600
like the probabilities
involved in evolution

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.183
and the connection
of common ancestors

00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:29.040
with humans and other
species, and made

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.790
them understandable
to the average reader.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.930
One might say that he
organized some information

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.330
and made it more accessible.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.670
RICHARD DAWKINS: That's
an in-group [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.627
MALE SPEAKER: So our
mission here at Google

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:45.210
is to organize the
world's information

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.810
and make it more
accessible and usable.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.430
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Well, my mission

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.770
is to make morality
intelligently designed.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.496
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.360
MALE SPEAKER: Professor
Dawkins started

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.080
to attract a lot more
widespread attention,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.455
for better or for worse, with
the publication of "The God

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:00.930
Delusion" in 2006,
which was sort

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.436
of more of a full frontal
assault on religion.

00:02:05.436 --> 00:02:07.560
In it, he argues that God
almost certainly does not

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.949
exist and gives many
explanations for why

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.830
he believes it's harmful
to hold such beliefs

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.610
and why they're not necessary to
explain, for example, morality.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.095
He followed up this book with
"The Greatest Show on Earth,"

00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.800
in which he gathered together
a massive amount of evidence

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.390
for evolution,
again, making it very

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.000
accessible to a lay reader.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.210
I actually really,
really love this book.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.457
I found it truly inspiring.

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:32.040
It really made it
clear to me just how

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.287
overwhelming the case is for
evolution by natural selection.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.120
I remember finishing
the book on an airplane

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210
and sitting there just
for the rest of the flight

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.031
just sort of in awe of
just how strong the case is

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.030
for evolution, how much
evidence we've gathered.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:51.940
In 2006, he also founded The
Richard Dawkins Foundation

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.790
for Reason and Science, which
is a nonprofit organization

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.560
dedicated to promoting
scientific literacy

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.142
and secularism.

00:02:58.142 --> 00:02:59.600
Specifically, he
wants to encourage

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.551
us to use our critical thinking
skills in our day-to-day lives

00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:04.800
and allow secular views to
be more welcome in politics

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.977
and policy making.

00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:09.310
Professor Dawkins retired
from the Simonyi Professorship

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.410
in 2008, since which he's
written a book directed

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.740
at children, "The Magic of
Reality-- How We Know What's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.047
Really True," which,
I must add, is also

00:03:16.047 --> 00:03:17.088
delightfully illustrated.

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:21.840
I've been saving this one.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.620
I think it's about time I
let my daughter read it.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.290
She's got a bunch of questions
that are answered directly

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.660
in that book.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.860
So the book he's here to
promote is "Brief Candle

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.540
in the Dark-- My
Life in Science,"

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.050
which is the second part
of a two-volume memoir.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.080
The first book, "An
Appetite for Wonder,"

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.234
is about his childhood,
youth, and time up

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:40.650
until he wrote
"The Selfish Gene."

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.076
So please join me in welcoming
Professor Richard Dawkins.

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:46.482
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.380
So I got all dressed up.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.600
It's not our usual
attire, as you can see.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.140
I wore my tie that
actually has species names

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.297
written in Latin on it.

00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:02.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:03.850
And, as I was looking
through your book,

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.349
I noted that you had
a passage about how

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.890
the ties that you
do wear when you do

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.080
wear a tie are all designed
actually by your wife.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.330
RICHARD DAWKINS: That is true.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.480
She paints silk.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.774
So every one of my ties
is a one-off unique tie.

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:19.190
I think she should
be selling them

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.900
for very large sums for
particular occasions

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.654
like golden weddings
to rich nerds from--

00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:28.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.940
--never, otherwise,
wear a tie at all

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.610
as I can see looking
around the room.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.340
Unfortunately, my ties are
all in the suitcase, which

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.820
is in the back of the car.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.420
And I couldn't get it out.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.170
So no tie today.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.160
It's the only occasion on this
trip where there is no tie.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.520
And that's in honor of Google.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.497
MALE SPEAKER: So the story about
how you met your wife actually

00:04:50.497 --> 00:04:52.830
kind of ties back to a bunch
of things that folks here--

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.705
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:57.400
Perhaps I might read a
little passage on that.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.570
Do you have the page number?

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.300
Here we are.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.520
"This was 1992
when Douglas Adams

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.440
reached his 40th birthday.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.850
And his party was memorable
for a particular reason.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.240
It was there that he introduced
me to the actress, Lalla Ward,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.540
whom he had known from
the days when "Doctor Who"

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.580
was at its wittiest because
he was the script editor.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.800
And she and Tom Baker gave
added value to the wit

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.390
by their inventively ironic
playing of the two leading

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.930
roles.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.600
At the birthday party, Lalla
was talking to Stephen Fry

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.340
when Douglas led me
over and introduced us.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.410
Douglas and Stephen are
both absurdly much taller

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.050
than Lalla and me,
so it was natural

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.580
that we should find
ourselves facing

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.580
each other under a Gothic arch
formed by Douglas and Stephen

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.040
as they exchanged lofty
witticisms high above us.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.280
Through the archway,
I shyly offered

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.820
to refill Lalla's glass.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.680
And when I returned, we
rapidly reached agreement

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.990
that the party was too
noisy for conversation.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.470
'I suppose by any faint chance,
it wouldn't just possibly be

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.830
a good idea to go out for a
quick meal and, of course,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.850
return later.' We discreetly
slipped away and found

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.470
an Afghan restaurant
off the Marylebone Road.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.380
That Lalla had read
"The Selfish Gene"

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.520
and watched my Christmas
Lectures was gratifying.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.450
That she had read "The
Extended Phenotype" and Darwin,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.750
as well, was too
good to be borne.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.390
I subsequently discovered that,
in addition to Doctor Who's

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.270
companion, she had played
a beautiful Ophelia

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.030
to Derek Jacobi's "Hamlet"
in the BBC TV production

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.120
and was also a talented
and versatile artist,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.800
published author,
and book Illustrator.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.730
As I said, too good to be borne.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.870
We didn't return to the party."

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.640
Miriam Rothschild is a very
distinguished biologist

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.840
and member of the immensely
wealthy Rothschild family.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.320
And she's a great character.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.880
She lives in a house
deep in a wood, which

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.390
looks like a kind of fairy tale
house covered with creepers.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.620
You need a machete to find it.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.630
And her garden consists
of wild weeds and grasses

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.720
breaking against
the house like waves

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.700
and going into the
French windows like waves

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.280
coming inside the house.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.010
She has an annual
dragonfly party,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.340
which is to celebrate
her conservation measures

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.770
of dragonflies around her lake.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.276
It's a very large party with
about 80 people, I suppose.

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:36.500
And one year, she said, come
and sit by me, dear boy.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.220
But, first, go and carve
me a slice of venison--

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.620
a very small slice, mind.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.620
I'm a strict vegetarian.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.630
And the scarf story
was that she's

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.960
the world authority on fleas.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.710
And so Lalla was trying to
raise money for a charity

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.886
that she runs, which is
called Denville Hall.

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:59.880
It's an old people's
home for old actors.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.420
And so I encouraged her
to paint an enormous silk

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.370
scarf, a gigantic silk scarf,
because Miriam Rothschild wears

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.140
silk scarves.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.880
And she painted nine
different species of flea,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.080
hugely magnified images
of fleas on this scarf.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.240
And I sent it off
with a covering note

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.880
explaining about the charity.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.190
And, eventually, Dame
Miriam wrote back and said,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.309
"I shall keep the handkerchief,
but tell your wife

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.010
that she has sadly
underestimated

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.530
the penis of the male flea."

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.510
"As you know, it is
proportionately the largest

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.520
in the animal kingdom."

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.630
And she wrote a generous
check to the charity,

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.010
and accompanied it with her
own book on flea micro-anatomy,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.100
inscribed to Lalla
with a note that said,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.864
"See page 272 for
vagina of mole flea."

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:00.748
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.800
MALE SPEAKER: So people
often perceive you

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.610
as being sort of
cold and calculated.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.742
But, in this book, there are
a lot of stories that you have

00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:14.250
that are very sentimental
and emotional.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.139
In particular,
one that struck me

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:23.730
involved an experiment that
you were talking about,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.820
having to do with
vision of the human eye.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.630
I was wondering if you
might tell us about that.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.740
RICHARD DAWKINS: I was
invited in the early 1990s

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.630
to give the Royal
Institution Christmas

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.650
Lectures for children.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.230
This started out in
the 1820s, founded

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.350
by Michael Faraday, who
gave the lectures himself

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.340
on many occasions.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.730
They've now become
five one-hour lectures

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.970
around Christmas
time every year.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.120
And one scientist is
invited to give them.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.540
Nowadays, they're televised.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.950
It's quite an
intimidating thing.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.170
The whole thing is very
highly choreographed.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.600
There's a tradition
starting with Faraday

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.730
that you don't have
slides, or very few slides.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.440
Instead, you call
the children out

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.224
to assist with demonstrations,
rather like conjurers do.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.980
"In lecture five, I was talking
about a revealing difference

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.810
between two ways in which
the retinal image can move."

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.990
If you shut one eye, and
poke-- you don't even

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.000
need to shut the one.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.390
Poke the other eye
with your finger.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.470
You see the world move as
if there's an earthquake,

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.480
not surprising because the
retinal image is moving.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.750
But if you swivel your eyes
around in their sockets using

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.550
the muscles that are
supposed for that purpose,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.330
then you don't
see an earthquake.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.850
The world appears to be still.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.840
You're just looking at
a different part of it,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:53.170
even though the retinal image is
moving in the same kind of way.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.710
In one case, you
see an earthquake.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.970
In the other case, you don't.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.930
Well, there's a theory
about why this happens

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.550
due to some German
workers, which

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.040
is that when you give the
order-- when your brain gives

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.930
the order-- to the eye to
move around in the normal way,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:13.470
swiveling in the socket, the
brain sends a copy of the order

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.390
to the perceiving
part of the brain

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.470
and tells the brain to
expect the world to move.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.750
And so, since there's
no discrepancy

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.890
between the expected movement
and the observed movement,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.330
the world appears to be still.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.840
On the other hand, when
you poke your eyeball,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.320
the copy doesn't go.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.690
There's no copy that says,
expect the world to move.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.860
So you do see it as if
there was an earthquake.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.740
So that's the background.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.470
"I pretended I was going
to demonstrate the effect

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.290
with a key experiment.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.400
I would paralyze the
eyeball-moving muscles

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.020
with an injection.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.380
Then, when the brain sent an
order to move the eyeball,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.100
the eyeball would stay still,
but the copy of the instruction

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.730
would still be issued.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.430
So the person would see
an apparent earthquake,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.140
even though the
eyeball hadn't moved

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.010
and nor had the world,
the apparent movement

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.450
being the discrepancy between
the expected and actual

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.420
observed zero eye movement.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.040
This being the Christmas
Lectures, the next thing to do

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.280
was to call for a volunteer."

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.680
"I produced a huge veterinary
hypodermic syringe,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.010
fit to sedate a
rhinoceros and asked,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.080
'Who would like to take part
in the experiment?' Normally,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.570
the children at the Royal
Institution Lectures fall over

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.010
themselves in their eagerness
to assist in demonstrations.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.970
Surely, nobody would
volunteer in this case.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.580
And I was about to
reassure everyone

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.950
that it was only a joke when
one little girl of seven,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.940
probably the youngest
in the audience,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.980
hesitantly raised her hand.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.540
It was my darling daughter,
Juliet, sitting shyly

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.390
by her mother.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.410
I still choke up a
little at the memory

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.640
of her uncomprehending
loyalty and courage

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.640
in the face of the
monstrous hypodermic

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.960
that I was brandishing.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.862
Is it irrelevant that she is
now a promising young doctor?"

00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:14.320
MALE SPEAKER: So
one of the reasons

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.903
that that touched
me so much is I have

00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:17.970
a 6 and 1/2 year old daughter.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.500
And a lot of questions
are coming up

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.940
in how I raise her
around this age.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.150
One of the things
that happened recently

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.461
was we're planning a trip
to Vietnam and Cambodia.

00:13:31.461 --> 00:13:32.960
And one of the
things we want to see

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.820
is the Temple of Angkor Wat.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.100
And when we went to
talk to her about this,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.090
she didn't understand
what a temple was.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.190
And, suddenly, my wife and
I were sort of on the spot.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.310
How do we teach our
daughter about religion

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.756
without actually
teaching her religion,

00:13:52.756 --> 00:13:55.121
because that seems important?

00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.288
And I was wondering if you
had any thoughts on that.

00:13:57.288 --> 00:13:59.412
RICHARD DAWKINS: It's a
very important distinction.

00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:01.800
You can't get away from
teaching a child about religion

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.140
because the child would be
illiterate in the world today.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.540
You couldn't understand
European history, for example,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.630
unless you understand that many
of the wars in European history

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.490
have been between
Protestants and Catholics.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.260
You can't understand
contemporary history

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.290
unless you understand
about Islam,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.830
and Sunnis and Shias
and things like that.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.810
You can't really take your
allusions in English literature

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.730
unless you know
biblical references.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.720
So you've got to teach
children about religion.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.020
But to indoctrinate a child
in a particular religion

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.720
and tell a child-- a
six-year-old child--

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.890
tell a six-year-old child,
you belong to this religion.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.485
And, therefore, you believe in
this, this, and this and not

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:45.750
that, that, and that.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.790
That's child abuse.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.160
Tying a label around
a child's neck

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.730
as belonging to the same
religion as its parents

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.700
is child abuse.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.320
Yet, we all do it.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.330
We all quite happily--
we would never say,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.640
this is a logical
Positivist child,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.780
or this is an
Existentialist child.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.650
This is a Hayekian
Monetarist child.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.180
Nobody would dream
of saying that.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.885
And, yet, we're quite happy
to talk about a Catholic child

00:15:12.885 --> 00:15:14.960
or a Muslim child.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.520
I read a story only a
week ago of a mother.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.840
She had just given birth.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.440
And the midwife held up
the baby to the mother

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.540
and said "What religion is he?"

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.630
And the mother said, "Isn't he
a little bit too young to know?"

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.286
MALE SPEAKER: So also,
reading through the book,

00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:37.702
I noticed a lot
of things actually

00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:40.800
that made me think about
what we do here at Google.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.985
One of the things
that came to mind

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.360
is the fact that,
here at Google,

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.680
we're sort of working at
the forefront of machine

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.000
translation.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.230
And you had several anecdotes in
your book about the experiences

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.770
you've had trying to
translate your books and how--

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:57.645
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:15:57.645 --> 00:16:00.100
MALE SPEAKER: --that
worked or not worked.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.420
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well,
the first experience I had

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.750
was the German translation
of "The Selfish Gene."

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.610
I had a letter from
a woman in Germany

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.040
who said that the
translation was

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.780
so good that it was though
author and translator were

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.537
twin souls.

00:16:18.537 --> 00:16:20.370
I thought that was
wonderful, so I looked up

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.535
the name of the German
translator, Karin de Souza

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:27.214
Ferreira.

00:16:27.214 --> 00:16:28.630
Not exactly the
sort of name you'd

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.750
expect of a German
translator, but never mind.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.130
I was immensely impressed.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.980
And I told the story to a German
Swiss colleague, Hans Kummer,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.870
a famous primatologist.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.220
And I'd only got as far
as saying twin souls.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.380
I didn't mention her name.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.910
I just got as far as twin souls.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.120
And he pointed his finger at
me and said Karin de Souza

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.002
Ferreira?

00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:52.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:55.150
I thought that was a pretty
good recommendation, a kind

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.930
of independent recommendation.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.090
I haven't always been so lucky.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:07.170
When the Spanish translation
of "The God Delusion" came out,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.069
I received three
independent letters

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:12.760
from Spanish-speaking people
who also spoke good English say,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.335
"It was so bad, it was probably
done by Google Translate."

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:19.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.770
In other words, literal
translations of idioms.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.140
But I must say that the Spanish
publishers manned up and agreed

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.090
to destroy that edition,
and withdraw it,

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.400
and commission an entirely new
translation, which I'm told

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.320
is very good.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.226
So if you're interested
in the Spanish version,

00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:48.640
get the more recent one.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.690
MALE SPEAKER: So
also of interest

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.505
to some of the
folks here, I read

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:57.730
that for "The Selfish Gene,"
you actually wrote your own word

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.730
processor to write that?

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.105
RICHARD DAWKINS: Oh, that was
for "The Blind Watchmaker,"

00:18:01.105 --> 00:18:01.790
yes.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.000
I feel rather ashamed of
this because it really

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.560
is rediscovering the
wheel, not entirely.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.330
I mean, I had an Apple
II computer at that time.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.600
And the standard word
processor supplied by Apple

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.580
was called Apple Writer.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.230
And there were no
lowercase letters.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.110
It was all uppercase letters.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:28.910
And uppercase was represented
by a reversal of color.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.969
And there was no
proper wrap-around.

00:18:30.969 --> 00:18:32.385
I mean, it was
really pretty poor.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.010
It didn't wrap around properly.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.710
So I did actually write
my own word processor,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.170
which was called Scrivener.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.677
And it was an immense
labor, as you could imagine.

00:18:44.677 --> 00:18:46.260
I mean, you're all
professionals here.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.000
You can knock it
off in a weekend.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.950
But, for me, it took probably
the best part of a year,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.710
and then I wrote
one book with it.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.200
And that was that.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.100
So I was addicted at that
time to computer programming.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.390
I expect many people here
understand about the addiction.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.830
And I would sort of
stay up all night,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.326
and not eat, and not sleep,
and things like that.

00:19:13.326 --> 00:19:15.450
MALE SPEAKER: It's not
uncommon amongst programmers

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.230
to think that you're creating a
tool you're going to use over,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.355
and over, and over again
only to find that you only

00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:21.166
used it the once.

00:19:21.166 --> 00:19:22.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:25.080
RICHARD DAWKINS: Douglas Adams
has a very good satire on that.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.850
He was well aware
of the syndrome.

00:19:31.459 --> 00:19:33.500
MALE SPEAKER: So one of
the other things going on

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.786
in the conversations
that we have at

00:19:34.786 --> 00:19:36.390
Google right now--
I know a lot of you

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.320
are talking about interviewing.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.970
And one of the things that we've
been talking about as regards

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.629
interviewing is trying to
make the interview more blind.

00:19:45.629 --> 00:19:48.170
So when we write our interview
feedback, not including things

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.470
like whether the candidate
was a woman or a man,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.370
that sort of thing.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.082
And what made me
think of this was

00:19:56.082 --> 00:19:57.540
there's a passage
in the book where

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:03.305
you talk about the importance
of double-blind experiments.

00:20:03.305 --> 00:20:04.180
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.410
MALE SPEAKER: And I
remember, as a grad student,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.540
preparing papers to be reviewed
in a double-blind format, which

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.910
always just seems
like such a chore.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.320
But it turned out, it's actually
really, really important.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.899
And you touch on how important
double-blind evaluation is.

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:26.440
RICHARD DAWKINS: It's immensely
important in medical research

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.070
where it's so easy to be fooled.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.700
And scientists now have to
be alive to the possibility

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.440
that they are being fooled by
what they want to discover.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.050
They desperately
want to get a result.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.690
And, with the best
will in the world,

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.730
it's very hard not
to be influenced.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.270
So, I mean, I demonstrated
this in a television program

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.290
where we were looking at
water divining, dowsing.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.630
And, since it was
television, we got

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.000
a lot of volunteers, people who
were life-long practitioners

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.370
of dowsing, water divining.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.410
And they all were
absolutely confident

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.110
that they could do
it, but they'd never

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.110
been tested in double-blind
conditions before.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.540
So, first of all, we
had a tent, and there

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.490
were lots of buckets of water.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:18.477
And they were walking
over the buckets of water.

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:20.560
Or some of the buckets had
water, and some of them

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.030
didn't, of course.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.870
And when they could see
the water, their hazel

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.245
twigs, or whatever it
was, dipped down exactly

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:28.870
as they should.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.660
And it all went fine.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.840
And then we did it blind.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.840
So there was no clue as
to where the water was.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.927
Even the experimenter
didn't know

00:21:38.927 --> 00:21:41.010
where the water was because
he might inadvertently

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.910
have given the game away.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.070
The person who had
laid out the buckets

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.274
did so and then left
and went 100 yards away

00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:49.940
to the other side of
the tent so that he

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.990
couldn't give any clues.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.490
And not a single one
of these dowsers--

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.810
from all over the
country, not a single one

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.090
scored above charts level.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.200
They were devastated.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.420
One of the women actually
broke down in tears.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.509
She'd never been tested in
double-blind conditions before.

00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:09.050
There was another
story, which I tell

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.900
in the book, of a
double-blind trial

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.180
of a diagnostic technique,
which is used by some quacks

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.410
to test the efficacy of
some certain substances.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.760
I once actually did this myself.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.025
I'd [INAUDIBLE] my neck,
and it was weekend,

00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:30.650
so I couldn't go to
my ordinary doctor.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.990
So I thought I'll go to an
alternative practitioner.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.200
And the first thing she did was
to do a diagnostic test, which

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.450
was to kind of arm wrestle me.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.450
I was lying on my back.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.260
And she was testing the
strength of my arm against hers,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:51.430
with and without a sealed
bottle of vitamin C on my chest.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.090
And she showed, to
her satisfaction,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.610
that when the sealed bottle
of vitamin C was on my chest,

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.810
I was weaker-- sorry,
I was stronger.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.430
So when I sort of expressed
my skepticism, she said, yes!

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.410
See, it's a marvelous
vitamin, isn't it?

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.880
But then I told a
story in the book

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.690
of another very
similar test using

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.780
the same arm
wrestling technique,

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.850
again, testing a substance.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.130
This time, it was whether
fructose or glucose

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.810
was put on your tongue,
whether it made you stronger.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.520
And in double-blind
conditions, there

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.770
was, of course, no difference.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.300
It didn't show any effect.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.330
And the homeopath or whatever
he was who was doing the test

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.380
said, "You see?

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.190
This is why we don't
do double-blind trials.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.320
They never work!"

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.204
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:42.050
MALE SPEAKER: I know
when I was preparing

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.870
the introduction to
this, for instance,

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.310
I was thinking about my
recollection of "The Greatest

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.149
Show on Earth," and having read
it on the plane and so forth.

00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:51.440
But then when I actually went
looking through my books,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.789
I found that it was
"The God Delusion" that

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:56.208
had the boarding pass in it.

00:23:56.208 --> 00:23:57.011
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.011 --> 00:23:58.636
RICHARD DAWKINS:
False memory syndrome.

00:23:58.636 --> 00:23:58.980
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.160
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yeah.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.700
MALE SPEAKER: And I had
somehow managed to-- I

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.455
mean, I was completely convinced
that what had not happened,

00:24:05.455 --> 00:24:06.650
had happened.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:12.190
And you mention that in
regards to recounting

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.410
an interaction with the
late Christopher Hitchens.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.201
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Christopher Hitchens and I

00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:20.214
were having a debate in London
with three religious types.

00:24:20.214 --> 00:24:21.380
And so they were over there.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.088
And we were here.

00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:22.730
I was here.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.880
Christopher was there.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.660
And the philosopher,
A.C. Grayling, was there.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.880
So we were very close together.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.760
And, at one point, one of the
religious people, Rabbi Julia

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.240
Neuberger, said something
irritating or silly.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.860
And Christopher Hitchens
interrupted and said, "How dare

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.450
you?

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.620
How dare you?"

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.830
Except that he didn't.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.010
It's a false memory.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.220
I remembered it
extremely clearly.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.550
And I still remember
it extremely clearly.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.400
I used it in a eulogy speech
that I gave after his death

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.650
in Melbourne.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.580
I told the story.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.440
And only quite recently
when checking up

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.960
to write the story
down in this book,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.380
I looked at the YouTube
video of the event.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.700
And it didn't happen.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.630
What did happen was that Rabbi
Neuberger was interrupted.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.360
She said something which he
did interrupt but much more

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:26.997
quietly.

00:25:26.997 --> 00:25:28.330
And he didn't say, how dare you.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.940
He said something
much more gentle.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.120
He did say "how dare you"
about half an hour later

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.670
to a member of the audience
who asked a silly question.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:46.800
And he said that, although
he didn't believe in God,

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.600
he thought of himself
as a Christian

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.650
because he was a moral person.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.131
Christopher said,
"How dare you!"

00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:54.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.330
Well, that's bad enough
that I had a false memory.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.930
Then I was telling the
story of my false memory

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.577
to Anthony Grayling,
the philosopher,

00:26:02.577 --> 00:26:04.910
because I thought he would
be interested in false memory

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.770
syndrome, which, indeed, he was.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.970
But when I told him the
story, his jaw dropped.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.070
And he said, but I had
exactly the same false memory.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.250
And it occurred to me
that in courts of law,

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:24.180
for example, juries value
eyewitness testimony

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.290
above all other
kinds of evidence.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.180
And imagine a lawyer
saying "I put it

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.650
to you, ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, that two university

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.650
professors both independently
had a false memory

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.150
of an event which took place
not two yards from where

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.690
they were sitting."

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.400
But there's a sequel to
the story, which actually

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.570
came after the book was
published and, therefore, is

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.300
not in the book.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.020
The sequel to the story is
that a young woman, I told her

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.050
in a letter about what happened.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.050
And she said that she had the
same false memory from having

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.460
watched the YouTube video.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.730
So she had watched
the YouTube video,

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.520
and she was the third
person who had attached this

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.580
"how dare you" to the
response to Rabbi Neuberger,

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.860
instead of to the right place.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.318
And I told her, well, go back
and look at the YouTube video

00:27:14.318 --> 00:27:15.450
again.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.440
She was actually
rather shattered by it.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.649
Don't trust
eyewitness testimony.

00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:23.690
And probably don't trust
my autobiography either,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.356
for that matter.

00:27:24.356 --> 00:27:26.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.540
MALE SPEAKER: So
one of the things

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.620
I wanted to talk about,
as regards "The Greatest

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:38.170
Show on Earth," in that
book, you compile experiment

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.610
after experiment validating
the claims and hypotheses

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.890
of evolutionary theory.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.630
One of them that really stood
out was the Lenski experiments

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.030
where they actually chart
the evolution of-- I think

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.780
it's a bacterium--

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.740
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Bacterium, yeah.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.465
MALE SPEAKER: --over thousands
and thousands and thousands

00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:56.130
of generations.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.090
And they even stop
it at certain points,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.920
set it aside, and show that they
can reproduce over and over.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.310
And I remember thinking, wow,
this is such a slam dunk case.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.410
But how do you--
something like that

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.800
is only convincing
to somebody who

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.980
has an understanding
of the fundamentals

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.030
of evolutionary theory.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.520
When you're faced with somebody
making an argument like,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.120
if we evolved from monkeys,
why are there still monkeys?

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.540
That belies a complete
lack of understanding

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.680
of even the fundamental--
the sort of stuff

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.365
that should be taught in
middle school, for instance.

00:28:32.365 --> 00:28:33.990
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Well, it's just logic.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.000
You don't need to
be taught that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.110
If Americans come
from Europeans,

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.370
why are there still Europeans?

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:46.180
Somebody said at
lunch, just before.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.790
Yes, I mean, it's a
totally illogical--

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.260
what it stems from is the idea
that evolution is a ladder.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.020
And we're at the
top of the ladder,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.400
and then other apes
are just below us,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.680
and then monkeys are
below that, and so on.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.470
And so it's as though each
time a rung is climbed

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.639
of the ladder, the
one below is kicked

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:06.930
away or something of that sort.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.040
There is no ladder.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.780
It's a branching tree.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.280
Every living creature,
every species

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.785
is the tip of a twig of its
own evolutionary history.

00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:17.660
So there's no ladder.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.860
There's no sense in which we
superseded monkeys or anything

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.670
like that.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:26.420
Monkeys and we both superseded
the common ancestor,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.462
which we share, some
20 million years ago.

00:29:30.462 --> 00:29:31.494
It's as simple as that.

00:29:31.494 --> 00:29:32.910
MALE SPEAKER: One
of the questions

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.870
that my daughter asked me, I
want to say a few months ago,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.746
was, who was the first person?

00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:39.870
And that's actually the
title of the second chapter

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.570
of your book, "The
Magic of Reality."

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.210
And I remember really
struggling to explain

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:50.099
to her the concept that there
really is no first person.

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:52.390
And I was explaining this to
a friend of mine and said,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.230
well, my mom once dragged
me into a paint store

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.360
and showed me the samples
of paint where, on one end,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.570
it was clearly yellow.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.403
And, on the other end,
it was clearly green.

00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:03.870
And then asked me, which
is first green sample?

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.575
But I wouldn't have
thought of that

00:30:06.575 --> 00:30:08.740
to explain that to a child.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.804
So how do you--

00:30:09.804 --> 00:30:11.220
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Well, it's right.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.510
I mean, there never
was a first person.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.070
Every creature ever born
belonged to the same species

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.140
as its parents and its children.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:27.190
So it's just that if you
put enough generations end

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.300
to end, if you start with
us today, and you go back,

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.320
and back, and back,
and back, and back--

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.820
if you go back 300 million
years, then you come to a fish.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.420
But there never
was a transition.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.610
There never was a sudden
transition from any one species

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.840
to any other.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.940
The paint example is
a perfectly good one.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.540
Another one that I use
in "The Magic of Reality"

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.600
is when we grow up,
we start as babies.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.630
And we become toddlers.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.610
And we become children.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.110
And we become teenagers,
and then young adults,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.674
and middle-aged, and then gaga.

00:30:59.674 --> 00:31:00.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.480
But there never is
a sudden transition.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.360
You don't go to bed
one night middle-aged

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.200
and then wake up next
morning and say, oh, I

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.630
seem to be old now.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.470
It's a gradual, gradual change.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.380
And exactly the same
is true of evolution.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.170
It's a matter of
convenience that we

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.690
are capable of
separating or saying,

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.900
this definitely isn't a fish,
and this definitely is a fish.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.920
All the intermediates
are not present.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.180
But it's a category
mistake to say

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.820
that because we distinguish
humans from, say, monkeys,

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.000
there must have
been a first human.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.720
There never was a first human.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.580
It's just a gradual, gradual
transition everywhere you look.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.830
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm going
to change tack a little bit

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.580
and talk more about
your experience

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.140
as a scientist, as a
teacher, and the experiences

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.130
that you had.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.430
For example, in the book, you
talk a lot about your life

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.150
at Oxford.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.747
And, as an American
who's not familiar

00:32:01.747 --> 00:32:03.580
with that institition--
I mean, for example,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.780
I was looking at the
history of the New College.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.581
But by the New, they meant
1379 or something like that.

00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:11.330
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well,
it was new in 1379.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.121
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:32:12.121 --> 00:32:12.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.072
So there are a lot of
traditions, and formalities,

00:32:15.072 --> 00:32:20.050
and so forth that took place
there that would seem foreign

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.190
and, dare I say, bizarre.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.440
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well, it
seemed pretty bizarre to me,

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.190
as well, actually.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.240
MALE SPEAKER: And I
was just wondering

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.940
sort of what sort of influence
did that have on you?

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.280
You talk, for instance,
about the formal dessert

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.630
that you had where everybody
sits in a specific place,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.110
and they pass
around [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.480
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yeah.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.247
Well, these are
rather quaint customs.

00:32:39.247 --> 00:32:41.830
I sometimes suspect they're not
as ancient as you might think.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.390
I mean, they might just go
back to the 19th century,

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.610
for all I know.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.685
But each generation kind
of thinks they're ancient.

00:32:50.685 --> 00:32:51.310
What can I say?

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:55.240
I mean, I had to preside over
this custom of formal dessert

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.260
where you pass around port
and nuts and snuff and things.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.527
When I was Sub-Warden of New
College-- which everybody

00:33:03.527 --> 00:33:05.360
becomes Sub-Warden at
some point-- and there

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.000
was a terrible evening
when I became aware

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.080
of some kind of
ominous rumbling.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.160
And it was a very
distinguished professor

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.820
of philosophy, Michael Dummett.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.430
And he was saying, "I've never
been so insulted in my life.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.680
You have the most
atrocious manners.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.540
You must be an Etonian.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.110
Etonian means somebody who
comes from Eton College, which

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.450
is Britain's most prestigious
and most expensive

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.280
private school.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.910
And the target of his
ire was Robin Lane Fox

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.650
who was a fellow
in ancient history.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.825
Robin was hopping with
anxiety and saying, "But what

00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:47.324
have I done?

00:33:47.324 --> 00:33:48.660
What have I done?"

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.460
And I couldn't work
out what it was.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.880
But I saw to it
in my hostly role

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.520
that they were seated as far as
possible away from each other.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.240
And then, the next
day, I discovered

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.180
what the trouble was.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.570
It had boiled up from
lunchtime the previous day.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.889
And there was some trivial
little minor dispute

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.310
over who should sit where
or something like that.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.989
And Professor Dummett
had harbored this rancor

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.280
throughout the rest of the day.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.480
And it had bubbled up to the
surface until, by the evening,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.000
it boiled over at dessert.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.469
But then, three days
later, he approached

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:26.255
Robin Lane Fox and
most graciously

00:34:26.255 --> 00:34:28.380
apologized and said there
was nobody in the college

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.190
that he would less
wish to insult.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.599
So it all ended up all right.

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:32.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.859 --> 00:34:35.137
MALE SPEAKER: And while
you were at Oxford,

00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:37.261
there was a period of time
when your uncle was also

00:34:37.261 --> 00:34:38.635
a fellow at Oxford.

00:34:38.635 --> 00:34:40.760
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes, my
father's youngest brother,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.020
my Uncle Collier.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.710
He was a wonderful character.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.010
One nice story about him was
that he came back from London

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.020
on the last train to Oxford.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.860
And the car park at
the railway station

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.210
had an arm that you had to put
a coin in the slot in order

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.970
to release your car.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.510
And, at midnight,
the arm had broken.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.710
And so the entire
car park was trapped.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.950
Nobody could get out.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:15.030
My Uncle Collier
was on his bike,

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.750
so it wasn't a problem to him.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:22.440
But showing supreme
altruism, he broke the arm,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.170
and marched up to the
station master's office,

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.130
plunked it outside the
station master's office

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.020
with a note giving
his name and address

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.340
and saying exactly
why he'd done it.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:38.390
And he was prosecuted and fined
for this public-spirited act.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.420
And then, many years
later after his death,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.770
actually, I happened to be going
to visit a rather old professor

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.400
of physics, Nicholas Kurti.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.222
And when he heard my
name, he said, "Dawkins?

00:35:50.222 --> 00:35:51.680
Are you any relation
of the man who

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.140
broke the arm at the station?"

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.570
So I said, "Well, yes.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.540
I'm his nephew.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.440
And he said, "Come.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.960
Let me shake your hand.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.380
Your uncle was a hero."

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.867
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.867 --> 00:36:04.700
I think the other story
you were thinking of

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.610
is he was an expert
in statistics.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.620
He taught statistics
as well as forestry.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.990
So I used to take my own pupils
and ask him to tutor them

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.669
in statistics.

00:36:17.669 --> 00:36:18.460
I didn't take them.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.826
I mean, I went and saw
him to ask if we would

00:36:20.826 --> 00:36:22.520
tutor my pupils in statistics.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.420
And I was doing that
one time in his office.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.120
And I was describing
this young man.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.842
I was saying things like, well,
he's a bit lazy, but he's OK.

00:36:29.842 --> 00:36:32.460
And you'll have to look after
him, make sure he works,

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.160
and so on.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.040
And I noticed that my
uncle was taking notes.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.470
He wasn't taking
notes in English.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:42.040
This was the Department of
Forestry, the Imperial Forestry

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.910
Institute at Oxford, which is
filled with old colonial types

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.740
from all over Africa.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.621
And so I said, well, that's
very confidential of you,

00:36:50.621 --> 00:36:51.620
taking notes in Swahili.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.260
And he said, "Swahili?

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.360
Good god, no.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.740
Everyone in this
department speaks Swahili.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.870
This is Acholi."

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.762
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:02.517 --> 00:37:04.850
MALE SPEAKER: One of my other
favorite parts in the book

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.330
are, basically,
the parts where you

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.621
talk about all the other
books that you've worked with.

00:37:08.621 --> 00:37:13.520
There are a lot of pictures
of colleagues and so forth.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.240
You talk about the debates and
the preferred mutual tutorials

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.920
that you've done
with other folks.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.420
Who would you say
that you've worked

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.690
with in that capacity that's
really had the biggest

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.127
influence on you?

00:37:26.127 --> 00:37:28.460
RICHARD DAWKINS: I like the
idea of the mutual tutorial.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.530
I find that the
debate format is not

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.980
an attractive one,
the format where

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.180
you have 10 minutes
for the proposition,

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.140
10 minutes for the opposition,
three minutes for rebuttal,

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.057
three minutes for
rebuttal, and then a vote.

00:37:41.057 --> 00:37:43.140
I don't think that's the
way you get at the truth.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.730
I like the mutual tutorial
where you have a conversation.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.620
And it doesn't have
to be adversarial.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.990
Sometimes a conversation can
be between people who pretty

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.030
much agree with each other.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:38:00.400
I suppose the best one
for me was Steven Pinker,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.150
the psychologist and linguist.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:05.320
And perhaps it was
the one that gave me

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.540
the idea for the
mutual tutorial.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.920
We had an on-stage conversation
in a London theater,

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.390
about 2,000 people.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.900
It was a very large audience.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.020
And it went very well.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.720
And we learned a
lot from each other.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.990
You sort of raise each other's
game in a funny kind of way.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.620
And precisely because
you're not disagreeing,

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.680
you're actually learning
from each other.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.990
The BBC got to hear
of this, and they

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.420
thought it might be
fun to reprise it

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.159
on television that evening.

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:35.700
So they asked us
would we agree to go

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.390
and have a shortened version of
our conversation on television.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.000
We said yes.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.170
And then the woman
producing it phoned me

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.450
up to plan the program.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:47.560
And she said, "Tell me.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.880
What's the nature of your
disagreement with Dr. Pinker?"

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.180
And I said, "Well, I
don't think we really

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.690
got much of a disagreement.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.190
We seem to agree
about most things."

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:59.550
And she said, "No disagreement?

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.310
No disagreement?"

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.954
She promptly cancelled
the whole thing.

00:39:03.954 --> 00:39:04.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.410
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.400
So as we're getting toward
the end of our time,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.983
I wanted to take a
couple of questions

00:39:09.983 --> 00:39:14.880
off of our submitted
questions list.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.824
The top one we have
right now says,

00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:18.490
"You must have rebutted
them all by now,

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.490
so I'd be curious to know
what, in your opinion,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.720
are the best arguments out
there against evolution

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.690
and the nonexistence of deities?

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.820
Which do you find the
hardest to rebut?"

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.340
RICHARD DAWKINS: Those are
two quite different questions,

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.840
by the way.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.150
There is no decent
rebuttal of evolution.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.010
And there is no decent
argument in favor

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.150
of the existence of deities.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.090
So if I attempt to answer that
question, I'm not in any sense

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.660
admitting that there is a
good argument because I once

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.720
made the mistake of saying the
best argument I could think

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:59.740
of for the existence of a God
would be a deistic God who

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.710
had something to do with the
fine-tuning of the universe.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.410
I think that is probably
the best argument around.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.424
It's still a very,
very bad argument,

00:40:08.424 --> 00:40:09.590
but it's the best one going.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:15.170
But when I said that once in
a debate actually with a man

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.560
called John Lennox, two days
later he was up in Scotland

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.025
giving a lecture on his own.

00:40:20.025 --> 00:40:22.400
And he more or less announced
that I had become a deist--

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:23.715 --> 00:40:26.090
--simply because I had said
out of all the bad arguments,

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.664
this is the least bad.

00:40:27.664 --> 00:40:29.830
And I've since met this
problem over and over again.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.710
That if you say x is
bad, but y is worse,

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.200
people will think you're
condoning x or somehow saying

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.380
that x is a good thing.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.530
So I think the best argument
for the existence of a god

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.452
is the fine-tuning argument.

00:40:44.452 --> 00:40:46.160
But it's still a very,
very poor argument

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.640
because you still
have left unexplained

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.860
where the fine tuner came from.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.860
The best argument
against evolution?

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.535
There isn't one.

00:40:56.535 --> 00:41:01.940
I mean, there's just
no argument against it.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.231
I mean, there are reasons
why people don't get it,

00:41:04.231 --> 00:41:05.480
which is a different question.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.290
There are reasons why
people don't get it,

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:13.860
such as that the time scale
involved is so huge that people

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:19.470
find it difficult to
grasp how long a time has

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.500
been available for the
changes we're talking about.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.100
In a way, Darwin
had it right when

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.120
he pointed to things
like dogs and pigeons

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.160
where we know how
long it's taken.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.140
And actually,
Lenski's bacteria too,

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.770
but Darwin didn't
know that, of course.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.372
It hasn't taken very long to
turn a wolf into a Pekingese.

00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:39.250
And when you think
that that's only

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.430
taken a matter of
centuries, and then you

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:45.240
think that to turn
a fish into a mammal

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.415
has taken not just centuries but
hundreds of millions of years.

00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:52.980
And if you extrapolate
the amount of change

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.470
from wolf to Pekingese
and multiply it

00:41:55.470 --> 00:42:00.180
by the number of centuries there
have been in 300 million years,

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.600
you get an idea of how you
will not grasp evolution

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.550
unless you can somehow get your
mind around these immensities

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.072
of time.

00:42:11.072 --> 00:42:13.280
MALE SPEAKER: It seems like
sort of the same problems

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.550
that we face, which is
obviously not as big of a deal,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.375
in terms of our
society and so forth,

00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:19.385
of getting people
to understand things

00:42:19.385 --> 00:42:21.456
like quantum mechanics
and general relativity

00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:25.138
that our brains are
designed to-- are designed?

00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:26.124
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:26.932 --> 00:42:28.890
--where everything is
middle of the road, and--

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.098
RICHARD DAWKINS: I think
the word "designed" is fine.

00:42:31.098 --> 00:42:34.210
It's just that it's not
designed by an intelligence.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.790
I mean, I think the
remarkable thing

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.310
is that brains which were
designed by natural selection

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:45.050
to survive on the African
savannah as hunter gatherers,

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.170
and to get a mate,
and rear a child,

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:51.590
and avoid being eaten by
lions, fairly simple problems

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:53.750
compared to quantum
theory or relativity.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.820
And yet, those very same brains
have the emergent property

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.570
that they can understand
quantum theory.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.270
I can't, but some people can.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:03.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.890
And it makes me proud to be
a member of the species homo

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.184
sapiens.

00:43:09.184 --> 00:43:11.380
MALE SPEAKER: I'll take
one more off of our list

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.250
here, which is, where do you
see the world 10 years from now,

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:18.315
in terms of belief in myths
versus belief in science?

00:43:18.315 --> 00:43:20.690
It seems that the overall
trends are positive for science

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.990
and negative for myth worldwide.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.281
There is also what seems to
be a backlash, for example,

00:43:24.281 --> 00:43:27.600
the rise of radical Islam
and the anthropogenic global

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.120
warming denial by
many in the US.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.995
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:43:29.995 --> 00:43:32.940
I mean, I think if you look
on the broad sweep of history,

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.970
things are going in
the right direction.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:40.060
If you take poll data in America
and in western and northern

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.032
Europe, things are going
in the right direction.

00:43:44.032 --> 00:43:45.490
In Britain, for
example, the number

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:51.510
of people who ticked the
Christian box in the 2001

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:55.430
census was, I think, 73%.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:59.890
And, in the 2011
census, it was 54%.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:05.400
And my British foundation,
The Richard Dawkins Foundation

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.150
for Reason and Science,
which, by the way,

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.500
is much more
flourishing in America

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.250
and is doing more sorts of
active things in America--

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.550
please join The Richard
Dawkins Foundation for Reason

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.850
and Science in America.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:25.570
But the British foundation did
a further survey of the people

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.160
who ticked the Christian
box in the 2011 census

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.230
and found that actually,
although it's still 54% ticked

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.760
the Christian box, who actually
asked them supplementary

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.910
questions, like, "Is Jesus
your Lord and Savior?"

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.690
and, "Can you pick out
of this list of four,

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.780
what is the first book
of the "New Testament?"

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.230
The number dropped
dramatically below that 54%.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.180
I mean, scarcely any
of them could really

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.070
claim to be proper Christians.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:45:02.840
In America, the number of people
who subscribe to any religion,

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.240
20% don't.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.960
There are 20% of the
American electorate now

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.570
who don't subscribe to any
religion according to polls.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.410
And that's a very high figure.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:17.360
It compares favorably with
any particular religion.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.930
So I think things are moving
in the right direction

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.030
but with dips.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.750
It's a sawtooth rather
than a gradual trend.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:30.140
And, as you say, the
rise of radical Islam

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.340
is a negative trend,
which may take

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.291
a bit longer to get rid of.

00:45:35.291 --> 00:45:36.290
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.230
So, with that, let's
thank our speaker.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:41.730
He's going to be signing books.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.080
Just to remind you, we won't
be personalizing them just

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.009
because we won't have time.

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:48.260
But, yeah, let's
thank our speaker.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.310
[APPLAUSE]
