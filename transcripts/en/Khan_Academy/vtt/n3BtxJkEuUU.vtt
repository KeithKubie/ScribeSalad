00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:04.424
- [Voiceover] Part c, let y
equals f of x be the particular

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:07.040
solution to the differential
equation with the

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.486
initial condition f of
two is equal to three.

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:15.714
Does f have a relative
minimum, a relative maximum,

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:18.767
or neither at x equals two?

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:20.889
Justify your answer.

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.199
Well, to think about
whether we have a realtive

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.258
minimum or relative maximum, we can say,

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.706
well, what's the derivative at that point?

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.633
If it's zero, then it's a good candidate

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.063
that we're dealing with a,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.549
that it could be a relative
minimum or maximum,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.751
if it's not zero, then it's neither.

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.114
And then if it is zero,
if we wanna figure out

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:37.705
relative minimum or relative maximum,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.845
we can evaluate the sign
of the second derivative.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.360
So let's just think about this.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.675
So, we want to evaluate f prime,

00:00:45.675 --> 00:00:49.314
we wanna figure out what f prime of,

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:53.142
f prime of two is equal to.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:56.712
So, we know that f prime of x,

00:00:56.712 --> 00:01:01.576
f prime of x, which is
the same thing as dy dx,

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:05.001
is equal to two times x minus y.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.982
We saw that in the last problem.

00:01:06.982 --> 00:01:10.028
And so f prime of two,
I'll write it this way,

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:14.184
f prime of two is going to be equal to

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:16.064
two times two,

00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:19.121
two times two minus

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.761
whatever y is when x is equal to two.

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.668
Well do we know what y
is when x equals to two?

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.873
Sure, they tell us right over here.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:29.056
Y is equal to f of x,

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.029
so when x is equal to two,

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.664
when x is equal to two,

00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:35.197
y is equal to three,

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.937
so two times two minus three.

00:01:37.937 --> 00:01:40.653
And so this is going to be
equal to four minus three

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:42.128
is equal to one.

00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:47.128
And so since the derivative
at two is not zero,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.081
this is not going to be a
minimum, a relative minimum

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:53.112
or a relative maximum, so you could say

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:58.112
since, since f prime of two,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.514
f prime of two does not equal zero,

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:07.411
this, we have a, f has,
let me write it this way

00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.411
f has neither, neither minimum,

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.274
or relative minimum I guess I could say,

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:19.535
relative min or

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:23.045
relative max

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:26.324
at x equals two.

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:29.064
Alright, let's do the next one.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:32.942
Find the values of the constants m and b,

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:37.487
for which y equals m
x plus b is a solution

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:39.583
to the differential equation.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:41.905
Alright, this one is interesting.

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.078
So let's, actually let's
just write down everything we

00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:47.257
know before we even think
that y equals m x plus b

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:49.903
could be a solution to
the differential equation.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:54.507
So, we know that, we know that dy

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.939
over dx is equal to two x minus y,

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.273
they told us that.

00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:02.281
We also know that the second derivative,

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:07.281
the second derivative of y,
with respect to x, is equal to

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.519
two minus dy dx. We
figured that out in part b

00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:14.333
of this problem.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.269
And then, we could also express this

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.911
we saw that we could also write that

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.599
as two minus two x plus
y, if you just substitute,

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.375
if you substitute this in for that.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.826
So it's two minus two x plus y.

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:29.282
So let me write it that way.

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:33.603
This is also equal to
two minus two x plus y.

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:35.785
So that's everything that we know

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:39.081
before we even thought that
maybe there's a solution

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:42.189
of y equals m x plus b.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.513
So now let's start with
y equals m x plus b.

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:48.924
So if y is equal to m x
plus b, y equals m x plus b,

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:50.547
so this is the equation of a line,

00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:54.996
then dy dx is going to be equal to,

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:57.362
well the derivative of this
with respect to x is just m,

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.007
the derivative of this with
respect to x, this is constant

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:01.576
this is not going to
change with respect to x,

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:02.842
it's just zero.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:03.654
And that makes sense,

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:06.864
the rate of change of y with
respect to x is the slope,

00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:09.460
is the slope of our line.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.163
So, can we use, and this
is really all that we know,

00:04:12.163 --> 00:04:14.233
we could keep, actually
we could go even further,

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.074
we could take the second derivative here,

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:19.177
the second derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:04:19.177 --> 00:04:21.009
Well, that's going to be zero.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.549
The second derivative of
a, of a linear function,

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:25.582
well it's going to be
zero, you see that here.

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.592
So this is, this is all of
the information that we have.

00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:31.350
We get this from the previous
parts of the problem,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.890
and we get this just taking the
first and second derivatives

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.317
of, of y equals m x plus b.

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:41.230
So given this, can we figure out,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.391
can we figure out what m and b are?

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:50.204
Alright, so we could,
if we said m is equal to

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:55.204
two x minus y, that doesn't seem right.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:57.950
This one is a tricky one.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.806
Well, let's see, we know
that the second derivative

00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:03.453
is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:05.542
We know that this is
going to be equal to zero

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:08.317
for this particular solution.

00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:12.149
And we know dy dx is equal to m.

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.717
We know this is m.

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.220
And so there you have it,
we have enough information

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.032
to solve for m.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.011
We know that zero is equal to two minus m.

00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:22.299
So zero is equal to two minus m.

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:25.120
And so we can add m to
both sides and we get

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.120
m is equal to, m is equal to two.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:34.942
So, that by itself, was quite useful.

00:05:34.942 --> 00:05:38.158
And then, what we could say, let's see,

00:05:38.158 --> 00:05:40.933
can we solve this further?

00:05:40.933 --> 00:05:43.497
Well we know that this,
right over here, dy dx,

00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:46.285
this is m, this is m.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.688
And it's equal to two.

00:05:48.688 --> 00:05:52.531
So, we could say that two
is equal to 2 x minus y.

00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:56.455
Two is equal to 2 x minus y.

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.320
And then let's see, if we solve for y,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.342
add y to both sides,
subtract two from both sides,

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:05.152
we get y is equal to two x minus two.

00:06:05.152 --> 00:06:07.328
And there we have our whole solution.

00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:09.973
And so you have your m, right over there.

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:10.952
That is m.

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:14.572
And then we also have our b.

00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:16.819
This one was a tricky one.

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.717
Anytime that you, you have to, ya know,

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:21.761
do something like this and it
doesn't just jump out at you,

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:24.005
and if it wasn't obvious, it
didn't jump out at me at first,

00:06:24.005 --> 00:06:26.007
when I looked at this problem,
I said, well let me just

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:28.260
write down everything that they told us,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.650
so they wrote this before,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.339
and then we say okay this
is going to be a solution.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.701
And so let me see if I
can somehow solve, so,

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:37.057
let's see what I didn't use.

00:06:37.057 --> 00:06:39.867
I didn't use, I didn't use that.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.119
I did use this.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.569
I absolutely used that.

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.669
I did use that, I did use
that, and I did use that.

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.666
So this was a little bit
of a fun little puzzle

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:52.162
where I just wrote down all
the information they gave us

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.484
and I tried to figure out, based on that,

00:06:54.484 --> 00:06:59.255
whether I could figure out m and m and b.

00:06:59.255 --> 00:07:01.143
And this is pretty neat,
that this a solution

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:02.725
two x minus two.

00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.632
If we go to our slope
field above, it's not,

00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:07.027
it wouldn't have jumped out at me.

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.263
But if you think about, if you think about

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:11.300
so two x minus two, it's
y intercept would be

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.356
negative two like that, let me
do this in a different color,

00:07:14.356 --> 00:07:17.717
and so the line would look something,

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:20.405
would like something like this.

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:22.727
The line would look something like this.

00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:25.548
And you can verify that
any one of these points,

00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:28.202
at any one of these points, the slope,

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:33.202
the slope is equal, the
slope is equal to two.

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:36.666
If we're at the point two comma two,

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:39.174
well it's gonna be two
times two minus two is two.

00:07:39.174 --> 00:07:42.680
One comma zero, two times
one minus zero is two.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.268
Negative two comma, or sorry
zero comma negative two

00:07:46.268 --> 00:07:49.240
well, zero minus negative two, that's two.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.202
So you see this is
pretty neat, the slope is

00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:53.570
changing all around it, but this is

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.356
this is a linear solution

00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:57.402
to that original differential
equation, that was,

00:07:57.402 --> 00:07:59.730
that was pretty cool.
