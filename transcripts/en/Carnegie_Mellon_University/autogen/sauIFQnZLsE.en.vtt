00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.760
differences not everyone focuses on
labor costs and the difference in labor

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:50.770
labor costs and the difference in labor
 

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.860
labor costs and the difference in labor
costs but you look at cultural

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:52.870
costs but you look at cultural
 

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.780

differences manufacturing operational

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:54.790
differences manufacturing operational
 

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.790
differences manufacturing operational
differences so we're talking differences

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800
differences so we're talking differences
 

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.670
differences so we're talking differences
in yields in downtimes material quality

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680
in yields in downtimes material quality
 

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.910
in yields in downtimes material quality
material cost those differences are so

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920
material cost those differences are so
 

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.850
material cost those differences are so
significant as that when you model them

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:05.860
significant as that when you model them
 

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.910

we find that they switch the most

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:08.920
we find that they switch the most

the United States when you're looking at

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:16.089
the United States when you're looking at
 

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.260
the United States when you're looking at
this is the hot new emerging technology

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.270
this is the hot new emerging technology
 

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.079
this is the hot new emerging technology
but when you move manufacturing instead

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.089
but when you move manufacturing instead
 

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.410
but when you move manufacturing instead
overseas those economics switch and the

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:25.420
overseas those economics switch and the
 

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.350
overseas those economics switch and the
old technology becomes more economically

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360
old technology becomes more economically
 

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.350
old technology becomes more economically
viable than the new technology and the

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360
viable than the new technology and the
 

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.150
viable than the new technology and the
firms in both of the industries that

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160
firms in both of the industries that
 

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.480
firms in both of the industries that
I've studied follow those economics so

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:36.490
I've studied follow those economics so
 

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.220
I've studied follow those economics so
rational right they move manufacturing

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.230
rational right they move manufacturing
 

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.810
rational right they move manufacturing
overseas they produced the old

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:39.820
overseas they produced the old
 

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.150
overseas they produced the old
technology overseas and they stop

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160
technology overseas and they stop
 

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.400

pushing forward that new technology back

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.410
pushing forward that new technology back
 

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.280
pushing forward that new technology back
in the United States and so the question

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.290
in the United States and so the question
 

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.630
in the United States and so the question
then becomes we'll wait a second as

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640
then becomes we'll wait a second as
 

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.669
then becomes we'll wait a second as

the first thing that I would say as we
 

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.770
the first thing that I would say as we
think about this problem is that I don't

to actually understand what that

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:29.530
to actually understand what that
 

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.040

and how to educate our engineers how to

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:34.510
and how to educate our engineers how to

right now today there are more IT jobs

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:54.620
right now today there are more IT jobs
 

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.470
right now today there are more IT jobs
in the US then there were even at the

00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.480
in the US then there were even at the
 

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.690
in the US then there were even at the
top of the peak of the dot-com boom and

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:01.700
top of the peak of the dot-com boom and
 

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.090
top of the peak of the dot-com boom and
that's been the case for several years

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:04.100
that's been the case for several years
 

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.600
that's been the case for several years
in fact that even though the there's

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:07.610
in fact that even though the there's
 

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.300
in fact that even though the there's
been a explosive growth in this business

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:10.310
been a explosive growth in this business
 

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.090
been a explosive growth in this business
outside of the US the US has also

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:13.100
outside of the US the US has also
 

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.100
outside of the US the US has also
maintained a strong and steady growth

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.110
maintained a strong and steady growth
 

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.280
maintained a strong and steady growth
and continues to so one interesting

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.290
and continues to so one interesting
 

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.350
and continues to so one interesting
itself though is that the number of

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:20.360
itself though is that the number of
 

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.420

in this country is about twenty two

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.050
in this country is about twenty two

thousand a year across all of the US

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:26.540
thousand a year across all of the US
 

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.900
thousand a year across all of the US
universities and that's not really

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:28.910
universities and that's not really
 

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.570
universities and that's not really
enough to sustain growth and in fact a

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:31.580
enough to sustain growth and in fact a
 

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.880
enough to sustain growth and in fact a
lot of companies are having to hire in

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:33.890
lot of companies are having to hire in
 

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.800
lot of companies are having to hire in
foreign countries now not

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:35.810
foreign countries now not
 

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.410

to decrease their labor costs but

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.420
to decrease their labor costs but
 

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.240
to decrease their labor costs but
actually because that's where the talent

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:40.250
actually because that's where the talent
 

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.210
actually because that's where the talent
pool is and so I think one of the

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:43.220
pool is and so I think one of the
 

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.130
pool is and so I think one of the
challenges for our country is again

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:45.140
challenges for our country is again
 

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.980
challenges for our country is again
since our students largely choose what

to then say in what industries in what

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:05.310
to then say in what industries in what
 

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:08.000
to then say in what industries in what
cases is that possible and what cases is

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.010
cases is that possible and what cases is
 

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.160
cases is that possible and what cases is
that not possible today and so the

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.170
that not possible today and so the
 

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.470
that not possible today and so the
example that comes to mind for me is the

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480
example that comes to mind for me is the
 

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.920
example that comes to mind for me is the
photonics industry today Oh or which is

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:15.930

States and move the manufacturing
 

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.599

overseas and so what that would suggest

00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:51.609
overseas and so what that would suggest
 

00:58:51.609 --> 00:58:54.240
overseas and so what that would suggest
is that if we do want to produce these

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.250
is that if we do want to produce these
 

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:55.980
is that if we do want to produce these
new technologies and we do believe

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:55.990
new technologies and we do believe
 

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:58.289
new technologies and we do believe
that's important then there that

00:58:58.289 --> 00:58:58.299
that's important then there that
