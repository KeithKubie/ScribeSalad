00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.890
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.440
is give ourselves a quick
introduction to carbohydrates,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.367
and you might already be
familiar with the notion.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.910
If you look at some packaged food,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.208
there's usually a nutritional label

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:13.730
and will say carbohydrates.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.030
It will tell you a certain
number of grams per serving.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.900
And not all carbohydrates are edible,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.580
but many of the things that we eat

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580
or many carbohydrates are edible

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.470
and many of the foods we eat

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.360
have some carbohydrate component to it.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.550
But what is it actually?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.170
Well, we can look at the
word and we see carbo,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.030
so maybe it has something
to do with carbons.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.250
And it says hydrates,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.470
so maybe it has something
to do with water.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.960
And if you said that,
you'd be pretty close

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.590
because carbohydrates do involve carbons.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.710
In fact, this is a very
typical carbohydrate,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.310
a very simple one right over here.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.350
This is a glucose molecule.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.540
And in gray, you see
that it has six carbons.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.800
And the hydrate part refers to,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.350
that carbohydrates typically
have oxygen to hydrogens

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.940
in the same ratio as you
would expect in water.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.380
So, for every one oxygen, two hydrogens,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.960
and you see that right over here,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.650
where in glucose, you have one, two,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.450
three, four, five, six oxygens

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.870
and you have 12 hydrogens,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.320
and so that's where this word comes from.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.670
Now, another word that is often used

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.142
interchangeably with carbohydrates
is the term saccharide.

00:01:21.142 --> 00:01:25.780
Saccharide, and saccharide
comes from Greek for sweet,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.650
and that makes sense because
if you were to taste glucose,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.290
it would taste sweet to you.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.920
Now, what's interesting
about something like glucose

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.970
is glucose can be a standalone molecule,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.730
a very simple sugar in this case

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.630
or you can build up larger molecules

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.230
with really glucose as a building block.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.340
So for example, right over here,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.260
we have a part of a glycogen molecule.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.093
And as you can see,

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:56.600
it's just a repeating
sequence of glucose molecules.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.320
And so, something like this,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.300
we would call glucose a monosaccharide.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.440
It's one simple sugar right over here.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.400
Monosaccharide.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.800
And we would call this
glycogen a polysaccharide.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.160
Polysaccharide.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.620
Or another way to think about it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.560
is glucose is the building
block for the glycogen.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.070
Another term you might see
is monomer and polymer.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.330
Those are the general terms

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.250
or if I'm building a large molecule

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.380
out of a chain of smaller ones,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.370
the building blocks, we
consider to be monomers,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.220
and then the thing that we
build out of those monomers

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.520
could be our polymer.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.680
And as we'll see, this
monomer polymer phenomenon

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.830
is not limited to
carbohydrates or saccharides.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.080
We're gonna see that same
relationship, for example,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.410
between amino acids and proteins.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.010
Now, what role do carbohydrates play

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.130
inside of biological systems?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.360
Well, saccharides or carbohydrates

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.330
are often associated
with the source energy.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.060
Glucose can be converted

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.970
very quickly to energy
in biological cells.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.720
Glycogen is also a store of energy

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.320
in your liver and your muscles.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.300
And once again, it can be broken down

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.216
into the glucose molecules,
which once again,

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:20.520
is a very readily
available source of energy.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.610
Now, in plants especially,
some of these polysaccharides

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.530
could also play a structural role

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.220
if we're talking about
things like cellulose,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.610
which is another polysaccharide.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.560
So, there's also a structural role.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.850
Now, I will leave you there.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.420
We have focused only on one type

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.220
of monosaccharide in glucose,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.530
and only on one type of
polysaccharide in glycogen.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.010
As we will see, glucose does show up a lot

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.030
but there are many other
types of monosaccharides

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.340
and there are many other
types of polysaccharides.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.870
And polysaccharides in particular are part

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.000
of a broader group of molecules
known as macromolecules.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.030
And as you can imagine,
from the macro prefix,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.120
it's referring to large molecules,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.320
oftentimes that have
thousands of atoms in them.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.440
But don't get the wrong idea.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.610
They're very large at an atomic level

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.980
but each of these circles are still atoms,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.160
so you would still need a very, very,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.190
very, very powerful microscope
to even to take a look

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.990
at even some of the
largest macromolecules,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.420
including polysaccharides.
