In addition to major depressive disorder, there are other depressive disorders

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:09.050
that have milder symptoms, but the key is that they last longer. One of these

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.856
milder forms include persistent depressive disorder, or PDD. Most of the

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:19.666
symptoms of PDD are the same as in major depressive disorder, but they are less

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:25.270
intense in PDD. Also the depressive mood lasts for most of the day and most of

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.899
the time for at least two years. Remember, in major depressive disorder you

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.019
only need to have the symptoms for two weeks. In addition, people with PDD may

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.508
also experience one or more episodes of major depressive disorder during their

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.411
lifetime.
