00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.449
Why Do We Toast Drinks?

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.490
Humans throughout history have made a habit
of basing a great deal of our traditions and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.120
customs around food.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.150
The curious practice of raising our drink
containers is one of the most ancient of these.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.630
To answer your question, for starters, we’ll
dispel a myth.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.560
You may have heard that the tradition of toasting
originated out of a fear of poisoning- the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.259
idea being that clinking two glasses together
would cause the liquid from both to spill

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.419
into one another; thus, the people you’re
drinking with wouldn’t poison you as they’d

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.199
then be poisoning themselves.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.079
As interesting as this historical rumour is,
not surprisingly, there is not a single shred

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.469
of evidence backing up this conjecture.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.149
As to the real origin, because the practice
of honouring through a drink offering seems

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
to have begun in pre-history, it’s hard
to say who first got the idea.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.969
In fact, most ancient societies show evidence
of doing this.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.329
The Ancient Greeks would offer libations to
the Gods as a ritualistic practice, as well

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.120
as make a point of drinking to each other’s
health.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.780
Evidence of this can be found in The Odyssey
when Ulysses drinks to the health of Achilles.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.220
The Romans placed such an importance on drinking
to health that at one point in time the Senate

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.730
passed a decree that stated that all must
drink to Emperor Augustus at every meal.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.640
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire even
describes a feast where Attila the Hun indulges

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.680
in at least three toasts for every course.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.250
The term “toast” itself originated in
the 16th century.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
One of the first written accounts of it was
in Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.470
when the character of Falstaff demands - “Go
fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in’t.”

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.960
To translate, he’s asking for a great deal
of wine with a piece of (literal) toast in

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
it.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.399
I can hear your disgusted outrage and objections
to adding toast to wine, but it was actually

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.540
quite a common practice at the time.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.869
This is thought to be due to the quality of
wine in the past- it was in many cases inferior

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.259
to our modern vintages.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.659
Thus, placing a piece of toast within a jug
was supposed to soak up some of the acidity

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.610
and improve the flavour.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.710
This also had the side benefit of giving people
something to do with a piece of stale bread,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.280
often spiced or with fruit embedded, that
would improve the bread’s palatability.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.350
Up until very recently in history, wasting
food just wasn’t something people tended

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.920
to do, so finding ways to make stale bread
taste good was fairly common- waste not, want

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.920
not.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.550
(This was also more or less how French Toast
got its start.)

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.630
Over the coming centuries, the term “toasting”,
in English, slowly transformed to incorporate

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.850
traditional libations and the honouring of
people.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.010
In the early days of this connection, the
person being honoured often received the physical

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.150
toast saturated with wine at the end.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.610
Toasting became so popular in the 17th and
18th centuries that Toastmasters came into

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.610
being.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.940
Acting as a kind of party referee, they were
there to ensure that the toasting didn’t

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.200
become too excessive and that everyone got
their fair share of toasting opportunities.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.300
This may sound silly, but it was a desperately
needed role.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.550
If left to their own devices, guests would
occasionally go on toasting every individual

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.550
in the room.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.840
(This being a great excuse to drink excessive
amounts of alcohol without seeming like a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.050
lush.)

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.840
Elaborate drinking games soon became interwoven
with the toasting ritual, and most of them

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.700
seem to have been designed to impress the
ladies.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.370
One of the more “charming” examples of
this involves a gentleman cutting himself,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.280
mixing the blood with his drink and then toasting
to his lady of choice in order to prove his

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.340
devotion.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.920
Shakespeare is once again our authority when
it comes to this particular early, bizarre

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.360
toasting practice.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.830
In The Merchant of Venice the King of Morocco
talks of stabbing himself and then laments

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.780
-
“I stabbed my arm to drink her health,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.310
The more fool I, the more fool I.”

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.600
Another odd custom of the time involved toasting
to a lady’s beauty by drinking from her

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600
shoe…

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.570
Unsurprisingly, the sheer excess of these
practices, and drunkenness that often ensued,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.680
lead to anti-toasting clubs and movements.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.790
Although they were unsuccessful, the eventual
result was toasting becoming more of a civilized,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.370
restrained and intellectual pursuit, rather
than one purely designed for imbibing alcohol.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.680
There were even “Toastmaster” books published
around this time.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.310
One of these was The Toastmasters Guide by
T Hughes, which strove to instill proper toasting

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.010
etiquette within the reader.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.120
Some of these books include examples of short,
appropriate, but also witty toasts that were

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.370
relevant to all occasions.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.690
Examples of these include -
“Mirth, wine and love.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.580
May the works of our nights never fear the
day-light.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.920
Old wine and young women.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.470
Prudence and temperance with claret and champagne.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.010
Love without fear, and life without care.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.290
May we never want a friend to cheer us, or
a bottle to cheer him.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.960
A generous heart and a miser’s fortune”
Evidence of this change in etiquette is still

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.810
apparent today, and there are even still Toastmaster
Clubs.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.341
Furthermore, while we still often include
alcohol in our toasting, drinking directly

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:06.080
after a toast is usually far more restrained,
often just a sip, and more reminiscent of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.360
its roots – a practice used to honour someone
in a respectful and revered manner, rather

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.580
than a great excuse to get drunk.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.510
As for the aforementioned raising of the drinking
vessels and clinking them together, there

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.900
are a couple of theories surrounding the origin
of this, but as with the ultimate origin of

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.830
toasting, we can only guess.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.670
Probably the most popular, and simplest, theory
is that people originally did this to raise

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.790
their drink to the gods or person being honoured
in offering, before taking a drink themselves.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.270
As to the clinking, this perhaps has similar
origins of symbolically offering your drink

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.480
to the people around you in a general toast.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.520
Bonus Fact:
• A word that tends to go hand in hand with

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.810
toasting, “cheers”, or in Medieval times
“cheres”, derived from the Anglo-French

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.700
word for ‘the face’.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.630
If we go a little further back, in Old French
the word “chiere” meant “face, countenance,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.160
look, expression.”

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.230
By the late 14th century “cheres” had
evolved to “cheere” and came to mean a

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.880
mood that was reflected in the face.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.500
By the 18th century, it had come to mean gladness
and it began being used to show support and

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.500
encouragement.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.810
Considering that wine, or alcohol in general,
is something we drink in both celebration

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.990
and lamentation, it’s hardly surprising
that “cheers” eventually became a part

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:36.430
of the toasting ritual.
