1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,350
You discuss making sure your teams have
the freedom to make strategic changes to

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:05,610
the plan if needed.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,950
What if you're developing a system with
your team and you begin to get push back

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,610
from them before you fuel the
core values are established.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,220
So this is a really good question.
Once again,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,820
you start calling up with your plan
and you're already starting to get some

7
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:28,260
pushback from the boys on what it is.
Well, what do you do? Listen to them.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,090
Listen to them. Why are they
pushing back? You know what I mean?

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,410
Why are they pushing back? Maybe they
have some good points. Is that possible?

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,590
Maybe you're a little bit off base on the
plan that you're coming up with her in

11
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,240
the strategy that you're coming
up op with. Maybe you're not.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,760
Of course that's always possible to,
maybe they're wrong. You're right,

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,230
but hear them out. You
know, if I say, hey,

14
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,720
we're going to hit the target
from this direction here,

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,070
and my team disagrees with
what I'm saying, well, why
are the disagreeing? What's,

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,090
what's the reason for that? You know,
how do they think we should do it?

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,760
They should think we should come
in from the, from the south,

18
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,400
and I think we should come from the north.
Why do they think that now?

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,860
If I know something is right

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,190
and I am right, then guess what? I can
explain it to them and they'll say,

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,860
oh, Jocko, we didn't know that.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,340
We didn't know that there was defenses
that we hadn't been told about to the

23
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,320
south and why. That's why we
should come into the north door.

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,840
We didn't know that the sun would
be bad or back from the north.

25
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,000
And that's why we didn't
know that at the time.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,990
So you're right now,

27
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,250
if I can't explain it to them for,

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,840
can't give them a reason why my
strategy or my plan is better,

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,200
then there's something wrong with my
plan or there's something wrong with my

30
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:46,920
ability to explain it to them,
right?

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,010
So if you're doing the right
things for the right reasons,

32
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:53,970
you'll be able to convince your
team of the strategy or of the plan.

33
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,110
And if you can't,

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,290
it's a hint that maybe you need to
adapt your strategy or maybe you need to

35
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,490
adapt your plan. Now be
advised, this is not easy.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,250
This is not easy to do. First of all,
you have to get your ego in check, right?

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,950
Because you think you've come up with a
plan and you think it's the master plan,

38
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:18,180
so you, you, you have to put
your ego in check is secondly,

39
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,370
you might actually have the best plan,

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
but maybe you don't have the ability
to articulate the nuances of the plan.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,410
And so your guys,

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,670
you get a guy that's a really articulate
guy that's arguing with you on his plan

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,120
and he's actually winning the argument,
even though your plan might be better.

44
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,150
That's a,
that's a tough situation to be in.

45
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:44,151
So that means you've got
to really get in the weeds.

46
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,840
Now, one thing that you could do in that
situation, they say, Hey, I'm in charge.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,550
Shut up. Listen to me. And again,

48
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,800
this might be a situation where
you're right and they're wrong,

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,410
but if you can't articulate that properly
and now you only way to do is to pull

50
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,860
rank on them, hey, you're
going to go backwards, right?

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,780
You're going to go backwards. So you
have to be very careful that, again,

52
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,220
this is why it's important to,

53
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,940
to have good command of
the English language.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,530
That's why it's important to listen.

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,620
That's why it's important to take people's
ideas and that's the thing with being

56
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,854
a leader.
Okay,

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,120
have an open mind, have open ears, listen,

58
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,110
communicate and lead
your team not by rank,

59
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,260
right?
But by being able to,

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,430
to discern and uncover and mold and
shape the best possible plan in the best

61
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:51,451
possible strategy by and through
understanding everyone's perspectives and

62
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,010
ideas,

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,410
and then taking all those perspectives
and all those ideas and coordinating them

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,440
into a unified fought that
leads the team to victory.

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,440
That is hard.
That is hard to do.

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,140
But the minute, again, the minute
that I'm telling somebody, hey, no,

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,800
just do it my way.
I know that there's,

68
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,690
there's something wrong here
either I'm not articulating right,

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,670
which means I should take the time
because if I'm right and you're wrong,

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,230
we should be able to get there
to where you see that. Yeah,

71
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,430
we should be able to get there.

72
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,480
We could also get to a point where it's
six in one half dozen. The other right.

73
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,420
We could get to that point too, and at
that point, you know what I'm going to do.

74
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,700
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to use your plan.

75
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,870
If it's six one half dozen, the other,
I'm gonna use your plan. Echo says,

76
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,270
come in from the north.
I say come in from the West.

77
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,250
We look at the pros and cons of each.
I'm going to go with your plan.

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,710
What'd you want to come in from
the West? Yeah. Okay. If it's,

79
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,990
if it's 50 50 I'm going
to go with your plan.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,510
I'm going to give it to you
and give you the ownership.

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,560
That's what I'm going to do.
Even I'll tell you,

82
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,550
even 60 40 I'm probably
going to give it to you.

83
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,750
We get to, you know, 70 30
now you're going to see it.

84
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,680
You're going to see the light.
If you have any brain now,

85
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,520
you could also be an EGOMANIAC, right?
Who's like my way? My Way, my way.

86
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,280
Now we've got to break through that.
How do we do that?

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
It's not by attacking your plan,

88
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
which you're going to defend because
you're an EGOMANIAC. Instead,

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,470
I'm going to say, well, tell
me the benefits of your plan.

90
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,270
Let's wait it out between
your plan and my plan.

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,640
Maybe we adapt your plan a little
bit. Oh, I like what you did here.

92
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,380
I see where you're coming from.
That's a really good point.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,180
I didn't think of that, but also we
need to consider this that I didn't.

94
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,790
You know, we, we didn't know before.
So now we're going to adjust.

95
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,890
So those are the things that are hard.

96
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,130
Those are things that are
hard about being a leader.

97
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,850
But the best thing you can do,
open your mind, open your ears,

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,520
listen to what people are saying.
Take it onboard.

99
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,000
If their plan is better than yours, great.
Use it. If it's not better than yours,

100
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,710
okay, articulate the reasons why.
Have the conversations with them.

101
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,530
Don't be scared. It's a slick move. I,

102
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,960
I didn't think of that for you.

103
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,670
Got to build up their ego.
If they got the big ego,

104
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,500
we've got to flank them blank yet.
So yeah,

105
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,334
that's good.

106
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,410
Get other people's perspectives because
it can seem like a 50 50 or it can seem

107
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,810
like 60 40 you know,

108
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,980
but it can also seem like a 64
or 70 30 year plan is better.

109
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:36,230
But to them 70 30 they're plan is
better because of their perspective.

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,580
Let's say they, they, there's rats drawing
down this trail. Yeah. I don't like rats.

111
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:43,910
But if you didn't know that, you know,
you're like frats who cares kind of thing.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,980
Yeah. Yeah. Dang girl, you're advanced
dogs would be a better thing. Sure.

113
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,490
To say rats aren't going to interfere
with your mission. Dogs start barking.

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,130
And maybe they had,
they had somebody,

115
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:58,580
they read an Intel report that said there
was a bunch of dogs up in this, this,

116
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,300
you know, residents to the north.
So we want to come in from the West.

117
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,030
And I didn't know that. I didn't
do a good enough. So now it's easy,

118
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,940
easy thing to convince me off.
Right.

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
But all we have to do is
have the conversation. Yeah.

120
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,520
I understand the perspective. Talk and
communicate those dogs with three teeth.

121
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,490
Put your egos in check.
Yeah. Or snakes, by the way,

122
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,260
if you're Indiana Jones
or something like that.
