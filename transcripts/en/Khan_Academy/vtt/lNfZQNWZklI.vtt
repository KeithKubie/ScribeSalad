00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:10.380
Estimate the solution to 582,205
plus 610,859, rounding

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.660
these two numbers to the
nearest thousand.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.430
So we going to round each of
these numbers to the nearest

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.980
thousand and then add them,
and that'll give us an

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.440
estimate to this solution.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.310
So let's do each of
these numbers.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:31.760
So if we start off with 582,205,
we want to round to

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.795
the nearest thousand.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.860
So you go to the thousands
place, and you go one place

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.740
below that.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.310
If that's 5 or greater,
round up.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.240
If it's less than
5, round down.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.620
This is less than 5.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.010
The 2 here is less than 5,
so we want round down.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.860
We are going to round it down,
so it's going to be 582,000.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.560
We're just going to round
it down to 2,000.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.100
We're going to get rid of
all of this 205 here.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.910
582,000 when we rounded it down
to the nearest thousand.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.910
Now, we have 610,859.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.090
Same drill.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670
Go to the thousands place.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.560
That's the 0 right there.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.300
Look one place below the
thousands place.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.080
This is that 8 right there.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.850
If this is 5 or greater,
you round up.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.310
Less than 5, round down.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.460
It is 5 or greater.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.160
8 is greater than 5.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.950
Or it could even be 5 and we'd
still around up, so we're

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.240
going to round up in
this situation.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.680
We're going to round up, so we
end up with 600, and instead

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.570
of 610,000, we're rounding
up to 611,000.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.790
We've rounded the two numbers
to the nearest thousand.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.796
Now we're ready to add.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.490
So let's add them.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.330
Let's add the two numbers.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.800
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.400
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.860
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.230
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.440
8 plus 1 is 9.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.230
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.130
If there were more places here,
we would carry the 1 in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.030
the tens place.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.230
But there isn't, so you can
just write an 11 here.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.380
And so we are left with-- put
a comma every third digit--

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.200
1,193,000, which is
our estimate.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.790
And the whole reason why this
is useful is if someone were

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.740
to give these numbers to you and
you had to do it in your

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.080
head, it's hard to add these
whole numbers, but you might

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.240
be able to do 582 plus
611, knowing

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.830
everything isn't thousands.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.780
So it allows you to do things
in your head a little bit

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.550
easier when you round, and then
you estimate the sum of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.570
the rounded numbers.
