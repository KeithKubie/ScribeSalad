00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.610
What do you think would happen if we dripped the concentrated sulfuric acid onto the head of the match

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.029
I've been reading a book that says you can use this technique as an improvised pyrotechnic igniter

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.580
So the purpose of this experiment is to find a match

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.700
Let's put it to the test.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.320
Yohis jar of sulfuric acid from a previous video where we extra

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.260
Sulphuric acid ranks very high on the Ph scale

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.178
It's a very reactive acid especially when it's in concentrated form and that's why we're taking safety precautions today

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.280
I've also got a bowl of baking soda water standing by here, baking Soda will help neutralize

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.580
The acid if we spill any in fact, if we take a couple of drops and just drip it down in the center

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.320
You can see it immediately reacts and neutralize the acid, so this is our back-up plan in case anything goes wrong today

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.039
I'm using a little plastic pipette here this plastic is not reactive with Sulfuric acid, and we don't need much

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.649
We're just going to grab a couple of drops there and hold it in the tip

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.390
You can see if I squeeze it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.660
We can get it to come out one drop at a time, now according to my book

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.219
We should be able to take one drop of sulfuric acid and put on the match head and watch it burst to flames

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.969
But instead you can see it just sits there. This is very interesting

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.470
I'm definitely seeing the sulfuric acid reacting with the match head it is bubbling

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.379
And it changes color if it gets down onto the Matchstick

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.000
It actually soaks some of the moisture out of the wood and Chars it and turns it Brown

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.189
But our matches are not bursting in a flame

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.869
And that's what we're looking for. I can actually smell some fumes coming off of that. So there is some reaction taking place

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.830
You can see some discoloration

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.479
We add a little bit more acid see if that'll speed the reaction

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.189
But that's kind of disappointing isn't it? So a match in this condition doesn't seem to very easily burst into flames now interestingly enough

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.289
I have a friend called nurdrage who put up a video recently as well doing the same experiment

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.130
I don't know if he's reading the same books as me

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.509
But he tried the same experiment and what he found is that using laboratory grade sulfuric acid you actually can get a reaction

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.720
But he did a follow-up video showing that actually took a lot of different tries and a lot of different fails before some of the matches would go off

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.400
Nurdrage did get it to work however failed more times than he succeeded

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.100
I'd like to see a little more reliable method for igniting Matches with Sulfuric acid

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.568
And I think I've come up with a little trick that'll do just that

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.849
Now I'm playing around I figured out a way to make this work

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.250
100% of the time with a slight modification

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.180
And all you're going to need is a plate a spoon and a couple of matches from your Matchbox

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.060
I find what works well for me is to place my finger into the spoon and then crush the match head on two of its sides and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.519
Then you can use the side of the spoon just to scrape off all that match head powder and remove any pieces of wood

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.578
Now, If we take the back of the spoon and just crush this into a fine powder

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.719
It's going to increase the surface area which will make it a lot more reactive with the acid

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.539
All right, we'll make a nice little pile and the match head powder is a lot finer now. That should make a big difference

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.879
Udius

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.410
Haha that's a dramatic difference

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.760
Dont do drugs, now the head of your safety matches are very small, but they contain an amazing array of chemicals

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.410
Not only is their potassium chlorate

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.100
But there's also a wood, glue, starch, sulfur, carbon and a few other materials that act as a fuel to help facilitated reaction

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.629
When we strike a match. So what exactly is happening to get the match to ignite, according to my friend

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.309
Nurdrage, the Sulfuric acid reacts with the potassium chlorate to form an acid called chloric acid

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.939
Chloric acid is very unstable and the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the fuels in the match head and make it spontaneously combust

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.700
Beautiful and of course the more match powder you use the bigger your reaction will be?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.670
Very nice. This is going to be good

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.239
Now this kind of match acid igniter could be used for all kinds of applications not just chemistry experiments

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.369
but if you rigged up some kind of an acid time delay

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.110
You can drip acid on here and use it to ignite a firework safety fuse for setting off pyrotechnics and fireworks

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.679
Check this out just for fun. I whipped up a batch of

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.060
Pyrotechnic play buttons using some of our initiater let's go drop some sulpuric acid on this thing and see how it reacts

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.660
Oh wow!

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.820
That looks amazing

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120
(Inaudible)

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.860
whoa

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.920
very cool

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.060
So there you have it guy's, a simple modification for making match heads react with sulfuric acid to make

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.940
a cool Pyrotechnic display,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.980
Hey, thanks so much for joining me for this experiment. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
What?
