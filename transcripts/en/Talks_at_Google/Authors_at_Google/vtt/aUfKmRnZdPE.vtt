[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.290
All right, good afternoon.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.130
Today at Google, we're delighted
to welcome Mr. Grant Faulkner.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
Mr. Faulkner is an American
writer, the executive director

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.970
of National Novel Writing
Month, and the co-founder

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.150
of the online literary
journal "100 Word Story".

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.590
Joining him on stage is Anthony
Francis, Google's very own,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.450
who works on the brain
robotics team at Google.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.380
They will be discussing on
stage Mr. Faulkner's new book,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.820
"Pep Talks for Writers--

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.380
52 Insights and Actions to
Boost Your Creative Mojo".

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.410
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Mr. Grant Faulkner.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.059
GRANT FAULKNER: Thanks, David.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.100
Thanks so much, everyone.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.060
Thanks for coming.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.400
It's great to see you.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.120
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Well,
welcome to Google.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.870
I was wondering if you could
tell us a little bit more

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.880
about yourself, what
you write, and how

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.200
you got involved with NaNo.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.075
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:06.010
Maybe I'll back up--

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.540
I'm going to ask,
how many people

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.171
here have done National
Novel Writing Month?

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:10.670
OK.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.746
I've got three
people, four people.

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:15.370
I am very curious if
anyone has done it

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.170
more times than Anthony has.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.570
He's nearing a
million words right

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.850
now for his whole
NaNoWriMo career.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.830
He started in 2002.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.490
Has anyone done it that long?

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.360
OK.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.820
Me included.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.614
But I want to tell you--
maybe just for those of you

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:33.780
who don't know what National
Novel Writing Month is,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.970
I'll just describe
it to you, and I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.520
want Anthony to also give
his take on what it is,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
because everyone has a different
sort of entry point to it.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.870
It was founded in
1999 by this guy

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.620
named Chris Baty in Berkeley.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.240
And Chris basically-- it might
not have been this suddenly--

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.200
but he woke up one morning
and kind of literally decided,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.640
I want to write a novel.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.320
I mean, he was an active
reader, a lover of language,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.950
but he hadn't read any,
like, how to write books.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.949
He hadn't taken any
writing workshops.

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:09.449
He just wanted to write a novel,
and he figured the best way

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.359
to do it was to write.

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.900
And that's what I
always tell people.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.526
If you want to learn
to write a novel,

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:16.650
the best way is to actually
sit down and write one.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.440
It's just such a big, crazy
experience that you have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.864
to experience it first hand.

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:24.887
But anyway, Chris-- so he
looked at his bookshelves,

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:26.970
and he picked up some of
the more slender volumes,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.060
so think of something about the
size of "Catcher in the Rye",

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.920
and he did a rough estimate.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780
And they came up with 50,000
words, was a kind of like--

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.440
the lowest edge of a
novel, lowest word count.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.960
And he did some very
sophisticated math,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.530
and figured out that you
could write a novel in a month

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.350
if you wrote 1,677 words a day--

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.970
I'll round up to 1,700.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.410
And Chris recruited about 20 of
his friends to write with him.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.170
And they met in coffee
shops after work

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.100
and they would do these
interesting challenges.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.380
They would, for instance,
challenge each other

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.620
through word sprints, which
we still do during NaNoWriMo,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.960
and the person who would
write the most words

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.370
would get a prize.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.370
So they'd write for like five
minutes, and the person who

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.040
one might get a latte.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.940
And then-- very Pavlovian
in its roots, NaNoWriMo.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.810
And then they'd do this other
kind of Pavlovian technique

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.490
that you can't go
to the bathroom

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.160
until you've written
a thousand words.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.030
And after the latte and
after other beverages,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.890
this is the single
best writing--

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.180
motivational technique
in the world.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.180
So if you're ever behind and on
deadline, drink a lot of coffee

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.520
and then don't let
yourself go to the bathroom

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.103
until you've written
a thousand words.

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:46.380
But anyway, the reason I
tell this story is one,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.970
I think a lot of
people don't realize

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.490
their creative potential, or
pursue their creative dreams

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.812
because they put obstacles
in front of themselves.

00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:58.020
And so one way that Chris
did this was like, he said,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.340
I don't have to take
a writing workshop

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.423
to learn to write a novel.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:01.690
I can just do it.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.660
And meeting in cafes with
his friends also built in--

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.750
we're essentially, this is what
NaNoWriMo is, it's a community.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.310
It's one part event,
one part community.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.690
And the community part
is really important,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.269
because they held each
other accountable.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.660
So if someone didn't show
up for-- now we call them

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.010
write-ins--

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.320
somebody might give a
call the next day and say,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.150
are you still working
on your novel?

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.960
Are you still making progress?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.930
And so the whole
premise of it is,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.100
is that you don't have to
have an MFA to be a writer.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.225
You're a writer by writing.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:36.780
That's the definition.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.400
And that-- also we say that
everyone has a story to tell.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.740
And this is actually
true, or true enough.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.320
I read a survey in "The
New York Times" recently,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.970
81% of Americans say they
want to write a book someday,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.010
but most of them don't do it.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.131
And that's why we exist.

00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.130
We say, if you're going
to write a book someday,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.338
those things that you say
you're going to do someday,

00:04:58.338 --> 00:04:59.730
they rarely happen.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.740
Have you ever noticed that?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.870
Usually we're waiting for that
kind of perfect expanse of time

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.800
and the perfect place
to do it, but perfect--

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.970
perfection-- it never arrives.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.120
So that's part of the
premise of NaNoWriMo

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.640
is like, make your creative
dreams happen today,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.470
and write 50,000
words in November.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.660
And we've expanded our
program since then.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.450
We have a camp NaNoWriMo program
that happens in April and July,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.970
it's a more casual
version of NaNoWriMo.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.030
We have I Wrote A Novel, Now
What? in January and February

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.190
where we focus on
revision and publishing.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.720
And then we have
this huge program

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.100
called the Young
Writers program,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.790
where 80,000 kids and teens
sign up to write a novel.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.580
When I was going to high
school, kids didn't even

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.810
think about writing a novel.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.910
It was like something
that adults did.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.280
So I'm really proud
of that program.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.260
Yeah.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.826
And Anthony has
done it since 2002.

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:49.200
How would you
describe NaNoWriMo?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.810
ANTHONY FRANCIS: So it's
really interesting the stuff

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.140
that you listed, because
I've been writing

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.320
on and off for over 30 years.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.310
And with exception
of a short story,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.230
I'd never gotten
things published.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.580
And I had read all the writing
books that I could find,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.840
I took off a summer to
finish a novel once.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.870
I tried to prioritize
my writing.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.430
I went to 80% time at
the company I was at

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.920
to try to give myself
more time for writing,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.640
and then they started
eating into that,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.473
and so I switched
companies to another place

00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:28.560
where I could do that.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.130
I went to a writing
workshop at Dragon Con.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.730
And none of these
things really helped

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.690
me get what I wanted,
because they were focusing

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.020
on things like creating--

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.410
improving my technique, or
creating space in my life.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.360
They weren't focusing
on the right problem,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.060
which was writing.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.030
Actually focusing
on the writing.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.730
And at that writing workshop,
I heard about National Novel

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.600
Writing Month.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.010
And I tried it.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.290
And I got 50,000 words into
a novel, and I was overjoyed.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.480
And I had the intent
of following up on it,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.520
and some stuff
happened in my life.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.340
So that didn't happen.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.180
But a few years later, I met
another community of writers

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.500
that were focused on writing.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.650
It was a writing group,
but not a critique group.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.470
It was like, we get together,
we write, we read what we wrote,

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.310
but nobody critiques.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.240
This is just to hear the words.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.620
And they were involved in
NaNo, and that brought me back

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.740
into it.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.840
And that really had a
spark, because instead

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.480
of focusing on technique,
instead of focusing on how do I

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.700
create space, I'm
sitting here going,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.620
people that have
day jobs did not

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.880
take off a month to succeed
at NaNo, they just did it.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.190
And that broke my mindset
that I had to create space

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.660
or I had to perfect
my technique,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.040
and some of my very best
writing has come out

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.370
of this, because you
think through your plot,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.420
you know that you've
got your magical tattoo

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.420
artist in the second
NaNo I had, she's

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.695
about to go to a Werehouse--

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.497
W-E-R-E, house of werewolves--

00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:12.080
and I suddenly realized, well,
I've written this into my plot,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.730
and I have no idea what
actually happens there.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.980
I know what happens next,
but not what happens there.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.415
And I had to step off into
space or miss my word count.

00:08:22.415 --> 00:08:25.687
And I ended up writing a whole
scene I never anticipated,

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:27.770
and characters that pushed
their way into the book

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.170
and refused to
leave, and now I'm

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.440
writing a young adult series
about this spin-off character

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.000
that came entirely through
the door opened by my NaNo.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.039
But another part
is that community.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.150
And even if you're just
going onto the website,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.970
or talking with friends about
NaNo, that's really important.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.450
I have done-- attempted NaNo--

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.710
20 times, counting NaNo,
Script Frenzy, and Camp NaNo.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.910
I have failed twice.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.180
And my failures
were when I decided,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.930
oh, I'm just going
to do NaNo in a month

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.870
by myself without the support
of the whole community.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.890
And 10,000 words
in, it just died.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.350
Because I didn't have
that fear that I'm not

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.955
going to be able
to submit my word

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:15.890
count at the end of
the month, and I'm not

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.435
going to get that little
Viking hat graphic.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.560
GRANT FAULKNER: It's very--

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.210
you want to get the
Viking hat graphic.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.530
ANTHONY FRANCIS: I still--

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.710
GRANT FAULKNER: That's what
most people are working for.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.390
ANTHONY FRANCIS: I have an
actual Viking hat somewhere

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.110
in my house when you
were still giving--

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.610
I don't know if you
still do or not.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:29.990
But--

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.600
GRANT FAULKNER: We do.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.520
We'll get you more Viking hats.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.645
ANTHONY FRANCIS: I don't
need any more Viking hats.

00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:35.860
I don't have any
place to store them.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.470
But it's really-- it's been the
community is just as important.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.980
So you--

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.030
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah,
I totally agree.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.969
I think that's actually
part of the reason

00:09:42.969 --> 00:09:45.260
I wrote this book, because
I talked to so many writers,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.680
and they would find their
creative home with NaNoWriMo

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.120
in November and find
themselves as writers

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.560
and and they would have
full intention of taking--

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.170
going beyond NaNoWriMo
to write year round,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.180
yet they'd have
problems about that.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.680
Like in some ways,
I mean it does

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.519
feel like the whole world is
writing with you in November,

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.060
and throughout the
month of November,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.700
#nanowrimo is trending.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.010
And Anthony mentioned
the forums online,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.500
we get like a million forums
posts the month of November.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.580
So literally every writing topic
under the sun is talked about.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.240
But I do think
it's like NaNoWriMo

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.840
is this great opportunity to
make your creativity a priority

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.260
during the month of November.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.890
And I think as we
get older, creativity

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.010
has a way of falling lower
and lower on our list.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.125
There's this great
quote from Picasso,

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:35.450
he says that every
child is born an artist.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.850
The challenge is how to
be an artist as an adult.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.640
And I bet we all
feel about here.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.534
And so I think--

00:10:41.534 --> 00:10:43.700
but I think it's really
important to make creativity

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.980
a priority every
month, no matter if you

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.470
want to be a bestselling author,
or if you just like writing,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.220
and so that's what
this book is all about.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.150
The 50-- The 52 essays, not
a coincidence with the 52.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.849
One per week.

00:10:56.849 --> 00:10:58.640
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Well,
it's interesting you

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.560
say this about making sure
that we stay creative,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.455
but for some people, like, they
with more stories in their head

00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:08.330
than they can put down
on page, and they just

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.820
need to carve out some time
to do it or give themselves

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.110
permission to do it.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.020
Other people want to write,
but then they get there

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.510
and then there's that
page and they're like,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.860
I just don't know what to write.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.350
I don't know-- or I
know I want to write,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.590
but I can't come up
with the right words.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.380
So it's a-- when--

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.770
how do you spark
that creativity?

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.540
Like you've got the
desire, but sometimes

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.580
you just seem to run dry.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.299
What do you do to
spark your creativity?

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:38.090
What are some techniques
that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.080
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.820
There are a lot of them.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.990
I'm going to talk about one.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.600
I'm going to read a little
bit in the book here.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.450
One of the things that I
think holds people back

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.250
from being creative is there's
this notion of inspiration.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.900
And I'll hear people say, well,
I don't write because I'm not--

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.780
or I wait for inspiration
to strike before I write.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.650
And so here's a little
take on the inspiration

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.310
that I think might
help people write.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.480
Inspiration is a funny thing.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.020
It's powerful enough
to move mountains.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.820
When it strikes it
carries an author

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.940
forward like the rushing
torrents of a flooded river.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.210
And yet if you wait for
it, nothing happens.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.760
The irony is that so much
is actually created--

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.082
mountains moved, sagas
written, grand murals painted--

00:12:26.082 --> 00:12:28.040
by those who might not
even describe themselves

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.990
as particularly inspired.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.090
Instead they show up every
day and put their hands

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.370
on the keyboard,
their pen to paper,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.230
and they move their
stories forward bit

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.650
by bit, word by word,
perhaps not even recognizing

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.450
that inspiration is
striking in hundreds

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.420
of tiny microscopic ways as they
push through another sentence,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.080
another page, another chapter.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.880
I write when the
spirit moves me,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.000
and the spirit moves me every
day, said William Faulkner.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.210
No relation.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.850
This is the princ--
oh I wish there was--

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.780
this is the
principal way writers

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.180
finish 50,000 thousand
words of a novel each year

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.010
during National Novel Writing
Month-- by showing up.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.874
And it applies to being creative
the rest of the year as well.

00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:09.290
Inspiration is
often characterized

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.260
as a thunderbolt, a
brilliant flash that

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.430
strikes from the
heavens, a eureka moment,

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.200
and that metaphor
certainly holds true,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.410
because inspiration can be
a sudden igniting force--

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.690
random and illuminating
and otherworldly

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.659
and even a bit dangerous.

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:24.200
Yet I think of
inspiration-- at least

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.990
the big gob smacking
moments of inspiration--

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.090
as more like Bigfoot.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.610
Sightings of Bigfoot are
rare, and he's so elusive

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.770
that he can't be captured
physically, or even truly

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.280
on film, so his very
existence is in question.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.110
It's wonderful to
believe that he exists,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.820
because it's nice to
think the world is

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.580
strange and beautiful enough
to spawn such a creature.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.830
But if you go out into the
woods and look for Bigfoot,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.510
you're not likely
to find him, just

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.970
as you can't force sweeping
gusts of inspiration

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.480
to appear on any given day.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.620
The muse of Greek mythology--

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.870
that creature depicted
in a beautiful flowing

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.670
gown, playing a harp--

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.120
was invoked by authors to
sing stories into their ears,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.250
but I'd like to
recast this muse.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.710
The muse doesn't sing the
words of a story to you.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.660
The muse is conjured
in the telling,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.870
in overcoming those lulls that
strike with willpower, grit,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.240
and as much caffeine
as it takes.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.310
I see the muse as hundreds
of invisible sprites

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.400
that sleep in the whispery
spaces between each word.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.040
These sprites are enlivned only
by the breath of a churning

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.140
imagination, by the stirrings
of a story moving forward.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.540
Such a muse is
ineffable, so miniature

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.610
that she often goes
unnoticed, yet an author

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.830
must trust that the
responsibility for bringing

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.590
those story sprites
to life resides

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.206
in creating a spool of words
that spin onto the page.

00:14:40.206 --> 00:14:42.080
A writer is either
compelled to write or not,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.370
said Toni Morrison.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.460
If I waited for inspiration,
I wouldn't really be a writer.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.960
The urge to wait
for inspiration has

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.080
killed many a wonderful story.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.980
And I am going to end with
the Toni Morrison quote

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.619
there because Toni Morrison--

00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:58.160
I don't know if you
know this story--

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.690
but when she wrote
her first novel,

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.260
she was a single working
mom in New York City.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.530
And she worked all
day like us, busy job.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.070
Came home, took care of
her kids, got them to bed.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.230
And she had about 15 minutes
of the day left to her.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.280
But she used that 15 minutes--
not her prime creative time,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.340
not when her mind is like
super fresh and imaginative--

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.760
but in those 15 minutes she
wrote every day, and that--

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.560
she built a novel
by tiny increments.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.700
And so I feel like this is a
lesson for us all about what

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.690
you can build just
through a daily practice.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.440
And if she'd been
waiting for inspiration,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.750
she'd still be waiting
to write that novel.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.010
And she's moved on past that.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.700
So I really do think, like--

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.360
and this is why,
and Anthony, I will

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.370
get to this, why, in
many ways, I don't

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.670
believe in writer's block.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.150
I feel like we tell
ourselves we have a block,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.610
but if you just sit down
and put words on the page,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.090
you'll solve that block, because
other words like to follow.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.980
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Yeah, there's so

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.430
much I want to follow up there.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.610
It's-- I think that lightning
bolt of inspiration--

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.430
and as a cognitive scientist,
we have this feeling that things

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.520
come into consciousness
all at once or not at all,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.880
like you see something
or you don't.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.710
Yet there's these
perceptual processes

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.500
that are churning in the
background all the time.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.360
And inspiration is kind of like
perceiving your own idea space,

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.454
where it congeals, and
you're seeing this idea

00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:25.120
that you've had.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.370
But if you aren't
feeding your brain

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.930
with all these
thoughts and ideas

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.260
and trying to progress
step by step, it's like--

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:37.150
the muse can't set sail unless
you've already filled the ocean

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.820
with your tears of hard work.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.180
GRANT FAULKNER: I love it.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.138
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Right.

00:16:40.138 --> 00:16:46.000
So it's-- I think
it's really critical.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.920
But then the Toni Morrison
quote, also it strikes me--

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.460
and I went to a
writer's workshop

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.090
with Walter John Williams
as one of the instructors,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.390
and he did had us
do an exercise,

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.270
and he had us all get
together and write

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.480
for 30 minutes on whatever our
favorite writing implement was,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.240
and at the end of that, he
asked us to do a word count.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.790
And the word count for
people was everywhere

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.770
from 250 to 1,200, because
some people were very fast.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.220
And the average was around--

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.230
I can't remember the
number, 300 or 500 words.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:25.329
And he said, OK, if you
did that five days a week,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.300
50 weeks a year, that's a novel.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.770
That's a career.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.470
And his point to us is that we
don't really have an excuse--

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.860
and this is a science
fiction workshop-- his point

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.780
that we don't really
have an excuse

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.442
not to be a writer
because it can be done,

00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:42.400
at least in the writing
part, 30 minutes a day.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.720
Maybe not the editing.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.560
But--

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:44.910
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.368
ANTHONY FRANCIS: But if you
have the text, you can edit it.

00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:49.390
If you don't, you can't.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.610
And then that goes
back to that--

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.100
so let's talk a
little bit about--

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.683
I want to come back
to writer's block,

00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:58.950
but let's talk a little
bit about creating

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.490
the practice of writing.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.590
How-- a lot of people--

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.820
like even for me.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.970
I have done NaNo forever,
I've written many novels,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.900
and I still struggle to
maintain a practice where

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.000
I am writing at
the speed and rate

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.764
that I wanted to finish
my books before I die.

00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:19.180
GRANT FAULKNER: We all have
too many books in us, I think.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.710
We'll never get the books I
want to read read or written,

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.880
unfortunately.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.400
I just wanted to go back a
little bit for the writer's

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.330
block, and to the story that
you did about the half an hour

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.010
a day.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.190
When I mentioned a word
sprints during NaNoWriMo,

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.209
which is basically
giving people a prompt

00:18:37.209 --> 00:18:39.250
and telling them to write
for five to 10 minutes.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.530
And per what Anthony
said, in five minutes,

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.960
I've never encountered-- at
least people on a laptop--

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.820
people write at least 200 words.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.330
Even, like, people who classify
themselves as non-writers.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.120
Which I don't think exists.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.380
Everyone's a writer.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.380
But it's the same thing.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.560
It's that idea that even
if it's a rough draft

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.100
and you write 200 words
a day or 300 words a day,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.480
300 words a day is like
10,000 words a month.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.370
That's 120,000 words a year.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.549
That's a huge novel,
perhaps two novels.

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:07.090
And again, it might
be a rough draft.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.947
But the point is,
like, for me, getting

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:11.530
the rough-- writing
the rough draft is

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.790
the hardest thing for me.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.050
I hate rough drafts.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.452
That's actually what
NaNoWriMo delivered me from.

00:19:16.452 --> 00:19:18.160
It helped me get
through my rough drafts.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.570
I called myself a precious
ponderous writer beforehand,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.910
because I would sit and
make the first sentence

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.580
or the first paragraph of the
first chapter perfect before I

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.490
moved on, which was entirely
the wrong approach to writing

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.710
a novel, because
that first chapter is

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.840
likely going to get
cut in revision,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.540
or rewritten anyway,
so the premise--

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.999
I feel like I didn't
describe this quite as

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:41.290
well as I should have earlier--

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.027
but it's getting
the rough draft out.

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:45.110
And the thing is, is like
that when we measure it,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.850
so many people, the one obstacle
they put in front of themselves

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.970
in a rough draft is that their
words in their rough draft

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.680
don't match their
favorite authors words.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.622
And in the end, what
we don't realize

00:19:56.622 --> 00:19:58.330
is that our favorite
authors have written

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.830
these crappy rough drafts.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.654
We just don't get to see them.

00:20:01.654 --> 00:20:03.070
We only get to see
the drafts that

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.620
have been revised
maybe eight or 10 times

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.730
and edited it by a
professional editor.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.190
So it's really about getting
the words on the page.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.320
And then you can edit them.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.110
And now I've forgotten the
great question you just asked me

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.305
because I was backtracking.

00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:16.930
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
We'll come back to it.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.770
I just-- about writer's block.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.320
I've heard a number
of people say,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.150
writer's block doesn't exist.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:27.290
I mean, I can show you half a
dozen books that are out there.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.140
This is "The
Writer's Block Myth".

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.970
Half a dozen books
and blog posts

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.080
where people say the same thing.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.090
And that's-- I
struggle with that,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.390
because I also have read
the cognitive science

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.270
on writer's block.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.270
But then strangely,
I realized they

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.240
were saying the same thing.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.110
So the resistance I
had is like, I know--

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.640
I instruct on writer's block.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.830
I do workshops.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.750
I have people that
I'm like, just

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.910
take a blank piece of paper
and just write blah blah blah.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.850
Just write any
words you can think

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.770
of just to get it started.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.425
And they are-- find themselves
unable to do even that.

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.300
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.200
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
And then for me--

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.890
GRANT FAULKNER: Really?

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.360
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Oh yes.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.776
GRANT FAULKNER:
No blah blah blah?

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:07.460
ANTHONY FRANCIS: They
won't-- they won't do it.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.260
It's called writing
avoidance, sometimes.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.970
Other times I was
writing an article,

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.220
I knew what I wanted to write.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.450
I was, at least in my own mind,
an expert in the subject area.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.350
I wanted to write the article,
I knew what I had to say next.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:28.050
And I was so paralyzed, I
actually lay down on the floor

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.070
in a building in this very
campus staring at the ceiling,

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.200
going [FRUSTRATRED GROWL]
because I could not

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.670
force the words onto the page.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.580
And this is after I've already
written 800,000 thousand words

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.980
in NaNo.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.790
And so I'm like, ah, so
writer's block-- it's real.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.240
Yet, most people, when
they have writer's block--

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.100
and this comes out
in all the studies--

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.870
is they're filled
with all these--

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.550
some people are
blocked emotionally,

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.910
but most of the time
it's from having rules.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.190
It's from having a habit--

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.830
to wait for your muse,
to wait for inspiration.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.050
Another big one
is editing, where

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.610
you become convinced that
you must write perfectly

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.970
on the page.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.420
And that's-- that made me
think of what you're saying,

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.680
as far as that rough draft,
is, we talk a little bit about

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.140
your inner writer and
your inner editor.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.250
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.590
Yeah, in fact I
do have a chapter

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.980
here about the inner editor.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.740
I'll read a little bit.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.170
Does anyone know what
an inner editor is?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.640
Do you have any guesses?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.470
Hazards?

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.428
Elizabeth, you're laughing
at your inner editor here.

00:22:31.428 --> 00:22:32.670
AUDIENCE: Big jerk.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.500
GRANT FAULKNER: Big jerk.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.700
I like that.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.746
Anything else?

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:39.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
inner critic.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.120
GRANT FAULKNER: Inner critic.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.680
Yeah.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.090
That person who's saying--

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.669
I like the big jerk one,
because I do think sometimes

00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:48.710
that inner editor is
saying, you're not a writer.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.810
Why are you doing this?

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.530
Why are you being so
pretentious to think

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.300
that you can write a novel?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.800
Or the inner critic
is more I think

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.500
what I was talking about
earlier, where I'll

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.390
write a sentence,
and it'll be like,

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.210
that's just a crappy,
banal sentence.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.930
Your favorite writers can
write that much more eloquently

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.460
and lyrically.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.840
But then inner editor
plays a big, role

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.960
in NaNoWriMo in
the sense that it's

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.420
all about banishing
the inner editor.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.130
And that's probably--
the slide here

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.380
is the power of
writing with abandon.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.810
And so it's about
saying, inner editor,

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.980
you can't be here this month.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.980
That's a really easy
to say, hard to do,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.650
because our inner editors
are powerful figures.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:28.460
But we say that.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.320
Like, banish your inner
editor for a month

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.144
and just write, and
write with abandon.

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.560
And part of the
premise of that is

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.810
that when you
write with abandon,

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.110
you are going to discover ideas
and take creative risks in ways

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.484
that you can't even imagine.

00:23:40.484 --> 00:23:42.650
That's one of the reasons
I do NaNoWriMo every year.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.630
I came to NaNoWriMop
as a writer before I

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.340
became executive director.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.400
And getting that rough draft
out and exploring my ideas,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.410
because the rough
draft in so many ways

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.450
is just an exploratory draft.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.320
It's not meant to ossify into
the structure of your novel,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.210
necessarily.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.460
So I like-- I recently
heard this quote

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.620
by Barbara Kingsolver,
where, when

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.610
she starts writing a novel she,
starts a page in negative 100.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.770
And so she's writing
those first 100 pages just

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.242
to kind of find her story.

00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:12.950
And that's the way I
view my rough draft.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.210
I'm just finding my story.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.404
I think Anthony maybe has
his more structured going in,

00:24:17.404 --> 00:24:19.070
and I mention that
just because everyone

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.290
has a different
approach to writing.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.180
And that NaNoWriMo,
and that as creators,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.220
we have to constantly
be experimenting

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.682
with our approach.

00:24:26.682 --> 00:24:28.640
ANTHONY FRANCIS: I was
on a writing panel once,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.210
and we went down the list, and
everyone described themselves

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.230
as being--

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.500
plotters versus [? pancers, ?]
people who were plotting ahead.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.690
And we got to the last
person on the list,

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.930
who was Diana Gabaldon,
who wrote "Outlander".

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.500
She's like, well, I
don't want the audience

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.480
to be misled, because it seems
like we're like 3/4 of this one

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.850
type of person, but
the average statistics

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.090
are the opposite of this.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.677
So everyone is different,
everyone is unique.

00:24:57.677 --> 00:24:59.510
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah,
and I think every year

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.551
I do something different.

00:25:00.551 --> 00:25:03.080
I'm more of like what we
call in NaNoWriMo terms

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.080
a [? plancer, ?] I'm in
between a planner or plotter

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.440
and a [? pancer. ?] This is
kind of how I describe my life,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.570
I never go too far
into any one camp.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.320
So anyway.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.000
It works for me, though,
to find that middle ground.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.920
So this chapter is actually
about improvisational writing,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.130
which NaNoWriMo largely is.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.300
But I think it connects
with the inner editor

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.520
really well as well.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.089
Your inner editor
has a sibling who

00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:29.630
can be more dangerous
to your writing

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.080
than even the growling critiques
of your inner editor itself.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.420
It tends to walk around the
rooms of your mind gazing

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.390
at all the imaginative ruckus
with a persnickety, arrogant

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.650
gaze.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.780
It exudes an air
of judicious logic,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.110
speaking in the grave
tones of seasoned caution.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.990
He likes to stroll in just when
you get an idea that you're

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.440
about to pounce on like a
puppy pounces on a chew toy,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.050
and it says, but wait.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.940
But wait, this isn't logical.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.650
But wait, that's unpleasant.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.930
But wait, let's
just not go there.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.420
I think of But Wait as
an enthusiastic drip,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.340
the kind of person who
sits smugly in meetings

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.520
and never quite gets behind
an idea for whatever reason.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.210
The killjoy who lacks that or
the wonderful reckless zeal

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.310
that brings ideas to life.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.280
But Wait is a volcano
that will never erupt.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.820
But Wait has never led to
great artistic or scientific

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.680
breakthroughs, although
it comes in handy

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.990
if you're an impulsive shopper.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.075
But Wait is quite different than
his twin, But Wait, What If?,

00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:29.930
a wonderfully stimulating
thought partner.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.600
If your brain has fallen into
a rut of resistance, a storage

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.690
bin of hand-me-down ideas
and shopworn sensibilities,

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.880
it's necessary to
find ways to open up

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.090
to new sense-ravishing
possibilities.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.880
If I'm feeling too many
but waits in my mind,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.640
I try to embrace the
opposite force, the guiding

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.850
principle of improv, yes and.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:50.954
It's simple, really.

00:26:50.954 --> 00:26:52.370
Improv actors are
trained to trust

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.550
the impulsive force of an
idea and just say yes to it.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.010
They accept whatever fellow
actors offer in a scene,

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.680
instead of stiff-arming the
action in the direction they

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.270
want it to go.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.027
For example, when one actor
says it's so cold in here

00:27:05.027 --> 00:27:07.610
you don't say, but wait, that's
not a good approach the scene,

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.320
or but wait I'm not cold.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.150
You take the statement
and build on it.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.700
Yes nudity brings on
the chills, you say.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.230
Or something silly.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.544
And then your acting partner--
oh, thank you for laughing.

00:27:19.544 --> 00:27:21.710
And then your acting partner
embraces your statement

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.000
and builds on that.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.440
When I'm writing,
I sometimes like

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.810
to think that there's an
entire writing team in my head,

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.700
tossing ideas back and forth,
a veritable comedy troupe.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.710
But Wait hates scenes
like this, everyone

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.360
getting ideas,
loving their ideas,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.390
putting their ideas into the
world, onto the page in such

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.430
a sloppy, gleeful way.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.080
But Wait tries to
speak above the fray.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.350
But once the naturally
boisterous writing team

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.440
in your brain gets going, But
Wait's cranky little voice just

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.220
isn't loud enough.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.550
Improvisers take risks and
make mistakes by definition.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.340
They let themselves fall into
the most foolish behavior,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.860
allow themselves to speak
what's taboo, because that's

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.110
what leads them in
fresh directions

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.030
and helps them connect
with their audiences.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.020
And so I just want to
say that part of that,

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.515
like, taking risks is what a
novel or any creative endeavor

00:28:09.515 --> 00:28:12.200
is is really all
about, and accepting--

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.860
for novelists, you're really
accepting so much failure

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.330
in that first draft.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.190
There's so much of it.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.890
I have a slide, when we get
to the workshop portion,

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.660
but Karen Russell
the novelist says

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.600
that 90% of her rough
draft doesn't make it

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.400
into her final draft.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.550
Almost every novelist I've
talked to that's the case.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.900
And so the rough draft really
is a sandbox, a playground.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.810
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:42.860
Because it's a chance
for you to try ideas

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.350
and then later you may
find they may not work.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.600
If you write slightly
out of order, like I do,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.110
the pieces may not fit, but
until you've got all the pieces

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.090
down, you can't figure
out where you're going

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.520
to have to lay that highway.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.232
Keith Johnstone has a
great book called "Impro",

00:28:58.232 --> 00:28:59.690
which talks about
some of the stuff

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.240
that with improv
that your talk out.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.190
And I find the ideas,
great, but when

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.130
I've been on the improv
stage, I often kind of

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.180
find myself freezing up.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.484
And because I haven't
done improv enough.

00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:17.900
And this is this
goes back to what

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:24.860
we were talking about, about
that blank page and writer's

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.370
block.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.230
If you think about when
you start to write,

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.550
you have to know
why you're writing,

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:35.000
what you're writing about,
what words you want to choose.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.720
You have to be familiar
with your tools,

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.610
whether it's a typewriter
or a laptop or a pen.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.470
And we have this--

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.450
we have a limited
number of things

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.510
we can store in our heads,
and in our working memories--

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.355
seven plus or minus two is
the old cognitive science saw.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:53.510
And that's not quite accurate,
but it's a first cut.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.070
And when you have
all these skills

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.430
that you haven't practiced
competing with each other,

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.670
you can just get jammed.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.010
And that's one of the theories
why the blank page writer's

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.880
block happens.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.920
And the way around it
is to do what we do

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.830
and the rest of our lives,
is to practice enough

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.977
that all those skills go
into our subconscious, become

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.560
automatic, and then we can just
focus on what we want to write

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.570
and we can let
the muse take off.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.740
So to do that,
you have to write.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.870
It's like to do improv, you
have to not just read "Impro",

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.660
you have to go to improv.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.940
So what are some strategies that
we can use to help us keep that

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.067
writing practice going even
when we feel like we can't?

00:30:34.067 --> 00:30:36.400
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah, thank
you for mentioning practice,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.060
because I do think this
is easier said than done.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.850
Like the improvisation
metaphor, yeah.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.920
If you do that every day,
like you did NaNoWriMo,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.940
you would build those
muscles in your brain.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:50.170
And it would become effortless
in some ways, I think.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.580
So practice is really key.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.910
One of the chapters I
really like in this book

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.640
to help people face
that blank page--

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.910
it's an exercise that
comes from Ray Bradbury.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.110
When he first decided to
become a writer and a novelist,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.680
he did this exercise where
he would write down 20 nouns.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.210
And he'd do it
entirely randomly,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.950
just from his subconscious.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.940
And then he would write what he
called pensays, little thoughts

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.710
or little tiny essays
about each word,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.980
and they would be like
100 words to 200 words.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:24.700
And in that process of just the
random nouns and then putting

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.040
his thoughts to them, he came
up with some of his best stories

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.640
and novels.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.220
I think "A Wicked
Thing This Way Comes",

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.380
that's how he came up
with the idea for that.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.430
ANTHONY FRANCIS: "Something
Wicked This Way Comes".

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.040
GRANT FAULKNER: "Something
Wicked This Way Comes",

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.460
yeah, I always
stumble on that title,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.810
but this is all this say that I
do think that writer's block is

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.790
often something
we tell ourselves,

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.780
and it becomes an excuse.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.880
There's a mythology
built around it.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.320
And I think that if you think
about what techniques will help

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.230
you get words on the page, like
whether it's Ray Bradbury's,

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.720
or a simple phrase,
like sometimes we

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.190
give just a phrase
as a writing prompt,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.180
or use photographs that
you find on the internet.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.670
Or some-- I've known
people who write letters

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.040
to their main character, or
have their character write

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.785
them letters to themselves.

00:32:10.785 --> 00:32:12.160
There are a lot
of different ways

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.320
to get to do an end
run about whatever that

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.270
is that psychological block.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.940
And then I still think once you
get those words on the page,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.492
they create a momentum
that is mysterious.

00:32:22.492 --> 00:32:24.200
And that's why like
when we do these word

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.802
sprints during NaNoWriMo,
oftentimes you'll

00:32:26.802 --> 00:32:29.260
get the prompt, you won't have
a story that you're writing,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.885
you'll just have to
write as many words

00:32:30.885 --> 00:32:32.140
as you can in five minutes.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.520
And it's always a-- it's just a
this huge mystery and surprise

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.800
how words just kind
of come pouring out,

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.790
and they sort of-- they
make this interesting sense.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.466
And they lead to
a story, even when

00:32:45.466 --> 00:32:46.840
you don't think
you have a story.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.392
There's a story in there.

00:32:48.392 --> 00:32:50.350
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Yeah,
you can really sometimes

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:54.730
just start with something you
don't know where it's going,

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.220
and then suddenly it
becomes something.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.780
And both of the novel series
I work on, there's a section--

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.005
I can point to you a section
which came out of just kind of,

00:33:05.005 --> 00:33:06.880
I had ideas that I wanted
to write something,

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.250
but the section that
just wrote itself,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.320
and then everything
else had came out

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:15.580
of that, that spark that
got into that world.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.590
And then sometimes, as
I'm taking in that spark,

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.600
it's like, OK, do I
really want to do this?

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.780
And fortunately, because
I write you know slightly

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.450
over-the-top genre fiction,
it's really easy for me

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.560
to take the But
Wait guy and say,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.900
every time I hear that,
I'm like, if I say, like,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.540
oh wait, should I really do
this, the answer is oh yes,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.405
that, do that.

00:33:35.405 --> 00:33:36.280
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.071
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Sometimes it doesn't work,

00:33:38.071 --> 00:33:41.670
but most of the time it's
best to follow that Impulse.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.420
GRANT FAULKNER: And
you learn that impulse

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.000
to say, no but wait.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.060
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Mm-hmm.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.380
GRANT FAULKNER:
Through writing, right?

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.010
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Right.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.390
GRANT FAULKNER: And
through hearing that voice

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.640
and like, and then figuring
out, but that voice

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.580
isn't guiding you
to better stories.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.850
But that's the practice part.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:58.980
And it comes out of the
practice and the pushing things

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.070
through to a conclusion.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.230
Sometimes where I'm
like, should I do this?

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.560
And I put like three or
four ideas into a story.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.120
I think it was on
my second novel.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.449
One of those story plots,
arcs, had to disappear.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.760
But the other three were solid.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.550
And it's like, the thing I
wasn't going to put in there

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:19.679
became the thing
that I had to do.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.389
And so sometimes that writing,
you get it down there,

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:23.770
you're happy with
it that moment,

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.650
sometimes you're
happy about editing.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.110
I would be happy if I finished
the series that I'm writing,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.670
which is rather long.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.520
But one of them the
moments that I really liked

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.429
was when I was at a convention
and someone came up to me

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.030
and said, I read
your book, and I

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.679
was delighted to find out that
your character is like me.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.960
Because no one had
written that for her.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.290
ANTHONY FRANCIS: And
so that, in a way,

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.780
even if I never
finish the series,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.540
that moment of a
reader's delight,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.936
was a real moment
of success for me.

00:34:59.936 --> 00:35:00.810
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.530
ANTHONY FRANCIS: And
that's something else

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.750
you talked about in your book,
is like how we define success.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.660
GRANT FAULKNER:
Yeah, I think one

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:12.360
of the questions I get
asked most frequently is,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.289
how many people--

00:35:14.289 --> 00:35:16.080
like, what do you do
with all these novels?

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.730
Sometimes at it's
most disparaging,

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.780
it's asked like that.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.880
And so this year for
National Novel Writing Month,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.800
we'll have possibly 350,000
people sign up to write novels,

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.990
and we have a consistent--

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:32.100
relatively consistent-- about
15% of them will finish.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.210
So what is that?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.880
That's about close
to 50,000 novels.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.464
And so the question is--

00:35:37.464 --> 00:35:39.630
when they say, what do you
do with all these novels,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.730
the reason I call it
disparaging is that I think

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.170
behind that question,
people think

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.220
that every novel has to have
the goal of being published

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.370
or that every novel--

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.740
it's putting, it's making a
novel into a product, right?

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.960
Like, why do this if you're not
going to make money from it?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.620
But NaNoWriMo exists in part--

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.090
I mean in large part--

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.490
to awaken people's
creativity, and to do--

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.440
to be creative for the
sake of being creative.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.890
And I think of sometimes
like, if you started knitting,

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.110
and you told a friend that
you were starting to knit,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.610
they wouldn't say,
oh, are you going

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.002
to open up a sweater shop?

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.960
Like they wouldn't take
it that goal, end goal.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.110
And I think you could like
say, I'm taking guitar lessons,

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.810
and you wouldn't ask me, oh are
you going to form a rock band

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.900
and try to get top 40 hits?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.680
I think you can play
the guitar and knit

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.900
and just enjoy it as
an activity itself.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.154
And the same with writing.

00:36:27.154 --> 00:36:28.320
And that's not to say that--

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.810
I mean, I have
goals of publishing,

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:35.370
and I welcome bestseller lists,
if they find their way to me.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.320
But I also think that there's
a deeper gift in writing.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.140
And that's what I
really like to observe.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.460
And let me read--

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.351
this is the final
chapter of the book.

00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:45.100
And maybe we should
take questions after--

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.230
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Yeah,
I was just thinking.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.370
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:53.500
In fact, I won't read--

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.430
you know what?

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.720
What if we take questions now?

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.904
I just noticed we
only have 20 minutes.

00:36:57.904 --> 00:37:00.070
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Yeah, so
15 minutes, actually, so--

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.610
GRANT FAULKNER: 15 minutes?

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.530
So why don't I skip the
reading, because I'd

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.150
love to answer your questions.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.730
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Yeah,
so we have a mic,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.010
so if you'd like to--

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.040
GRANT FAULKNER: And I hear that
David will give anybody who

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.140
asks a question a free book.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.311
And he has 20 books.

00:37:17.311 --> 00:37:19.060
ANTHONY FRANCIS: So
you must enter to win.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.810
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.154
Where's my book?

00:37:27.154 --> 00:37:28.457
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Very meta.

00:37:28.457 --> 00:37:30.790
AUDIENCE: I've been doing
NaNoWriMo for quite some time,

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.070
but I'm one of those people
you call a rebel who's

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.220
been doing kind of--

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.320
I did the same
novel over and over,

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.690
then I abandoned it to write
a bunch of short stories.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:44.130
I have had some published
locally, which is kind of nice.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:48.040
I put-- bundled a few together
and put them on Kindle.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.060
But how do you feel about--

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.390
if-- I'm going to do NaNoWriMo
again, I'm wondering,

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.010
should I go back
to my old novel?

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.630
Or maybe I should
start a new one?

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.770
Or--

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:02.200
GRANT FAULKNER: So
this is a really--

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.210
it's tough for me every
year to decide what

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.160
I'm going to do in NaNoWriMo.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.420
I've also been a rebel.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.090
Sometimes I need to
revise one of those novels

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:13.150
I didn't quite get
to from years ago.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.780
Time-- I can't
keep up with time.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:22.690
But I mean, my short
answer is to write what

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.820
stories tend to attract you.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.620
And sometimes they
attract you equally,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.750
but write what you're
most passionate about.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.140
So if you want to go back and
revise, like think about, like

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.420
am I going to be passionate
about that project?

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.860
Am I going to be
really energetic?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.214
Do I want to wake up
and see it every day?

00:38:38.214 --> 00:38:39.880
Because I think there's
something really

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.220
important about working
on something not just

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.140
to get it finished,
but to work about--

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.280
I don't think we
should abandon things

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.450
because they will get hard.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.450
The finishing part is
difficult. But I would try

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.172
to identify what's calling you.

00:38:51.172 --> 00:38:53.380
And I think that can be a
really mysterious question,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.920
and sometimes you
can't decide it

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.572
and you just have
to choose a project.

00:38:56.572 --> 00:38:58.405
AUDIENCE: I think that's
pretty good advice.

00:38:58.405 --> 00:38:58.750
Thank you.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.110
GRANT FAULKNER: Oh good.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.870
Good.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.110
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Yeah, I usually you

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.620
know try to take the
next project in my queue

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.230
and push it forward to
conclusion, because I've

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.550
seen a number of people that
once you reach that concluding

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.000
point on a book,
it's like a almost

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.970
magical sense of
perspective on what you've

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.340
done that helps you
figure out where you're

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.420
going to go next with it.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.360
But then I know a lot of other
writers that are just like,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.704
they go right up to that moment.

00:39:29.704 --> 00:39:31.370
And they're like,
what is calling to me?

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.430
And I know a very
prolific author.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.820
She's written, like, many books.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.490
And she has gotten 10,000
words into something and said,

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.560
this story isn't
speaking to me, and tries

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.230
to switch gears and just
write the other words

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.662
in some other project.

00:39:45.662 --> 00:39:49.270
So you-- it's got to figure
out what works for you.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.680
But NaNo is also a challenge.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.940
So figure out how you can use
it to help challenge yourself

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.710
while everyone else is
doing the same thing.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.710
Any the other questions?

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.251
GRANT FAULKNER:
Let's have some more.

00:40:01.251 --> 00:40:01.822
Yeah.

00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:04.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:04.664 --> 00:40:05.330
Thanks for this.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:05.871
This is cool.

00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:07.280
GRANT FAULKNER: Oh good.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.170
AUDIENCE: I guess
this is actually

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.378
related to the last question.

00:40:09.378 --> 00:40:12.197
I have a real problem
of writing a lot

00:40:12.197 --> 00:40:14.030
to the point where I'm
like just about done,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.282
and then being like, eh.

00:40:16.282 --> 00:40:17.990
And it's not that I
would like to submit,

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.031
or even I'll submit it
and then it gets rejected,

00:40:20.031 --> 00:40:21.050
and then I'm like, eh.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:25.062
Like, do you have any advice
around doing that last 5%?

00:40:25.062 --> 00:40:27.020
In terms of motivating
yourself, like something

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.090
that you are excited about, and
you're just like, kind of done

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.230
writing, and like--

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.530
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.322
AUDIENCE: Like NaNo

00:40:31.322 --> 00:40:33.738
GRANT FAULKNER: Are these like
novels that you've written?

00:40:33.738 --> 00:40:35.670
AUDIENCE: No, no like
short stories or essays.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.110
Pretty short.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.776
GRANT FAULKNER: So
you just want to like

00:40:37.776 --> 00:40:39.140
think about how to finish them?

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:39.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.033
GRANT FAULKNER: You're the
type of marathon runner

00:40:42.033 --> 00:40:44.650
who quits at the 23 mile mark
and goes for the Gatorade?

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.150
Or--

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.800
AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.760
No, I don't know, actually.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.176
GRANT FAULKNER:
Sorry, I'm joking.

00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:48.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.040
No, I think finishing--
it is super tough.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.190
And the reason the reason
I was questioning my answer

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:59.030
previously there was that
sometimes if you choose

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.040
to write only what
you're passionate about,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.950
you might be leaving projects
before you're finished.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.375
So it really becomes
this question of,

00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:08.500
do I want to-- what are my
goals with this project?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.750
Do I really want to finish it?

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.125
If I want to finish
it, do I want

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:14.000
to revise it enough that I
can submit it for publication

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.820
or give it to a friend to read.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.470
So I mean, in the end it's--

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.184
finishing really is
about your goals.

00:41:21.184 --> 00:41:23.600
I mean, a lot of it is in the
chapter I didn't read there,

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.670
like, how do you define success?

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.935
And if you want to make
it to bestseller lists,

00:41:28.935 --> 00:41:31.310
then you're going to have to
think about all those rounds

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:32.780
of revision and the willpower.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.164
Because it does take willpower.

00:41:35.164 --> 00:41:36.830
Writing a novel-- I
mean, and the reason

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:40.320
I brought up the marathon too--
writing a novel is a marathon.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.590
NaNoWriMo is a marathon
unto itself for a month,

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.870
but then going beyond
that and revising.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:45.662
It gets very tough.

00:41:45.662 --> 00:41:47.619
And every writer has
those moments where you're

00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:50.300
looking at it, the project, and
you're just full of self-doubt

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.090
or you're exhausted and you're
like, why am I doing this?

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:54.410
Does this even matter?

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:57.010
I mean, I spent 10
years on one novel

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:00.560
that I guess I "finished"
it in the sense that it's

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.320
gone through numerous drafts,
but I haven't finished it

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.720
in that it's solid enough for
me to publish or submit, really.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.100
But I also have decided--

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.080
I don't know, maybe I
will return to this.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.030
There's part of
me that's decided

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.470
it's just that it's just
necessary to leave it behind.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.400
It's not-- and that isn't to
say it's not calling me anymore,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.830
despite all that--

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.400
the wasted thousands
of hours I put into it.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.660
But we'll see, So I think
there are all these,

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.276
like, crazy decision points in
making and finishing a novel.

00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:32.150
But it's a gift when
you're finished with it.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.877
It feels so good to have
seen it all the way through.

00:42:34.877 --> 00:42:36.710
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Those
hours weren't wasted.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.090
GRANT FAULKNER:
They weren't wasted.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.589
Yeah, you're right, I totally
went against my message points

00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:42.510
there.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:44.770
They weren't wasted because
I was learning from them.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.642
And every novel is a new novel.

00:42:46.642 --> 00:42:47.350
That's the thing.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:48.800
Novelists-- it's always new.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.750
They're always-- it's
always a new challenge

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.541
to carry off a novel,
no matter what it is.

00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:55.790
So I hope that all those
missteps I took previously

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:56.780
are helping me now.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.630
ANTHONY FRANCIS: And flip for
everything that I've published,

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.570
anything that I've
written that is more than,

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.140
I don't know, 3,000 or 5,000
words long, every single one

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.380
of those, there was some point
where I wanted to quit and say,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.050
OK, this isn't calling
to me anymore, even when

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.470
I was close to the end.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:19.520
So you're not alone, and
if it's calling to you,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.500
you will reach a point
where you want to stop,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.440
but if you're this
close, just go for it.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.660
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:25.650
I'll say one more
thing, and then I

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.650
want to hear the next two
questions, definitely.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.565
Ray Bradbury said, to
become a good writer,

00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:30.940
you have to write
several hundred

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.790
thousand throwaway words.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.530
I've heard people say a million.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.170
I don't know.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.378
Anyway, the premise is,
you've got to practice a lot.

00:43:37.378 --> 00:43:39.300
So keep writing.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.040
How about you?

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:40.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Hey.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:41.340
Thanks for being here.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.180
I learned a lot--

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.250
GRANT FAULKNER: Great.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:43.170
AUDIENCE: From this.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.790
So I was surprised, one
of the things I learned

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.956
was what you said about
Toni Morrison, how she spent

00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:48.900
15 minutes each
evening, and you gave

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.360
the example of, like, if you
took 30 minutes, five days

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.410
a week, 50 weeks a year, you
could have a novel if not two.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.410
How do you, with those
little increments daily,

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.240
create a cohesive story?

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.600
I mean, in my mind, by the
time I started writing,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.410
15 minutes have
passed and I'm just

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.670
kind of getting in the flow.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.600
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah,
well keep in the flow.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.560
If you're in the flow
and have momentum,

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.840
keep going, definitely.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.080
I mean, in terms of how you
stitch together a whole novel,

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.010
I mean, people have
a lot of different--

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.900
every novelist kind of has a
different approach, I think.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.020
And I know back to the
planning-- some novelists

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.256
I know, they plan their
novel so meticulously

00:44:31.256 --> 00:44:32.130
before they write it.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.590
I mean, they have really
detailed outlines,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:37.050
they have software that
helps them do a timeline.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.530
They really get into
the thinking it through.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.060
And that helps them write.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.770
And that's great.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.390
That doesn't help me right.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.600
When I write an outline, I
feel like I get pigeonholed,

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.711
my story idea becomes rigid, I
have a hard time breaking out

00:44:51.711 --> 00:44:52.210
of that.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.480
So I feel like I'm writing
more towards the outline

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.620
and not enough
towards the story.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.120
So I just need an idea of
where the story is going,

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.520
kind of its direction
or trajectory,

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.560
and then I write towards that.

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.960
And that's because I like
to write for the mysteries

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.279
of my characters and the story.

00:45:08.279 --> 00:45:10.320
And I think that that
happens without an outline,

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.910
for me at least.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.980
If you're writing in 15 minute
increments a day, though,

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.036
and if you haven't
outlined your novel,

00:45:18.036 --> 00:45:20.410
I would say you like you could
trust that you're creating

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.090
a momentum with that every day.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.050
And the reason I say--

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.900
the good thing about
doing that every day is

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.400
if you do that once
every two weeks,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.342
you're not really
creating momentum.

00:45:28.342 --> 00:45:29.800
But if you do it
every day, there's

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.020
something happening in your
brain, whereas like right now,

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.561
somewhere in your brain, you'll
be thinking about that story,

00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:36.220
or when you go to sleep tonight.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.389
And I think that is
like a valuable--

00:45:38.389 --> 00:45:40.180
and that's again, the
premise of this book.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.850
The reason there's 52 essays.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.560
It's just-- keep being
creative year round,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.367
and it will build
into something bigger.

00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:47.200
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.534
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah, thank you.

00:45:48.534 --> 00:45:49.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.954
How do you balance brevity?

00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:52.870
How do you trade off
between like a high level

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.930
of detail, more of a
sense of a real time flow,

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.410
versus getting more
quickly through the plot,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.390
getting past boring
bits, et cetera?

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:03.600
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah, it's--

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.280
I'm sure every writer has a
different approach to this

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:06.940
as well.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:10.710
But for me, like, at least
within the NaNoWriMo framework,

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.960
part of the making the perfect
sentence, which I think

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.222
you were alluding to, like I--

00:46:16.222 --> 00:46:17.680
and that's great,
sometimes writing

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.160
the perfect sentence can give
me momentum to keep going.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.210
And you can feel
your story better.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.830
I at least personally
got too hung up

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.750
on creating the perfect
sentence before going on.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.750
And so NaNoWriMo,
the reason I like it,

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.600
is because it is this--
like the point of every word

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:37.780
is progress and to see, like, to
reach that point in one draft.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.410
And for me at
least, I need that.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.520
It might be--

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.280
I mean, it it is for
me a way of exploring

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.850
like the plotline of
the story in a way

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:51.700
that I can't do it
with an outline.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.070
So it gets to be that
kind of like struggle

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.840
with the inner
editor, I think, where

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.510
it's that practice, at least for
me, to banish the inner editor

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.560
and to favor progress.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.720
I'm not sure if I'm
getting to your question.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.345
Am I?

00:47:02.345 --> 00:47:02.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.011
GRANT FAULKNER: OK, good.

00:47:04.011 --> 00:47:05.300
Thank you.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.550
AUDIENCE: I'm supposed to
know all this stuff already,

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.633
so I don't really have a--

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:10.778
GRANT FAULKNER: No writer
knows all the stuff.

00:47:10.778 --> 00:47:13.400
AUDIENCE: So I'm going to
throw you a softball-- both you

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.800
guys, actually.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.920
What is the thing that you are--

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.647
that you most look forward to
every year with National Novel

00:47:21.647 --> 00:47:22.230
Writing Month?

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.950
Like, I always feel like
it's kind of like a festival

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.110
almost, right, and I love--

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.650
I look forward to it every year.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.620
But what is the thing
about it that you're most

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:31.760
looking for to?

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.412
What is the thing about it
that you most struggle with

00:47:34.412 --> 00:47:36.620
or that you anticipate you're
going to struggle with?

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:40.430
And then like, have you decided
what you're going to write?

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.170
GRANT FAULKNER: So, looking
forward to, most struggle with,

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:44.420
and what I'm going to write.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:44.990
Can I let Anthony?

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:47.115
Anthony hasn't talked in
a while, can I let you go?

00:47:47.115 --> 00:47:49.150
ANTHONY FRANCIS: OK.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.500
What I'm looking
forward to is there's

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.550
this real tension
between the moment where

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:59.240
I submit my final word count
and go, oh, thank god I made it.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.210
Because that has been
actually like on 11 o'clock

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.630
on last night from time,
and then there's an event

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.820
called the Night of
Writing Dangerously, which

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:12.260
is a big just
celebration of NaNo,

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.800
and that's a really
a really fun event.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:21.170
What I struggle with most
is there's this point--

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:26.750
doesn't happen every time,
but my life gets in the way,

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.060
and I don't start right on time.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.180
And then I end up like 5,000
or 10,000 words behind,

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.060
and I am behind, and I
reach this point where

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:41.400
I hit the 25,000 word mark and
I'm like five days or even 10

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.160
days behind.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.440
And I'm like, oh my gosh
the month, is almost up.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.110
And then I have to
go into this crunch.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:50.910
And that's the
thing that I dread

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.800
and try to avoid by trying
to get started earlier.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:01.200
And the project I'm working
on is called "BotNet".

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.870
It's the second book.

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.140
So I have an adult series about
Dakota Frost, a magical tattoo

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.330
artist, and she's adopted
and weretiger child

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.600
called Cinnamon Frost, and I'm
writing the second young adult

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.102
book for NaNo.

00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:17.310
GRANT FAULKNER: I think the
thing I'm looking forward

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.479
to is, at least
most NaNo's, when

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:22.020
I'm starting a new
project, this kind

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.478
of gets into the
third answer here,

00:49:23.478 --> 00:49:27.020
but the start of the novel.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:31.200
Just-- there is
something, it's a gift

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.080
to have an idea for
a novel and then

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.640
to write the first words of it
and to get it out of the chute

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.780
and into the world.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.050
It's just a kind of
magical feeling I think.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:45.690
The biggest challenge actually
happens about like week two.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:49.050
Like I follow the typical
trajectory of most NaNo

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.720
writers, where out of
the gate that first week,

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.520
you're just like, the
words are gushing,

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.350
you feel so good
about the story.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.120
You have so much momentum.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.900
But the second and third
weeks can be really grueling.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.109
I call them the muddy
middle of NaNoWriMo,

00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:05.400
where you're literally kind
of walking through a swamp.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.740
And it's super
tough to keep going,

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.410
and per what Anthony was saying
about when you fall behind

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.020
on your word count,
it is inevitable

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.422
that in the month of
November, you will get sick,

00:50:15.422 --> 00:50:17.204
you will have a big
project at work.

00:50:17.204 --> 00:50:18.120
Something will happen.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.470
There's just something
about the month of November

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.370
that it attacts these things.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:26.227
And but the thing is is not
to let that getting behind

00:50:26.227 --> 00:50:27.060
affect your writing.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.830
Like, the premise
of our event is

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:30.540
like, we want people
to write, and we

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.810
want them to keep writing.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:33.810
So if you can't
hit 50,000 words,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.540
if you only hit 25,000
words go for that.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.392
The main thing is to
get your novel going.

00:50:40.392 --> 00:50:41.850
I have so many
people come up to me

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:44.550
and say, I only wrote 10,000
words during November.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.620
Well, there's no
only to 10,000 words.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.819
That's a lot of words to write.

00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:50.610
And let me think-- your
third question was?

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.780
Oh, what am I writing?

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.590
AUDIENCE: Just,
have you decided?

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:53.000
You don't have to--

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:53.380
GRANT FAULKNER: Have I decided?

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:53.730
You know what?

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:54.660
I have not decided.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.920
This is a crazy year.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.890
I'm thinking about
going back to a novel I

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:02.250
started over the summer, and
I have 75,000 words on it.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.834
I want to start something new,
but I also want to finish that.

00:51:04.834 --> 00:51:05.333
Yeah.

00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:06.000
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.877
Thank you.

00:51:07.877 --> 00:51:08.960
GRANT FAULKNER: All right.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.655
OK.

00:51:09.655 --> 00:51:10.850
Only one more question?

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.932
We talked too much.

00:51:12.932 --> 00:51:13.640
We're can do two.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.515
We'll go really fast.

00:51:14.515 --> 00:51:15.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.880
Arguably your whole talk
has been about this,

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.760
but in case you have
anything particular,

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.610
I used to try to write,
every once in a while I'd

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.160
find a story which
I'd do, and I would.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.470
But mostly I'm a perfectionist,
I would just there.

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:30.360
I can't write anything
that isn't perfect.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:30.930
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.430
AUDIENCE: I could
do that for hours.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.580
So do you have anything
which would address that?

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.889
GRANT FAULKNER: About
the-- being-- writing--

00:51:37.889 --> 00:51:38.930
you're really embracing--

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.190
AUDIENCE: And beyond that.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.606
GRANT FAULKNER:
Your inner editor.

00:51:40.606 --> 00:51:41.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:42.860
GRANT FAULKNER: You know what?

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.060
I would get really messy.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.320
I would do the opposite
of your inclinations.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.340
Like if you're a neat freak
kid, I would go out and just

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.910
jump in a mud puddle.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.690
I have a chapter in this
book, actually, which is--

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:01.320
it's more about embracing
the absurd or the surreal,

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.850
but I think, like, sometimes--

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:04.920
or to be more playful.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.310
Like, there is a kind of playful
spirit to kids finger painting

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:09.700
and getting messy too.

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.520
And so I think I think
I'd practice that.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.170
I think I'd practice
being playful

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:16.350
and getting messy and then
just that general practice,

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.562
like, building that muscle of
banishing the inner editor.

00:52:19.562 --> 00:52:20.520
And write with abandon.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.780
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:22.988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Thanks.

00:52:22.988 --> 00:52:24.970
ANTHONY FRANCIS: Yeah
I'm on board with that.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:28.560
I feel like getting playful
is probably the best

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.210
thing that you can do for that.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:35.550
And the most analytical
writing instructors you find

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:38.400
will tell you you need to
put aside your inner editor

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.510
because you just you can't
edit it with the speed

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.330
that you can speak and create.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.240
Editing is done consciously,
writing inspiration

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.420
comes from the flow
of your subconscious

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.230
and you need to just let it rip.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.060
GRANT FAULKNER: I'll mention
one exercise Julia Cameron--

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.570
she's a kind of writing
guru, creative guru--

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.810
and she says that morning
papers is what she calls them?

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:01.650
You know about them?

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:02.340
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Morning pages, yeah.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:03.120
GRANT FAULKNER:
Morning pages, yeah.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.610
You just-- you just write
anything, two or three pages

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:06.360
or for 20 minutes.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.859
I can't remember
how she defines it.

00:53:07.859 --> 00:53:09.070
But that would help.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.030
Do we have time for
one more question?

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.779
SPEAKER: One more.

00:53:10.779 --> 00:53:12.371
GRANT FAULKNER: One more, OK.

00:53:12.371 --> 00:53:14.290
AUDIENCE: Yes, I made it.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:16.120
GRANT FAULKNER: Good.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.110
AUDIENCE: I just was
really curious, like,

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.810
what you guys think
makes a great writer?

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.860
I mean, anyone can write,
but what makes you a great--

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.360
what makes you stand out?

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.920
And then secondly, what is
your favorite novel or book?

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.821
GRANT FAULKNER: Gosh
that first question.

00:53:33.821 --> 00:53:37.910
Do you have a whole semester
we can explore that?

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.570
I mean, so I'll give
you a short definition.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.100
And this is in
relation to all the,

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.630
like, how to write
great suspense,

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.320
how to rate a great plot,
how to write great dialogue.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.770
There are hundreds of
books on that subject.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:52.550
And they all matter,
like writing craft

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:54.680
does matter to
writing a good story.

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.220
But I think what matters more
than that is a story where

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.220
the author makes him or
herself vulnerable on the page

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.550
and really connects with
the reader heart to heart.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:05.300
And so it's that heart
to heart connection

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.644
about a story that
you can relate to

00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:09.560
and that really gives
you meaning in your life

00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.772
that makes that novel great.

00:54:10.772 --> 00:54:12.230
And it's great in
your mind, right?

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.200
That's all that matters.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.783
It doesn't have to
be considered great

00:54:14.783 --> 00:54:18.317
by, whatever, a whole panel
of judges or something.

00:54:18.317 --> 00:54:19.400
So that's my short answer.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.840
And then, let me see,
your second question was?

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.920
AUDIENCE: Favorite book.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.461
GRANT FAULKNER: Oh,
my favorite book.

00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:26.744
That is the single most
impossible question to answer.

00:54:26.744 --> 00:54:28.910
I mean, I really do have
hundreds of favorite books,

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.409
and they're probably
all equivalent.

00:54:30.409 --> 00:54:34.340
I just, strangely enough you
ask that, just in last Sunday's

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.860
"San Francisco Chronicle" in
their book review section,

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.700
I was asked to tell about my
most treasured book, which

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.460
is a book called
"Under the Volcano".

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.420
And the reason I had
to come up with one

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.320
for the sake of the
article, but it's

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.360
a treasured book in the sense of
like when I read it in my life

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.019
and what it meant during
that period of my life.

00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:54.560
And it was "Under
the Volcano", which

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.960
is just one of the craziest
novels ever written, too.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.560
It's really wonderful novel.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.180
ANTHONY FRANCIS: So, oh.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.000
Let's see.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.766
So my-- I'm going to
steal someone else's--

00:55:06.766 --> 00:55:08.140
I don't remember
who to attribute

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.230
this to-- that writers write,
good writers write about what

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:13.630
they love, great writers
make other people

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.150
love what they love.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:19.150
And I think if you can move
people, you're a great writer,

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:23.230
and it all depends on what
genre or area you're aiming for

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.810
and there's different
criteria for that.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:31.000
As for the best book, I could
easily list half a dozen,

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.420
from "Ulysses" to "Atlas
Shrugged" to "Ringworld".

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.940
The two that leap to
mind most are short

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.340
would be "Old Man and
the Sea" by Hemingway,

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.010
and long form would
be "American Gods"

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:49.300
by Neil Gaiman, or possibly
"Gravity's Rainbow" by Thomas

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:49.822
Pynchon.

00:55:49.822 --> 00:55:50.780
GRANT FAULKNER: Mm-hmm.

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.990
ANTHONY FRANCIS: See, I got like
six in there instead of one.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:54.906
GRANT FAULKNER: Yeah,
you covered some genres.

00:55:54.906 --> 00:55:55.750
Cool.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.260
Well thank you so
much for coming.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:00.670
I think we have a writing
workshop now for 45 minutes.

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:02.710
And also I'm happy to sign--

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:05.380
I don't know if we have time
for me to sign books too?

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.120
Does that happen at the end
of the 45 minute workshop?

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.722
OK, cool.

00:56:08.722 --> 00:56:09.680
Well Thank you so much.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.930
These are great questions.

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:11.220
I appreciate you
guys coming out.

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.160
ANTHONY FRANCIS:
Thank you for coming.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.013
GRANT FAULKNER:
Yeah, yeah, thank you

00:56:13.013 --> 00:56:14.054
for your great questions.

00:56:14.054 --> 00:56:15.490
Yeah.
