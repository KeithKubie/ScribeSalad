00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.340
Now that we have
a parameterization

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.090
for the boundary of our
surface right up here,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.039
let's think a little bit
about what the line integral--

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.700
and this was the left side of
our original Stokes' theorem

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.820
statement-- what the line
integral over the path

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.320
C of F, our original vector
field F, dot dr is going to be.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.940
And now, once
again, this R we're

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.400
talking about the path of
this boundary right over here,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.480
C. Not C1 that we
did to kind of get

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.830
some of our foundational
material going.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.250
So F dot dr-- well,
we remember what F is.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.010
F was all the way up here.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.340
Its i, j, and k components
were just P, Q, and R.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.050
So that's kind of
easy to remember.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.730
But let's think about
what dr is equal to.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.230
And we're going to
have to break out

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.771
a little bit of our
three-dimensional

00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:54.310
or our multivariable chain
rule right over here.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:03.701
So dr is the same thing
as dr dt times dt.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.200
So we really just
have to figure out

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.540
what the derivative of
R with respect to t.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.320
And this one we're going
to have to break out

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.611
a little bit of the chain rule.

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:10.960
So let me write this down.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.450
So dr dt is going to be
equal to the derivative of x

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.462
with respect to t times i
plus the derivative of y

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:25.920
with respect to
t-- I'm just taking

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.590
the derivative with
respect to t-- j.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.980
Because z is a function of
x, which is a function of t,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.460
and z is also a function of
y, which is a function of t,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.032
we're going to have to break out
our multivariable chain rule.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.740
So if we want to take
the derivative of z

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.698
with respect to t-- I'll
do it separately here,

00:01:43.698 --> 00:01:45.370
and then I'll write
it down down here.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.950
The derivative of z with respect
to t-- the way I conceptualize

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.420
is, what's all the
different ways that z

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.800
can change from a change in t?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.670
Well, it could
change because x is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.230
changing due to a change in t.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.490
So z could change due
to x, the partial of z

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.555
with respect to x, when x
changes with respect to t.

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:08.680
But then that's not the
only way that z can change.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.920
We have to add to that how z
can change with respect to y,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.130
partial of z with respect
to y times how fast

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.920
or how y is changing
with respect to t.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.390
And this is just our
multivariable chain rule.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.430
And so this is dz dt.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.170
So I'll just write
it right over here.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.610
And I'll use slightly
different notation

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.651
that's consistent with
what we were doing before,

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.140
and it'll help make things
a little bit clearer.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.650
So it's going to be the partial
of z with respect to x, dx dt,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.010
plus-- actually, let
me write it this way--

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.490
plus the partial of z
with respect to y dy dt.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.830
And then we're going to
multiply everything times our k.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.340
So with this out of the way,
if we wanted what dr is,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.410
dr is just going to be
this whole thing times dt.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.780
So let's do that.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.130
So now we can rewrite our
line integral right over here.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.260
And we're going to now
go into the t domain.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.820
And so t is going to
go between a and b.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.820
And F dot dr--
remember, F's components

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.760
were just the functions P,
Q, and R. And each of those

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.540
were functions of x, y, and z.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.490
And z is a function
of x and y, so we'll

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.490
have to think about all
of that in a little bit.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.010
Use a little more of our
multivariable chain rule.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.700
But when we take
the dot products,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.460
we're just going to take
the corresponding components

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.290
and multiply them.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.050
So it is going to be-- actually,
let me just copy and paste it.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.439
Let me rewrite it down here.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.855
Our vector field
F-- and I'm going

00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:53.230
to write it a
little bit shorter.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.970
Our vector field F is P times i
plus Q times j plus R times k.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.570
So when we take our dot
product of F dot dr,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.120
we're essentially taking the
dot product of this and this.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.590
And we have to throw
a dt at the end.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:24.260
So we're going to get P
times dx dt plus Q times dy

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:35.160
dt plus R times all of
this business over here,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.370
which is the partial
of z with respect

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:46.130
to x dx dt plus the partial
of z with respect to y dy dt.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.240
And then we have to multiply
all of this times dt.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.060
We can't forget that
part right over there.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.002
So we're going to multiply all
of this right here times dt.

00:04:57.002 --> 00:04:58.960
Now, I'm going to leave
you there in this video

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.770
just because I'm afraid of
making careless mistakes.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.400
What we're going
to do now is we're

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.780
going to rearrange
this whole thing,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.860
recognize that this is the same
thing as this right over here.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.370
Then that gives it a form that
we can apply Green's theorem

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.870
using this boundary
right over here.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.660
And then when we do a little
bit more algebraic manipulation,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.590
we're going to see that this
thing simplifies to this thing

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.740
right over here
and proves Stokes'

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.830
theorem for our special case.
