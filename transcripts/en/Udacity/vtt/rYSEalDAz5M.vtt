00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.140
So let's see if we can figure out what

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.870
a lock variable really is. Suppose we have a

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.200
code like this. This code is similar to the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290
previous one, it's just written in C, so we

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.760
have lock, the lock that corresponds to element L, increment

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.172
account for L, unlock. The question for you is, what is count

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:25.388
lock of L? Is it just another location in shared memory, a location is some

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:29.276
sort of special synchronization memory, or a special variable

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:32.390
that doesn't really have a memory address at all?
