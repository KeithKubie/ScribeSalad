00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.670
Write 7/8 as a decimal.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.670
And so the main
realization here is

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.190
that 7/8 is the same
thing as 7 divided by 8,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.890
which is the same thing
as 7 divided by 8.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.180
These are all different ways
of writing the same thing.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.119
So let's actually
divide 8 into 7.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.660
And I'll do it down here just
so I have some more real estate

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.720
to work with.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm going to divide 8 into 7.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.250
And I'm going to add
a decimal point here,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.875
just because we know
that this value is

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.010
going to be less than 1.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.560
7/8 is less than 1.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.990
We're going to have
some digits to the right

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.260
of the decimal point.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.350
And let me put the decimal
point right up here,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470
right above the
decimal point in 7.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.770
And then we start dividing.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.210
And now this really turns
into a long division problem.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.260
And we just have to make sure we
keep track of the decimal sign.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.090
So 8 goes into-- it
doesn't go into 7 at all,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.590
but it does go into 70.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.220
So 8 goes into 70 eight times.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.040
So it goes into 70 eight times.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.830
8 times 8 is 64.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.290
And then you subtract.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.540
70 minus 64 is 6.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.042
And then bring down
another 0 because we still

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:17.750
have a remainder.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.840
We want to get to the point
that we have no remainders.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.839
Assuming that this thing
doesn't repeat forever.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:24.160
And there's other ways
we can deal with that.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.134
8 goes into 60?

00:01:26.134 --> 00:01:26.800
Well, let's see.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.120
It doesn't go into it eight
times because that's 64.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.310
8 goes into 60 seven times.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.210
7 times 8 is 56.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.300
And then we subtract again.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.740
60 minus 56 is 4.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.170
And now, we can bring down
another 0 right over here.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.370
And 8 goes into 40?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.340
Well, it goes into 40
exactly five times.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.480
5 times 8 is 40.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.090
And we have nothing.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.230
We have nothing left over.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.320
And so we're done.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.190
7 divided by 8 or 7/8 is
equal to 7 divided by 8,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.060
which is equal to 0.875.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.000
But I'll put a leading 0 here
just so it makes it clear

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.509
that this is where
the decimal is.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.950
0.875.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.830
And we are done.
