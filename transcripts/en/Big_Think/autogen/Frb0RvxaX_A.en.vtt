00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.000
 
so one of the things we're interested in

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
so one of the things we're interested in
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.650
so one of the things we're interested in
studying the monkeys for is because we

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660
studying the monkeys for is because we
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.150
studying the monkeys for is because we
want to see do they have the kinds of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
want to see do they have the kinds of
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.919
want to see do they have the kinds of
cognitive capacities that we have as

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
cognitive capacities that we have as
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.210
cognitive capacities that we have as
humans that we're really proud of and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
humans that we're really proud of and
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.400
humans that we're really proud of and
one of these things is what we call a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
one of these things is what we call a
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.510
one of these things is what we call a
theory of mind

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520
theory of mind
 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.580
theory of mind
it's complicated term but what it really

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
it's complicated term but what it really
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.440
it's complicated term but what it really
just means is the fact that when we look

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450
just means is the fact that when we look
 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.700
just means is the fact that when we look
out in the world and watch human

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
out in the world and watch human
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.009
out in the world and watch human
behavior we don't see just behavior we

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
behavior we don't see just behavior we
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630
behavior we don't see just behavior we
see all these things going on inside the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
see all these things going on inside the
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.609
see all these things going on inside the
head so we see other people's beliefs

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
head so we see other people's beliefs
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979
head so we see other people's beliefs
their intentions their desires that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
their intentions their desires that's
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.150
their intentions their desires that's
how we kind of make sense of the world

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
how we kind of make sense of the world
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060
how we kind of make sense of the world
it's a hard problem from a psychology

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
it's a hard problem from a psychology
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920
it's a hard problem from a psychology
perspective because we can't see any of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
perspective because we can't see any of
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690
perspective because we can't see any of
that stuff directly or making all these

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
that stuff directly or making all these
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310
that stuff directly or making all these
kind of crazy inferences about what's

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
kind of crazy inferences about what's
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319
kind of crazy inferences about what's
going on in others heads so lots of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
going on in others heads so lots of
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.580
going on in others heads so lots of
researchers have wondered do other

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
researchers have wondered do other
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319
researchers have wondered do other
animals do this can they go beyond what

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
animals do this can they go beyond what
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.110
animals do this can they go beyond what
they see and actually infer other things

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
they see and actually infer other things
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.090
they see and actually infer other things
the way we've tried to get at this is a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
the way we've tried to get at this is a
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.590
the way we've tried to get at this is a
little bit tricky we've said well what

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
little bit tricky we've said well what
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.420
little bit tricky we've said well what
are the contexts in which other species

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
are the contexts in which other species
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340
are the contexts in which other species
might use a theory of mind if they had

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
might use a theory of mind if they had
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080
might use a theory of mind if they had
them and the sad thing is that if you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
them and the sad thing is that if you
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119
them and the sad thing is that if you
think about evolution usually the way

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
think about evolution usually the way
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.799
think about evolution usually the way
other species might use a theory of mind

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
other species might use a theory of mind
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840
other species might use a theory of mind
is actually to out-compete others to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
is actually to out-compete others to
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.400
is actually to out-compete others to
deceive others to do kind of slightly

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410
deceive others to do kind of slightly
 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.200
deceive others to do kind of slightly
dastardly things with what they know

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
dastardly things with what they know
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630
dastardly things with what they know
about others beliefs and intentions so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
about others beliefs and intentions so
 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460
about others beliefs and intentions so
we set up a big series of studies at the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
we set up a big series of studies at the
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380
we set up a big series of studies at the
field site to actually see do the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
field site to actually see do the
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539
field site to actually see do the
monkeys know when it's a good time to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
monkeys know when it's a good time to
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670
monkeys know when it's a good time to
deceive us in other words do they pay

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
deceive us in other words do they pay
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410
deceive us in other words do they pay
attention to what we can see and what we

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
attention to what we can see and what we
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230
attention to what we can see and what we
know so the experiment is pretty simple

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
know so the experiment is pretty simple
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.649
know so the experiment is pretty simple
we set up a human who has some treat

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
we set up a human who has some treat
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.999
we set up a human who has some treat
that a monkeys might like like a piece

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
that a monkeys might like like a piece
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340
that a monkeys might like like a piece
of grape and we just vary whether the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
of grape and we just vary whether the
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.140
of grape and we just vary whether the
human can see the grape you know so he's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
human can see the grape you know so he's
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.370
human can see the grape you know so he's
either facing it or he's turned around

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
either facing it or he's turned around
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050
either facing it or he's turned around
he's a barrier in front of his face

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
he's a barrier in front of his face
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260
he's a barrier in front of his face
and what we do is just ask you know does

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
and what we do is just ask you know does
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910
and what we do is just ask you know does
a monkey subject try to steal it and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
a monkey subject try to steal it and
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920
a monkey subject try to steal it and
what we find is surprisingly the monkeys

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
what we find is surprisingly the monkeys
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569
what we find is surprisingly the monkeys
use pretty much the same cues that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
use pretty much the same cues that
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130
use pretty much the same cues that
humans used to decide when somebody

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
humans used to decide when somebody
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929
humans used to decide when somebody
could see them so they don't steal a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
could see them so they don't steal a
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880
could see them so they don't steal a
great for somebody's facing forward but

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
great for somebody's facing forward but
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.170
great for somebody's facing forward but
they do if somebody has turned to the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
they do if somebody has turned to the
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200
they do if somebody has turned to the
side or looking away so they're they're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
side or looking away so they're they're
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.190
side or looking away so they're they're
very good cheats and thieves but in in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
very good cheats and thieves but in in
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.539
very good cheats and thieves but in in
showing that they're good cheats and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
showing that they're good cheats and
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.590
showing that they're good cheats and
thieves we've actually been able to see

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
thieves we've actually been able to see
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630
thieves we've actually been able to see
they have some aspects of our own theory

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
they have some aspects of our own theory
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.909
they have some aspects of our own theory
of mind
