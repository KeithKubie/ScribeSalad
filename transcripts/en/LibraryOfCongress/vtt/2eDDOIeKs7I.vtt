00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.040
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good evening.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.340
&gt;&gt; Good Evening.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.170
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I'm Anne McLean,
from the library's Music Division.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.470
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.190
This is a great audience.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.360
We're very pleased tonight to
present a lecture by Marie Rolf.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.350
Debussy's Fascination With the
Exotic: From China to Spain.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.620
Dr. Rolf is Senior Associate Dean
of Graduate Studies and Professor

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.450
of Music Theory at the
Eastman School of Music.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.960 position:56%
As a scholar, her research interests
and publications range from analysis

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.150
and performance to the pedagogy
of music theory, and the music

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.900
and manuscripts of
Debussy and Mozart.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.980
Throughout her career,
Dr. Rolf has been noted

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
for her scholarly examinations
of the music of Claude Debussy,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.380 position:56%
through his exploration -- through
her explorations of his manuscripts,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
beginning as early as her
graduate studies at Eastman.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.950
Here at the Library of
Congress, I'm very glad to say

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.260
that she has studied a
number of our sources,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.080
and she'll be talking
about that tonight.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.810
She's the editor of the critical
edition of Debussy's "La Mer,"

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.140
and has also published
his "Seguidilla"

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.330
with the composer's
publisher, Durand.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.620
Currently, she is editing
a volume of his early songs

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.960
to be included in his
complete works.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.490
At the Eastman School, in her work
as dean, Dr. Rolf has initiated

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.640
and developed a number of new
diploma and certificate programs.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.870
Among these are orchestral studies,
ethnomusicology, and sacred music.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.710
It's really a pleasure to
have her here as a lecturer

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.600
under the auspices of the
library's Music Division.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.510
Please welcome Dr. Marie Rolf.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:07.620
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.920
&gt;&gt; Marie Rolf: Well, thank you.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.610
And thank you all for being here.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.560
I'm grateful to the Library of
Congress for your kind invitation

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.330 position:56%
for me to speak about one of my very
favorite composers, Claude Debussy,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.120
and specifically, about two
songs-one of the manuscripts

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.520
of which is on the table to
my right, and the other is

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.430
in a microfilm here at
the Library of Congress.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.260
It is my hope that
during the next hour,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.790
you'll come to share my excitement
and enthusiasm in discovering

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.360
and hearing these largely unknown
works by this marvelous composer.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.720
So here we go.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.320
Debussy's Fascination With the
Exotic: From China to Spain.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.350 position:56%
Throughout his life, Claude
Debussy was captivated by exoticism.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.020 position:56%
Which essentially involves the
notion of a fascinating other-world.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.830
That is tantalizingly different
from one's native culture.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.950
Some of Debussy's best-loved
compositions, works like "Pagodes"

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.150
from his "Estampes" for piano,
and "Ibéria" from the orchestral

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.050
"Images" conjure up
landscapes of faraway places,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.540
from the Orient to Spain.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.470
As a cosmopolitan and
relatively well traveled Parisian,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.940
he was exposed to the
traditions, sights,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.530
and sounds of other cultures.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.350
In addition, many of Debussy's
closest friends opened his eyes

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.910 position:56%
vicariously to the art and aesthetic
values of other civilizations.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.770
Among them were: Edmond
Bailly, whose bookshop,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.800
the Librairie de l'Art Independent,
was a hotbed for Orientalism

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.360
and esotericism; Pierre
Louÿs and Paul-Jean Toulet,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.840
whose extravagant travels ranged
from Egypt and Algeria, to Tonkin;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.670
and Louis Laloy and Victor
Segalen, whose work took them

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.650
to the Far East; and as
Edward Said has reminded us,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.070
Paris was "the capital
of the Orientalist world"

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.460
by the turn-of-the-century,
when Debussy was in his prime.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.190
In my presentation today, I aim

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.070
to demonstrate how Debussy
absorbed those influences,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.280
and perhaps most importantly
how they served as a catalyst

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.880
in the process of his
own compositional growth.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.430
To that end, I will highlight
two of his songs in particular:

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.400
the "Rondel Chiniois"
and "Séguidille,"

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.820
treasures whose manuscripts are
preserved in the Music Division,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.600
here at the Library of Congress

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.160
and that were never published
during Debussy's lifetime.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.570
In fact, the "Rondel Chinois"
finally appeared only in 2013.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.780
Edited privately by Nigel Foster,
for the London Song Festival,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.490
and "Séguidille" was released by
Durand-Debussy's own publisher,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.550
in a score edited by yours
truly in August 2014.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.910
The manuscript of the "Rondel
Chinois" has been housed

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.850
at the Library of Congress
since 1930 when it was purchased

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.370
from Henry Pennier, by Carl
Engel, and the manuscript

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.160
of "Séguidille" is currently
in a private collection.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.250
Whose owner has graciously
shared a microfilm

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.130
of it with the Music Division.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.150
Debussy was still a teenager when
he composed the "Rondel Chinois."

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.250
While he had not yet had personal
encounters with Eastern music,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.570
he could not have escaped the craze

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.340
in Paris during his formative
years, for art of the Orient.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.870
Following the opening of trade
channels between the East

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.280
and West in the mid-19th century.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.130
The European market was flooded
with articles such as prints,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.010
ceramics, furniture, ivories.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.120
Silk and bronze works
from China and Japan.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.560
Dealers like Siegfried Bing began

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.880
to import Orientalist
objects in the 1870s.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.100
From 1888 until '91, he
published a monthly journal called

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.990
"Le Japon Artistique," and by
1895 he opened a shop called l'Art

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.810
Nouveau in the 9th arrondissement.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.120 position:56%
If you look over the doorway there
you can see the words l'Art Nouveau.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.550 position:56%
This is slightly later architecture,
but an example of architecture

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.760
from the 1860's, that was conceived

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.660
in Oriental style is
the Bataclan Theater.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.530
Originally a cafe-concert,
but which has been

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.990
in the news this past weekend as
you know, for very sad reasons,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.170
as the site of a devastating
terrorist attack.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:25.270 position:56%
And the black-and-white photo on the
left is a photo from around 1900.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:32.110
The theater opened in 1865, but it
still has its original pagoda roof

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.240
and is very Orientalist-style.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.000
And the color photo on the
bottom right is from 2008,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.520
when it has just recently
been-had recently been painted.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.520
Other individuals, like Enrico
Cernuschi, a patriot who fled Italy

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.010
after the 1848 revolution
and relocated to Paris,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.400
where he would become
a wealthy banker,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.220
collected Oriental art
on a massive scale.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.660
Disheartened by the Paris
commune of 1871, Cernuschi decided

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.230
to escape the turmoil in his
adoptive city and traveled

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.880
around the world from 1871
to '73, during which time,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.620
he purchased approximately
5,000 artworks.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.840
Many of them Chinese bronzes.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.580
Upon returning to Paris, he
displayed them at the Palace

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.050
of Industry, contributing to the
emergence of a Japonisme in France.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.020
Today, one can still view
his fabulous art collection

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.910
at his former home, now the Musée
Cernuschi in the Parc Monceau.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.960
Artists in Europe embraced
exotic elements from the East,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.770 position:56%
celebrating its linear qualities
and lavish colors in their canvases.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.850
As early as 1875, Claude
Monet memorialized his wife

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.240
in kimono dress in this
flamboyant painting now preserved

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.340
at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.390
There she is.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.730
In 1886-7, Vincent
van Gogh portrayed

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.890
"Le Père Tanguy" three times,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:26.280
the third of which most
unabashedly reflects Orientalism.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.840
That same year, van Gogh quite
literally copied two prints

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.540
by the great Japanese
Ukiyo-e artist, Hiroshige.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.540
The first is the Flowering Plum
Tree"-that's Hiroshige's woodblock

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:47.230
from 1857, and here is
van Gogh's copy from 1887.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.400
Also, Hiroshige's "Bridge In the
Rain"- I love that rain coming

00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:00.560
down diagonally, from 1857 and
van Gogh's copy 20 years later.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.300
Even James McNeill Whistler,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.730
so well-known for his monochromatic
portraits and watery nocturnes,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.750
could not resist the
lure of the East.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.370
In 1863, he began painting
"The Princess from the Land

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.260
of Porcelain," which eventually was
incorporated into the Peacock Room,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.000 position:56%
now in the Freer Gallery, here in
Washington, D.C. The Japanese screen

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.680
in the background may have
belonged to Whistler himself,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.860
who passionately collected
Oriental objects, including china,

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.460
lacquerware, and Japanese
woodblock prints.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:46.080
And here she is in C2 in
the Peacock Room with many

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.380
of those ceramics along the wall.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:55.780
The contemporary musicians and
writers in France were not immune

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.990
to this pervasive influence
of exoticism.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:05.750
In the decade between 1875, when
Bizet's "Carmen" was premiered

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:12.530
in Paris, and 1885, when Gilbert
and Sullivan's "Mikado" opened

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.570
in London, French stage works
were teeming with exotic subjects.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:24.020
From Delibes' "Lakme" to Massenet's
"Le Roi de Lahore" and " Le Cid."

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.610
The Goncourt brothers were
actively chronicling Parisian art

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.630
and society, Including
the rage for Orientalism.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.260
They avidly followed
Cernuschi and began themselves

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.840
to collect Japanese prints
and Chinese porcelain,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.610
displaying these objects
in their home,

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.900
amidst their 18th-century French
treasures, often commenting

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.570
on the resonances between the
arts of the East and West.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.410
Later, in the 1890s, Edmond de
Goncourt published on the works

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:01.970
of Hokusai and Utamaro, whom
he called the Watteau of Japan.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.460
It's no wonder that Debussy,
who was coming of age

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.790 position:56%
in this exotically saturated
milieu, was swept up in the current.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.580
He, too, venerated the work
of Hokusai and Utamaro.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.890
As shown in this famous
photograph of the composer

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:27.050
with his guest Igor Stravinsky
taken in his study decades later.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.700
On the wall behind the
composers, at the top,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.490
hangs Hokusai's "Great Wave off
Kanagawa," which Debussy requested

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.510
for the cover of the first edition

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.760
of his orchestral masterpiece
"La Mer."

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.390
Hokusai is on the left, cover
of "La Mer" on the right,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:53.930 position:56%
and beneath it is Utamaro's portrait
of Wakatsuru as she reads a letter,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.170
echoing the second scene in Act
I of "Pelléas et Mélisande,"

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.680
where Genevieve reads
Golaud's letter aloud

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.110
to the blind King Arkel.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:13.870 position:56%
On Debussy's desk is his beloved and
ever present wooden toad from Japan,

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.500
a fetish that the composer
named Arkel,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.690
who brought him good
luck on his travels.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.080
There is a grande dame
in Debussy research

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.440
who is now deceased-her name
was Margaret Cobb-who used

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.580
to tell the story about
Debussy traveling.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.380
And he would say.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.820
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.540
"Don't put Arkel in the suitcase.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.960
He doesn't like that [laughter]."

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.120
Debussy, an inveterate smoker,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.820
also owned this Japanese
lacquered cigarette case

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.140
and this 19th century
lacquer work of gold fish,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.580
encrusted with mother-of-pearl.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:07.360
These poisons d'or inspired one
of his "Images" for piano in 1907.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.220
Even when he could ill afford

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.820 position:56%
such objets d'art during his student
years, Debussy coveted curios

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.430
and was known to have spent
time and money acquiring them.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.160 position:56%
It is thus perhaps no surprise, that
he would be attracted to the sensual

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.170
"Rondel Chinois," a poem which
paints a Chinese tableau.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.490
This is a tableau by Hokusai
set on a lake that is bordered

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.480
with azaleas, water
lilies, and bamboo.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:46.040 position:56%
On the water, floats a mahogany junk
boat, in which a lady sleeps veiled

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.380
in a swath of crepe up to her
neck, while a Mandarin observes her

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:57.860
with his owl-like eyes from his
lazy veranda in the distance.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.160
The author of this captivating
landscape was unknown

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.570
until a few years ago when Debussy
scholar Denis Erlin [phonetic] was

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.170
able to identify the
poet as Marius Dillard.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.440
A critic of literature,
art, and music,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.750
Dillard eventually
became the director

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.150
of a magazine called Rouen-Artiste.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:24.030
While yet in his teens, he had
won a poetry contest with his

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.930
"Rondel Chinois," and as
a result, it was published

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.360
in the May 5, 1878 issue of the --

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.050
"Union littéraire des
poètes et des prosateur"

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:40.980
Debussy, two years younger than
Dillard, chose to set the text

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.960
of the "Rondel Chinois" as a
song for Madame Marie Vasnier,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.420
a coloratura soprano, whom
he accompanied as a student

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.100
and who would inspire no fewer
than 29 of his early Melodies.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.470
Young Achille, which
was his given name,

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.970
was besotted by this
married older woman,

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.300
and she in turn must've been
flattered by his attention.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.250
Before long, they became
deeply involved.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.800
The flowery dedications to Madame
Vasnier that Achille penned

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.320
on his manuscripts bear witness to
the intimacy of their relationship.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.190
The manuscript of the "Rondel
Chinois" is no exception.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.490
You can see the original
on the table.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.280
I'm sorry, the copy is not
terribly legible, but if you look

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.670
in the top left corner, he
writes: "To Madame Vasnier.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.610
The only person who can sing

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.220
and make forgettable
all that this music has.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.600 position:56%
That is un-singable and perplexing."

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.400
He says:

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.700
In French, the phrase [foreign
words] is the equivalent

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.790
of "it's Greek to me" in English.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.960
So in this dedication the
composer is cleverly punning

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.240
on the adjective "chinois."

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.670
Following the title of the
song, the composer continues

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.240
with tongue-in-cheek,
identifying the work

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.510
of the last two lines
on this slide, as --

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.920
"Chinese music based on
manuscripts of the period,"

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.410
which was, of course, bogus.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.460
It's clear, even from
this title page,

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.320
that this piece was a calculated
attempt to render the allure

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.140
of the unconventional,
or exotic, in sound.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.250
Although this autographed
manuscript is not dated.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.430
We can infer a date of
1881 for two reasons.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:57.830
First, young Achille misspelled
Marie's last name-you'll be able

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:03.810
to see it on the table there-as V,
A, N, I, E, R. Instead of V, A, S,

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.300
N, I, E, R. It's only by
January 1882 that he began

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.060
to spell Marie's name correctly on
manuscripts, so we know this has

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.090
to be prior to that time.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.860
Second, Debussy biographers report

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.560
that he accompanied
Marie in a recital.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.140
Which included the
"Rondel Chinois" in 1881.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.570
While unfortunately no program
of that event has been preserved,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.960
we do have a printed program
for a recital in which Marie

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.270
and Achille performed
two of his other songs,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.320
"Fete Galante" and "Le Roses."

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.980
They're down four from the
bottom, there on 12 May, 1882.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.810
And if you look at the
top, about the third line

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.060
down you will see he
must have discovered how

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.970
to spell her name correctly by this
time, since it was printed as V, A,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.770
S, N, I, E, R on the program.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.610
Dillard' poem is a classic
Rondel form, in that it consists

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.980
of 13 lines, two quatrains,
followed by a quintal,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.960
With a two line refrain that
opens the first quatrain

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.440
and closes the second.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.550
In his "Rondel Chinois," only the
first line of the refrain returns

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.430
after the final quintal and
the challenge for the poet is

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.040
to find seven compelling
rhymes for the A-lines

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.930
and six rhymes for the B-lines.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.350
Ideally, the poet will also
illuminate a new aspect

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.280
of the original idea each time.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.430
Rather than simply repeating
the refrain for its own sake.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.560
In the "Rondel Chinois," Dillard
continually shifts the focus

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.660
of his images, not
unlike a videographer.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.540
In the first strophe, he moves
from the general landscape

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.040
on the lake bordered with azaleas,
water lilies, and with bamboo,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.900
to focus on the slight motion
of the boat within that scene.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.990
A mahogany junk with a
gold tapered bow passes by.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.380
But in the second strophe,
Dillard reverses orientation,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:19.040
training his lens first on
detail, the sleeping Chinese woman

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.450
who is clothed in crepe, and then
executing a literary focus poll,

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.060
by situating her within the
wide-angle landscape of the lake.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.140
In the following quintal,
he transfers our attention

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.680
from the crepe dress of the
woman in the boat on the water

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.910
to the lacey veranda of
the Mandarin on the shore

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.800
who is watching with owl-like eyes.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.500
Who? The Chinese woman
who is passing by.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.070
Where? On the Lake
bordered with azaleas.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.590
So you see that Debussy's
continually shifting --

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.480
Dillard's continually
shifting juxtaposition

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.030
of images creates a sense of
fluidity and panoramic vision,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.370
in spite of the repeated refrains.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.210
Each line of a Rondel typically
contains eight syllables.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.510
And Dillard's poem follows
this principle as well.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.070
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.870
There's eight.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:41.050
[ Foreign Language ]

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.930
While Debussy does not
repeat musical material,

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.680
for each of the refrains of the
"Rondel" circled in this slide,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.830
he does respond to its three large
divisions by casting his song

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.690
in a ternary form -- ABA.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.840
Both of the A sections convey
the pastoral scene in the tonic

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:10.550
or home key of A-minor, while
the B material centers closely --

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:15.950 position:56%
centered on the closely related key
of C-major and features a new motive

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:20.420
and increased rhythmic
motion in the piano.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.700
Debussy echoes Dillard's
octosyllabic lines in his choice

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.450
of a duple meter and a regular
two and four bar phrase structure.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.060
In the A section, the
piano conveys the sensation

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.640
of a boat gliding gently
on the water.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.250
The language, duple pulse,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:45.570 position:56%
emphasized by hollow open fifth
petals in the bass on the downbeats,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:50.160
contrast with dissonances on
the second part of each measure,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.790
simulating a steady ebb
and flow of the water.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.940
Against this placid
backdrop, as you just heard,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:03.110
Debussy lavishes ornamental
interest in the vocal line,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.810 position:56%
which is clearly designed to
suggest a mysterious other-a foreign

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.910
fragrance of the East.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.700
This melody is replete with
pentatonic inflections,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.830
a non-Western pitch
organization, that are overlaid

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.210
on a similarly exotic
modal quasi-Dorian canvas.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.410
Whether the voice is that of
the lady in the boat or that

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:32.650 position:56%
of a narrator, we hear her before we
meet her, as Debussy opens his song

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.500
with a captivating vocalise.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.730
Of course, in a practical sense,
passages such as this were composed

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.800
to show off Madame Vasnier's
high and agile voice.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.850
In Debussy's "Rondel Chinois,"

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:52.070
they also serve a structural
function introducing the A section

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.150
and, as well as, the
re-transition to the final A,

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.430
and then ending the song.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:04.910
Let's now hear at least the A and
B sections of this entire song,

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.470
performed by Natalie
Dessay and Philippe Cassard.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:15.420
I will -- I'll perhaps
over-dub where we are,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.540
because they are very
metrically free here.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.940
It may be hard for you to
follow the phraseology.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:32.710 position:56%
And then a return of A. Just as van
Gogh was copying Hiroshige's "Bridge

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.350
In the Rain," so was Debussy
imitating what he knew

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.570 position:56%
of Chinese musical conventions in
his setting of the "Rondel Chinois."

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:46.210 position:56%
Our knowledge of his precise musical
models is scant, but presumably,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.120
he would've been copying Western
imitations of Eastern music

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.180
at this time in his life,
because his first serious exposure

00:24:54.180 --> 00:25:00.190
to indigenous music of the East
would not occur until later in 1889

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.230
at the Paris World's Fair.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:09.160
And, just as van Gogh would absorb
elements of Japanese Ukiyo-e

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.780
into his own artworks, so
too did Debussy harness some

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.980
of the musical ideas that he
had developed in imitation

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.390
of Eastern musics and
incorporate them

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.970
into his own distinctly
French works.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.590
A clear illustration of
this assimilation is found

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.830
in his song entitled "Fête
Galantes," based on a poem

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:36.290
by Theodore de Banville
and composed just one year

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.720
after the "Rondel Chinois."

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:43.530
There is no hint of
Orientalism in Banville's poem.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.980
Rather, it evokes the very French
genre of the "Fête Galantes,"

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.850 position:56%
depicting elegantly dressed men and
women, often in a park-like setting,

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.290
and engaging in amorous
play a la Watteau.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.980
This is his famous...

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.360
[ Foreign Language ]

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.750
Debussy would soon turn
to Verlaine's collection

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.230
of " Fête Galantes," setting
eight of the 22 poems to music,

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.850
but in a sense, he
apprenticed in the genre

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.240
by setting Banville's poem first.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.330 position:56%
In Debussy's "Fete Galantes" song,
which the composer himself described

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:23.200
as Louis XIV music with
formulae from 1882,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.530
he re-appropriated
melodic embellishments

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.110
from the "Rondel Chinois."

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:32.730
Already in the opening
gesture he composed a melody

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:38.420
with the same characteristic turns,
outlining the open fifth in blue

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.160
and emphasizing the flat three
and flat six scale degrees in red

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.390
and green, and the primary
difference being that the

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.890
" Fête Galantes " tune
is now in triple meter.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.790
You see the 3-4 there, instead

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.410
of the duple meter of
the "Rondel Chinois."

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.760
The second phrase in both
songs moves up to the high A

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.740
and exhibits the same
Dorian inflected F-sharp

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.690
within the melisma.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.620
I've adjusted the spacing in
the notation of this example

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.710
to juxtapose visually
the similar outlines

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.580
and have bracketed parallel
pitch material in the same color,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.450
but you'll be able to
hear this immediately.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.330
Debussy's approach to the final
cadence shows further resonances

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.160
between the two songs, ending
with an extended vocalise

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.440
that ascends stepwise to the high
A. Possessed with perfect pitch,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.230
the composer would
surely have been conscious

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.510 position:56%
of these direct melodic connections.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.970
Likewise, his tonal plan,
though more complex in the later

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.240
"Fête Galantes" song, shows a
similar opening move from the tonic

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:52.350
of A-minor to C and the
phraseology remains very square.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.650
Because he's no longer
attempting to evoke the Orient,

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:59.190
Debussy limits his use of
pentatonicism and a drone bass

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.740
in the "Fête Galantes,"

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.600
but he maintains the
melismatic pitch material

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.070
that he developed in
the "Rondel Chinois."

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.670
Even at the same pitch
level as we have seen

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.580
and he retains the modal
inflections and the vocalises,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.210
as well, beginning and end.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.960
In an even more extreme
act of self-borrowing,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.230
he eventually recycled and
refashioned the material from his

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.210
"Fête Galantes" song
into the minuet movement

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.330
of his petite suite
for piano four hands.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:40.140
So here's the opening of the
song, as sung by Anne-Marie Rodde

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.940
and played on piano, the --

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.080
performed by the late
and great Noel Lee.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:57.790
Compare that to Noel Lee and
Werner Haas playing the beginning

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.200
of the minuet from
the "Petite Suite."

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.350
The point is, the distinctive pitch
elements and melodic treatment

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.420
that emanated from his engagement

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.740
with an oriental subject
were eventually assimilated

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.670
into his own uniquely French
compositional vocabulary.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:21.660
Of course, the East was not
the only source of foreign

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.610
and exotic influence for Debussy
or other artists of his time.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:28.400
Keenly aware of his environment,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.120
he could not fail to
have been influenced.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.540
As were Bizet, Chabrier,
and later, Ravel,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.860
by France's well establish
attraction to all things Spanish.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.630
Debussy was too young to enjoy
the Spanish gallery established

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.700
at the Louvre from 1838
to '48 by collectors,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.090
or perhaps one should more
aptly call them plunderers.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.760
Such as Marshal Soult, who arrived

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:59.270
in Spain during the Napoleonic
occupation of 1808 to '14

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.570
and brought back many
treasures to Paris.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.490
However, a recently
discovered letter suggests

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.070
that Debussy may have had
the opportunity to view some

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.980
of the Velasquez paintings
at the Prado in Madrid prior

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.650
to his residency at
the Villa Medici,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.800
as a winner of the Prix de Rome.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.380
And he surely would have been
exposed to Spanish folk songs

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:27.930
and dancing performed in the
cafes and on the streets of Paris.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.450
Among his very first
compositions was "Madrid,"

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.680
drawn from Alfred de Musset's
"Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie."

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:41.820
In it, Musset portrays a
seductive Andalusian temptress,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.780
not unlike "Carmen"
in Bizet's opera.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.670
Debussy presumably attended
a performance of "Carmen"

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.840
in Vienna, in November 1882.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.460
With his patroness
Madame Nadezhda von Meck,

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.280
who two years earlier was said to
have treated him to a bullfight

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.270
in San Sebastián while he
was staying with her family

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:08.480
in Arcachon in southwestern France.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.240 position:56%
As Tchaikovsky's devoted
patroness, Madame von Meck was eager

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.590
to introduce the young Debussy
to the Russian composer's music

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.880
and she asked him to
transcribe, among other things,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:26.710
the "Danse Espagnole" from "Swan
Lake" for piano four hands.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.950
Back in Paris at the
Conservatoire, it's highly likely

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.640
that Debussy would have
come to know Carmen well

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.770
through his composition
teacher Ernest Guiraud,

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.520
who constructed the
recitatives for Bizet's opera

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.800
and compiled 12 numbers from it

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:50.300
into two orchestral
suites in 1882 and 1887.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.340
Other Spanish influences on
Debussy may have come from faculty

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.220
and students at the Conservatoire,
for instance, his harmony teacher,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:03.830
Emile Durand, had set Théophile
Gautier's "Séguidille" already

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:11.960
in 1874, which may have prompted
Debussy to try his own hand at it.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.080
As is the case for
the "Rondel Chinois,"

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.470
there is only one complete
manuscript source

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.570
for Debussy's "Séguidille."

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.510
Although it is not
dated we can surmise,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.900
based on the paper type used,
the layout of the manuscript,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.490
and other chirographic evidence,
that it was completed sometime

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.420
after the end of March 1883,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.020
the year following his
composition of "Fête Galantes."

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.130
And the cover page for "Séguidille"
features the song's title

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.070
in the center creatively lettered,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.510
diagonally down to the
right and followed by --

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:51.160
[ Foreign Language ]

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.040
...with, of course, the
dedication on the top right

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.620
of the page, to Madame Vasnier.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.130
Debussy's signature on
the last page of this

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:07.520
"Séguidille" score is quite similar
to his signature for "Invocation"

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.400
from May 1883, as well as
that on the flyleaf of the

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.980
"Recueil Vasnier," a collection
of 13 songs which Debussy finished

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.730
by February '84 and
which he presented

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.620
to Marie Vasnier sometime
before leaving for Rome.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.440
The most intriguing clue in
our quest to ascribe a date

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.550
of composition for "Séguidille"
comes from a phantom page

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.670
in the "Recueil Vasnier."

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:40.580
It follows the sixth song in the
collection, "Coquetterie Posthume,"

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.730
which was also based on a Gautier
text and dated at the bottom there.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:51.120
It's very hard to see but
it's 31 Mars-March, '83.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.870
The folio after the end of the

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.350
"Coquetterie Posthume" song
was mysteriously excised

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.430
from the volume.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:07.250
However, ink blots bled from
the folio that was removed

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:14.600
onto the remaining page and if one
reverses the image of the inkblots,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.010
reading backwards,
from right to left,

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.130
the outlines of the
accompanimental figuration,

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.550
as well as the descending
arabesque-like triplets

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.380
of the vocal line of
"Séguidille," are clearly exposed.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.380
Maybe not so clear on these slides.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.130
Not even that clear, in reality.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:37.800
You need a [inaudible]
-- what do you call that.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.100
Thank you.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.470
To see it well.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.310
Including the folio
that was excised,

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:47.510
11 consecutive pages were left
blank in the "Recueil Vasnier,"

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.240
approximately the number
needed for a title page

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.360
and the planned notation of the
entire song of "Séguidille."

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.920
So clearly, Debussy
was already working

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.100
on "Séguidille" during
the first half of 1883

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.930
after the "Coquettesie Posthume."

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:08.650
The female character in Gautier's
poem is decidedly different

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:13.510
from the elegant Chinese woman
in Dillard's "Rondel Chinois."

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:17.530
Having spent a great deal of time
in Spain, Gautier was seeking

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:23.640
to portray a Manola, a
characteristically bohemian

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.760
and flirtatious woman
of strong temperament,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.310
and in flamboyant dress.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:33.510
In his book, "Voyage on Espagne,"
he wrote of his exhaustive search

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.820
for a pure-blooded
Manola while in Spain

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:41.220
and we might imagine her is
similar to the earthy depiction

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.980
of Francisco de Goya's
"Una Manola," shown here.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.660
Or, perhaps more like the seductive
dancer in John Singer Sargent's

00:35:51.660 --> 00:36:01.090
"El Jaleo," painted in 1882 just
right in the same time period.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:05.980
That, you can see at the Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.530
In any case, the Manola in
"Séguidille" wears a tight skirt

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.890
and huge comb in her chignon.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.130
Her gestures are bold and carefree
with no thought for the morrow.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.070
And she sings and dances
to the sound of castanets,

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:26.600
dallying with the toreadors
while smoking cigarettes.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.000
The structure of Gautier's poem
follows the general outline

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.460
of a traditional poetic seguidilla,
which consists of a four-line copla

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.870
or quatrain, followed by a
three estribillo, or tercet,

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.380
that serves as a refrain.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.060
In classic seguidillas, each
Copla alternates lines of seven

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.520
and five syllables with
a rhyme scheme of ABAB,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.950
and each estribillo reverses
the pattern with lines

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:58.800
of 5-7-5 syllables and
a rhyme scheme of CDC.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.980
Furthermore, all of the five
syllable lines typically

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.390
feature assonance.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:10.250
While these details vary somewhat
in Gautier's "Séguidille,"

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.270
the basic structure
remains and he concludes

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:18.400
with the estribillo refrain that
celebrates the lively Manola.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.700
"Alza! Olá!

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.970
La veritable Manola."

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.290
Debussy celebrated her as
well, up to a high C-sharp.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:34.720
Not only does the song exude
the Manola's overt flamboyance,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.670
but its abrupt conclusion
reflects the bien parado

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.540
of a typical seguidilla dance,

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.770
in which the performers freeze
in their final position.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:50.150
As you can see in the next slide
Debussy's form -- musical form --

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.980
parallels Gautier 's
poetic structure.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:58.840
His extended 46-bar introduction,
featuring the Manola's vocalise,

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.230
is followed by strophe one,
or Copla one in A-minor,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.090
w ith its virtuosic refrain,
the estribillo, in tonic major.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:14.390
Strophe two is cast in the
relative major of C. These --

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.590
do you remember these keys?

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.600
And a coloratura cadenza leads to
the return of A for strophe three,

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.160
which ends with a bien parado on
a high C-sharp in tonic major.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.990
This formal and tonal plan, as
well as the prominent vocalises,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.570
were all seen in the "Rondel
Chinois" from two years earlier.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:41.190
However, just as Debussy captured
the flavor of Eastern musics in his

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:47.260
"Rondel Chinois," so did he openly
adopt Spanish musical formulate

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.560
in "Séguidille."

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.390
In fact, many of the
musical clichés

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.020
in his song closely
resemble conventions found

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.780
in the most popular Spanish
spectacle of the day,

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.070
none other than Bizet's "Carmen."

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.530
I could focus an entire lecture on
the parallels between Bizet's opera

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.970
and Debussy's song, but will
limit myself to just a few

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.530
of their characteristic features.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.430 position:56%
One of the most obvious, is the
similarly abrupt and dramatic ending

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:22.230
of "Carmen's" own "Séguidille,"
from act one of the opera.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.700
You all know this.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.250
This is thanks to Marilyn
Horne that we're hearing it.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.250
Indeed, Debussy picked up on
numerous other Spanish formula

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.260
from Bizet's "Séguidille," many
of which are also present in his

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.040
"Habanera" and "Chanson Bohème."

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.750
However, Debussy's song echoes
perhaps most persuasively,

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:47.790
the "Entr'acte" linking acts
three and four of "Carmen."

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:52.680
Both works feature a quick triple
meter, slow harmonic rhythm,

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:57.880 position:56%
and chromatic inflections
especially on flat six and flat two.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:03.020
This is the opening
of the "Entr'acte".

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:09.420 position:56%
Above this foundation, Bizet
introduces a descending line related

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.510
to "Carmen's" earlier "Habañera."

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.240
[ Singing ]

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.010
You know, that descending line-but
now more languid and syncopated,

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:23.080
and then contrast it with
a florid ascending melody.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.790
Ultimately, this passage gives
way to trills and scalar runs.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.880
Debussy's song features
similar runs in the cadenza,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.140
after the middle B section.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.800
And "Carmen's" triplet-inflected
melody becomes even more

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.320
death-defying in Debussy's score.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.760
As well, at the climax
of the "Entr'acte,"

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.990
Bizet exposes a descending
tetrachord in the base.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:01.460
Sometimes called an Andalusian,
or Spanish tetrachord.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.910
Again, Debussy exploits
this cliché fully

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.650
in his setting of "Séguidille."

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.640
However, Debussy's
opening tetrachord descends

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.950
to a tri-tone away.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:17.490
You see the circled red
notes, E, D, C, B to B-flat,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:22.240
which ultimately functions as a
phyrigian flat two in A-minor.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.850
Above this surprising twist of the
base, to B-flat, the voice enters

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.560
on E, he tri-tone above
with a flamboyant trill,

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:35.080
and continues with that descending
syncopated line that's uncannily

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.320
reminiscent of the tune
in Bizet's "Entr'acte."

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.720
Finally, Bizet is fond of
overlapping his melodies

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.350
above four bar ostinato
units in the accompaniment.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:54.580
I've circled the four bar
foundation in blue here.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:00.680
And shown the melody in red, how
it overlaps those four bar units.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.870
Debussy picks up on this notion of
non-synchronous phrase structure,

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.140
already in his vocal
introduction with a five bar phrase

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:15.270
that overlaps the four bar
pattern established in the piano.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:20.630
Similarly, the opening of the first
Copla contains a five bar vocal

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.970
entry over regular four
bar phrases in the piano.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.450
Let's now hear this
marvelous song composed

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.450
by the 21-year-old
Achille-Claude Debussy.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:39.840
I'm going to play the A
section with the refrain.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.570
Let's do the B section,
[foreign language],

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:46.130
and then there's this extended
cadenza instead of the refrain

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.090 position:56%
and I think I'll stop it after that.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.830
Debussy's sequel to "Séguidille"
was a "Chanson Espagnole"

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.980
that he substituted in the
"Recueil Vasnier" in place

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.400
of his momentarily
aborted "Séguidille."

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.490
Ultimately, he codified his
Spanish musical style in the

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.160
"Chanson Espagnole," a duet
intended for Marie Vasnier to sing

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.800
with her teacher, Madam
Morosanti [phonetic],

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.600 position:56%
and that showcased their virtuosity.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:23.120 position:56%
Based on a text by Alfred de Musset,
whose "Madrid" Debussy had set

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.110
as a rather unimaginative strophic
song several years earlier,

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.650
the "Chanson Espagnole"
had been popularized

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.070
by Delibes and others as...

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.370
"Les filles de Cadix"

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:37.480
It would become Debussy's
third song about a bullfight,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.020
the story told this time
from the perspective

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.500
of the toreador who's flirting
with girls near the bullring.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.270
In the "Chanson Espagnole" Debussy
pulled together the Bolero rhythm

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.900
that he had used in "Madrid"

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.510
and that Bizet had
used in his "Entr'acte"

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.030
[ Singing ]

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.020
...with the other Spanish
conventions

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.160
that we've already heard: triple
meter, a slow harmonic rhythm,

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.410 position:56%
chromatic and modal inflections,
especially on flat six and flat two,

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:10.910
virtuosic octave leaps, runs
and trills in the voice.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.040
triplet inflected descending
melodic motives,

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.770
and a descending Andalusian
tetrachord in the base.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.580
Perhaps most memorably,

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:24.410 position:56%
he highlighted the dual soprano's
elaborate vocalises at the beginning

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:29.010
of the song and in the refrains,
as you can see the bottom line,

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.640
"les filles de Cadix," following
each of the two strophes as he had

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.750 position:56%
in the "Séguidille," and he
finished with an abrupt bien parado,

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.960
just as he had concluded
the " Séguidille."

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.510
And the piece ends with
the, just the high B...

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.150
[ Singing ]

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.730
...with the bien parado.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.380
As he matured, Debussy
continued to expand

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.900
and refine his Spanish
musical vocabulary,

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.130
especially as he intersected with
Spanish composers such as Albeniz,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:04.910
Manuel de Falla and Enrique
Granados, and the pianist,

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:10.700
Ricardo Viñes, who would
premier the Spanish inspired

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.520
"Soirée dans Grenade," from
Debussy's "Estampes" in 1904,

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.930 position:56%
as well as "La Serenade Interrompue"

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.520
from the first book
of preludes in 1911.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:25.480
Debussy's later full
assimilation of Spanish elements

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.510
into his own compositional
vocabulary is evident in works

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.100
such as "Iberia" and
other piano preludes.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:39.690
These works reflect his continued
exposure to, and exploration of,

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:43.690
indigenous Spanish folk songs
as they were disseminated

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.040
in anthologies published
by individuals

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.890
such as Filipe Pedrell and others.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.860
And of course, he absorbed many
other Orientalist sights and sounds

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.660
through the Paris World Fairs.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.020
During his formative years as
a composer, in the early 1880s,

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.660
Debussy's initial attraction
to Orientalist philosophies

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:11.120 position:56%
and values may have triggered his
attempts to compose transculturally.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.060
That is, to imitate
and adopt the stylistic

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.740
and formal conventions
of another culture.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.700
But ultimately, he absorbed and
generalized these exotic elements

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:28.410
within his own musical
vocabulary, fully integrating them

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:32.130
as he developed his
unique compositional voice.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:37.170
Perhaps that is why his music is
so universally loved and admired

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.150
by people throughout the world.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.950

because of the traffic.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.980

attention on the painting.

Yes.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.320

up attention that the choice

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.790 position:56%
of the color and the spacing pattern

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.630
of the painting could be
more Japanese than Chinese,

but under the influence
of Chinese ink brush.

Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Marie Rolf: Nancy.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.960
&gt;&gt; Could you elaborate more
on the personal relationship

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.920
between Debussy and Bizet?

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.310
In -- there's so much similarity.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.740
Was it friendly, or
was it competitive

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.740
in the way they were interacting?

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.040
&gt;&gt; Marie Rolf: No.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.790
Bizet died, in fact when Guiraud --

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:26.090
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.550 position:56%

&gt;&gt; Marie Rolf: Yes.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:34.100
Yes. So Debussy would
have known Bizet mainly

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.210
through his composition teacher...

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.510
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:41.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Rolf: ...Ernest Guiraud,
with whom he began to study in 1880.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.980
And it was in '82 that Guiraud
composed the recitatives

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.190
for "Carmen," posthumously --
that is, posthumous for Bizet.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:56.390
But when Bizet died, the
recitatives had not been --

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:57.980

We have "Apparition,"
which was based

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:51.720
on a Mallarmé poem he
composed in 1884 just shortly

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.840
after these other works
we've been looking at today.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:33.510
for Madame Vasnier and once
their relationship was over,

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:37.830
which happened probably 1887.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:42.140
Monsieur figured out what was going
on, and that was sort of the end.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:49.180 position:56%
Debussy came back from Rome and it
was over, but he realized that he --

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.570
if he wanted anybody to sing these.

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:55.040
He couldn't write such
high tessitura

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.670
and such difficult coloratura.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:03.780
So -- and that be --
even more importantly.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:11.690
He became very attracted and
drawn to symbolist literature,

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.220
which is very understated and
it's all about implication.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.240
It's not heart on the sleeve.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.070
It's all more inner.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:27.320
And because of that aesthetic
shift in his thinking.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.940
He would never have
composed a piece like this.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.110
So even after April of 1902,
when "Pelléas" was premiered

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:39.400
and became incredibly popular.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.390
I mean, it just catapulted
him to fame overnight.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:49.370
The publishers were asking for more
works and he couldn't possibly keep

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:54.860 position:56%
up with the demand, so he often went
into his old, you know, portfolios

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.770
and "what can I resurrect and
slightly tweak and publish?"

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:01.320
But he still chose not to do these.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.480
And I think it was
for aesthetic reasons.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.070
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you so much.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.680
Unfortunately, we do have
to run out of -- well.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.470
We have a limit on how long
we can be in the building.

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.170
So we'd love to get you
over to the manuscripts.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:15.300
And if you have any further
questions for the speaker,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.170
feel free to see her
privately over there.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:19.510
Thank you so much.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:22.820
[ Applause ]

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.470
