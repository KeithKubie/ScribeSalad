00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The one at zero is stable, the next one is unstable, and the last one is stable again.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Why is that the case?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Assume that we are close to zero so that we have a small amount of fish

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and this harvesting rate is going to quickly reduce that amount to zero again, which makes zero stable.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
By the way, we can't approach zero from the other side.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There won't be any negative amount of fish. The second equilibrium is unstable.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Imagine that we had a little less fish that we would harvest more than we gain in this specific period,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which means we are going to further drive down the number.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We are moving away from that equilibrium.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Similarly if you have a little more fish then the growth rate exceeds the harvesting rate.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We are going to have even more fish.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In both directions, we are moving away from the equilibrium It's unstable.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And now the third equilibrium, if we have a little less fish,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the growth rate being curve exceeds the harvest rate, more growth than harvest.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We are going to end up with even more fish.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're moving up on the horizontal axis towards the equilibrium.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If we have a little more fish, the harvest rate exceeds the growth rate.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We are fishing more than we gain, which curves down the amount.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So from both sides, we are going to approach this equilibrium, which makes it stable.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If we are in this region, we are definitely over fishing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The amount of fish is going down all of the time towards zero.

00:01:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The harvesting rate is way to large for the small amount of fish that we have in this region.
