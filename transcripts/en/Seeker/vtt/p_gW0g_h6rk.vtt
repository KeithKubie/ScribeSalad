00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.859
Like Apollo 7 before it, Apollo 8 was meant
to stay close to home, testing crucial equipment

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.900
in Earth’s orbit, helping to ensure everything
would be ready when the time came

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.900
to put a man on the moon.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.980
But that's not what happened.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.790
Just four months before launch, Apollo’s
mission was drastically changed and a crew

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.720
already in training was given a new assignment.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.040
They were now tasked with going farther than
anyone in history, on a journey that could,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.360
with one wrong calculation, leave them stranded
in the vastness of space.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
The last minute change was due to this, the
Lunar Module, the craft that would eventually

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.350
land the crew of Apollo 11 on the moon.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.400
Apollo 8’s original mission was to test
the Lunar Module for the first time in Earth orbit.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.300
But because it was teeming with problems and
wouldn’t be ready by launch, it would be

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.720
pointless to continue Apollo 8’s original
mission.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
At this point NASA had few options.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.100
Postponing Apollo 8 would mean pushing back
all other missions, potentially causing the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.340
U.S. to miss Kennedy’s deadline
to put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960's.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
JFK [We choose to go to the Moon.]

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.100
To make matters worse, the CIA had intelligence
that the Soviet Union was planning a lunar

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.850
flyby of its own.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.530
So NASA came up with a bold solution; to abandon
its original plan, leave the lunar module

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.259
grounded and instead, go straight to the moon.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.400
With a new mission came a new crew.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.439
Astronauts Frank Borman and James Lovell,
two Gemini veterans and William Anders, who

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.180
had never been to space before, were reassigned
to Apollo 8 in August of 1968.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.200
They were given their new objectives, to test
the crew, command module and equipment between

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.420
Earth and lunar orbit, as well as lunar orbit
itself.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.000
They would also test communication at such
long distances and take pictures to help scout

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.219
a possible landing site.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.890
Apollo 8, like many that came before it and
many that would come after, was a mission

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.860
of firsts, with each leg of the journey aiming
to do something that had never been done before.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.000
This made it exciting and inspiring, but also
came with enormous risks and impending unknowns,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.099
starting with the rocket that would launch
them into space.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.379
On the morning of December 21st the three
man crew squeezed into the command module

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.849
on top of the Saturn V rocket.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.909
This was only the third time a Saturn V had been
launched and the first with a manned crew.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:43.680
During its last flight on Apollo 6, the Saturn
V was plagued with violent shaking and engine failure.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.480
NASA engineers had developed a solution by
rerouting excess helium to dampen the vibrations.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.340
But there had only been time for ground
tests before the real launch of Apollo 8.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.439
Thankfully, the Saturn V proved it could withstand
the elements.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.060
Three hours after launch, a fuel boost would
increase the spacecraft’s velocity by over

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.359
35,000 feet per second, taking astronauts
outside of Earth’s orbit for the first time.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.480
This was a major victory, but
one of the biggest challenges was still to come.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.520
After Apollo 8 made the journey from the Earth
to the Moon, it needed to enter lunar orbit,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.890
a task that had to be done on the far side of the Moon--out of communication

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.650
with the NASA team back on Earth.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.019
In order to slow down enough to be captured
by the Moon’s gravity, Apollo 8’s propulsion

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.040
system would be fired in reverse for a precise
amount of time.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.579
If it burned too long, the craft would slow
down too much and crash.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.140
Too little and it would be traveling too fast,
missing the Moon altogether, drifting into

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.200
space without hope of ever returning to Earth.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.040
On December 24th, Apollo 8 disappeared behind
the Moon and a nervous Mission Control waited

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.460
for a sign that the maneuver was successful.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.940
Astronauts [We are now approaching lunar sunrise.]

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.180
Astronauts [The crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you.]

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.020
Astronauts [In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth.]

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.980
The module would orbit the moon 10 times before
entering the next dangerous phase of the mission.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.880
In order to exit the moon’s orbit, they
once again had to rely on their propulsion system.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.180
If it failed at this point, the crew would
be stranded in the Moon’s orbit and most

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.720
likely would suffocate and perish by New Year’s
Eve.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.440
Not only was the propulsion system successful,
the crew returned to Earth and splashed down

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.300
less than three miles from their rescue ship.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
Apollo 8 was a triumph of preparation and
execution.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.180
It gave us our first view of home from another
world.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.050
It proved that we could go to the Moon and
back.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.930
And many credit it as the mission that changed
how society viewed space travel.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.400
Apollo 8 sparked interest, imagination, and confidence.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:49.180
Astronauts [And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with goodnight, goodluck, a Merry Christmas]

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.100
Astronauts [and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth.]

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.040
NASA was fast approaching a Moon landing,
but there was still a great deal that needed

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.550
to be tested, including the grounded lunar
module.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.750
Soon new crews would be sent into space to
deal with challenges of their own, including

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:16.000
space sickness, record breaking speeds and
navigating the most famous walk in history.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.320
