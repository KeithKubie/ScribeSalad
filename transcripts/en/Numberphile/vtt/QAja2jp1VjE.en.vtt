00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
If you ask real experts in probability

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.120
they'll say this is not random because it's far too uniform, you know.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.840
Really, Poisson... That kind of thing would have more gaps and so forth.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.120
But it's random enough and what I'm about to show you

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.760
works with any sufficiently random dots. OK.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
Now, I photocopied this on a transparency.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.560
The exact copy, I put one on top of the other.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.040
The result is this.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.360
Interestingly boring, shall I say, really amazingly boring.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.720
But now, let's shift the transparency against the bottom sheet a little bit

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.720
and what you see is this.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.920
You see those concentric circles

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.620
around a common center,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.560
and the reason, actually in retrospect, is not too surprising because

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.760
whatever I'm doing to the transparency is a Euclidean motion

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.720
and we know that a Euclidean motion in 2D is always a rotation.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.900
Actually it could be a translation, but a translation is a rotation with a center at  infinity.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000
So it's always a rotation. So you see

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.560
those traces of rotation, so to speak, under your eyes.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.600
What's happening is that the original random dots

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.280
are displaced slightly

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.680
and images are close enough to the original dots.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.060
And when you have a situation like that, human eyes cannot help connecting the dots.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.540
The dots are connected and you see those small segments in your eyes

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.380
and then you see those trajectories of the rotation

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.020
that are concentric circles.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.280
So, if you rotate them too far,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.080
the images and the originals get too far

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.600
and they lose all correlation and you don't see anything.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.500
Now, let's suppose that for example this common center of all the concentric circle is too high

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.640
and you don't want it to be too high,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.500
you want to bring it back to the center.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.160
So when I first tried this I naturally shifted the transparency

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.000
in the direction that I want to move the center,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but watch what happens when I do this.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.360
I'm going to move it up and down in this direction.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.760
The center moves sideways, horizontally!

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.960
And when I move the transparency sideways, it goes up and down.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.000
So the motion of the center is always perpendicular

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.120
to the direction in which I'm moving the transparency, that's really strange.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.400
Now, once you notice this you can actually figure out what's happening by calculation.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.280
So let's say this is a line and that's another line,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.220
and one has been rotated into another, so that's the center of rotation.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.800
That's where they intersect, so to speak.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.380
Now, let's say that I move the image sideways

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.160
and you can see that the point of intersection actually goes up and down

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.720
like that.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
So, although I'm moving the knife horizontally,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.100
the intersection point is going up and down vertically.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.580
So that's more or less why if you move the transparency horizontally the center goes vertically

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.800
and if you move it vertically it goes horizontally.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.180
Next, I'm going to show you another example.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.800
This is the same picture as the previous one, but only shrunk a little bit.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.020
I went to the photocopier and hit the shrink button.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.840
It shouldn't be shrunk too much, maybe this is 96% of the original

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.600
because if you shrink it too much, again, you lose the correlation and you don't see anything.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.900
But this time, what you see is this.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.760
You see those spirals.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.220
And of course you see those spirals, because in addition to the rotation that's present from the previous one,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.760
you rescaled the whole thing

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.720
so you have this radial shrinking

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.220
and if I now adjust the rotation so it gets rid of the rotational component

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.640
and make it pure translation then you get this radial pattern.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.280
OK, so that was the random end of the experiment.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.120
Let's try the other end, which is the regular end of the spectrum.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.140
And we'll begin by seeing something that is very classical.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.520
This kind of thing makes you seasick.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.360
Square lattice, and I took an exact photocopy of this on the transparency,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.400
and if I put one on top of the other,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.520
you get something completely black.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.180
Now, nothing interesting is happening. Let's start rotating this.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.120
When I rotate this:

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.320
some ghost-like sorts of shades appear

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.940
and resolve into, resolving to,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.560
this beautiful pattern of square lattice

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.920
but at 45 degrees to the original one.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.660
And, as I keep rotating, it resolves into a smaller and smaller pattern

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.420
and at 45 degrees it becomes the smallest,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.460
and around that point you see there's some kind of wave that comes in and out, that's quite curious.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.320
and then when I keep spinning,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.880
eventually, this pattern becomes larger and larger,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.160
comes back out at us, again,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.060
45 degrees and then the scale diverges

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.020
and it becomes a blur and keeps going and so on,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.600
and I have rotated by 90 degrees, because that's the period, if you like.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.600
This is called a moiré pattern, which is quite well known.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.500
You can do the same thing with another kind of lattice;

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.800
this is lots and lots of equilateral triangles that have been put together

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.620
and colored in an automated fashion black and white.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.900
And if I put the photocopy of this on top, again you see nothing.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.700
Now, let's start rotating this.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.500
You again see the moiré pattern:

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.000
a ghost comes in and then resolves into this kind of thing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.740
I think at this stage, most people see black walls

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.860
partitioning the plane into white triangles.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.600
Black walls and white triangles. OK.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.840
Let's keep rotating.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.460
These triangles become smaller and smaller,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.480
and they kind of go away and resolve into the smallest scale,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.260
and then, if I keep rotating, these come back.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.740
But when they come back at us,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.940
what comes back is not what went out!

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.520
Many people at this stage see hexagons,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.180
but you can probably be convinced that these are white walls

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.260
dividing the plane into black triangles, I don't know if you can see this.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.020
And so what comes back is dual to what went out.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.000
What went out was black walls dividing the plane into white triangles

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.040
but what came back is white walls dividing the plane into black triangles.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.060
And then it becomes a blur.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.520
And if I keep rotating, you get back

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.820
what has just disappeared into infinity,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.500
and then if you keep rotating further

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.000
you again get triangles and hexagons

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.720
and smaller and smaller scale and eventually

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.800
the pattern starts coming back.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.000
But what comes back is what had gone out in the first place,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.580
that is, black walls with white triangles,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.000
and then it becomes a blur and by the time I have completed the cycle

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.160
I have rotated it by 120 degrees, which is the angle's symmetry.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.620
But within this single period

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.840
it turns out that you have two sub-periods

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.020
and those two sub-periods are dual to each other: what goes out and what comes back

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.080
are sort of complimentary to each other so that's quite curious.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.240
Numberphile is brought to you by the Mathematical Science Research Institute, MSRI.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000
That's the building behind me there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a place where many of the world's top mathematicians

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.240
come together for sometimes a semester at a time

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.000
cracking some of the hardest problems in mathematics.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.640
If you'd like to find out more, I've put some links in the description under the video.
