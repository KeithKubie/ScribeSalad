00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.620
These are our polar oceans,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.320
a part of the world that is more foreign to scientists

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.180
than the moon or Mars.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.840
But we are getting closer to discovering

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.808
more about these crucial environments

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:15.840
with advanced robotic technology.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.860
Dr. Alex Forrest is at the forefront 
of that work.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.340
His robots are built to access underneath ice shelves,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.960
and to gather data for large-scale maps and models

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.220
that answer big-picture questions like,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.720
"How is a shoreline changing after a storm?"

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.040
"How is toxic algae spreading?"

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.280
And, "how fast is polar ice really melting?"

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.400
The Nansen ice shelf is in Antarctica,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160
down in the Ross Sea,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
and this ice shelf been an area of interest

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.980
because it's breaking up.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.000
Basically, a piece of ice the size of Manhattan

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.700
broke off and drifted off, and it exposed,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.840
in cross-sectional view, 
one of these subglacial channels

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.920
that we've been trying to get access to for a while.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.700
We're aiming to go back there again
with gliders and AUVs,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.400
to try to understand the turbulence

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.960
and how much energy is being transported
through that system.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.400
Energy is associated with heat,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.060
so if we understand how much
heat is in that water,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
we can understand how much
of that heat is coming from the ocean

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.860
and how much of that is coming from the ice itself.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.920
To get a 3D picture of an ecosystem,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.660
Alex builds tools including Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, or AUVs

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.520
with sonar, to make bathymetric maps.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.580
He then uses gliders to sample the water column

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.140
providing him with turbulence, temperature,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
salinity, chlorophyll and oxygen data.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.060
What a glider will do, is move oil around
to displace more or less volume

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.900
to make it heavier or lighter than the water it's in.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.880
When it reaches an inflection point, it will
pump itself light and then point upwards.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.680
The wings create a lift and start
drawing it forward.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.040
In here is a satellite phone connector,
a GPS receiver, and a free wave,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.920
or radio receiver.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.720
So we can talk to it when it's sitting
up on the surface

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.320
and tell it where to go from anywhere in the world.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.740
All together, these chemical
and environmental fluid mechanic data

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.840
create a comprehensive model of this ecosystem.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.780
Exploring these icy frontiers is a balancing act

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.500
of keeping people and equipment safe in
extreme weather and ocean conditions,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.440
bringing back accurate data,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.620
and preserving the very delicate ecosystem
we want to study.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.749
One of the biggest challenges underwater is
that we don't have positioning.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:45.280
We don't have WiFi, we can't get radio signals through, we don't have GPS...

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.420
all of these tools that we use
in regular, terrestrial mapping.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.880
You're basically guessing where you are underwater,
so you need to develop navigation algorithms

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.700
if you're using an underwater vehicle.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.600
Now, you put that on a ship, and then s@$%,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.140
you all of a sudden are influenced by the waves.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.200
So the waves, storms, et cetera will then modify
how your data looks.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.279
What we don't want to happen is to have our
vehicle modify the fragile ecosystem that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.220
exists at this water-ice interface.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.520
Despite these challenges, Alex and his team
continue to gather this data

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.680
as it is one of the clearest examples 
of how the planetâ€™s climate

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.560
is changing every day.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.700
The polar regions are changing faster than
anybody ever predicted.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.200
It's not just a matter of large pieces of
ice shelves collapsing.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.080
What I find more intimidating is the idea
that our sea ice volume

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.760
is at some of the lowest it's ever been before;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.160
that the Arctic ocean temperatures are getting warmer

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.100
than ever before; that all of a sudden,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.640
air temperatures are getting hotter.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.900
So we need to know the baseline conditions of
today if we're to predict how they're gonna

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.680
change and evolve in the future,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.900
and also to understand as a global community

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.820
what we're losing.
