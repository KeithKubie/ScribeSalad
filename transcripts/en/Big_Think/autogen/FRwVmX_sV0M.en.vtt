well there's so many parts to answering

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:04.840
well there's so many parts to answering
 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.150
well there's so many parts to answering
that question I i think the the big idea

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160
that question I i think the the big idea
 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.740
that question I i think the the big idea
if there is a the big think or or the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
if there is a the big think or or the
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.620
if there is a the big think or or the
accidental happenstance was when i was

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630
accidental happenstance was when i was
 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.839
accidental happenstance was when i was
trying to solve a story problem if a

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849
trying to solve a story problem if a
 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.820
trying to solve a story problem if a
person could live forever a person was

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830
person could live forever a person was
 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.970
person could live forever a person was
immortal how would they change over time

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980
immortal how would they change over time
 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.540
immortal how would they change over time
I was curious about whether one lifetime

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
I was curious about whether one lifetime
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.640
I was curious about whether one lifetime
was enough for somebody there are some

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650
was enough for somebody there are some
 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.330
was enough for somebody there are some
people you know those arrested

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340
people you know those arrested
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.450
people you know those arrested
development type men who can't really

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
development type men who can't really
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.090
development type men who can't really
outlive their outgrow their adolescence

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100
outlive their outgrow their adolescence
 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.710
outlive their outgrow their adolescence
and I thought well maybe one lifetime

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720
and I thought well maybe one lifetime
 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.560
and I thought well maybe one lifetime
isn't enough maybe you need more so I

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
isn't enough maybe you need more so I
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.650
isn't enough maybe you need more so I
was just thinking through if a person

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660
was just thinking through if a person
 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.360
was just thinking through if a person
could live long enough how would they

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370
could live long enough how would they
 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.330
could live long enough how would they
change and that seemed like a cumbersome

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340
change and that seemed like a cumbersome
 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.160
change and that seemed like a cumbersome
experiment because of having to deal

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170
experiment because of having to deal
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.670
experiment because of having to deal
with changing history so I was trying to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680
with changing history so I was trying to
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.140
with changing history so I was trying to
solve the problem how you can have a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150
solve the problem how you can have a
 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.630
solve the problem how you can have a
person be immortal without having

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640
person be immortal without having
 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.270
person be immortal without having
history change from underneath them so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280
history change from underneath them so
 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.039
history change from underneath them so
that the movie would not the story of

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049
that the movie would not the story of
 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.149
that the movie would not the story of
the movie would not have to deal with

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159
the movie would not have to deal with
 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.489
the movie would not have to deal with
the French Revolution and and with the

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:08.499
the French Revolution and and with the
 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.929
the French Revolution and and with the
future and things like that and then to

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939
future and things like that and then to
 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.830
future and things like that and then to
solve that I remembered an idea i had

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840
solve that I remembered an idea i had
 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.660
solve that I remembered an idea i had
had about a year or two before that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670
had about a year or two before that
 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.059
had about a year or two before that
about a guy repeating the same day and i

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069
about a guy repeating the same day and i
 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.719
about a guy repeating the same day and i
realized that having a person receipt

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
realized that having a person receipt
 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.889
realized that having a person receipt
repeat the same day turns an eternity

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899
repeat the same day turns an eternity
 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.129
repeat the same day turns an eternity
into a circle and and that's when all

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139
into a circle and and that's when all
 

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.139
into a circle and and that's when all
the dramatic possibilities came and the

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149
the dramatic possibilities came and the
 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.539
the dramatic possibilities came and the
comedic possibilities and although the

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549
comedic possibilities and although the
 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.139
comedic possibilities and although the
the resonances with repetition so that

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149
the resonances with repetition so that
 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.539
the resonances with repetition so that
was the idea like that I was actually

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
was the idea like that I was actually
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.129
was the idea like that I was actually
getting ready to read one of Anne Rice's

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139
getting ready to read one of Anne Rice's
 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.770
getting ready to read one of Anne Rice's
novels about vampires and I was sort of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
novels about vampires and I was sort of
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.120
novels about vampires and I was sort of
thinking about why I thought that was

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
thinking about why I thought that was
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.129
thinking about why I thought that was
interesting and the most interesting

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139
interesting and the most interesting
 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.989
interesting and the most interesting
thing to me was that it was a different

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999
thing to me was that it was a different
 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.749
thing to me was that it was a different
class of people there just like people

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759
class of people there just like people
 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.399
class of people there just like people
except some of the rules were different

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409
except some of the rules were different
 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.899
except some of the rules were different
and the most interesting one being that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
and the most interesting one being that
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.370
and the most interesting one being that
they were immortal and that's what got

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380
they were immortal and that's what got
 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.349
they were immortal and that's what got
me thinking about immortality there

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359
me thinking about immortality there
 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.010
me thinking about immortality there
that's all of it

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020
 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.050
yeah well I thought of the funny things

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
yeah well I thought of the funny things
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.840
yeah well I thought of the funny things
first the very first thing I thought of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850
first the very first thing I thought of
 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.650
first the very first thing I thought of
was the date seen being able to use your

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660
was the date seen being able to use your
 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.430
was the date seen being able to use your
superior knowledge to pick up women and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
superior knowledge to pick up women and
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.140
superior knowledge to pick up women and
as soon as I thought of that I knew I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
as soon as I thought of that I knew I
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.030
as soon as I thought of that I knew I
had a movie that just seemed to me so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
had a movie that just seemed to me so
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040
had a movie that just seemed to me so
extraordinarily interesting and fun and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
extraordinarily interesting and fun and
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.550
extraordinarily interesting and fun and
funny so I guess I was approaching it in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560
funny so I guess I was approaching it in
 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.920
funny so I guess I was approaching it in
a comedic way but it wasn't as onra

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
a comedic way but it wasn't as onra
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.320
a comedic way but it wasn't as onra
comedy I was thinking of it more as just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
comedy I was thinking of it more as just
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.610
comedy I was thinking of it more as just
a whimsical entertainment

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.170
this is one of those things that just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180
this is one of those things that just
 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.809
this is one of those things that just
kind of fell together when I got the

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819
kind of fell together when I got the
 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.240
kind of fell together when I got the
idea of a man repeating the same day

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
idea of a man repeating the same day
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.780
idea of a man repeating the same day
over and over again it was like january

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
over and over again it was like january
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.720
over and over again it was like january
thirtieth or 31st and so the first thing

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
thirtieth or 31st and so the first thing
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.240
thirtieth or 31st and so the first thing
i thought of is I've got to think of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250
i thought of is I've got to think of
 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.339
i thought of is I've got to think of
which day he repeats which day is it and

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349
which day he repeats which day is it and
 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.110
which day he repeats which day is it and
so I just opened up the calendar and the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
so I just opened up the calendar and the
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.050
so I just opened up the calendar and the
first holiday day I came to was two days

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
first holiday day I came to was two days
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.979
first holiday day I came to was two days
later groundhog day and I was thinking

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989
later groundhog day and I was thinking
 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.660
later groundhog day and I was thinking
about that saying well this is perfect

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
about that saying well this is perfect
 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.300
about that saying well this is perfect
it's a completely unexploited holiday

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
it's a completely unexploited holiday
 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.309
it's a completely unexploited holiday
that can play it on TV every year like

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319
that can play it on TV every year like
 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.729
that can play it on TV every year like
the Charlie Brown special but other

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739
the Charlie Brown special but other
 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.319
the Charlie Brown special but other
things started to make sense immediately

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329
things started to make sense immediately
 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.470
things started to make sense immediately
to like I didn't I wanted him to be a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480
to like I didn't I wanted him to be a
 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.500
to like I didn't I wanted him to be a
character who went somewhere was an

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510
character who went somewhere was an
 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.569
character who went somewhere was an
unfamiliar territory if he was on his

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579
unfamiliar territory if he was on his
 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.569
unfamiliar territory if he was on his
own to his home turf with his family and

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579
own to his home turf with his family and
 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:28.740
own to his home turf with his family and
friends it would be a completely

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750
friends it would be a completely
 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.680
friends it would be a completely
different story and by making a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
different story and by making a
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.369
different story and by making a
groundhog day I thought okay so maybe

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379
groundhog day I thought okay so maybe
 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.229
groundhog day I thought okay so maybe
he's a weatherman and he comes from

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239
he's a weatherman and he comes from
 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.330
he's a weatherman and he comes from
Pittsburgh and he drove to Punxsutawney

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
Pittsburgh and he drove to Punxsutawney
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.809
Pittsburgh and he drove to Punxsutawney
for the ceremony and so and the the

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819
for the ceremony and so and the the
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.550
for the ceremony and so and the the
groundhogs name is Phil so I'll name him

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560
groundhogs name is Phil so I'll name him
 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.140
groundhogs name is Phil so I'll name him
a fill and a bunch of things just

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
a fill and a bunch of things just
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.440
a fill and a bunch of things just
started falling together in that way
