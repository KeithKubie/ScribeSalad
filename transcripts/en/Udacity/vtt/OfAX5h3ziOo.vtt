00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
I have another Gaussian question for you--

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.970
this is called a heavytail Gaussian.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.440
So, as you go to +/- infinity,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.650
the Gaussian levels off at some finite value alpha,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.550
as opposed to zero.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.050
My question is--

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:23.890
"Is it possible to represent this function as a Gaussian?"

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.960
This is the formula for the Gaussian again.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.870
Particularly, can you find a Mu and a sigma square

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.000
for which this exact function over here is obtained?

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please just check one of these two boxes.
