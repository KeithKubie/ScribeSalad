00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:42.720
To most people the idea of “pouring one
out” in regards to the act of pouring a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.840
small amount of some manner of alcoholic beverage
onto the ground in remembrance of one’s

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.290
dead homies is a pop-culture phenomenon, but
it turns out that the practice’s origins

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.340
can be traced basically as far back as recorded
history.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.520
Noted as being one of the oldest known human
customs, pouring one out, or libations as

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.080
it’s more accurately known, is a ritualistic
practice humans have been doing for at least

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.110
5000 years.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.710
Virtually indistinct from its modern equivalent,
the key difference between historic libations

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.500
and modern ones is that the earliest known
group to do this, the ancient Egyptians (generally)

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.860
didn’t pour out alcohol in reverence of
their fallen kin and friends, but instead

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.890
commonly poured out water- thought to be because
of its rejuvenating power and its association

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.070
with life giving.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
This said, Ancient Egyptians were known on
occasion to pour out other liquids in memory

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.140
of the dead including things like milk, honey
and, occasionally, wine and other spirits.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.680
Whatever they were tipping, the general practice
was to pour out a bit of the drink, imbibe

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.420
the rest, and break the containers the drink
was in on the ground, leaving the remains

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
behind.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.720
As an example, pouring one out is specifically
noted in the Papyrus of Ani dating around

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.600
the 13th century BC, where it notes:

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.100
Pour libation for your father and mother who
rest in the valley of the dead…

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.830
Do not forget to do this even when you are
away from home.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.450
For as you do for your parents, your children
will do for you also…

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.060
The same is true of other cultures across
Ancient Africa who, in addition to pouring

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.840
libations in memory of others, did so to thank
the gods and/or ward off vengeful spirits

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.510
as the situation required.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.920
Moving to the Ancient Greeks, they similarly
offered libations to both the gods and fallen

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.010
comrades, usually in the form of sweetened
wine which they’d pour a little of out before

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.320
drinking in appreciation of whomever they
were honoring.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.420
The act of the Greeks pouring one out even
gets name dropped in the The Iliad, specifically

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.480
in Book VI, where the mother of the legendary
warrior Hector tells him, “Wait till I fetch

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.169
you some sweet honeyed wine, first to pour
a libation to Zeus and the other gods, and

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.950
then for your relief if you will drink.”

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.560
Moving on from the Greeks, the Jews also got
in on the action.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.450
For example, just such an offering is recorded,
among other places, in Genesis 35:14, where

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450
it states:

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.600
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he
had spoken with him [God], even a pillar of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600
stone.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.230
He poured out a drink offering on it and poured
oil on it.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.109
And, in fact, it would seem that virtually
every other culture to have engaged in this

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.010
practice throughout history (which judging
by our research is virtually all of them ranging

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.630
from the ancient Chinese to the indigenous
Quechua people of South America) all did this

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.880
for basically the same reasons- in homage
to various gods or the deceased.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.600
Although some cultures certainly took this
practice more seriously than others- our personal

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.380
favourite being the Ancient Romans who created
stone pimp chalices built into their tombs

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.419
that mourners could pour wine into, as well
as drop various food items in.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.390
These chalices would even sometimes contain
a sophisticated draining system, with these

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.450
libation tubes funneling the alcohol or other
item directly onto the corpse.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.220
Yes, in this case mourners could literally
pour one out onto the rotting skeleton of

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.120
the person being honored, which is probably
the most metal thing we’ve ever talked about

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
here.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.160
According to one Dr. Tracy Prowse of McMaster
University, one didn’t even need to be wealthy

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.350
to have a libation tube, it is commonly found
in graves of people from all stations.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.280
She also states, “The main point was to
maintain an ongoing relationship with the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.340
dead, so the family would sit and have a meal
at the grave site and share that meal with

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.340
the deceased.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.340
Romans believed that they had to keep the
spirits of their ancestors content, otherwise

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.160
they might become vengeful.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.370
Offering proper rituals and libations was
a way to keep them happy.”

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.020
In the Western world this type of practice
did see a sharp drop off with the rise of

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.919
Christianity, though still endured across
much of the rest of the world, including throughout

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.410
Africa where it is still an extremely popular
tradition even to this day.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.750
On that note, exactly how humans went from
dumping gallons of wine onto the skeletons

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.720
of their ancestors to ritualistically pouring
one out onto the sidewalk while looking as

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.220
threatening as possible in a music video isn’t
definitively known.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.600
However, given that this was more or less
introduced into pop-culture thanks to a variety

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.490
of African American hip-hop artists, and pouring
one out has been mildly prevalent in African

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.120
American culture, particularly in the southern
states, for centuries, it seems likely that

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.700
this wasn’t something some rapper or producer
came up with independently while planning

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.730
out a video shoot.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.120
Rather, they were more likely already well
familiar with it, at least in some form, and

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.010
decided to incorporate the tradition into
their act.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.430
This trope particularly saw a huge surge in
popularity in the 1990s thanks to the likes

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.350
of Boyz II Men and Tupac Shakur, with the
latter directly referencing the act in several

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.520
of his songs, most notably Pour Out A Little
Liquor released in 1994.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.040
Shakur was so linked to this practice that
it’s noted that one of the first things

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.280
people did upon hearing he’d been killed
was ceremoniously pour liquor out on the street

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.760
corner he was shot– something that apparently
still occurs on occasion even to this day.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.010
But to sum up, nobody is really quite sure
who first got the idea of pouring one out

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.760
for your homies, as it’s seemingly been
something humans have done about as long as

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.010
we’ve been humaning.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.060
But given our propensity to give food offerings
to deities and ancestors seemingly throughout

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.930
history, it’s not exactly a surprise that
we also thought offering said entities a drink

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.820
would be a good idea.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.210
Or as Dr. James Early, a director at the Smithsonian
Institution’s Center for Folk Life Programs

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.050
and Cultural Studies notes,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.250
There is something very basic about pouring
blessings into the earth.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.820
That is where you are buried…

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.990
It figures into all world views and all religions.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.240
We initially emerged as people living very
close to the earth, and the earth provided

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.360
everything we needed…

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.680
We poured libations to acknowledge that our
love and insights do not come solely from

00:06:35.680 --> 00:08:59.550
us but from those who came before us.
