00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.470
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Eric Weiner
is a wanderer, a searcher for God,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.770
for genius, for happiness.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.920
Fortunately for us he takes
us on his journeys and we get

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.690
to see his humor, his
curiosity, his deep intelligence.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.570
In his book, Man Seeks God, he went
in search of the divine traveling

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.810
to Nepal to try Buddhism, to the
Bronx to mix with the Franciscans,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.230
to China to take in the Daoists,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.350
and to Israel to plunge
into the Kabbalah.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.140 position:56%
In his search for happiness, Weiner,
again traveled far and wide seeking

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.570
to discover the happiest
place on the planet.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.840
Perhaps, not surprisingly, he found

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
that happiness is not a
place but a state of mind.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.280
And the things that people normally
think bring us happiness do not.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.570 position:56%
If money were the key, why do people
living in humble circumstances

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.070
in Latin America say
that they're very happy.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.540
In his latest book, The Geography
of Genius, Weiner sets off

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.940
on another worldly quest to
find the wellspring of genius.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.670
And he comes to the realization

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.250
that genius is not necessarily what
we have always imagined it to be.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.150
Of course, we have our
solitary tortured geniuses,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.390
van Gogh, Mozart, da Vinci.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.190
But Weiner looks beyond the
individual to the times and places

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.420
that gave rise to --
gave birth to genius.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.090
And he discovers that genius
often arose after a period

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.970 position:56%
of hardship, chaos, and uncertainty.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.730
In many cases a mixing of different
cultures was a contributing factor.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.060
Before he combed the
world as an author,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.000
Weiner was foreign
correspondent for NPR reporting

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.430
for more than 30 countries.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.510
Now, please join me in
welcoming Eric Weiner.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:13.480
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.780
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Wow.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.780
I think I may have to add a chapter
to my book about the geography

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.400
of genius include this room.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.170
Because I sense a lot
of genius out there.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.440
Steve, thank you for
that great introduction.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.130
I think you did neatly
sort of sum up what I do.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.790
Because it's not always easy to
explain to people what I do when,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.920
you know, you have to fill out
the forms and put occupation,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.740
I usually write philosophical
traveler.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.880
This is -- confuses
people at the IRS

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.300
and makes you subject
to audits, you know.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.570
But that really is what
I'm doing is I'm looking

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.110
for the intersection
of place and idea.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.300
And I've always been a traveler

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.420
and I've always done my
best thinking on the road.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.140
Ever since I was five years old and
I ran away from home, true story,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.280
and I got a good mile
and-a-half away from home

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.790
and would have made it to
wherever it was I was trying to get

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.110
to had Baltimore County
Police not decided to,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.240
I thought a bit impetuously,
intervene with my little adventure.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.590
But ever since I've been
wandering and as Steve said looking

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.000
at big ideas, like happiness, like
spirituality and now like genius,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.810
not just any ideas, ideas where
I feel that the role of place

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.530
or geography in the biggest sense
of the word is often overlooked.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.200
And I do think that is the case
with genius because there are a lot

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.840
of theories, slash,
myths surrounding genius.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
It's a big word; right?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.360
It comes to us like so
many words from Latin.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.870
But the Latin notion of genius was

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.080
that it was not something
you achieved;

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.500
it was something that
accompanied you.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.960
A sort of presiding spirit or
deity that followed you around.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.320
You had your genius take --

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.590
you know, sort of travel
with you everywhere.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.700
And today it means
lots of things; right?

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.330
It might mean someone
with a really high IQ

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.350
or someone who's a
really know-it-all.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.620
That's not the definition
I'm working with.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.180
I believe that genius
is not a know-it-all.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.260
A genius is a see-it-all,
someone who sees connections.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.560
Someone who is creative really.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.730
Creative genius.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.840
But where do these
creative geniuses come from?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.170
Well, myth No.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.200
1, and I use the term myth in sort

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.240
of the Joseph Campbell
sense is it's something

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.480
that can be very empowering
and perhaps partially true

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.220
but not 100 percent true.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.480
Myth No. 1 is that
geniuses are born.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.540
They just pop out of the
womb fully brilliant.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.180
Think of Mozart as sort of the
poster child for this theory.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.670
You know, playing the violin at age
three and composing at age eight,

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.420
it must have been that he
was born that way; right?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.450
Ignoring the fact that his
father Leopold Mozart was one

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.300
of premier violin instructors
and musicians of the time

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.160
and that he was growing
up in a very musical era

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.620
in a very musical city of Salzburg.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.230
So I don't believe that
genetics accounts for as much

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.970
as we think of the genius puzzle.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.200
And the second myth, again in
quotes, is that geniuses are made

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.670
through hard work; right?

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.760
It's the 10,000 hour theory which
you may be familiar with, you know.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.480
Put in at least 10,000 hours of
work over ten years and you have

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.350
at least a chance of achieving
excellence if not genius.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.900
Well, I know a lot of hard
working people in North Korea

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.190
with good genes who
aren't achieving genius.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.880
And there have been plenty of
hard working women in ages past

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.620
who did not achieve
the status of genius

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.220
because they weren't recognized and
they weren't given the opportunity.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.120
I don't think genetics and
hard work alone explains it.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.880
In fact, I began to
think about this.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.910
So I thought, well, what
if geniuses are not born,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.420
what if they're not made,
what if they're grown.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.510
What if it's actually in the soil.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.090
Think about, you know,
growing an apple tree; right?

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.360
You need to have the
seed, good quality seed.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.700
You need to put in some
hard work planting it.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.050
That's the work part.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.360
But you need to have the right soil

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.440
or you're not going
to have an apple tree.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.730 position:56%
So, in fact, as I investigated this,
if you look at a map of the world

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.700
over the course of history and
you were to plot the appearance

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.830
of geniuses, of the
Beethovens and the Einsteins

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.870
and others throughout
history, you know,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.510 position:56%
you wouldn't find them appearing
randomly, you know, one in Belgrade,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.560
one in Vienna, one in Alexandria,
two in Alexandria, I don't know.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.010
But you don't -- what you find is
that they are in these groupings.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.080
Genius clusters I call them; right?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.660
Certain places at certain
times have just been very good

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.410
at producing brilliant
minds and good ideas.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.880
And the question is why.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.280
What was in the water back then
and for selfish reasons we want

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.560
to know can we bottle it; right?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.940
I'm interested in the history
but it's sort of applied history.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.780
What are the lessons for us today.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:50.510
So I came up with a list of
seven golden ages ranging

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.450
from ancient Athens
to Silicon Valley.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.630
Some of them were pretty well known
to most of my readers, I think,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.110
such as Athens during
the Classical period,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.040
Florence during the Renaissance.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.160
Others were maybe not as
well known such as Edinburgh

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.900
in the 18th century in the time of
the -- the Scottish Enlightenment.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.460
Or Vienna which had a rare double
dip of genius which I'll talk

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.220
about both in Mozart and
Beethoven's time and then

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.700
in Freud's time around 1900.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.890
And some of the places
I chose are really

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.640
for most readers a terra
incognita I would say.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.370
Hangzhou china in the 13th century,
an amazing, amazing genius cluster

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.220
that we don't, in the West
at least, know much about.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.740
Or Calcutta.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:42.060
Yes, Calcutta in India in the
late 19th, early 20th century home

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.720 position:56%
to the Bengal Renaissance where more
books were published than any city

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.620
in the world except for London and
produced the first non-Westerner

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.740
to win the Nobel Prize for
literature, Rabindranath Tagore.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.130
And then I bring the book home to
Silicon Valley because I wanted

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.650
to bring it home, and
I wanted to bring it

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.940
to a current place of genius.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.620
So word about what the academics
would call methodology and what I

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.160
like to call how I do stuff.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.250
I do -- here's my sort
of philosophy of travel.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.780
Read about a place before you go
there but don't read too much.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.190
I would read lots of histories
before I would go somewhere.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.440
But I didn't want to read other
contemporary authors accounts

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.750
because I wanted to have
a fresh take on places.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.070
I also am a loiterer.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.730
I will go some place
and spend more time

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.360
than I think I need to spend there.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.170
Now the challenge for me in this
book was writing about the past.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.470
In my previous books I've written

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.500
about contemporary India
or Bhutan or Iceland.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.000
The past, it's been said,
is a foreign country.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.360
They do things differently there.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.660
And it's true.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.320
So the challenge was to make
these places come alive.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.720
I suppose I could have written
this entire book without leaving,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.040
say the Library of Congress.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.340
But that's not the way I roll.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.430
I really -- I feel because people
have asked me that question, like,

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.830
well, do you really
think you need to go

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.390
to Athens and the answer is yes.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.670
I think to walk in the footsteps
of Socrates or Plato or Aristotle

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:23.370
and to experience the place they
experienced is vitally important.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.690
So I want to give you a
quick world tour of some

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.720
of the places I visited,
what I found,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.090
and then open it up to questions.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.640
So I start in Athens.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.700
And Athens is a mystery; okay.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:52.660
It's a mystery because of all the
places to produce so much genius

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.370
in such a short period of time, you
wouldn't necessarily choose Athens

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.900
because remember there
were hundreds and hundreds

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.560
of these Greek city states.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.520
Hundreds of Greeces, you
know, little microcultures.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.770
And Athens did not
have the most going

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.200
for it compared to
these other places.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:24.080
So I'm just going to read a
little section to give you a sense

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.390
of my task, what I was up to, and
what I found out about Athens.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.180
As I said "the past
is a foreign country;

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.130
they do things differently there.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.720
Yes, they do.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.280
And unfortunately this
particular foreign country known

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.460
as ancient Greece has
extremely tight border controls.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.010
It doesn't take kindly to
interlopers such as me.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.250
Yet, if I'm going to solve
the Athenian mystery,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.250
the past is exactly
where I need to be.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.300
What to do?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.900
Squint. That was the
advice of a friend back home

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.490
when I had mentioned my
plans to visit Athens.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.310
I laughed it off but now I realize
it's actually a smart tactic.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.980
Sometimes we can see more
by narrowing our field

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.030
of view than by expanding it.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.850
The zoom lens reveals as much as
the wide angle and sometimes more.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.460
Don't squint too much,
Aristotle warns."

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.310
I should say that Aristotle is
the name of my guide in Athens.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.250
Talk about a wonderful
piece of serendipity.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.590
It's kind of burden, though,
when your name is Aristotle.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.290
And I really thought at
first, well, this is great.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.830
And he's like, you
know, it's not so great.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.770
People assume great
wisdom on his part.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.670
And he's plenty smart but, you
know, you don't want that name.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:43.770
"If I could time travel, he
says, to Athens circa 450 BC,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.060
I'd probably be disappointed.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.890 position:56%
The great Athens, the cradle of
Western civilization, the birthplace

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.930
of science, philosophy, and so
much else we hold dear was a dump.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.570
The streets were narrow and dirty.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.940
The houses constructed of wood
and sun dried clay were so flimsy

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.980
that robbers gained
entry by simply digging.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.460
In fact, the ancient Greek word
for robber means literally one

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.120
who tunnels through walls.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.200
As a time traveler I would
definitely notice the noise,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.140
vendors hawking their wares
at the Agora, a flute,

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.460
a lute rather screeching off key.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.350
But what would grab my attention
and not let go is the stench.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.150
People relieved themselves in
the courtyard of their own home

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.510
or even right in the streets
where the mess would sit

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.920
until a slave sluiced it away.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.640
Conditions were such that as
historian Jacob Burckhardt put it,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.200
no sensible and peaceful person

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.600
of our day would want
to live under that."

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.140
And he wrote those words by
the way in the 19th century.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.660
So this is one of the great myths
of these places of genius is

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.330
that they're paradise, that
they're really nice places.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.670
They're not.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.720
They're difficult places.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.100
I really believe that one
of the keys to creativity is

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.020
that we need constraints.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.650
We need something to push against.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.500
And paradise if it does exist

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.300 position:56%
and I hope it does is probably the
least creative place in the universe

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.450
because you don't have that
need to create something.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.440
You don't have that
something to push against.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.110
You know, there was one
very interesting study done

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.100
by a psychologist where
he gave two groups

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.280
of people an assignment
to build a collage.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.290
But one group was given a very
limited number of materials

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.570 position:56%
and limited number of options of how
they can work with these materials.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.870
And the other was given
a whole bunch

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.280
of material and lots of options.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.950
And it was that first group
with the greater constraints

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.870
who produced the more creative,
as judged by a panel, collages.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.570
We need something to push against.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.300
And we need that sort of messiness,
I don't know about the stench,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.610
but the messiness that you had
in Athens because creativity

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.470
and creative genius
is not a neat process.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.580
There is a messiness to it

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.790
and that's why you
often see relationship

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.970
between chaos and creativity.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.770
If you think about it, if you're
going from the old way of thinking

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.460
to the new way of thinking,
you need to pass

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.990
through an intermediate stage.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.560
That intermediate stage is chaos.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.440
A neuroscientist named Walter
Freeman studied the brains

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.840
of rabbits.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.610
No rabbits were harmed
in these experiments.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.300 position:56%
I just want you to know because I
always feel uncomfortable with that.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.790
But he hooked up their
little rabbit brains to EEGs

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.380
and he introduced them to odors.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.090
And some odors they
were quite familiar with

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.810
and other odors they
were new to them.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:38.010 position:56%
Well, when they saw a familiar
odor, the EEG had a regular readout.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.130
When they were introduced
to an unfamiliar odor,

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.060
they saw a very chaotic
state on the EEG.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.020
And Freeman called that very
interestingly the I don't

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.540
know state.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.580
And that I don't know state is
essential for creative genius

00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:00.680
and it's essential that these
places nurture it, cultivate it.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.560
One thing I should add about
all these places they have

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.460
in common is they're
almost all cities.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.170
If it takes a village to raise a
child as the African proverb goes,

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.720
it takes a city to make a genius.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.670
I won't say to raise a genius
but to cultivate a genius.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.730
Because cities provide
the opportunities;

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.730
cities provide the audience
which is hugely important.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:28.540
And a city like Athens
had the one single trait

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.090
that psychologists have identified
as the most important trait

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.090
for creative people and I
would argue for creative places

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.770
and that is this, openness
to experience.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.410
Openness to experience.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.710
And the manifestation of that

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.840
in ancient Athens was
the Port of Piraeus.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.600
And they went out and
they sailed and here's one

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.070
of the dirty little secrets
about the ancient Greeks.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.370
They mooched.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.830
They were tremendous moochers.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.200
They borrowed ideas
statuary from the Egyptians

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.490
and mathematics from elsewhere.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.710 position:56%
As Plato said though what the Greeks
borrow, very nice way of putting it,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.820
or steal from foreigners
they perfect.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.370
And there's nothing wrong
with that, you know.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.150
As the historian Will
Durant said something

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.640
that at first I found disturbing
and later I've come to embrace.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.640
He said, nothing is
new but the arranging.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.060
Nothing is new but the arranging.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.950
At first as a writer,
I thought, oh, shoot.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.620
Well, I've got nothing new to say.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.620
But then I realized there's
great beauty in the arranging,

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:28.920
you know, and the rearranging.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.530
You can probably find every word
that I have in this book somewhere

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.920
out there in other books scattered
around the world but not arranged

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.580
in the particular way
I've arranged them.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.160
So genius is about the art of
stealing and borrowing as well.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.780
And just -- this is going to be a
quick whirlwind tour but let's talk

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.150
about another well known place
which is Florence; right?

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.320 position:56%
A couple interesting things about
Florence in the Italian Renaissance.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.710
One is that it was born
out of catastrophe.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:04.130 position:56%
That the Italian Renaissance which
started in Florence started not more

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.960 position:56%
than a few decades after the
outbreak of the bubonic plague known

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.400
as the black death which was
horrible, which was terrible,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.320
which should not be
wished on any society.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.180 position:56%
But it had this effect of shaking up
the culture of making it less rigid.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.650
And some historians believe,
and I subscribe to this,

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.380
that it was that shaking
up that ultimately led

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.190
to the flourishing known
as the Renaissance.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.810
And the other interesting thing

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.620
about the Italian Renaissance is
the role that money played in it.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.750
Now we have this very romantic
notion of this starving artist.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.050
Forget it.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.290
The starving artist doesn't
produce anything except his own --

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.590
or her own misery.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.760
They're always worried
about their next meal.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.040 position:56%
So some degree of money is required.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.410
And this is where patronage
comes into play.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.430 position:56%
And it took the form of one
particular family, the Medici who --

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.060
it's not enough just
to throw money around.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.350
You have to know what you're doing
and they knew what they were doing.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.500
And there's a great story about
Lorenzo Medici who was known

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.300
as Lorenzo the Magnificent.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.150
I think it said it
on his business card.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.740
I think that's just how he went by.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:24.380
And one day he is -- he's walking
outside the sort of palace grounds

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.270
in the Medici gardens and he
sees this young stone cutter

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.800
who can't be more than 14
years old working on a sort

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.940
of rudimentary statute
of a fawn, a Roman deity.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.850
And Lorenzo, who's getting
up there in age by now,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.030
says well that's pretty good, kid.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.190
But, you know, it's an older fawn
and it's teeth though are new.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.070
When you're an older man like
me your teeth don't look so new.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.240
And he walked away.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.090 position:56%
Comes back the next day Lorenzo does

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.230
and notices the kid has
perfected the teeth and put

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.230
in a little tooth decay and
really created something special.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.140
And -- and --

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.820
Lorenzo is sort of on
this spot, takes a chance.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.780
Makes an investment in that kid
and says you come live with me,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.280
basically live with me, become
a part of my family essentially.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.780
I'm going to give you the best
access to teachers and to materials

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.250
and the highest challenges.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.070
And it was a very wise investment
because today that kid goes

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.640
by just one name usually,
Michelangelo.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.100
Now we think of Michelangelo
as the genius, he's well known.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.240
Lorenzo the Magnificent less so.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.900
But you can argue that
without Lorenzo

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.150
and his patronage there would be
no Michelangelo and you can argue

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.970
that the real genius was Lorenzo.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.880
You could also argue as I would
that the real genius was the city

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.150
of Florence and their appreciation

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.540
and their willingness
to make bets like that.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.870
Another Michelangelo story
is Pope Julius II was looking

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.500
to have some ceiling work
done on the Sistine Chapel.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.140
So he sends out bids to
contractors essentially.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.470
But he chose Michelangelo which was
-- now we look back and say, well,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.770
that's such an obvious choice.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.640
It wasn't at the time, you know.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.770
Michelangelo was mainly
a statute maker.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.290
He was a, you know,
a sculptor rather.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.640
He was not -- he was not
so much of a painter.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.090
But that, I think, is
something essential

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.390
and something we've lost a bit on.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.380
That's taking, making a big bet

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.210
on someone whose not the
exact fit for the job.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:35.080
Think of how many jobs today, like,
we look to hire someone who's done

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.250
that exact same job previously.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:41.260
But the Pope who was a Medici
from the family took a bet

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.260
on Michelangelo and it
paid off tremendously.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.450
Other places.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.350
Hung jo China.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.790
So in the 13th century, you
know, Europe is pretty backward.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.590
You know, they're picking fleas out
of each other's hair and wondering

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.950
when the Dark Ages are
ever, ever going to end.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.250
This is just going on too long.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.050
But at the time Hangzhou
is a flourishing city

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:10.740
of a million people,
you know, or more.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.310
And it is just taking off.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.910
And they're sailing ships
that are unlike anything

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.360
that Europeans have done.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.220
And it's ruled, no joke,
by a group of poet emperors

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.120
and that's nice, you know.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.230
It's, you know, wouldn't the world
be a better place if it was run

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.970
by poet politicians
or poet philosophers.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:37.980 position:56%
So and the striking thing is that
there's sort of a top down approach.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.750 position:56%
This is often the way China works is
that people, a Chinese person said,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.050
well, we play follow the leader.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.350
And I thought really?

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.240
Well, if you think about it
when your emperor's a poet,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.800
it's going to filter down.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.730
So there's a tremendous
amount of poetry and writing

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.260
and scientific research going on.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:04.150
And it has the characteristic
of all of these places of genius

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:10.590
and that is that it is
extremely interdisciplinary.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.480
People are crossing boundaries.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.430
So I want to share with you just
one section where I'm looking

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.310
at the work of somebody
named Su Dong-Po.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.630
Now in addition to being a
paint, poet and a painter's,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.300
Su is much still revered in
Hangzhou by the way was a governor

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.220
and an accomplished engineer.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.000
His best known project
was a causeway

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.800
that traversed West Lake
and still does today.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.310
Su was a renaissance man 300
years before the Renaissance.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.820
So as I step out of the small
museum where I'm admiring his work

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.100
to this bright sky in
the city of Hangzhou,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.390
I find myself wondering why aren't
there more people like that today?

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.110 position:56%
Why must we sequester our ambitions?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.910
I answer my own question by
imagining what would happen

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.940 position:56%
if a poly-man like Su Dong-Po walked
on to a modern college campus.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.690
Is it literature you're
interested in, Mr. Su?

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.820
Oh, well, then please see
the School of Humanities.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.120
Oh, what's that?

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.420
You're a painter?

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.830
Well, please drop by the
Department of Fine Arts.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.130
I'm sorry.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.170
It's engineering that
piques your interest?

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.430
Well, we have an excellent
school for that too.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.150
But I want to do it all, says Su.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.810
I'm sorry Mr. Su, we
can't help you there.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.980
Please return when you've
clarified your career objectives.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.340
Meanwhile if you like I can direct
you to mental health services.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.620
You see, we don't often question
the rationale for specialization.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.280
Of course, there was a lot -- there
was less specialization back then,

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.370
a friend told me at a dinner party.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.880
The world was less complicated.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.840
It was. But I would argue that
the world was less complicated

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.930
because there was less
specialization.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.670
A specialist is encouraged,
rewarded,

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.770
for parsing his chosen field
into smaller and smaller morsels,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.630
then building high walls
around these tiny bits,

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.410
a narrow outlet naturally follows.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.930
We mourn the death of the
Renaissance man and women.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:10.440
Oblivious to the blindingly
obvious fact that we killed him

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.110
and we continue to do so
every day on college campuses

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.410
and in corporate offices
across the land.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:21.700
And I think that is one reason why
we are arguably, and it's arguably,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.610
seeing fewer creative
breakthroughs today.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.940
Because as I said before the
genius is not a know-it-all;

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.480
the genius is a see-it-all.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.520
There were physicists
during the time of Einstein

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.160
who knew more physics than
Einstein did, but they weren't able

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.470
to make those connections
that he was able to make.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:45.200
And what you see -- let's time
travel a few hundred years past

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.490
Hangzhou to Vienna now of 1900.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.740
And this -- this was an
incredible flourishing.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.350
You had the art movement
with Gustav Klimt.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.440
You had physicists like Ernst Mach.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.900
You had philosophers.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.490
You had writers like
Arthur Schnitzler

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.930
and you had Sigmund Freud.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.210
So what often happens when
you have sparks flying in lots

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:13.880
of different directions is a
fire of creativity ignites.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.640
So if you're Sigmund Freud and
you're sitting there in Vienna

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.730
and you see a new art movement,
the Secessionist movement

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.980 position:56%
and you see new developments of the
world of philosophy and mathematics,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.900 position:56%
you start to think on an unconscious
level that as Freud would put it,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.340
then why not in my field too.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.350
Because creativity is contagious.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.360
There is a contagion effect.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.710
And that's why I think it's
very important for places

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.170
like Silicon Valley to not
just do technology; right?

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.110
But to have a thriving art
scene there for selfish reasons.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.730
In addition to art being
beautiful and wonderful, is it --

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.230
actually it's going to
help the technology field

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:58.660
because these lines we think
are so solid are not, in fact.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:02.950
So a couple words about
Silicon Valley

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.350
and then I do want to
take your questions.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.930 position:56%
It was probably the hardest
chapter for me to write to be honest

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:11.630
because it's not done yet.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.570
There's no period at the end of it.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.460
And people are familiar with it
more than they are with Hangzhou

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.190
so they think they know what
makes Silicon Valley tick.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.310
I went there with a
completely open mind.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.860
I did not talk to technology
people because I don't --

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.040
not exclusively because Silicon
Valley actually has very little

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.170
to do with technology.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.470
I really believe that.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.430
The product is technology, yes.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.140
But the process is cultural.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.090
Right. So I hung out
with anthropologists

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.430
and there are some
anthropologists there who are sort

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.650
of the Margaret Meads of Silicon
Valley who look at the locals

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.300
and their strange customs
and what they do.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:57.320 position:56%
And what Silicon Valley is very good
at is it actually resembles a lot

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.300
of these ancient golden
ages in some ways.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.240
You have that mooching going
on, that borrowing ideas.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.410
Actually very little,
relatively little is invented

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.710
in Silicon Valley.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.770
Not the cell phone which was
invested in a suburb of Chicago.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.240
Not venture capital
which came from New York.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:23.050
But there is a system in Silicon
Valley for let's just say for --

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.340
what's the hot word these
days, curating these ideas.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.870
So as much as places of genius
are magnets for good ideas,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.370
they also need to be
colanders to sift

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.840
out the good from the bad; right?

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.260
So Jonas Salk two time Nobel prize
winner, no slouch, was once asked

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.620
by a young student, you know,
Dr. Salk, how do you come

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.890
up with so many good ideas?

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.190
He said, well, it's easy.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.020
I come up lots of ideas and I
throw away the bad ones; right?

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.570
That element of discernment
is hugely important

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.870
and often overlooked.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.060
We think that, you know, in
order to have a tolerant --

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.270 position:56%
in order to have a creative
atmosphere, you need to be tolerant.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.440
Well, yeah, you need to
be tolerant but you need

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.810
to be discerning in that tolerance.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:09.710
You can't treat all
ideas as equally good.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:15.000
The question is will Silicon
Valley last, you know.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.680
And that's something I discovered
about these golden ages is

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.540
that don't last that long.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.840
They're very fragile.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.360
Like, there's one element in the
periodic table, I forget its name,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.970
but it's so unstable it lasts about
ten second and then poof it's gone.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.360
And these golden ages
are almost like that.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.470
Because there are these
goldilock places where they need

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.300
to achieve this sweet spot and
it's very hard to maintain.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.020
And that tension I talked about,
that sort of chaos that drives it,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.560
can ultimately can tear it apart.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.320
And I conclude that really
what leads to the demise

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.580
of these places is really
one word, arrogance.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.150
They become arrogant.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.870
And if you're arrogant,
you're not ignorant.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.670
And if you're not ignorant,
you're not going

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.230
to produce anything worthwhile.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.600
You need to know what
you don't know.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.290
You need to know the
unknown unknowns

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.960
as Donald Rumsfeld once said.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.320
It really is important to maintain
that openness to experience.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.510
So ancient Athens, you
know, becomes closed off.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.960
They believe they have
all the answers

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.410
and then it starts to decline.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.210
And you see this time and
again happening with places.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:27.680 position:56%
So my advice to Silicon Valley was
to -- would be to remain open minded

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.210
and to really, I -- in the
conclusion of the book,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.510
I always wrestle with this.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.720
Like -- I'm not someone
who really --

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.410
I'm really in my element when
it comes to contradictions.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.200
I really relish contradictions
and trying

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.140
to hold two contradictory ideas
in my head at the same time

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.730
without my head exploding.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.680
But there is a -- I'm
just being honest here --

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.700
a pressure to tie things
up in a neat bow.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.030
People want to know
what the answer is.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.030
Like what is the special
sauce that if you were going

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.240
to create a Silicon Valley or
an ancient Athens from zero,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.320
like Frankenstein's
monster only in a good way,

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.850
you know, what would you do?

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.990
So I'm here to tell you
that if I knew that answer,

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.670
I'm here to tell you I would
not be here telling you.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.050
I would be on a yacht in the
Mediterranean sipping a drink

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.330
with an umbrella in it because I
would be very, very wealthy; right?

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.490 position:56%
And there have been all these
attempts to re-create Silicon Valley

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.080
and they all fail; right?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.710
Because they're trying
to re-create a culture

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.470
and culture is more
organic than that.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.420
Having said that I do provide the
three D's at the end with a bonus,

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.070
fourth D thrown in no extra charge.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.770
And this is what I think
these places have in common.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.510
No. 1 is diversity.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.980
Diversity not only ethnically.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.410 position:56%
In fact, I wouldn't even say ethnic
diversity is the most important kind

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.710
of diversity I'm talking about.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.010
But intellectual diversity.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.810
I mean a lot of different
ideas, having that tolerance

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.940
and that openness to other ideas.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.820
And the second D is
discernment; right?

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.790
So you've got this openness,
you're letting everything in,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.720
but you're discerning
and you're willing to --

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.960
I believe it was poet Allen
Ginsberg kill your darlings,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.550
you know, brutally.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.460
Make it look like an accident
if you have to but, you know.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.320
But you need to separate the
good ideas from the bad ideas.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:25.730
The third D is disorder which
makes some people uncomfortable

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.020
because they think,
well, we need order.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:33.500
We need -- we need to
have things just working

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.230
in a certain way especially
corporations.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.530
We need a system.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.820
But, in fact, there's always that
element of disorder and even chaos

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.430
if you will because a chaotic
setting you're getting lots

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.210
of sensory input.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.670
You have lots of say
molecules bouncing off

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.550
of each other in a small space.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.640
They're more likely to
form new combinations.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.330
That's why one of the reasons
why density is important

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.200
for creative places.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.960
Not density alone because
prisons are dense places

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.260
but not particularly creative.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.780
No, seriously.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.550
And I think it's actually
more nuance.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.550
I think you need density and
you need trust of one another.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.580
You need intimacy in the
best sense of the word.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:16.850
And in these places, these
genius clusters you had people,

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.970
fellow geniuses, co-geniuses who
were intimate with each other

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.190
who were competitive
but in a healthy way.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:30.950
And the bonus D because really
everything has to be in three's.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.980
Like top three ways, no
one ever has top four.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.250
But I realize the bonus
D is discomfort; right?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.000
You need to be a little
bit uncomfortable.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.670
You need to be challenged.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.260
Most geniuses come from the
middle and upper middle classes,

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.070
not from the aristocracy.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.600
I hope I've given you
something to think about,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.840 position:56%
made you a little bit uncomfortable,
but not too uncomfortable.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.510
And with that I welcome your
questions about anything at all.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.720
We have microphones I believe.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.020
Oh, yes?

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.320
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.620
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Hi.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.920
&gt;&gt; I think it's on, yeah.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.370 position:56%
I think you were beginning, you were
alluding to where my question here.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.310
In the actual geography

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.010
of the places was there
anything you discerned,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.000
I mean you talked about
density but --

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.300
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Right.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.600
&gt;&gt; had actual --

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.640
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: As far as
like topography, you know,

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.620
which I do look at, you know, like
I arrived in Athens and, you know,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.610
the light strikes you immediately.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.690
It's very stark and
beautiful, brilliant light.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.820
And that somehow make a difference.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.670
But then you think of what
about Elizabethan London?

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.500
That's dreary and it
produced Shakespeare.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.130
So just as in geography unless
I can include, you know,

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.680
weather doesn't explain happiness.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.480
I don't think that
climate explains genius.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.590
You can be a genius in a
rainy place or a sunny place.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.330
But I think the role
that topography, say,

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:06.040
played in ancient Athens,
is that, you know,

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.340
the rocky hilly terrain sort

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.520
of cut off these city
states from one another.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.620
So it allowed that -- those
different Petri dishes to grow

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.730 position:56%
and I think that was very important.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:21.000
And people can be inspired
by landscape, you know.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.320
And they can go out into the desert
to have their creative epiphany.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.090
But they always will
return to a city, you know,

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.760
like Beethoven would go off for
these walks in the Wienerwald,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.350
the woods, outside of Vienna and
got a lot of his ideas there.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.650
But he always returned to the city

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.040
because that's where
his audience was.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.730
That's where his patrons were.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.990
And so I've noticed that there's
always this toggling, you know,

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.860
between countryside and the
city, between being very,

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.160
you know, social and being low.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.730
David Hume, the Scottish
philosopher,

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.730
he'd do these mind experiments
for days at a time just staying

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.780
in his apartment, not
leaving, you know, in his head.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.180 position:56%
But then he would write about how he
desperately needed to get to the pub

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.680
and have a stiff drink
and socialize with people.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.970
And so I think geniuses
are very good at toggling.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.270
Thank you.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.080
&gt;&gt; I don't know -- oh, there it is.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.900
I was wondering if you had any
thoughts about Richard Florida

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.080
and the creative class and the
idea that in some of his writings

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.920
and the idea that people
are choosing to live --

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.590
smart, creative people are
choosing to live in environments

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.750
that are supporting of that.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:30.380
So that's sort of kind of more an
American focus, current focus --

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.680
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Right.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.980
Yeah.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.280
&gt;&gt; That's my first question.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.580
And the second question is you
are in Washington after all

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.130
and I was wondering if
you have contemplated

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.430
and perhaps this is oxymoron but
is there anything you might say

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.640
about the creation of genius
in government [laughter].

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.990
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Gene -- government.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.920
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: I'm familiar
with Richard Florida's ideas

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.910
and I think some of
them are quite good.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.030
I think he's right
about urban density

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.830
but I think his explanation is
incomplete because it misses

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.180
that intimacy I talked about.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:09.250
I think the creative class
is true up to a point.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.830
There are creative people who are
attracted to certain environments.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.770
But what I think he misses
is that discomfort part

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:22.120
that by the time places become
nice enough, in quotes, nice,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.950
to attract creative people,
they're no longer creative.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.020
Thus the exodus from say Soho
to Brooklyn to maybe Queens

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.270
or who knows where -- what's
happening in New York now.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.400
You know, it's one
thing to say, okay,

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.230
to have nice sushi restaurants,
the ethnic restaurants,

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.060
and some theater, but creative
people are creating that.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:46.370
They're not drawn necessarily to
something that exists already.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.430
I think he underestimates the
role of a challenge that you --

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:55.210
that on the cusp when you know
now I guess it's hip to live

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.620
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn
but for a while it was edgy.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.160
And so those people were not
necessarily following Richard

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.060 position:56%
Florida's rule of the creative
class being drawn to the bon bons --

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.660
that these cultural bon bons
that these places offer.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.660
I think creative people
are motivated

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.530
by a challenge more
than by nice things.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.800
The tolerance part he's
right about, though.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.100
Yes?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.650
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for your time.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.810
I was hoping to learn a little
bit more about your thoughts

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.550
on gentrification and how that
impacts the genius of a place.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.180
It seems really relevant
to the Silicon Valley

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.720
and during what's happened there.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.430
And I'm wondering if
you've learned anything

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:42.160
about places being either more

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.740
or less successful
from confronting that.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.620
I'm just curious how that came up.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.920
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Well, I
think just to follow it,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.250
it sort of relates to
that question a bit.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.320
That once a place becomes
gentrified,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.050
it becomes less challenging.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.140 position:56%
And, of course, you price out people

00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:03.150
who might be truly
creative which is a problem.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.200
You know, another part of the
question -- can you say that again?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.500
&gt;&gt; I don't know if
there's any examples

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.780
from your historical study
of -- addressing that.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.080
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Right.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.260
I would say that something
really interesting

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.540
from say ancient Athens
is that, you know,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.010 position:56%
I was just leaving no stone unturned
so I looked into the possibility

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:24.010
of food as an excuse to eat too.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.870
Like, you know, was it the
diet -- stay with me on this.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.380
Was it the diet, the
ancient Greek diet

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.090
that maybe explained their genius.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.670
So it turns out there's
this restaurant

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.370
in Athens called Archaion Gefseis
which means ancient flavors.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.720
And they create this atmosphere
where it's just like you're

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.590
in 400 BC and you're
eating just the food then.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.780
Like so they didn't have
tomatoes; there's no tomato.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.080
They didn't have forks.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.510
They had knives and spoons so
you only had knives and spoons.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:55.650 position:56%
You know, I believe the restaurant
does take credit cards so, you know.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:40:01.050
But it turns out the
food was really bad.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.400
It was really plain and simple.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.200
They are just not foodies.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.600 position:56%
And then something happened and
they became foodies and they started

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.380
to really get into that
decadent foodie culture.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.130
And you can -- I'm not saying
there's a causation here.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.460
But there is a correlation between
the Athenians becoming foodies

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.630
and the decline of
their civilization.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:23.150
So I think once places
become over-gentrified

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.500
and become a bit silly if I can
say that that way, then, you know,

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.530
your energy's going into finding
just the perfect olive oil,

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:35.790
you know, as opposed to
thinking about other stuff.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.930
So gentrification is
too dangerous I think.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.230
Yes?

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.630
&gt;&gt; Hi. Do you believe that every
civilization has its cluster

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:45.930
of geniuses?

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.570
And if so, how did,
for your research,

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:54.080
how did you choose one civilization
or golden age over another?

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.330
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: That's
a really good question.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.620
Does every -- you know
I'd have to --

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.300
I realize this is not a
very Washington thing to say

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:07.060
but I don't know whether
every civilization had one.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.690
I do know that many,
many do and did.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.370
And I do know that my
process of whittling it down

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.870
and choosing these were
very -- was very difficult.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.710
I had considered, seriously
considered a chapter on the Arab

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:29.760
and Muslim golden age which spanned
actually more centuries than most

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.350
and spanned, you know,
geographically, you know,

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:36.640
from Morocco to Persia and
probably further east than that.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.370
The sort of epicenters of
the place though that, again,

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.770 position:56%
that I'm traveling for this book
were Baghdad and the House of Wisdom

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:51.150 position:56%
in 800 AD in Damascus and although
I'm a former foreign correspondent I

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.390
was not prepared to go to
those places at this time.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.020
I did not want my obituary

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.120
to read Author dies while
researching book on genius.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.750
So but seriously I was very --

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.600
I felt very bad that I was
not able to include that.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.290
I had toyed with including a
chapter on Paris of the 1920s.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.130
But Woody Allen's movie, Midnight
in Paris, had just come out.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.170
I thought it was overly familiar.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.010
But I came to regret that decision.

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.310
True story.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.030
I get a call from -- because
the book's been translated

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.420
into some 16 languages
but not French.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.350
And I got a call from the French
publisher says Mr. Weiner,

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.650
we like your book.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.950
It's very nice.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.250
We would like to publish
it here in France

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.960
but why you don't have a
chapter on the French geniuses.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.920
We have so many.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.220
That stung.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.160
So there a lots of places
I could have included.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.870
I tried to go with a cross
section geographically,

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.910
temporally across time, and
in terms of familiarity.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.210
Good question.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.810
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Yes?

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.110
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is a rather
trivial question.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.410
Have you ever --

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.710
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: There
are no trivial questions.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.310
Have you ever watched the
series, Silicon Valley?

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Oh, this is trivial.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.870
&gt;&gt; And if so, -- and if so, do
you have any thoughts about it?

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.000
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: I have watched it.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.590
I met one of the guys,
not who stars in it

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:13.260 position:56%
but who's a venture capitalist named
Roger McNamee who appears in my book

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:18.630
and who was consulted with -- by
the producers of it, you know.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:23.080
And who makes this sort of
cameo appearance in the series.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.210
And he thought it was spot on.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:31.350
And I think it -- it
does a good job of sort

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.570
of puncturing the myth
around it; right?

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.150
And one of those myths is

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.840
that Silicon Valley
embraces failure; right.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.140
This failure fetish.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.420
Failure is good, you know.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.210
In early Silicon Valley,
pioneers said well,

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.710
if you fail in Silicon Valley
out here in the West, you know,

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:53.670
far away from the East Coast,
your neighbors won't --

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.430
your family won't know and your
neighbors won't care, you know.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:57.730
That kind of freedom.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.210
And there is some truth to that.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.200
But really if you think about,
if you think about a Steve Jobs

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.400
and his back story, we love
the back story of the failures

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.520
because it ultimately
led to success; right?

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.290
And, in fact, as one
anthropologist points out to me,

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.140
if you fail in Silicon
Valley, you're working

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.400
with a pretty big net, you know,
because you can work again.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.340
These other places I
looked at if you fail,

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.630
like in renaissance
Florence, you were done.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.360
You know, the stakes were higher.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.720
So the show's pretty good,
I think, at, you know,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.510
it does what all good satire does.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:34.650 position:56%
It exaggerates a bit, probably not
as much as we think to make a point.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.660
And it exaggerates
the culture in order

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.490
to illuminate the culture
of Silicon Valley.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.040
So yeah and it's funny.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.520
Don't forget that.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.720
Not trivial at all.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.470
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was just wondering if
you had any tips for application

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:53.780
for those of us who might find
ourselves in jobs that are

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.120
like somewhat bureaucratic
or limited

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.900
by like working within a system.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.080
Did you find any tips
within your research --

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.380
&gt;&gt; Eric Weiner: Which reminds me,

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.680
I never answered the
government question.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.990
I'm going to answer that
one and then answer yours.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:14.530
I did not include Washington,
D.C. even though I live here.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:23.710
I don't think -- this has
probably not been a place of genius

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.020
for a good couple hundred
years to be honest.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:32.250
I think because of the caution
that comes with bureaucracy.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:36.790
You mentioned being sort of -- if
you're stuck in a bureaucratic job

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:41.930
or you're stuck somewhere,
you know, bureaucracy

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:46.000
and creativity are
pretty antithetical

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.680
because of the cautiousness.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.270
There have been certainly --

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.810
well, institutions you can
say that have produced things.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.050
The Manhattan Project
was a group that was part

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.660
of the federal government,
right, but it was in New Mexico.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.180
They got them the hell
out of Washington

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.620
and said go to New Mexico.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.630
And Bell Labs while not
government was a corporation

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.620
that produced lots
of creative places.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.660
I think what the things you
can do and this is sort of one

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.450
of the points in my
book is that, you know,

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:23.340
we don't need an ancient
Florence or anything like that.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.830
But the thing -- there
are lessons --

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.570
this is [inaudible]
with things you can use

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:30.180
to be less miserable in your job.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.100
One, is you can go for a walk.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.400
Can you get out of your office?

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.100
If you can that's good, okay.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.840
Because lots of geniuses
have walked.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.770
Beethoven was a walker, Freud was a
walker, other people were walkers.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:45.060 position:56%
There's something about walking
that's very conducive to creativity.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.380
Go to a coffee shop if you can.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.740
Because there's the
ideal decibel level,

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.100
research shows, for
creative thinking.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.840
It's not complete silence and
it's not really loud noises.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.450
It's about 70 decibels,
that background din.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.220
I'm convinced this
is one of the keys

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.300
to Starbucks success,
that background din.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:12.600
And also you can engage in some
creative thinking exercises,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.320
you know, such as what's
called homeopathic thinking,

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.030
taking two contradictory ideas

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.780
and juxtaposing them
and things like that.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.770
But I would caution you and
this is sort of the whole point

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:27.250
of my book is that I think a lot of
this creativity training that goes

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:31.910
on in corporations and institutions
is not that helpful if the people

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.910
at the top are not open
to these new ideas.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.420
You need someone at
the top who's going

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.180
to say yes, let's run with that.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.440
Otherwise, you can have all
the creative thinking exercises

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.290
in the world and you're
just going to have a lot

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.810
of frustrated creative employees.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.310
And on that kind of downer
of a note, I'm going to have

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:50.510
to say thank you very much.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:55.190
