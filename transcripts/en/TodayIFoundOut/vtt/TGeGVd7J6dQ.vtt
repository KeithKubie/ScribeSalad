00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.379
What's the Difference Between Partly Cloudy
and Mostly Sunny?

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.170
If you ever thought it was difficult to tell
the difference between “partly cloudy”

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.029
and “mostly sunny,” you’re not alone.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.671
Established by the National Weather Service
(NWS) according to a loose set of rules, the

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:28.240
criteria used to describe different elements
of your forecast can be pretty vague.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.790
Sky conditions are classified according to
how much “opaque cloud coverage” (OCC)

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.720
is expected that day.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.250
While the NWS has apparently not defined “opaque
clouds,” they are presumed to be those that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.520
can’t be seen through, or more technically,
those that are “opaque to terrestrial radiation.”

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.120
To qualify as “Sunny,” there can be no
more than 25% OCC.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.760
“Clear,” on the other hand is sometimes
used as synonym for “Sunny,” but is only

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.000
applied when there is no more than 5% OCC.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.530
“Mostly Clear,” which is also a synonym
for “Sunny,” is used when there is between

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.180
6% and 25% OCC.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.850
“Mostly Sunny” and “Partly Cloudy”
are apparently interchangeable, and apply

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.840
when the OCC is between 26% and 50%.”Partly
Sunny” and “Mostly Cloudy” can also

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.850
be synonyms, when the OCC is between 51% and
69%, although “Mostly Cloudy” can be applied

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.219
for OCC up to 87%.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.689
At an OCC of 88% and above, the sky is considered
“Cloudy” or “Overcast.”

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.240
Note that when there is a “high probability”
of precipitation (60% or more), many weather

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.909
folks skip the sky condition forecast, since
it may be inferred to be “Cloudy.”

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.700
When forecasting the chance of precipitation,
the NWS considers the likelihood that there

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.350
will be at least 0.01 inches of precipitation
at one place in the forecast area within (usually)

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.229
a 12-hour period (called the probability of
precipitation or POP).

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.240
Words used in the forecast, such as “chance
of rain” and “likely,” as well as “isolated”

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.659
and “scattered,” are considered either
“expressions of uncertainty” or “qualifiers”

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.010
(the last two denote that the entire area
will not be affected), and they are tied to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.010
ranges of POPs.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.120
So, when the probability of precipitation
(POP) is between 60% and 70%, the “uncertainty”

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.880
is low and so the forecast may often include
the word “likely,” while when the POP

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.820
is only 20%, the “uncertainty” is higher,
so the phrase “slight chance,” may be

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.820
used.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.440
“Isolated” is used when the POP is between
10% and 29%, while “scattered” is used

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.380
when the POP is between 30% and 59%.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.880
“Occasional,” “intermittent,” and
“periods of,” denote a POP of greater

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.430
than 79%, but also that the precipitation
will be “on and off.”

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.300
When the forecast temperature is given in
a range, it has a particular meaning, as well.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.310
For example, “near 40” means the temperature
is expected to be anywhere from 38F to 42F,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.810
“lower 40s” denotes anywhere from 40F
to 44F, “mid 40s” from 43F to 47F and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.430
“upper 40s” from 46F to 49F.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.360
Wind terms are tied to specific ranges too,
all related to “sustained wind speed”

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.330
(SWS), and they can overlap.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.470
“Sustained wind” is defined as the average
of observed wind speeds over a two-minute

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.470
period.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.670
“High,” “strong” and “damaging”
winds are those expected to have SWS of at

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.790
least 40 miles per hour (mph).

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.170
“Very windy” denotes when SWS is between
30 and 40 mph, and “windy” between anywhere

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.750
from 20 to 35 mph.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.530
When the SWS is between 15 and 25 mph, “breezy”
is used when the weather is mild, and “brisk”

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.460
or “blustery” are used when it is cold.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.710
“Calm” and “light” are used to denote
SWS of 5 mph or less.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.530
Wind chill incorporates considerations of
how much heat a human body will lose to the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.760
environment on a cold or windy day.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.960
Calculations are estimated at weather conditions
at 5 feet above ground level (said to be the

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.030
typical height of a human face), and begin
when SWS reach 3 mph.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.880
The NWS provides a chart that shows wind chill
for any temperature between 40F and -45F with

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.440
winds between 5 mph and 60 mph, and it reveals
that even a slight wind, with cold temperatures,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.570
can have a big effect on wind chill.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.210
For example, at 0F with only calm winds of
5 mph, the wind chill is -11F.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.380
Likewise, even when temperatures are relatively
mild, say at 35F, if the winds are high, say

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.190
60 mph, it can make it feel about half the
temperature it really is (17F).

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.880
On the other hand, the heat index reflects
the fact that when the humidity reaches a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.400
certain point, the perspiration on your skin
can’t evaporate, you can’t cool down so

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.640
easily, and so the apparent temperature feels
hotter than it actually is.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.090
On that note, the NWS provides a heat index
chart as well, which shows temperatures between

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.860
80F and 110F and relative humidity (RH) between
40% and 100%.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.610
Just as with wind chill, slight changes in
a single variable can have a dramatic effect,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.550
and when both are high, the heat index becomes
dangerous to human health.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.370
For example, at 90F and 40% RH, the heat index
is only 91F, but if it’s soupy outside,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:44.880
say 95% RH, then the heat index shoots up
to 127F.
