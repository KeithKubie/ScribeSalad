00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.939
Her last breath slowly fills up her lungs

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.090
Feet float to the top of the toy chest

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.709
Red scarf unwinds itself from her neck

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.930
The Korean pop song unplays on a loop. Tears crawl back up their paths into her eyes

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.789
Sadness unfolds itself to blinding anger

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.139
The paper's blotchy letters come into focus

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.430
The idea leaves her head

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.439
Doors unslam. Words claw back into her mouth settling in the fire of her gut

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.130
She's having her last fight with me

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.400
But I don't know that yet

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.640
"I hate you"

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Slams back into my mouth

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.279
The pink homemade Valentine's card she knocked over leaps from the floor and into place on my desk

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.900
She paces backwards swallowing the vomit of no one understands.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.900
No one knows, No one listens, No one cares, No one loves me

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
I'm Alone

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
She un-opens my door

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.200
I have a sister still.
