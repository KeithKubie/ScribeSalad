00:00:14.696 --> 00:00:17.364
What does "going viral" on the internet really mean,

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:19.516
and why does it happen so quickly?

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:22.322
Why is a financial institution too big to fail?

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.616
How does a virus in Africa end up

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.812
in the United States in a matter of hours?

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:30.657
Why are Facebook and Google such powerful companies

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:32.488
at creating global connections?

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:33.273
Well, in a word:

00:00:33.273 --> 00:00:34.716
networks.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:36.159
But what are networks?

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.459
Everyone knows about their social network,

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:40.387
but there are all different kinds of networks

00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:41.801
you probably haven't thought about.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.118
Networks are collections of links

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:48.302
which combine by specific rules and behaviors if they are alive.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:50.201
We say that networks are alive

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.543
because they are in constant change.

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:55.296
Over time, the connections within a network

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.707
migrate and concentrate in new places,

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.691
forming evolving structures.

00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:01.733
How the evolution and concentration

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.668
of constantly changing connections occurs

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:06.889
is the subject of a whole discipline called

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:07.988
network theory.

00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:10.792
We can think of networks as neighborhoods.

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.296
Neighborhoods are defined by maps.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:15.542
A Google map demonstrates the relationship

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.995
between locations in exactly the same fashion

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.518
a network connects hubs and nodes,

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:24.175
using streets as links to connect neighborhoods.

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:27.113
The reason a network can expand and evolve so quickly

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:29.457
is based upon a mathematical concept called

00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:31.112
power functions.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:35.095
A power function is a mathematical amplification mechanism,

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.732
which over specific and very small ranges,

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:42.163
accelerates changes logarithmically.

00:01:42.163 --> 00:01:44.599
That is, a very small change in one parameter

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.149
produces a huge change in another

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.191
over a very specific range of values.

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.104
An example of how network structure emerges

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:55.158
is the algorithm used by Google.

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:59.595
As the number of links around a search term, say "friends", increases,

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.977
connections begin to form among millions

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:05.092
of different searches using the term "friend".

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:07.361
What Google has cleverly accomplished

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.649
is a real-time mathematical model

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.160
for how to predict the emergence of growing connections

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.641
among billions of search terms.

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:17.980
The algorithm Google derived collects

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.808
the number of references to any search object.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.864
As references to a search object increase,

00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:27.913
the number of links also increases, creating a node.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:29.841
As the node increases in size,

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.934
it eventually becomes a hub,

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.616
which links to many nodes.

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.843
Networks will continue to emerge

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:40.776
as new ways of connecting and creating neighborhoods are defined.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:44.112
Perhaps you can begin to see why networks are so powerful.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:48.225
As Google continues to collect the billions of daily searches,

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:51.182
new clusters of links will rapidly emerge,

00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:53.483
forming additional and growing networks.

00:02:53.483 --> 00:02:56.922
Despite the logarithmic expansion of your network,

00:02:56.922 --> 00:03:00.630
the laws of six degrees of separation still apply.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.098
Therefore, if you explore a close friend or acquaintances

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.148
in you Facebook network,

00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:08.733
everyone on average will be separated

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:11.510
by six individuals or less

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.878
and a map of your social network will create neighborhoods

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.934
linked by common connections among friends.
