00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.020
In today’s pop culture, avoiding spoilers
is everything while awaiting a highly-anticipated

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.020
movie.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.059
But sometimes, studios can’t contain themselves.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.230
We’re not talking about trailers or advertising.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.100
There are instances where the film will spoil
itself.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.090
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Spoilers Hidden
At The Start Of Popular Films.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.300
21 Jump Street

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.710
21 Jump Street is full of twists, and a humorous
one comes at the end when Johnny Depp reprises

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.070
his role from the TV show.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.539
All through the film, he was unrecognizable
as an undercover drug dealer, but he gave

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.920
up his secret in the film’s first act.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
When Schmidt and Jenko investigate his gang
in a park, a bearded man insults the two policemen,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.899
saying that if they’re cops, he’s a DEA
agent.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.129
Turns out, that’s precisely what he is when
he makes his reveal at the end.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.269
If only the dealers had been paying attention,
they may have been able to avoid a whole lot

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.600
of trouble.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140
Shaun of the Dead

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.070
Edgar Wright has confessed that Ed essentially
sums up the plot of the film when he tries

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.370
to cheer Shaun up with a binge drink game
plan before they encounter a zombie outbreak.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.960
First, the two will have a Bloody Mary, then
grab a bite at the King’s Head, followed

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.780
by a Couple, a Little Princess, and then stagger
back to the bar for shots.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.470
They do all of that, just not in the way they
envisioned.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.250
It doesn’t seem like much when you’re
first watching it, but it’s a clever bit

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.620
of foreshadowing that spells everything out
to an unsuspecting audience.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100
No Country for Old Men

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.210
Anton Chigurh is one of cinema’s most intimidating
villains, and he’s essentially a human Terminator.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.700
Llewelyn Moss thinks he has what it takes
to bring Chigurh down, but he was doomed before

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.160
the two even crossed paths.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.270
In the beginning of the film, Llewelyn is
hunting elk, and manages to hit one with a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.270
bullet.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.140
But it doesn’t kill the animal, just wounds
it.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.200
It’s a tease of what’s to come, as Llewelyn
cannot find a way to stop Chigurh from coming

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.619
after him, no matter what he does.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.560
Llewelyn does injure his pursuer, but Anton
is an unkillable machine.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.770
Shutter Island

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.160
The big twist in Shutter Island is that Federal
Marshall Teddy Daniels is in face a patient

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.700
at the Ashcliffe facility, and his partner
“Chuck” is his head psychiatrist operating

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.920
a role playing exercise.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
It catches moviegoers off-guard, but attentive
viewers were clued in before all the action

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.390
takes place.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
When Teddy and Chuck arrive on the island,
they’re asked to hand over their weapons.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.700
Chuck struggles with the holster of his gun,
signifying that he’s not experienced with

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.890
firearms, and not a U.S. Marshall.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.040
Teddy can’t believe what he’s seeing,
but it all makes sense in the end.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.330
Total Recall

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.080
When the citizens of Total Recall are looking
to mix up their daily routine, they can have

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.670
memories of a trip implanted into their memory.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.550
Doug Quaid is having visions of a mission
on Mars, and goes to Rekall to live out the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.380
Secret Agent fantasy.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.459
Quaid opts to “go” to Mars, and when hearing
the pitch, he’s told that he will “save

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.340
the girl, kill the bad guys, and save the
entire planet!”

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.420
Once Quaid receives the memory and the action
kicks into high gear, that’s exactly what

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.420
happens.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.690
Quaid falls for a woman and saves the oppressed
people of Mars by wiping out all the villains.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.290
Spider-Man 3

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.410
After learning Peter Parker’s secret in
Spider-Man 2, Harry Osborn swears to avenge

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.430
his father and take down his former friend.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.490
That is, until he takes a nasty hit to the
head and suffers amnesia.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.930
When Peter and Mary Jane visit Harry at the
hospital, they reconnect like it’s old times,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.849
and the nurse notes that the trio has a strong
bond.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:04:00.120
Harry mentions that he cares about his friends
so much, he’d die for them.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.480
Turns out, he was actually predicting his
fate.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.000
In the third act as Spider-Man fights off
Venom and the Sandman, Harry pays the ultimate

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.080
price.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.310
Psycho

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.709
Norman Bates is far from a normal person,
and his relationship with his mother is interesting

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.799
to say the least.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.160
When Marion Crane checks into the Bates Motel,
she overhears Norman having an argument with

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.130
his mother, who is acting emotionally abusive
towards her son.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.180
Marion suggests that she’s toxic, but Norman
defends Mom, saying that she’s “as harmless

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.350
as one of those stuffed birds.”

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.280
Turns out, Mom has a little more in common
with those birds than she would like.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.240
It’s revealed at the end that Norman killed
and stuffed his own mother.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.280
But he wouldn’t hurt a fly, right?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.340
Final Destination

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.570
A film built around gory kills should want
to keep the grisly murders a secret, but the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.930
makers of Final Destination had other plans.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.210
In the opening credits, there are images of
objects such as a guillotine, axe, and … They

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.720
look like things that just fit in with the
tone of the movie, but they actually represent

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.820
the manner in which the main characters die
during the course of the film.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.410
At least audiences didn’t see who got killed
by each weapon, but these are surprises that

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.680
would have been better served for a more satisfying
reveal.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.660
Jaws

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.000
As the town of Amity Island is under attack
by a rogue shark, it’s up to three unlikely

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.540
heroes to find it and kill it.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.980
For their hunt, Brody, Quint, and Hooper bring
a variety of tools that could be useful in

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.980
their quest.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.980
One item of Hooper’s is a tank of compressed
air, and Brody wonders aloud how that can

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.280
help them get the shark.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.441
Quint makes the offhand comment that the big
fish could eat it, which ends up being a little

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.870
bit of foreshadowing.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.550
When Brody is the only left to take out the
shark, he gets the upper hand by tossing the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.100
tank in the shark’s mouth and shooting it.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.250
Star Trek Into Darkness

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.431
We mentioned this one is our other video “10
Amazing Clues You Missed In Movies” but

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.210
we just couldn’t leave it out!

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.341
When The Vengeance ship made its appearance
in the film, audiences shouldn’t have been

00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:13.990
surprised since much earlier in a scene where
Kirk and Spock meet Admiral Marcus, his office

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.320
has a collection of every ship from the Star
Trek Universe.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.229
The camera dollies
Through all of them and ends on… you guessed

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.660
it… the brand new Vengeance in the foreground!

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.300
Were they even trying to hide it?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.790
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.210
Which movie spoilers do you notice early in
the film?
