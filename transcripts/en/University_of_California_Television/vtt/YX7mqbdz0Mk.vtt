00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.310
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal. Naked. Large brain. Long the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:20.620
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:30.600
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.110
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.480
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.300
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.779
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
- [Pascal] I hope that this afternoon's
excellent presentations have convinced you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.380
that the skin is very much worthwhile as a
target of anthropogony, the study of human

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:59.710
origins. Skin is also very powerful. In
some places more than others. We are not

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.370
comfortable with nakedness depending on
where we grew up or when we grew up.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.040
So we like to cover skin and we learn
today that this creates a new ecosystem

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.640
for some interesting animals. And we've
also learned that we have changed our

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:26.500
colors many times in different directions.
And our hair, shape and color. It is fair

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.940
to say that skin is our largest organ. We
have an ideal model, the wet suit, in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.910
southern California. Two millimeters,
about the thickness of your skin, and the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.910
surface of one of these banners, about two
square meters. It is a self-healing

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.300
barrier. It provides protection. It
provides defense, thermal regulation and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.510
energy in form of the brain battery and in
form of your first food. Naturally, for

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.830
two and a half years until average weening
age, before agriculture. We synthesize

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.590
vitamins there. It's a very important
sensory organ. It's an ecosystem in more

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.210
ways than one. And it has strong signaling
value. It even signals our internal state

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.550
of mind when we blush or flush, either
saying a lie or being embarrassed. More so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.240
if you are melanically challenged as us
people coming from northern places where

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.300
we lost melanin. So I think we have many,
many things to discover in the future

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.260
study of skin, and I urge you to stay here
for the question answer session. But I'd

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.180
like to, for those who might leave before
the answer session, I'd like to thank all

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.300
of you in the audience. To those who made
the symposium possible. The symposium

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.040
chairs, my co-chair Nina Jablonski, our
featured speakers, our individual

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.220
supporters and, of course, all of you for
attending. So I look forward to question

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.260
session and I think my
co-chair Nina Jablonski

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.620
will address the first set of questions.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.590
- [Nina] We have, not surprisingly, some
wonderful questions that have come

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:15.940
forward. A question first for Doctor
Gallo. Since the sterile wound has more

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.180
inflammation, should we be scrubbing
people with betadine et cetera

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.060
pre-operatively or not?

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.750
- [Dr. Gallo] Well that's an excellent
question and it brings to distinction

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.960
between pathogens and commensal organisms.
First of all, scrubbing with betadine does

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.840
not sterilize the skin. There's still a
tremendous number of microbes that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.479
persist, but betadine does
minimize the number of pathogens,

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.210
so absolutely we should scrub.

00:04:52.018 --> 00:04:53.718
- [Nina] That was clear enough.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:03.635
Two good questions for Doctor Sawka. The
first, does the scalp and hair

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:06.315
play a big role in heat loss?

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.980
- [Dr. Sawka] It does in cold
environments. You have a tremendous amount

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.080
of heat loss through the head because
that's the exposed area and you don't get

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.670
the constriction. But in a warm
environment you don't have any exceptional

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.250
amount of heat loss through the head. It's
predominantly your skin of your torso and

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.020
these areas are overlying
the active muscle.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:38.310
- [Nina] Hold on, there's another
question. A second question. Many cultures

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.660
believe that eating hot chilies in hot
weather causes a cooling effect from

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.175
sweating. Is this valid?

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:50.635
- [Dr. Sawka] Not that I'm aware of but...

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:00.830
- [Nina] Not surprising, we have a group
of people absolutely obsessed with the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.960
microbiome, and so we have a large number
of questions, and some of these might be

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.820
shared between Richard and Rob so you guys
can sort of divvy them up. Do chemical

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.160
additions to western biomes negatively
impact our health? You've covered a

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.620
comparison, but I'm wondering about the
implications of research like this.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.900
So I think the effect of
chemical additives.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.090
- [Dr. Knight] So we saw that data for the
first time last night. We haven't had time

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.840
to fully look into the health
implications. So that's certainly the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.460
direction we would like to take the
research though.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:55.560
- [Nina] With respect to the fecal
microbiome, your studies show that it

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.590
matures at about two and a half years.
This coincides with the weening time of

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:07.600
the Hadza. Is there a mismatch between
early weening in the west and the gut

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.060
microbe maturation at two
and a half years?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.680
- [Dr. Knight] That's a very interesting
question. We've looked across culturally

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.330
the specific effect of weening and what we
see is the maturation effect overall,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.439
although it's affected by weening,
children who were weened at different ages

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:33.580
still follow the overall pattern of
maturation. So probably it's not going to

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.450
be an issue to ween earlier. Again, none
of this data existed three years ago, so

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.830
the kinds of perspective or ...
studies you'd want to see have not yet

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.810
been done. One thing I'll note briefly is
that because the technology to do this has

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.700
dropped in cost so rapidly, a huge number
of studies are possible now that weren't

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.500
possible a few years ago. So it's a
tremendous opportunity for students

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.168
getting into this field.

00:08:00.288 --> 00:08:03.347
- [Nina] What is known about
the skin microbiome of

00:08:03.347 --> 00:08:05.927
populations with great longevity?

00:08:07.548 --> 00:08:08.528
- [Dr. Knight] Nothing.

00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:12.860
That's another great example of one of
those projects that you could do now but

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.248
you couldn't have done a few years ago.

00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:21.610
- [Nina] Does eating probiotic food, is
that useful for the microbiome after

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.439
taking antibiotics? Can we regain
our microbiome?

00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:32.670
- [Dr. Knight] Yes. A number of different
probiotics have been clinically validated

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:39.980
for post antibiotic diarrhea, so in
general any of those probiotics or eating

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.457
live yogurt, has been
shown to be beneficial

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:44.457
in several different clinical studies.

00:08:46.277 --> 00:08:54.957
- [Nina] Does chlorine in swimming pools
act like antibiotics on the microbiome?

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:57.377
- [Dr. Knight] Great question. No data.

00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:00.537
- [Nina] There we go Richard.

00:09:00.537 --> 00:09:01.897
- [Dr. Knight] Maybe Rich has data.

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:03.457
- [Dr. Sawka] No.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:15.400
- [Nina] That's it, thank you. A question
for Sarah Miller. How different are the

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.400
human and chimpanzee
mammary glands?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.640
- [Sarah] So I don't think there's been a
lot of comparative studies on that, but

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.840
they, in each case, there are two mammary
glands which are pectoral. So the basic

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.270
structure is the same, but I'm not aware
of any detailed investigations. But they

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.300
would be interesting.

00:09:42.191 --> 00:09:46.960
- [Nina] A question for anyone, but I'll
take a stab at it myself. When, during

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:54.270
evolution, did the sclera of human eyes
become white rather than dark? We know

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.930
that this is something that is a physical
distinction of humans compared to

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.991
non-human primates, including
our closest relatives.

00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:11.420
I would think that this occurred quite
early in our evolution, and that it was an

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:21.860
important part of our long distance
signaling and visual display adaptation.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.870
It's hard to say exactly when this
could've occurred, but certainly much of

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:39.410
human facial gestures and many aspects of
human gestural vocabulary are visible from

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:46.350
a great distance, or at least from several
meters. And I would think that there was

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:52.730
probably selection for white sclera for
increased visibility and for understanding

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.230
the direction of gaze at the same time.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:06.270
- [Pascal] Traditionally, high incidences
of neural tube defects have been found in

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.950
northern latitudes such as the UK and
northern China. How did this correlate to

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.930
UV damage folic acid?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:21.590
- [Nina] High prevalence of neural tube
defects in these populations is associated

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:30.850
with extreme low folate diets. And so
there was probably minimal amounts of

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:38.200
ultraviolet radiation induced loss of
folate in those populations. Rather there

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:45.450
has been historically, and fairly
recently, tremendously low folate in the

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:51.170
diets. Folate comes from fresh green
vegetables, citrus fruits and whole grains

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:58.200
and we know that in populations that are
eating very highly refined grains with not

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:05.000
a lot of fresh fruit and veg, that there's
a lot of folate deficiency.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.260
- [Pascal] I have a question for Mark
Stoneking. Does your study of body lice

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.000
not shed light on the evolution of
sleeping blankets? Skins of animals, not

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.750
clothing. This seems more likely in light
of the 40,000-year evidence of needles.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.400
Fossil needles.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.970
- [Mark] Yeah we don't know for sure
exactly what the evolution of clothing

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.110
involved, but it seems reasonable to think
that humans would have started out with

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.510
wearing skins of animals, which would have
probably been similar to the hair. May

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.810
have facilitated the movement of lice into
the hides or skins that humans were

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.830
wearing. And then you later have the
production of real woven clothing and so

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:50.950
forth. I don't think humans were weaving
that much 70,000 years ago, so...

00:12:52.622 --> 00:12:57.070
- [Pascal] Another question for Sarah
Miller. At what point in evolution did

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.770
humans develop only two mammary glands?
We kind of touched upon this so I

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:06.730
would...what is the implication of
supernumerary nipples?

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:12.180
- [Sarah] So I don't think it's known at
what point humans developed two mammary

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.990
glands. But it's assumed that it happened
perhaps in response to the decreased

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:25.730
number of babies that humans have compared
with some other species. In terms of

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:34.640
supernumerary nipples, so I talked a
little bit about how the mammary or milk

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.980
line is an important embryological
precursor of mammary glands and this is

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:48.240
found in humans as well. And supernumerary
nipples often develop along those lines.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.620
They can, in fact, very small ones, can
even develop during pregnancy. And this is

00:13:53.620 --> 00:14:00.140
thought to be due to mammary tissue that
has somehow got left behind during the

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:07.180
formation of the mammary glands.
So some circumstantial evidence and some

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:13.310
of our own unpublished data suggests that
during the formation of the embryonic

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:18.630
mammary gland, cells actually move along
the mammary line and end up in the

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:24.100
positions where the mammary gland will
form. So if those migrations fail or

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.260
happen abnormally this can leave behind a
little bit of tissue that could develop a

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:34.710
supernumerary nipple, either during a
re-genesis or even later in life in

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.160
response to hormones.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.880
- [Pascal] Thank you. If you don't mind, I
have a question. A follow up question. Do

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.710
we have any information on the age of the
permanent breast in humans as opposed to

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.640
chimpanzees and bonobos, where breasts are
not permanently enlarged?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.920
- [Sarah] Yeah, I'm not aware of any
evidence about that but that doesn't mean

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.663
there isn't any. They may...
somebody may know.

00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:06.450
- [Pascal] Thank you. And one last
question for Ron Knight. And this is the

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.800
question whether breast fed babies or
formula fed babies differ

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.421
in the gut microbiota.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.830
- [Dr. Knight] Yes. There's been several
studies showing that, and in general the

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.450
microbial diversity in the gut is higher
with breast feeding. There's also some

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.880
suggestion in the literature that breast
feeding may ameliorate the effects of

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.751
early life antibiotics or
C section delivery.

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:36.151
- [Pascal] Thank you very much.
I think that's it for questions.

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:40.142
- [Male Voice 1] I have a follow-up for
Rob. Rob, you mentioned in the C section,

00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:46.741
the effects on the microbiome. Does that
have any kind of noticeable health effects

00:15:46.741 --> 00:15:48.682
in later life?

00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:54.640
- [Dr. Knight] So we're not sure whether
the noticeable health effects of C section

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.790
in later life are mediated by the
microbiome yet. So whenever C section

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.450
affects the microbiome, we know that C
section affects the risk of several

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:11.990
diseases including atopic dermatitis,
let's see...food allergies, pet allergies

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:18.950
I think are on that list, obesity, asthma.
What we don't know for sure is whether the

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.320
mechanism by which C section affects those
conditions is via the changes in the

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.460
microbiome, although we know mostly from
animal model work with some evidence in

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.510
humans that all of those conditions have
been linked to the microbiome. So the

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.200
links that exist are between C section and
disease, C section and the microbiome and

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.420
microbiome and disease. But we don't know
if the specific mechanism of action of the

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.166
C section is via those particular
changes in the microbiome yet.

00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.806
Does that make sense?

00:16:50.146 --> 00:16:53.750
- [Pascal] Okay, so this concludes our
first ever CARTA symposium on the human

00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:01.090
skin. I look forward to a future one.
Thank you all very much for being here

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:06.086
today, and thanks to all the speakers for
the excellent presentations.
