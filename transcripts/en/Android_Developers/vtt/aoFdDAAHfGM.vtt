00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:09.290
Hi there.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.000
My name is Katherine Kuan
and I'm a developer advocate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180
on the Google Developer
Relations team.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.550
I'm here today with
a gift idea for you

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.100
for this upcoming
Valentine's Day,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.370
or that next special occasion
that's around the corner.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.330
The idea is that you
can create a mobile app

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.630
for your special someone.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.080
So you can go run and tell
them, I made this just for us.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.890
In today's fast
paced world, you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.402
buy the most extravagant present
with the click of a button.

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.110
But sometimes, the
most meaningful things

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.230
are the things you
can't buy off a shelf.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
They are the things that you
can create yourself and add

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.710
a personal touch to.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.420
Because, after
all, you're the one

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.097
who knows your loved one best
and how to melt their heart.

00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:50.930
You'll download the
source code for the app,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.270
customize it, and then give it
as a gift to your Valentine.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.469
Now keep in mind that
it could be for any one

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.010
important in your life-- your
significant other, parent, best

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.430
friend, et cetera.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.300
So let's walk through the app.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.930
It contains a list of coupons
where each one can be redeemed

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.280
for a favor or some
event to do together.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130
For example, you can
have a coupon to wake

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.340
up insanely early and go
watch a sunrise together.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.150
You could have a coupon
for a getaway to Hawaii

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.917
or a picnic at a vineyard.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.125
These are just some examples.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.737
The only rule is to be as
creative as you can be.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:24.820
Whenever the person is
ready to redeem the coupon,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.896
they'll click on it and the
Share dialog will pop up.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.270
They can pick
which app they want

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.412
to use to contact
you to redeem it.

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:33.370
There will be a pre-populated
message and photo

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.310
from the coupon so that
you can just hit send.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.480
Then it's up to you to fulfill
your end of the bargain.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.210
If they want a more public way
of declaring how lucky they are

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.290
to have such a thoughtful
person like you in their life,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.090
then they can share to
G+ or other apps as well.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.030
Let's get into the steps of
how to customize the app.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
First, you can create
a custom app icon.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.790
Roman Nurik, who is a fellow
developer advocate on the team,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.330
created this custom
tool where you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.130
can insert a photo of you and
your Valentine into this heart.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.030
It will generate the icon of
you at all the right densities.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.160
When you open up the tool,
you'll see a blank heart.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.280
Then, upload your image of your
choice, either a picture of you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.356
two, or the picture
of an adorable puppy.

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.480
You can adjust the scaling
and padding in the image

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.130
as well so it'll look centered.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.370
Once you create
your app icon, you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.550
can download the zip file of
the icons and save it for later.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.830
Now you'll want to download
the code for the app.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.830
You'll need Android
Studio to open the app.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.530
If you haven't
installed it before,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.380
see the link for how to
set up Android Studio.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.880
Once you're looking
at the code, you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.230
should fill in the sender
name with your name.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.800
That way, when the coupon
is shared to another app,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.010
the sentence will
contain your name too.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.900
Like in this example, I'm
excited to redeem my coupon

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.190
with Amy.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.565
Just to add a
personal touch to it.

00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:53.690
Next you'll want to add
photos for your own coupons

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.880
in the assets folder where
the other images are located.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.410
Here's a screenshot of what
the assets folder looks

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.950
like in Android studio.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.680
Now you can just add the lines
of code to create the coupons.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.810
Specify a title,
description, and the name

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.590
of the corresponding image
file in the assets folder.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.389
After you're done
customizing it,

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.680
you can give it your Valentine.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.570
You can use Google Play to
make it available to them.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.540
Optionally, you can restrict
the app availability

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.730
using the alpha channel
feature in Google Play.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.480
We've given you the basics,
but you can extend it further.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.820
Think of new ways you
can bond with this person

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.430
by taking advantage of
what a phone can offer.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.350
Your phone can buzz when another
person is thinking of you.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.020
If you hook it up
to a web service,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.830
you can send them little notes
or pictures to their device.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.890
So start brainstorming,
and be the first one

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.790
to build a personal
app for your loved one.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.120
That should earn you some
major brownie points.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.655
You can share
screenshots of the app

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:50.160
that you've built with
the hashtag #justforus

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.230
and it will give other people
ideas on what to do too.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.850
Thanks for watching, and I can't
wait to see what you build.
