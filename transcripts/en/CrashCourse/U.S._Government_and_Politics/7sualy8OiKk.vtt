00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.500
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today, finally, we are stepping

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.610
into the big leagues. That's right, I'm trying
out for the Cubs. No, we're gonna talk about

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.830
how the Supreme Court of the United States
actually works! I could try out for the Cubs right, Stan?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.539
Sometimes people refer to it by the unfortunate
nickname S.C.O.T.U.S but I'm not gonna do

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.800
it, I'm gonna call it the supreme cocoa, or
cocoa supreme. Now, let's just be respectful.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.960
So strap in and get ready for some highly
technical discussion of procedure as we learn

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
how you, yes you, probably not you, can bring
a case to the Supreme Court.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.740
[Theme Music]

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.140
The first thing you need to take a case to
the Supreme Court is a case, or controversy,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.690
and except in certain rare situations where
the court has original jurisdiction, that

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.500
case has to have already heard and decided
by a lower court and appealed. And not just

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.829
once; before a case gets to the Supreme Court
you have to have exhausted your appeals at

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.440
lower levels of the state or federal system.
If you've lost your previous appeals but still

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.310
think that you have an issue worthy of the
court's attention, you can petition for a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.600
writ of certiorari, which people in the know call "the cert"
'cause they're keepin' it cash...which is short for casual.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.200
For a look at how the court chooses its cases,
let's go to the Thought Bubble, or the thobub.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.270
Lot of nicknames today, Stan! Or ST. Certiorari
is a formal request that the Supreme Court

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.329
hear your case, but petitioning for a writ
is no guarantee of anything. The federal government's

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.369
chief lawyer, the solicitor general, is basically
like a bouncer at a hot club, if you're old

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.689
enough to get into a hot club. They screen
out a lot of petitions because those cases

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.170
don't raise a lot of federal law questions
or because they've already been decided in

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.420
other cases, or they're not wearing good enough
shoes to get into the club.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.619
If, and it's a big if, your petition is granted,
it goes into the cert pool - the first round

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.649
in which the justices decide which cases they're
actually going to decide. The list of cases

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.509
that will be decided is called the discussion
list. For the judges to actually hear the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.649
case, called granting certiorari, 4 of the
9 justices have to agree to hear it. This

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.490
is called the rule of 4. The discussion of
the discussion list and decision about whether

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.359
or not to grant certiorari happens at the
conference, which is like the back of the

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.490
club where the really well-dressed people
go.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.849
So the judges have read your petition and
4 of them have decided that your case is one

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.710
of about 80 that they will hear, congratulations!
Now you, and the side that disagrees with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.850
your position, have to submit briefs. Briefs
are not underwear; briefs are written legal

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.460
arguments from each side explaining why the
law favors their position. The party bringing

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.110
the case seeking to overturn the lower court
decision is the petitioner. The party that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010
wants the court to uphold or affirm the lower
court's decision is called the respondent.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.840
The petitioner also files a reply, which attempts
to rebut the respondent, which is not a euphemism.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.050
After filing all this, you're finally on your
way out of the Thought Bubble. I mean you're

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.010
on your way to court. Thanks thobub.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.080
You might think that there would only be two
briefs in a case, one from each side, and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.130
it's true that there must be at least two.
But often there are many, many more briefs,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.890
and even boxer briefs! That's what Stan wears.
Stan put your pants on! All undergarments

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.960
aside, individuals or groups who are not actually
parties to the case, but have an interest

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.550
in the outcome can also file amicus curiae,
or friend of the court briefs. Amicus briefs

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.560
often contain different legal, economic, or
historical arguments that can sometimes persuade

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.290
justices and appear in their opinions. They
are also one way that interest groups can

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.980
attempt to influence the Supreme Court.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.470
After the briefs have been filed, the court
schedules oral arguments, giving them time

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.330
to read and consider the briefs. Each side
gets half an hour to make its case, but this

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.810
time includes questions from the justices,
so most of the time it's usually spent answering

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.810
questions. Imagine a presentation with the
most intense teacher you've ever had bombarding

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.800
you with questions, except that there 9 teachers!
Well, 8 because Clarence Thomas never speaks.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.590
After oral arguments, you wait for a decision.
The justices then meet in another conference

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.380
which is held on a Wednesday or a Friday,
'cause there's good TV the other days. In

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.540
order for the court to render an official
decision, 5 of the 9 justices, a majority

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.990
must agree on at least one of the legal arguments
that either affirms or overturns the lower

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.740
court's decision. Although they can also send
a case back down to the lower court for another

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.980
decision, which is called a remand.
Although, you might call it... a punt!

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.360
Woo! That was like 30 yards.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.760
The chief justice presides over the conference
and assigns the task of writing the court's

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.760
decision, called the majority opinion. The
opinions are given in writing, although sometimes

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.950
justices will read them from the bench. Sometimes
the court will issue a single majority opinion

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.810
which is a very strong statement of unified
agreement. In the key civil rights case of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.940
Brown v. Board of Education, the court issued
a single opinion that was even stronger because

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.130
it was unanimous. But sometimes the court
will issue multiple opinions on the same case.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.820
The decision of the court either to affirm
or overturn the lower court's ruling is called

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.820
'the holding', and this is the first thing
you need to know in any Supreme Court decision.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.240
The second thing that matters is the legal
reasoning, or rationale, behind the holding.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.690
If a justice agrees with the holding in the
majority opinion, but for different legal

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.520
reasons, they write a concurring opinion.
The rationale in this concurrence is cool

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.770
and everything, but the lower courts do not
need to follow it. Only the holding of the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.470
majority and its rationale are binding on
lower courts. A single justice writes a concurrence,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.460
but other justices can sign onto it if they
agree with its logic. For instance, the eagle

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.530
and I both agree that fish are delicious,
but I would write a concurrence that the scales

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.500
and the eyeballs are gross. It's unlikely
this will go to the Supreme Court though.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.460
Let's solve it now. Problem solved.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.460
Many Supreme Court cases are not unanimous.
In fact, in an ideologically divided court,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.590
you are likely to find a lot of cases decided
by 5 to 4 margins. The judges who are on the

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.850
losing side who didn't support the majority
decision can write a dissenting opinion. A

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.020
dissent does not set a precedent for a lower
court and has no force of law, but often dissents

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.090
are very eloquent and they can provide arguments
that might persuade later courts in similar

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.060
decisions. Sometimes, as with the famously
bad case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the arguments

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.010
in a dissent can form the foundation for the
majority opinion in a later case, even though

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.889
it can take 50 years to get from a case like
Plessy to Brown v. Board of Education.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.480
So that's the nuts and bolts of how Supreme
Court decisions are made. But before we wrap

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.980
this up, here are a few key things to remember.
First, there are a lot of hurdles you need

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.540
to jump over before a court makes a decision
in a case. Most certiorari petitions, there

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.550
are usually about 8,000 each year, don't make
it past the clerks or the solicitor general,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.139
and don't get granted. It takes 4 judges to
agree to hear a case, but 5 to render a majority

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.050
opinion. Only the holding and the rationale
supported by at least 5 of the 9 justices

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.320
becomes binding precedent for lower courts.
Dissents and concurrences may be fun and interesting

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.020
to read, especially if there are pictures,
and they may include important legal ideas,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.310
but lower courts don't need to follow them.
So that's how to court works procedurally,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.060
but there's another way to think about Supreme
Court decision-making. To really understand

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.290
the Supreme Court, we need to consider the
thinking behind judicial decisions, but that's

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.300
for another episode. Thanks for watching.
