00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.080
You meet a new acquaintance, and as you go
to shake hands after introducing yourself,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.790
you suddenly realize “Wait...I already forgot
their name”. WHY does this ALWAYS HAPPEN

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.889
and what does it say about your brain?

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.360
Chances are you can remember someones face
over their name - our brains are hardwired

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.140
to recognize facial details. Brain scans even
show that individual brain cells are fired

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.430
in response to any given face. But when it
comes to forgetting names, it may have to

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.710
do with something called the baker effect.
If I tell you I’m a baker, I’m providing

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.980
information about what I do, and how I spend
my time, but if I say my name is Baker, it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.390
has no mental links and is vulnerable to forgetting.
After all, names are completely arbitrary

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.610
and hold no specific information in them.
And if your brain can’t make connections

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.960
between multiple pieces of information, particularly
things you already know or feel familiar with,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.219
then you’re more likely to forget that information.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.051
Of course, it doesn’t help that you’re
often focusing on introducing yourself. This

00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:01.330
is known as the ‘next in line’ effect.
Instead of watching and listening to the other

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.700
person, your brain starts focusing on it’s
own routine (What you’ll say, how you’ll

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.340
move, etc). And we simply aren’t very good
at both disseminating information at the same

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.220
time we try to take in and store new information.
Our brains have both short and long term memory;

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.600
but the short term memory or sometimes called
‘working memory’ can only hold so much

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.369
information, and if you don’t focus on it,
it fades away quickly [SCREEN FADES].

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.560
Finally, other research suggests that *drumroll*...you
may just not care. Honestly - you may be at

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.079
a party in which you’ll never see this person
again, or just generally uninterested in forming

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.360
a new relationship. Simply put, the more interest
you have in something, the more likely your

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.130
brain is to make new connections. As a result,
people who enjoy making new relationships

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
are tuned in and focused, and barely feel
as if their memory is being used or tested.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.869
So how can you improve your ability to remember
names? We break down 7 clever tips to avoid

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.620
