This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the Toyota Prius.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.340
Let’s lead the way.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.441
So you’re walking down the street with an
empty water bottle in your hand and toss it

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.220
in a trashcan thinking “it’s one bottle.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.260
It’s not the end of the world if I don’t
recycle it.”

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.130
Well, that one little bottle can make a big
difference.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.060
Hey guys, Amy here with DNews.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.330
Plastics, and specifically plastic bottles,
are one of the fastest-growing elements of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.680
municipal waste in America.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.470
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
estimates that as much as 12 percent of all

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.060
U.S. solid waste is plastic products.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.620
That’s a lot, and it’s something we can
actually do something about.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.480
Water bottles are typically made of polyethylene
terephthalate or PET, and it’s delightfully

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.430
easy to recycle and reuse.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.329
When a PET bottle is recycled, it’s sent
to a facility where it is ground down into

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.390
flakes, cleaned, then melted into small pellets.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.130
Those pellets can then be used to make new
bottles — a far more energy and cost efficient

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.690
process than making a new bottle from raw
materials — or recycled into something different.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410
When a PET bottle isn’t recycled, it goes
to a landfill.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.689
And because it’s not biodegradable it will
sit there forever, taking up space and letting

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.329
material that could be reused just sit there.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.209
The average American uses about 167 bottles
of water each year.

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:18.599
With about 316 million people living in this
fair country, that amounts to 52,772,000,000

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.380
plastic water bottles every year.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.640
And of those 167 bottles, that average American
only recycles 38 bottles, so that’s about

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.740
12,008,000,000 recycled around the country.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.530
That means a little more than 40 billion bottles
end up in landfills, which is equivalent to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.799
more than $1 billion in plastics.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.899
Granted, plastic water bottles are convenient.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.299
It’s great to be able to grab a bottle when
you’re rushing through an airport and dehydrated,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359
but we need to stop throwing them all away.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.999
About 7.4 cubic yards of landfill space is
saved for every ton of plastic that is recycled.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.939
Which is good, though we’re not exactly
experiencing a landfill shortage.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.439
Though the number of landfills in America
have decreased in the last two decades from

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.220
nearly 8,000 sites to a little over 1,600,
the average size has increased meaning they

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.729
can store more materials.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.990
But recovery of materials, like plastic bottles
sent for recycling, has also increased in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.039
the same time frame.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.750
And we can keep that trend going.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.099
If every person held on to one bottle a little
longer until they found a recycling bin, we

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.959
could save both resources and space.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.090
It’s a really small thing to do, but the
impact is significant.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.590
So, how often do you guys cart old bottles
around until you find a place to recycle them?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.409
