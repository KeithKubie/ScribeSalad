then the idea of taking two more hours

four hours long and they didn't seem to

be any clearer agreement about how long

until we actually started doing it but

early stages of previews it in a way
 

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.049
early stages of previews it in a way
became quite clear that the three hour

00:39:44.049 --> 00:39:44.059
became quite clear that the three hour
 

00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:46.269
became quite clear that the three hour
could have pretty arbitrarily chosen but

00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:46.279
could have pretty arbitrarily chosen but
 

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:49.450
could have pretty arbitrarily chosen but
the three hour limit was in fact pretty

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:49.460
the three hour limit was in fact pretty
 

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.670
the three hour limit was in fact pretty
close to the audience's tolerance level

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680
close to the audience's tolerance level
 

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.359
close to the audience's tolerance level
you know how much can you expect your

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:55.369
you know how much can you expect your
 

00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:58.480
you know how much can you expect your
audience to take in in the course of one

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:58.490
audience to take in in the course of one
 

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:01.420
audience to take in in the course of one
evening and I thought we all I think

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:01.430
evening and I thought we all I think
 

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.120
evening and I thought we all I think
felt that we were really at the linear

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:04.130
felt that we were really at the linear
 

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.220
felt that we were really at the linear
of what we could expand from our

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.230
of what we could expand from our
 

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.170
of what we could expand from our
audience and as I say if we in fact

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:08.180
audience and as I say if we in fact
 

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.700
audience and as I say if we in fact
thought we were over the limit and in

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:09.710
thought we were over the limit and in
 

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.980
thought we were over the limit and in
the case of the previews we took out 15

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:11.990
the case of the previews we took out 15
 

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.920
the case of the previews we took out 15
or 20 minutes of playing time in order

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:14.930
or 20 minutes of playing time in order
 

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.260
or 20 minutes of playing time in order
to bring it I mean now it's two acts of

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:17.270
to bring it I mean now it's two acts of
 

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.800
to bring it I mean now it's two acts of
about an hour and 25 minutes each to the

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:20.810
about an hour and 25 minutes each to the
 

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.210
about an hour and 25 minutes each to the
playing time is actually two hours and

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.220
playing time is actually two hours and
 

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.560
playing time is actually two hours and
50 minutes and then there's an interval

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:23.570
50 minutes and then there's an interval
 

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.600
50 minutes and then there's an interval
so it ends up being sort of three hours

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:25.610
so it ends up being sort of three hours
 

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.060
so it ends up being sort of three hours
and 10 I guess but but 20 minutes of

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:28.070
and 10 I guess but but 20 minutes of
 

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.850
and 10 I guess but but 20 minutes of
that is is a rest but there was another

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:30.860
that is is a rest but there was another
 

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.890
that is is a rest but there was another
key point where again we didn't have a

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:32.900
key point where again we didn't have a
 

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.350
key point where again we didn't have a
fight but actually email wasn't helpful

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:35.360
fight but actually email wasn't helpful
 

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.760
fight but actually email wasn't helpful
in this point because the thing about

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:36.770
in this point because the thing about
 

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.140
in this point because the thing about
email is that it can get a bit

actually one of the things I have to say
one of the things I'm proudest of about

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:22.900
one of the things I'm proudest of about
 

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.280
one of the things I'm proudest of about
the play is that it is it genuinely is

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.290
the play is that it is it genuinely is
 

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.440
the play is that it is it genuinely is
political theater in a way that I don't

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:28.450
political theater in a way that I don't
 

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.180
political theater in a way that I don't
think there's anything else that I do

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:30.190
think there's anything else that I do
 

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.440
think there's anything else that I do
about here I can't think of anything

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:31.450
about here I can't think of anything
 

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.470
about here I can't think of anything
else on the London stage that's that's

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480
else on the London stage that's that's
 

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.890
else on the London stage that's that's
being as kind of ballsy political

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:37.900
being as kind of ballsy political
 

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.280
being as kind of ballsy political
theater its power and it reminds me of

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:41.290
theater its power and it reminds me of
 

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.170
theater its power and it reminds me of
the kind of plays that you know when I

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:43.180
the kind of plays that you know when I
 

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.000
the kind of plays that you know when I
was first thinking about writing and

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:45.010
was first thinking about writing and
 

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.290
was first thinking about writing and
theater that kind of plays what would

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.300
theater that kind of plays what would
 

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.809
theater that kind of plays what would
see in London and on the fringe and so

00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:48.819
see in London and on the fringe and so
 

00:48:48.819 --> 00:48:52.500
see in London and on the fringe and so
on in the late 60s and early 70s plays

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:52.510
on in the late 60s and early 70s plays
 

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.780
on in the late 60s and early 70s plays
by you know agitprop theatre companies

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:54.790
by you know agitprop theatre companies
 

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.450
by you know agitprop theatre companies
productions of you know plays about the

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:57.460
productions of you know plays about the
 

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.960
productions of you know plays about the
Vietnam War whatever it might be very

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:00.970
Vietnam War whatever it might be very
 

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:04.650
Vietnam War whatever it might be very
powerful direct political theater and I

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:04.660
powerful direct political theater and I
 

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.460
powerful direct political theater and I
think there parts of this play which

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:07.470
think there parts of this play which
 

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.450
think there parts of this play which
which I think more or less consciously

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:09.460
which I think more or less consciously
 

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.059
which I think more or less consciously
draw on that tradition of political

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:12.069
draw on that tradition of political
 

00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:15.630
draw on that tradition of political
theater and I agree I'm glad we didn't

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640
theater and I agree I'm glad we didn't
 

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.370
theater and I agree I'm glad we didn't
pull any of those punches and now I mean

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:17.380
pull any of those punches and now I mean
 

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.720
pull any of those punches and now I mean

we are all now carrying around in our
 

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.760
we are all now carrying around in our
heads because of what we're seeing in

effect of that or the audience's view of
 

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:39.610
effect of that or the audience's view of
the play is really very dramatic you

the play is really very dramatic you
 

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.890
the play is really very dramatic you
know that the the large section of the

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:41.900
know that the the large section of the
 

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.960

second act which deals with the world

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:43.970
second act which deals with the world
 

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.510
second act which deals with the world

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520
war you know which deals with not one
 

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.220
war you know which deals with not one
but two Wars of the period of tyranny

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:48.230
but two Wars of the period of tyranny
 

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:50.410
but two Wars of the period of tyranny
and so on you know there there's a scene

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:50.420
and so on you know there there's a scene
 

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.030

where there's a family waiting to die
 

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.850
where there's a family waiting to die
while huge loads bombers fly overhead

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:54.860
while huge loads bombers fly overhead
 

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.420
while huge loads bombers fly overhead
and etc now I mean it's amazing to sit

00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:58.430
and etc now I mean it's amazing to sit
 

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.830
and etc now I mean it's amazing to sit
there and look at that scene in the

00:49:59.830 --> 00:49:59.840
there and look at that scene in the
 

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.360
there and look at that scene in the
light of what we know to be really

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:01.370
light of what we know to be really
 

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.670
light of what we know to be really
happening to families you know with

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680
happening to families you know with
 

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.730
happening to families you know with
bombers flying overhead around the world

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:05.740
bombers flying overhead around the world
 

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.650
bombers flying overhead around the world
or in another part of the world so I

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:08.660
or in another part of the world so I
 

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.020
or in another part of the world so I
think it has it's been an amazing

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.030
think it has it's been an amazing
 

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.360
think it has it's been an amazing
coincidence that a play like this which

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.370
coincidence that a play like this which
 

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:17.110
coincidence that a play like this which
deals so directly with the subject of

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.120
deals so directly with the subject of
 

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.140
deals so directly with the subject of
war should show up but that precisely in

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:20.150
war should show up but that precisely in
 

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:23.260
war should show up but that precisely in
this moment right I mean I think it's

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.270
this moment right I mean I think it's
 

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.790
this moment right I mean I think it's
dreadful to say so but it may actually

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800
dreadful to say so but it may actually
 

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.240
dreadful to say so but it may actually
help American audiences appreciate the

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:28.250
help American audiences appreciate the
 

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:30.940
help American audiences appreciate the
power of that part of the story because

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:30.950
power of that part of the story because
 

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.190
power of that part of the story because
after all otherwise it is dealing with

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200
after all otherwise it is dealing with
 

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.250
after all otherwise it is dealing with
political events and wars from far away

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:36.260
political events and wars from far away
 

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.410
political events and wars from far away
and long ago you know but but in a way

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:38.420
and long ago you know but but in a way
 

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.810
and long ago you know but but in a way
this brings it brings it right into the

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:40.820
this brings it brings it right into the
 

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.160
this brings it brings it right into the
present tense I think there's another

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.170
present tense I think there's another
 

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.020
present tense I think there's another
aspect too I mean you talk about the

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:44.030
aspect too I mean you talk about the
 

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.450
aspect too I mean you talk about the
Khomeini fatwa breaking your picture of

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:46.460
Khomeini fatwa breaking your picture of
 

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.120
Khomeini fatwa breaking your picture of
the world and certainly we who live in

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:49.130
the world and certainly we who live in
 

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.730
the world and certainly we who live in
New York City in many ways have the

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.740
New York City in many ways have the
 

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.640
New York City in many ways have the
picture of our world broken since 9/11

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:54.650
picture of our world broken since 9/11
 

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.410
picture of our world broken since 9/11
so there's maybe even another layer in

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:56.420
so there's maybe even another layer in
 

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.880
so there's maybe even another layer in
watching that second part of the show

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:57.890
watching that second part of the show
 

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:00.760
watching that second part of the show
here in New York City that might be a

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:00.770
here in New York City that might be a
 

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.410
here in New York City that might be a
difference between the audiences I just

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:02.420
difference between the audiences I just
 

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.180
difference between the audiences I just

simple subject of the book has to do
with the relationship of the individual

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:09.710
with the relationship of the individual

to me that that distance between the
 

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.090

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:38.100
public and the private has all but
 

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.040
public and the private has all but
disappeared and 9/11 is an example of

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.050

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.260
survive it what does it do to them you
know and that's that's an eternal

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:09.270
know and that's that's an eternal
 

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.580
know and that's that's an eternal
subject and by no means the first

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:10.590

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.450
it's it's one of the reasons why the
play and why the book you know if people

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460
play and why the book you know if people
 

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.680
play and why the book you know if people
still read the book and what I think

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:18.690
still read the book and what I think
 

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:27.440

anything I'd have to add to that is that
 

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:30.470
anything I'd have to add to that is that
sometimes that when you when you look at

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.030
sometimes that when you when you look at
these images that are coming on on

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040
these images that are coming on on
 

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.460
