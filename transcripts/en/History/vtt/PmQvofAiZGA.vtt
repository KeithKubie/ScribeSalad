00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.290
NARRATOR: From
about 1525 to 1866,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.830
12 and 1/2 million Africans
were taken from their homeland

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.710
and forcibly shipped
across the Atlantic.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.710
A journey that almost 2 million
of them wouldn't survive.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.500
By the turn of the 18th
century, European merchants

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830
were building vessels
capable of transporting

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.710
hundreds of slaves per journey.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.750
These ships had extra
portholes for ventilation,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.500
weapons mounted on deck
in case of rebellion,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.880
and additional compartments
added below deck

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.580
to take on more human cargo.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.830
Before boarding the ships
at African port cities,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.670
slaves were stripped
of their clothing

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.250
and remaining
possessions and had

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.500
their heads completely shaved.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920
During boarding, which could
take weeks or even months,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.750
slaves lived on the
deck of the ship

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.920
in a temporary wooden house
constructed by the crew.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.880
The crew also installed
netting around

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.580
the deck of the ship
designed to catch

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.920
slaves who might opt for
death over forced servitude.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.170
Once moved below deck, slaves
would find themselves stuffed

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750
into compartments
with ceilings as

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.000
low as 4 and 1/2
feet, where they would

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.290
spend most of their voyage.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.620
They were segregated
by gender and age.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
Adult men were kept separately
and shackled in pairs,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.790
women usually left unbound in
their designated compartment,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.620
and children often free
to move about the ship.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.790
There was no
plumbing of any kind.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.460
Slaves were forced to relieve
themselves where they sat,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.620
creating hellish conditions when
combined with the heat and lack

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.420
of ventilation below deck.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.290
Disease was rampant.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.290
Measles, smallpox, influenza,
scurvy, and dysentery,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.960
the number one killer, ravaged
slaves and crew members alike.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.120
The slaves generally spent about
eight hours a day above deck,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.380
but were still separated
by gender with a barricado,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.250
a reinforced wall that could
be used to protect crew members

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.830
in case of a revolt.
Slaves were also

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.460
subject to forced
exercise, sometimes

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.000
including dance and song for
the entertainment of the crew.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.500
Disobedient slaves were tortured
and beaten, usually whipped

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.830
with the especially cruel cat
of nine tails, a tool designed

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.500
to inflict maximum pain.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.830
Slaves who refused to eat their
typical meal of rice and beans

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.670
were forced to do so,
sometimes with a speculum

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.960
oris, a medieval tool used
to pry open unwilling mouths.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.500
Women, while usually
left unshackled,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.460
were raped and sexually
abused by members of the crew,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.250
sometimes arriving in the new
world carrying the children

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.750
of their attackers.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.460
But it was the women using
their minuscule freedoms

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.960
who would often coordinate
mutinies against their captors.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.500
But these rebellions
were rarely successful.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.210
The true extent of the
horrors of the Middle Passage

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.620
came to light in a 1783 court
trial over the slave ship Zong.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.500
The Zong left Africa in 1781
with 442 enslaved on board.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.540
After a two month journey
riddled with navigation errors,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.170
62 slaves and seven crew members
had perished without reaching

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.540
their destination.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.290
Disease was spreading
throughout the ship,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.170
and fresh water was
running dangerously low.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.120
Captain Luke Collingwood was
afraid of the financial costs

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.330
of more deaths.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.040
Slaves that died
of disease were not

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.080
covered by the ship's insurance,
but slaves who drowned were.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.920
Some 133 slaves were
thrown overboard.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.580
Collingwood claimed it
was necessary to do so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.710
to halt the spread of disease.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.710
At the trial between
the Zong's owners

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.500
and their insurance
company, the owners

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.330
argued that because it was
legal to kill sick animals

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.250
for the health of a ship,
it was legal to treat

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.580
infected slaves the same.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.420
The court agreed.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.080
But the trial itself exposed
the horrors aboard the Zong.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.330
The story was republished
by British abolitionists

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.080
with the name of
the ship redacted,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080
meant to show that this tragedy
could happen on any slave

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.750
ship across the Middle Passage.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.710
24 years after the Zong
trial, the slave trade

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.750
was outlawed in both Great
Britain and the United States.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.420
It would take England another
26 years and the US another 58,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.460
plus a civil war, before
the practice of slavery

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.880
was banned outright.
