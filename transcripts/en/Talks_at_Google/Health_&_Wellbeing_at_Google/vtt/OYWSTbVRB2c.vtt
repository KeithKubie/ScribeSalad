00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.000
I had been introduced earlier, but my name is Uno and I am the president of Nouvst

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.000
Which is a body change personal gym

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you for having me today

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's get started then, first, I would like to start with a quick introduction of myself

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
What I have done in the past

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.000
And, after this, if you have questions or things you would like to ask about your body in your daily life

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.000
Or if there are general questions you would like to ask

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000
At the end, we've also invited our staff today

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.000
For a few minutes, we would like to do a simple demo on how to improve our bodies

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
Thank you for coming today despite your busy schedule

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's get right into it then

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.000
In 1999

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.000
I worked for a big sports club called Konami sports for 15 years

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.000
15 to 16 years

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
Until a little part of this year, I was working there

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
Has anyone heard of Konami Sports Club here?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm glad to hear that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.000
They have about 200 branches, and I worked as an instructor

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
I started when I was 19

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.000
Starting out as a part time, and I became an employee after

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.000
I specialized in studio exercises and dance

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.000
I may not look it, but I did teach dance exercises

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.000
And, bicycle exercises, some of you may be familiar with feel cycle

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.000
There are bicycle programs, it isn't exactly feel cycle, but other bicycle programs

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.000
These are the programs I handled

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000
And starting in May this year

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.000
I opened my own personal gym, a gym that specializes in personal training

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.000
That is about my career

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.000
Within these experiences

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.000
I also introduce myself as a body builder

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
The reason I started body building

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.000
Is because of my twin brother

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.000
As you can see in the picture

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.000
By the way, I am the one in the left

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
The right is my younger twin brother

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.000
We both worked at Konami sports for over a decade

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.000
At the end, we were both in the same store in Musashikosugi

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.000
I entered the industry around 2 years earlier

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.000
After my brother joined

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.000
My brother started body building first

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.000
When I started, there were some who were body building

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.000
I had an image of them wearing short pants

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.000
It wasn't a good impression, so I couldn't find interest in it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.000
But my brother

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.000
In 2011

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:20.000
Joined a contest that's become famous for Nakayama Kinikun and Kasuga from Audrey joining

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.000
It's the contest called Tokyo Open Body Building Championships

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.000
It is sort of the gateway to success for newcomers

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.000
My brother, took part 2 years ago in 2009

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.000
And out of the blue, he won the competition

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.000
And as the fate of twins had come

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.000
The people around us started saying that I could do it too because I was the twin

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.000
The typical path of the case of twins

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.000
There was some time apart

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.000
My brother joined in 2009

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.000
And 2 years after, in 2011, after avoiding it for sometime

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.000
I eventually failed to completely avoid it, I joined the competition in 2011

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.000
I eventually was able to have results that proved we were in fact twins

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.000
In that year, in the same Tokyo Open division

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.000
And, there is also the different weight divisions

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.000
In weight divisions in Tokyo, it is in the top classes of competition

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.000
I joined them one after the other

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.000
And luckily, I managed to win

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.000
I started body buildin gin 2011, and in 2012

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.000
In body building, the biggest competition is called the All Japan Championship

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.000
With divisions other than this, once you win you cannot take part in it again

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.000
So, every competition you win levels up, this is the challenging part of it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.000
I kept doing this in a year

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.000
In 2014, in "Japan Men's Physique Best Body" which has now become popular

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.000
What is different from others is that you have to wear this surf pants

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.000
I thought that this would be alright, so I joined it for the first time

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.000
From the first All Japan championship

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.000
I finished in the 3rd place

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.000
Last year, I also took part in the Asian championship

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.000
This is the list of contests I've taken part in

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.000
It is quite extreme

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.000
Compared to those who do not body build

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.000
There's a preparation period for the competition, with food and training

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.000
There is an extreme difference

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.000
By doing this, it spreads my perspective

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.000
When I train people on their diet and health maintenance

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.000
It really broadens my perspective and knowledge

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.000
In this way, I think it was a good experience

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.000
With food intake

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.000
When you think about the food that body builders eat, what comes to your mind?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.000
Eating a lot of protein

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.000
Of course that is not wrong

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.000
We do put protein at the center of our diet

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.000
Having a balanced food intake is a body builder's diet

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.000
Basically, food

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.000
For normal people, it may be too strict

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.000
For people who have been on diets

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.000
It may be a little less strict, and the variety of choice have also expanded

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.000
This is something I learned from experience

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.000
In terms of the training, it is mostly muscle training

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.000
Has anyone here done muscle training before

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.000
Muscle training, I think for most body builders

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.000
In a week, the days that they do muscle training at the gym is

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.000
About 5 to 6 days a week, so that's almost every day

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.000
It may be different for people who do normal training

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.000
So, they go into the gym, and spend about 1 hour to 2 hours

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.000
And, they only work on one part

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.000
For example, if it is this arm, they will only do this arm on a particular day

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.000
In a week, they are able to train their whole body, this is the kind of training they do

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.000
It may be unimaginable for some people

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.000
For non body builders, it is not a practical way

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.000
There are also many happenings at the competition

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.000
Because these trainings can be very strict

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.000
So, it might be best to

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.000
Get right into the topic that everyone can relate to

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.000
Off season, currently, it is the off season

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.000
During off season, just like everyone else, we would eat anything and everything

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.000
We would also go out and enjoy drinking

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.000
Just like everyone else

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.000
Just because one is a body builder

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.000
It doesn't mean that they are any different, they aren't much different

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.000
I would like to take a quick survey

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.000
If there are questions or concerns related to it

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.000
I would like to help resolve them

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.000
So, let's start

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.000
We will write down all your questions on the whiteboard

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.000
If you tried going on a diet but didn't see results

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.000
If you have anything to ask about your body

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.000
Please let me know if you have anything

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.000
Yes

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.000
How much should I control carbohydrates

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.000
Do you currently control your carbohydrates?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.000
A little

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.000
Let's put carbohydrate control

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.000
I'd like to take out some questions that gets asked

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.000
And, guide you through using those

00:08:49.100 --> 00:09:06.000
Question

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.000
My weight fluctuates within the day

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.000
I weigh myself once a day

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.000
The following day that I eat a lot, for some weird reason my weight is lighter

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.000
So, let's put this as the second one

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.000
Are there anymore?

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.000
My gym trainer often tells me to take protein

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.000
In my case, I am worried about chemical additives

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:38.000
How much of artificial things including protein affect our bodies?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.000
Especially when it comes to chemical additives

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.000
Do you mean with protein?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.000
That is very specialized

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.000
There are quite a few, right? Within those variations

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.000
Are there anything else?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.000
I often go to the gym, and I eat a lot

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.000
I go to the gym a lot, and I eat a lot, and I take protein too

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.000
But I can't seem to gain weight

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.000
Hard to gain weight, okay

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.000
How thoroughly do you train?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.000
Do you mean in my case?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.000
Yes

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.000
And, generally, what is the standard

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.000
I also join contests

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:58.000
I work out 5 to 6 times a week, and I lift pretty heavily, but I have a hard time getting muscle pain

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.000
In actual, I am becoming bigger, so it might be that I am already used to it but

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.000
I am having trouble figuring out if I should put more load into my work out

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.000
By the way, what contest do you join

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.000
Summer Style Award

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.000
I see, that's a pretty high levelled one, fantastic

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.000
Are there others? Yes

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.000
Sorry, I assume the best way is to go to the gym and train

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.000
But, is there anything that can be implemented within a daily life

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.000
I think there might be a lot, but if there is something that you recommend, I would like to know

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.000
In your normal day to day

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.000
Something that you can implement in your daily life

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:52.000
If there are other things that can be done aside from the usual walking and climbing up the stairs

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.000
By the way, do you have a particular physical goal in mind?

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.000
For example, if you want to improve a stiff shoulder

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.000
It could be weight loss

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, I think both

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.000
Both

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.000
Is there anything else?

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:47.000
If the goal was to lose weight, what is the ideal ratio for aerobic exercise and muscle training?

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:10.000
It is a bit similar to the question earlier, but if I were to gain muscle, is it best to do aerobic exercises or not?

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.000
I think that might be losing weight while still maintaining bulk

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.000
That's a very hard-core question

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.000
How to lose weight while maintaining bulk

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.000
Let's look into each of this

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.000
So

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.000
First of all

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.000
Lately

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.000
It has become a fad

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:02.000
To debate about whether carbohydrate control is good or bad, extreme carbohydrate control

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:08.000
It is done even in big personal gyms too

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:15.000
When it comes to diet, there are various ways to do it

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.000
If you ask simply if it is good to control or not

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.000
Of course, people who do commit to carbohydrate control

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.000
Do lose weight and see results

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.000
The principle behind this has something to do with the term Ketone body

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.000
What this is is, by limiting your carbohydrates

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.000
The Keton is released

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:46.000
This has extreme effects in burning fat, simply put, the principle is

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.000
When extreme carbohydrate limitations are made

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.000
It will be very good for those that can stick to it

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:58.000
Because carbohydrates are simply energy that we use on a daily basis

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.000
Energy is converted extremely quickly

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.000
These are bread, rice balls, and such foods

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.000
Here we have fats that are said to be used for energy, but it is seldom used

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.000
By putting extreme limit to carbohydrate intake

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:20.000
The theory is that the Keton is released and it uses the fat to be converted to energy

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.000
If you ask whether it's good or bad

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.000
When it comes to basics of diet and muscle gain

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.000
If it works for you then that's great

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.000
But the ideal is to not do anything extreme to avoid rebounds

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.000
When I say extreme, when you completely cut carbohydrates then that is quite extreme

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.000
It would be very hard

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.000
Then when you go back to your old diet

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.000
Since there is a large difference

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.000
There is this thing called the glucose level when talking about carbohydrates

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.000
By consuming carbohydrates your glucose level shoots up

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.000
So, if you don't consume any, it goes down, this creates extreme changes

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.000
Making the probability of going on a rebound is very high

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.000
On the other hand, if you consume a lot of carbs your glucose level goes up, and this is what happens on a normal day

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.000
Of course, if you lose this, it would be very hard

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.000
So, when I say do not do anything extreme

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:23.000
It is because it is best not to create a gap between these two

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.000
I've looked through the diet of many people for the past decade or so

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:35.000
I've witnessed that the probability of success is much greater

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.000
So, there are people who can stick to this kind of diet but

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.000
There are many that rebound from this

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.000
It restricts so much calories, so when you cut your carbohydrates

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.000
The diet allows you to eat fat

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.000
But the calorie cut from restricting the carbohydrate intake is about 4 calories for 1 gram

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:01.000
So, in one bowl of rice, that is about 200 calories

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.000
If you don't eat it for a long period of time, this will reduce the calories

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.000
Then, when you try to put that back, the calorie intake simply goes over

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:16.000
Calorie intake and calorie out are the basics of diet

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.000
All types of diet boil down to the basics

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.000
So, if this simply increases, it will keep increasing

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.000
The most effective way not to rebound is

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:35.000
Not to reduce the muscle weight

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.000
Of course, when you intake calories, fat intake also increases

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.000
And as long as you don't lose the muscle weight, when you want to lose the body fat again this will help

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.000
The muscle is like the engine in a car

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.000
If the engine is big, when you run the car, it drinks up the gasoline

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.000
Gasoline is the energy source

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.000
But when the engine is small

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.000
No matter how much you run the car

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.000
It will not consume the gasoline, because it's a fuel-efficient car

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.000
For humans, it is better if it is a gas guzzler

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.000
So, it was also mentioned in the question earlier but

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.000
The ratio between the muscle training and the aerobic exercise

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.000
Even if you do a lot of aerobic exercises

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:28.000
If you do not have muscles, the calories will not burn as much

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:35.000
So, the base is not to lose muscles

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.000
When you think about it, going back to the topic earlier, if carbohydrate restrictiion is

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.000
Good or bad

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.000
Not doing something extreme

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.000
Is the best way to continue in the long term

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.000
When you see it as it is, it may be good when you want to lose weight in a short period

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.000
This is something you can do

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.000
There are many theories on this

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.000
Is everyone alright?

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.000
There was a question about the fluctuation of the weight within the day

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:19.000
When it comes to food intake, is it mostly similar menu and the same amount?

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.000
I do cut out rice often in the week

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.000
When I tried to eat rice for a day

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.000
The following day, my weight reduced

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:45.000
And, the following day, when I eat meat more than usual, my weight had gained

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:55.000
I am confused because I lost more weight when I ate more the day before than on days when I cut carbs

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.000
When it comes to weight changes

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.000
There are simply patterns, one is increase in body fat

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.000
And there is also water weight

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.000
When you drink 500 grams of water, you can gain 500 grams of water

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.000
So, the fluctuation in weight is normal

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.000
There are great fluctuations within the content of your food

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.000
One is the water consumption

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:25.000
To intake a lot of water means salt

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.000
It is salt, so when you consume too much salt

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.000
The water is absorbed into the body

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.000
Simply put, the effect is edema or swelling

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:42.000
Especially, for those who work in Google, you are on your computers

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.000
The time you spend sitting down is very long

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:54.000
It affects the lower part of your body very much, and it builds up the swelling in your lower body

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.000
In addition to this, I also had some of the food served here

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.000
You can eat a lot during lunch

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:09.000
Compared to preparing food by yourself, the amount of salt is comparatively high

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:14.000
If you do not control it, to be honest, the salt is very high

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:20.000
The ideal is said to be 4 to 5 grams a day

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:27.000
When you eat out and eat obento from the convenience store

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.000
When you consume these, without a doubt you consume 3 to 4 times more of the required amount

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:38.000
When you drink water normally, the water will refuse to flush out of your body

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.000
And this will add up to the your weight and pile up

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.000
But with in this amount of food, even if the amount of food does not change

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.000
When the level or grams of the salt in the seasoning goes over, this also happens

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.000
And, since you do desk work for long hours

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.000
This would be one of the final reasons

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.000
There is the way you sit down on a chair

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:08.000
Depending on the way you sit and your posture, your muscles stiffen

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.000
When you work on your computer for a long time, that's is why there were people that had troubles with stiff shoulders

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.000
Sitff shoulders occur because the muscles are stiff

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.000
Humans have blood vessels

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.000
And blood runs through this

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.000
When you are on your computer for a long time, our head that usually weighs 5 kilograms

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.000
This 5 kilograms leans forward

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.000
The weight of this is constantly on here

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.000
Then, this part here will be on a constant muscle training using your head

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:39.000
When it stiffens, the blood vessels underneath your muscles

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.000
These blood vessels are basically a tube

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.000
It crushes it, and as a result the flow becomes bad

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.000
This also stops the water from flushing because it crushes the hose

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:55.000
If the flow is bad, it also affects the emission of body waste that

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.000
Allows a good blood circulation

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.000
If this stagnates

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:06.000
The body fat does not increase but the body weight does increase

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.000
On the other hand, if you sweat a lot or if you haven't consumed as much as salt

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.000
This would be adjusted

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.000
When it is flushed out the body, there are cases that it reduces the weight, it could be this fluctuation

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.000
It is very less likley that you will lose 1 kilogram of body fat in a day or 2

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:30.000
To gain 1 kilogram of body fat, that would be about consuming 8000 calories

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.000
Is that 8000 kilocalories?

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.000
Yes, kilocalories

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.000
Can you eat 8000 kilocalories?

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.000
I think it is quite impossible

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.000
Then, there is also the calories that you burn in a day

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:49.000
A normal adult burns through about 100 calories a day

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.000
No matter how much desk work you do, or how much you don't move around, you will burn 1000 calories

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.000
When you think about this, a diet that will give you over 8000 calories is impossible

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:05.000
If this goes on a long period for about a week or 2, it builds up, a kilogram increase is possible

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.000
But, fluctuations on a daily basis is mainly from water

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:13.000
In controlling water, salt takes up the biggest part of it

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.000
I think that is what is happening here

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.000
Let's see the next question

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.000
Including the suppliment BCA and other chemical additives

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.000
To be honest, chemical additives are not good for you

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.000
There are many discussions on this but

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:34.000
When you are on a diet, because you do not want to take in calories

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.000
The zero calories that you intake in your diet

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:42.000
Includes aspartame and other synthetic sweeteners

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.000
But when you think about it in terms of health, it is not good for you

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.000
Suppliments such as BCA are often consumed

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.000
But BCA is basic amino acid and has a sense of bitterness

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:59.000
To control the taste without adding calories

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.000
Most suppliments have them, especially foreign made ones

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.000
I would not say it is extremely bad for you

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.000
But, if it is just a normal diet, or if it is for health maintenance

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.000
You might not need to worry about it too much

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.000
But if you compare not taking it to taking it, to be honest

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.000
It is not something that is completely healthy for your body

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:34.000
But there is no need to avoid it all completely

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:42.000
If you are very sensitive about these things, there are additive free products being sold lately

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.000
It is becoming quite popular, so you can choose to use those

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:53.000
I personally think that there is no reason to be that strict about it

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.000
Are we good?

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.000
After this, is about not being able to gain weight even after muscle training

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.000
By the way

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.000
How is your stomach now?

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.000
After eating, I feel full

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:20.000
What I am concerned about is that, I eat a lot, but I cannot consume enough

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.000
The required calorie intake and such

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.000
How is your bathroom situation?

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.000
This is quite important

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:33.000
The reason why you do not gain weight is, when you eat a lot, train a lot, and eat more

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.000
The food becomes nutrients to your body and especially becomes an ingredient for your muscles

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.000
The main source is protein

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.000
Is this food being absorbed

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:49.000
And what is most important is wether it is being used as an ingredient to make muscles or not

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:55.000
In figuring this out, the most easy way to decide is

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.000
Your bathroom frequency

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:03.000
If you have diarrhea, it means the nutrients are not being absorbed

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.000
Do you have diarrhea? Are you okay?

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.000
I thought it might be the supplements

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.000
It is not the supplements

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:23.000
But the it is about the intestinal environment, when you try to get bigger or you try to eat a lot to gain muscle

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.000
When you consume alcohol, things that you do to worsen the intestinal environment

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.000
This would also be consuming too much oily food

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.000
The intestines end up not functioning

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.000
So, when it consumes a lot all at once, it would not absorb it

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.000
No matter how much you eat, if it does not get absorbed, this means that it has not become the muscle's ingredient

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:48.000
So, the first thing is, to improve your weight gain

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.000
And, this can apply to all of this

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:56.000
It applies to health maintenance, diet, and muscle gian

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:04.000
With the intestines, internal organs, especially the intestines, it is important to make them function welll

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.000
How this works is

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.000
I will explain this after we answer all the questions, so please wait for that

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:22.000
The training load and muscle strains

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.000
Even after training, not experiencing muscle pain

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.000
It is hard for me to get them

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.000
This also has the same answer to the previous question

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.000
There are actually a lot of people who have the same problem

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.000
Most people have this problem

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.000
The biggest cause of this is

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.000
Do you work on the muscle training maching? Do you do free weights? Or is it a mixture?

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.000
I do both

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.000
Both

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.000
The reason you do not get muscle pain is that, it may be that the way you exercise is wrong

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.000
But most likely it isn't the case

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:03.000
The biggest cause is the position of your bones

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.000
Is not good

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.000
Simply put, there is a strain there

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.000
It means that your body is not moving the way it is supposed to move

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:22.000
The cause for this is your lifestyle and your work lifestyle

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:29.000
And, as we mentioned earlier, it is also related to the proper functioning of the intestines

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.000
There are many who do not get muscle pain anymore

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.000
I have been in this industry for 15 to 16 years

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.000
When I started out, there were rarely people who did not get muscle pain

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.000
There was no one

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.000
Now, there are so many

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.000
What is the part of your body that least gets muscle pain?

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.000
My back

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.000
Your back

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.000
There are many who do not get muscle pain in their back

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.000
And, lately, there are a lot that do not have them on their chests, and the fornt of their arms

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:07.000
The reason for that is because of desk work, computers, and smartphones

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:14.000
Smartphones, we use smartphones very much, and the position of our bones have changed

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.000
I assume that you work on a sitting on a chair

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.000
For not being able to see the results in training or see the results in dieting

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.000
It is because of the strain, but there are 2 major parts

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.000
It is the scapula (shoulder bone) and the pelvis

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.000
If this is in the original position, the organ's functionanilty also increases

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:43.000
The easiest way this would collapse is when you sit down

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.000
When you are seated, your pelvis is position like this

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.000
So, your ischium does not stand properly

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.000
Either way

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.000
Oh, that is the typical sitting position I am talking about

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.000
But, we do end up having this position

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.000
When we sit for a long time in this position

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.000
Our pelvis tilts to the back like this

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.000
When it tilts backwards, this part becomes round

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.000
Then we have our head that weighs about 5 kilograms

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.000
This posture, and you are on your computer

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.000
What happens is, the weight of this goes to here

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.000
The position of your shoulder goes forward, and you have a hunched back

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.000
When this happens you will get stiff shoulders

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.000
When you do this for a long period of time, it becomes stiff here

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:31.000
When it gets stiff, of course your blood does not go up, so you start to get headaches, and your neck starts to hurt

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.000
These are the symptoms you get

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:38.000
On top of that, if your pelvis tilts backwards like this

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:47.000
You get stress here, and the power of your upper body goes out and keeps going outward

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.000
Your belvis starts to spread and spread to the sides

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.000
When this happens, the bones on your feet, the thigh bone

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.000
Starts to open outward

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.000
Then, your pelvis opens

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.000
Your internal organs, since your pelvis opens up, it starts to fall down

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.000
When it falls down, when the organs were initially in this position, ends up being here

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.000
When the functions deteriorates, it stops running

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.000
So, we change this posture

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.000
This is where your shoulders should really be

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.000
On top of your shoulder bones should be the head

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.000
Your hip should be parallel to your hip, and this is called the neutral position which is the right posture

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.000
Let's try it then

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.000
Isn't it hard?

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.000
It is hard

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.000
If it's hard to maintain this posture and keep your backbone's position

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.000
This means that your torso's muscles that maintains this posture is weak

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:50.000
As mentioned earlier, the muscles are the engine, so if it is weak

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:54.000
When tour muscles gets weaker and weaker, your metabolism deteriorates

00:32:54.100 --> 00:33:03.000
When you get into this bad posture, the flow deteriorates, and it further worsens

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.000
So, if you fix this posture, your intestines will also start to work better

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.000
If you don't work on improving this, your muscle training will also not become effective

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.000
So when it comes to dieting, gaining muscle, or simply maintaining good health

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.000
The conclusion is all the same

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.000
The only difference between a body builder and a normal person on a a diet or in maintaining good health is

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.000
The volume in the things they do

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.000
The number of reps they do and the weight

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.000
But the way they do it is the same

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:46.000
What is most important is to correct the body's strain

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.000
In the office, standing desks are recommended these days, what do you think of this?

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.000
Standing desks are also

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.000
Can you stand please

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.000
When you stand for a long period of time

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.000
You would naturally lean towards either side

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.000
If there's a counter in front, you may also lean on it

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:16.000
You can sit down on a chair in the right posture with ease

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.000
This is sold on the internet for about 800 Yen

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.000
If you have the desk like this

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.000
It might not look so good but

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.000
Get as close as you can to the desk and your elbow should be

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.000
Imagine that the desk is here

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.000
And as much as possible

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.000
The elbow must be lifted but attached to the desk

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.000
As much as possible the ischium should be straight

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.000
I think it is hard to grasp how exactly to let it stand straight

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.000
You would need the ball here

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.000
Can you stand up first?

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:01.000
There is the part that hunches, so you would need to put the ball where it hunches

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.000
This is the backrest

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.000
In this state, you would lean on the ball when you're sitting down at work

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:12.000
It automatically sets the line here correctly

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:19.000
This chair might be different, but an office chair may be more like this?

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.000
I think it stands here more

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.000
Then it fits right in

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.000
In this position

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.000
If you have had bad posture for a while

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.000
This would collapse

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.000
To know whether the proper posture collapses, the ball will tell you if it falls

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:45.000
If the ball falls out, it means your posture is not correct

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.000
You must be able to sit with letting it fall to improve your posture

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.000
You must start fixing this first

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.000
The reason why your back training doesn't work is because you work on your computer in this posture

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.000
Your shoulder bones are like this

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.000
When you are on your computer a lot, it becomes like this

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.000
With a hunchback, your shoulders come forward, and your shoulder bones is in this position

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.000
In this state your back is

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.000
This gets slightly technical but

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.000
It is this kind of movement, when you do a lot of pull down using your upper body

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.000
It has to be this kind of movement

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:30.000
If you have a hunchedback, it will not move when you have your shoulder bones straight like this

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.000
You have to start setting it in this position

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.000
Or else, no matter how much you train, you will not get muscle pain

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.000
It means that you are not able to use it effectively

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.000
It doesn't mean that your way of doing it is wrong, but it means that your shoulder bone stands the wrong way

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.000
It is the strain in your body

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.000
When you start fixing your posture, then you will start to get proper results

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.000
Their women especially, their pelvis opens easily

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.000
It must be tucked in properly and the shoulder bone should be in the proper position

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:03.000
While you do your training, it is something that actually doesn't get much attention

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:10.000
It is the most common cause of why you don't get muscle pain or your training isn't effective

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.000
Can you demonstrate how the elbows should be again please?

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:20.000
Your elbows must be attached to the desk properly

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.000
Do you use a mouse?

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.000
You don't. It is better if you don't use one.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.000
Usually, the shoulder of the hand that uses the mouse tends to lift up like this

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.000
When your elbow lifts up, it means that your arm, though it isn't that heavy

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.000
If you keep this for 3, 4, ,or 5 hours

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:41.000
You will use your arm as weights, and it is the same as training it

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.000
So, this part gets really stiff

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.000
Both sides should be the same height

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.000
And you put it on the desk so that you don't use your arm as weights

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.000
As much as possible

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.000
Put your chair closer to your desk

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:07.000
In the standing posture, it is the standing version of it

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:15.000
The shoulder bone should be aligned to the pelvis and it is ideal if it can be performed in this psoture

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:20.000
So, if you have your computer on a counter

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.000
The way you can improve your posture is to

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.000
Go very close to the counter

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.000
Are we good?

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.000
How about using balance balls?

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.000
There are many who use balance balls

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.000
But balance balls are unstable right?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.000
When you are supposed to sit down with your ischium and both hands aligned

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:48.000
When you get on the balance ball, it becomes more unstable, and contributes to the train

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.000
It would contribute more to the strain

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.000
With the unstableness of the balance ball

00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:02.000
To eliminate the unstableness, it uses your core, often called the core training, and it helps to strengthen the core

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.000
By doing this and having your lower body unstable

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.000
It makes something that is already strained, more strained

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.000
I don't think it is very good for you

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.000
If you use it in core training, then that would be fine

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:21.000
If the pelvis isn't positioned well, and it is opened, then your organs will keep going down

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.000
More and more, especially for women, the flow to your lower body will be worse and worse

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.000
It is cycle of edema

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.000
So, as much as possible, I think it is best to avoid balance balls

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.000
I've been doing it for 5 to 6 years

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.000
5 to 6 years?

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.000
You might have spent 5 to 6 years strengthening your core

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.000
But if you don't keep this aligned, in the end

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:52.000
As we mentioned earlier, the foundation is to make the blood flow better, and better the organ's function

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:58.000
The most important is to eliminate the strain of your frame

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.000
I think you should go back to using a normal chair

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.000
Going back to the training load not being effective,

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.000
What you can do is, work on pre trainings before the actual training

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:16.000
Work on the normal frame, but since it is hard to put it back by just posture

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.000
For further ways on improving, I can do a one-on-one consultation on that

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.000
It might take more than an hour if we do it here

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:30.000
Let's get to the next one on exercises you can do on a daily basis

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.000
In everyday life

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.000
Of course, it is best to do muscle training and the like but

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:47.000
In your lifestyle, I assume you spend the most time at work

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:53.000
If you can work on the things we talked about today, then that is the best thing you can do

00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:00.000
In addition to that, if you have time, then you can work on muscle training and your diet

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.000
The fundamental, since working takes up most of your time

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:12.000
If you utilize this time well, then you can continue it for a long time

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.000
Training usually takes 30 minutes to 1 hour right?

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.000
Since the time you spend at work is longer

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:23.000
It is best to make the most out of this time

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:29.000
More than thinking of running more or training

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:38.000
It is more effective to try and get your lifestyle right, correct your strain for better blood circulation

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.000
Are we good?

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.000
Now let's look at weight loss in a short period

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.000
Who asked this?

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.000
Have you tried losing weight in a short amount of time?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:57.000
I think it is fascinating, but I've heard stories that they rebound after that

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:02.000
I wondered if you had to do it properly whether you had to continue doing it

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.000
In short term diets, for example

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.000
If you need to lose a certain number by a certain date

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.000
Then, you can simply calculate it by tracing back

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.000
As I mentioned earlier, diet is about calorie in and calorie out

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:25.000
For example, if you need to lose weight after 10 days, that's a very short time though

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.000
If you need to lose 5 kg by then

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.000
As we talked about earlier, losing 1 kg of body fat is equivalent to 8000 calories

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.000
So, that would be 40,000 calories

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.000
If you need to lose 40,000 in this short period

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.000
If it's 10 days and you match your goal to that number of days

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:46.000
You will need to account the balance, and you have to burn 40,000 calories in 10 days

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.000
How you do this is thru food restriction

00:42:52.100 --> 00:43:00.000
For example, if it is very short, food restriction is not enough for burning calories

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.000
If it is not enough, the only resort is aerobic exercise

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.000
The shorter it gets

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:17.000
The more things you need to do to match the numbers

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:24.000
It may not be enough by simply controlling your diet, or with base metabolism

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:31.000
When you think about this, the short term diet puts on a lot of stress

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.000
It puts on a lot stress, so if you ask whether its good or bad

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:40.000
To be honest, it has risks of rebound

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:46.000
If you are able to continue

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.000
The restrictions during that short period, then you will be able to maintan it

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:52.000
But because you are doing it in a short period of time, it is very hard

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:58.000
It is hard so, the rebound rate increases too

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.000
And, when you lose body fat in a short amount of time

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:10.000
Basically, as the theory goes, when you lose 1 kg of body fat, you also lose 1 kg of muscle

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.000
Your body fat burns in a short period

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.000
But at the same time, your muscle also reduces

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.000
So, what they say about needing to train muscles while dieting is

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.000
What they mean is you need to avoid also burning the fat

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.000
Another purpose is to put muscle to increase your base metabolism

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.000
But it isn't that easy to gain muscle

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.000
Especially for women, regardless of how hard they work out, the female hormones come first

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.000
They do not get as much muscle

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:46.000
So, when it comes to muscle training during a diet

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.000
You have to lose the fat without losing the muscle

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.000
This is because of the theory that losing 1 kg of fat will lose 1 kg of muscle

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.000
And the priority is to stop this as much as possible

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.000
So, when doing this in a short period

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.000
Even if the body fat burns at a high speed, the muscle is also lost very quickly

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.000
When this happens, when you go back to your old diet

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.000
When only the calorie increases, and the muscle stays the same at low level

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.000
This becomes the most risky rebound

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.000
This is when losing weight in a short period of time

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.000
It shows very quickly, so as much as possible

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:34.000
Even if you do it at a fast pace, it should be at least 1 kg a week

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.000
The best way is to not put stress on yourself

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:43.000
Try to lose 1 kg to 2 kg in a month

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:47.000
And, ideally, you are able to do this reasonably

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.000
I think it depends on that person's body fat too

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.000
Is this okay?

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.000
Let's talk about the ratio of muscle training and aerobic exercise

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.000
It relates to what we talked about earlier but

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:10.000
If your goal is to diet

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:15.000
Putting a little aerobic exercise will not let the figures balance out

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.000
If you are not able to lose weight by controlling your diet

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.000
You can use aerobic exercises to lose the number up until the goal date

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:30.000
As I mentioned earlier, in an aerobic diet, it is often said that fat will start to burn after 20 minutes

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.000
But at the same time, the fat keeps burning

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:37.000
Your muscles are also burning off

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.000
Muscles are made out of protein, and this is used as energy

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.000
To run and walk

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:49.000
So, as much as possible, for those who want to diet efficiently without rebounds

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.000
You should not do aerobic exercises as much as possible

00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:02.000
You might often hear people say that running will help you lose weight which is true

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.000
But when you continue to run, you will also lose muscles with it

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:12.000
When I was training for the contests I mentioned earlier, I had 2% body fat

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.000
I did not do aerobic exercises even once

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:22.000
When the figures didn't match

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:28.000
I would not do aerobic exercises but I would go to a bedrock bath or a sauna to burn off the calories

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.000
These aren't aerobic exerises so

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.000
I would not lose my muscles

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.000
There are those who take BCA as mentioned earlier

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.000
When you perform aerobic exercises

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:46.000
Instead of drinking water, there are people who drink VAAM or fat burning suppliments

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:52.000
Other than that, there is also BCAA for muscle energy

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:59.000
There are suppliments to avoid degradation of the muscles, and these may slightly help in prevention

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:07.000
Your muscles cannot be in a catabolic state all the time

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:13.000
It must always be in an anabolic state

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:19.000
If you do this, you will not have to lose muscles

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:24.000
As for the ration, ideally do more muscle training

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:29.000
And lessen the aerobic exercises

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.000
Is this okay?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.000
Now, let's get into losing weight while maintaining bulk

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.000
That is a very hard core question

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:47.000
In maintaining muscles while still losing weight

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:52.000
As we talked about earlier, when you lose body fat your muscles also reduce, this is the theory

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:59.000
This may get a bit technical but

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:07.000
You have to consume protein in your diet, and this is a fundamental factor

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:13.000
When you lose weight while you maintain bulk

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:17.000
How much protein do you take?

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.000
About 3 times

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:26.000
Times 3, you take a lot

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.000
You have to at least take that much

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:37.000
At the same time, how do you take your work out drinks during training?

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.000
I started with drinking BCA

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.000
And, after a little while, I changed to HMB plus EA

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.000
That was lot of alphabets

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.000
Does is decrease with that?

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.000
For the recent contest, I think I was able to maintain it

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.000
But I still felt like it went down a little especially around my bottom

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.000
I feel like the bulk went down a bit

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:13.000
That means the weight you put on your bottom is not enough

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.000
Because you lost fat on it

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:21.000
I was able to keep it up to a certain point, but at the end I went down 3 to 4 centimeters in size

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:26.000
Our muscles are made out of 70% water

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.000
It is best not to cut out carbohydrates too much

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.000
But, when you do take it calories come in

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.000
If the calories pile up, the fat will not come off

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.000
So do it moderately

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:46.000
So, in your workout drink during training, do not forget to put carb drinks

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:51.000
Make sure to consume carbs before, during and after training

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:56.000
The fundamental is to include carbohydrates

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.000
And, this goes back to our discussion earlier

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:04.000
When you think about carbohydrate restriction, it is not very effective

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.000
There are many opinions on this, but that is was I think

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.000
But if you do not limit it, it will not come off

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.000
You can lose it through diet control

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.000
But you have to take carbs before, during, and after your work out

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:26.000
Bulk maintenance is

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.000
To put carbs in what is called the golden time where you can work out very hard

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:32.000
What I had a hard time with was

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.000
When I train during the day time, I take carbs after and during training

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.000
But since I have a day job, I usually train late at night

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:44.000
I usually finish at arounf 10 at night

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.000
I get a bit worried about taking carbs during this time

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:56.000
I think that is why I hadn't taken as much carbs at night during training

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.000
During training?

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.000
Yes, when it is at night

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.000
Do you train at night often?

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.000
Yes, very often

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:09.000
If that is the case, if your training fits in that schedule it is a must for you to take it

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:14.000
Make sure to take it before, during, and after

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:19.000
Regardless of when you fit your training in, you have to consume it

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:24.000
I think it is common for everyone to want leave as much weight as possible

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.000
This is a must

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.000
It is less likely that you would gain body fat from it

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.000
Is this okay?

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.000
Are there any other questions?

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:42.000
Regarding the load of training

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:47.000
For normal people performing muscle training, is there a number of reps?

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:55.000
A minimum and maximum that we should do?

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:06.000
For normal people, in terms of reps, what is standardly being said is

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.000
The standard is

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.000
You can do as many reps as you want

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:21.000
Is your goal to gain muscle?

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:27.000
If it is to gain muscle, they say that 6 to 10 time is a good number

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.000
The logic of setting a number of reps is good

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:42.000
But when you set a number of let's say 6 to 8

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:49.000
Let's say 60 kg benchpress

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.000
When you set a goal

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.000
You will continue to do it, until you reach it

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:58.000
When you are able to do this, of course your muscle gains

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.000
When you try to achieve this goal

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.000
You do not pay attention to your form

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:10.000
So, it is best to come up with a certain number of reps you want to do but

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.000
What is important is training your chest or your legs the correct way

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.000
To put load on the left and right equally

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:22.000
It is good to have an idea of how many reps you will do but

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.000
What I do is about 10 reps

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:36.000
With 10 reps, at the beginning I would do 100 kg with 10 reps

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.000
On the 2nd set, it will decrease naturally

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:44.000
If it does go down, you do not try too hard to do the same amount of reps

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:50.000
What is the worst you can do is to neglect your form

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.000
So, when normal people train

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.000
Do 10 reps with a clean form

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:04.000
Do it in a clean form, or if it is hard, do it as many as you can, this is the best way

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.000
How about in terms of number of sets?

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:12.000
For normal people, at the beginning 3 sets is a good number

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.000
The more you do it, will the effect be less in terms of the effect and the energy?

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:24.000
If you are properly putting the load on the muscles the more you do it, then that is the best

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:31.000
The best is that that muscle comes to a limit and you will reach its maximum capability

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.000
If you keep going even if the muscles are all out, then it will have a negative effect

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:46.000
To reach the all out stage, does it mean doing It once or twice has more effect?

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.000
We are talking about the form

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:55.000
The best way, they say, is if you can do an all out in 1 set, then 1 set is enough

00:55:55.100 --> 00:56:00.000
That needs technique to achieve

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.000
To be able to train effectively goes down to the frame and posture we talked about

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.000
If your frame is correct, the load on the muscles will go on correctly too

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.000
And even 1 set will be very effective

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.000
Of course, the bigger the muscles become

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:21.000
The weight becomes heavier and the sets have to be longer to reach the all out state

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:28.000
So, it doesn't mean doing 1 or 2 sets will be most effective to the muscles

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:32.000
Is that okay?

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.000
That is all for today, we will be closing this session.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.000
Thank you very much Mr. Uno thank you for coming today.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.000
Thank you.
