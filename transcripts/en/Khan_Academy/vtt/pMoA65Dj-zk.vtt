00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.930
The one thing that probably
causes some of the most pain

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.340
in chemistry, and in organic
chemistry, in particular, is

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.990
just the notation and the
nomenclature or the naming

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.000
that we use.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.380
And what I want to do here in
this video and really the next

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.570
few videos is to just make sure
we have a firm grounding

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.220
in the notation and in the
nomenclature or how we name

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.450
things, and then everything
else will

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.020
hopefully not be too difficult.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.430
So just to start off, and this
is really a little bit of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810
review of regular chemistry,
if I just have a chain of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.730
carbons, and organic chemistry
is dealing

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.040
with chains of carbons.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.540
Let me just draw a one-carbon
chain, so it's really kind of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.160
ridiculous to call it a chain,
but if we have one carbon over

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.200
here and it has four valence
electrons, it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.790
wants to get to eight.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.480
That's the magic number
we learned in

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.900
just regular chemistry.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.520
For all molecules, that's the
stable valence structure, I

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.270
guess you could say it.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.560
A good partner to bond
with is hydrogen.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.490
So it has four valence electrons
and then hydrogen

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.120
has one valence electron, so
they can each share an

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.280
electron with each other
and then they

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.550
both look pretty happy.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.970
I said eight's the magic number
for everybody except

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.330
for hydrogen and helium.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.180
Both of them are happy because
they're only trying to fill

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.820
their 1s orbital, so the
magic number for

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.280
those two guys is two.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.110
So all of the hydrogens
now feel like

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.370
they have two electrons.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.375
The carbon feels like
it has eight.

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.520
Now, there's several
ways to write this.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.320
You could write it just like
this and you can see the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.510
electrons explicitly, or you
can draw little lines here.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.320
So I could also write this
exact molecule, which is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740
methane, and we'll talk a little
bit more about why it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.400
called methane later
in this video.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.200
I can write this exact structure
like this: a carbon

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.745
bonded to four hydrogens.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.730
And the way that I've written
these bonds right here you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.810
could imagine that each of these
bonds consists of two

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.330
electrons, one from the carbon
and one from the hydrogen.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.840
Now let's explore slightly
larger chains.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.919
So let's say I have a
two-carbon chain.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.600
Well, let me do a three-carbon
chain so it really

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.790
looks like a chain.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.070
So if I were to draw everything
explicitly it might

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.700
look like this.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.710
So I have a carbon.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.650
It has one, two, three,
four electrons.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.090
Maybe I have another carbon here
that has-- let me do the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.570
carbons in slightly different
shades of yellow.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.170
I have another carbon
here that has one,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.100
two, three, four electrons.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.110
And then let me do the other
carbon in that first yellow.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.500
And then I have another carbon
so we're going to have a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.850
three-carbon chain.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.040
It has one, two, three, four
valence electrons.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.130
Now, these other guys are
unpaired, and if you don't

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.380
specify it, it's normally going
to be hydrogen, so let

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.100
me draw some hydrogens
over here.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.980
So you're going to have a
hydrogen there, a hydrogen

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.580
over there, a hydrogen over
here, a hydrogen over here, a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.740
hydrogen over there, a hydrogen
over here, almost

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.490
done, a hydrogen there, and
then a hydrogen there.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.245
Now notice, in this molecular
structure that I've drawn, I

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:13.850
have three carbons.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.120
They were each able to
form four bonds.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.080
This guy has bonds with three
hydrogens and another carbon.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.460
This guy has a bond with two
hydrogens and two carbons.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.280
This guy has a bond with three
hydrogens and then this carbon

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.840
right here.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.750
And so this is a completely
valid molecular structure, but

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.230
it was kind of a pain
to draw all of these

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.730
valence electrons here.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.190
So what we typically would want
to do is, at least in

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.680
this structure, and we're going
to see later in this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.010
video there's even simpler ways
to write it, so if we

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.920
want at least do it with
these lines, we can

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.680
draw it like this.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.400
So you have a carbon, carbon,
carbon, and then they are

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.170
bonded to the hydrogens.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.560
So you'll almost never see it
written like this because this

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.910
is just kind of crazy.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.000
Hyrdrogen, hydrogen-- at
least crazy to write.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.400
It takes forever.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.800
And it might be messy, like it
might not be clear where these

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.870
electrons belong.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.640
I didn't write it as
clearly as I could.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.610
So they have two electrons
there.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.980
They share with these
two guys.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.305
Hopefully, that was
reasonably clear.

00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:10.340
But if we were to draw
it with the lines, it

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.330
looks just like that.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.440
So it's a little bit neater,
faster to draw, same exact

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.560
idea here and here.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.579
And in general, and we'll go
in more detail on it, this

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.550
three-carbon chain, where
everything is a single bond,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.430
is propane.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.640
Let me write these words down
because it's helpful to get.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.080
This is methane.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.170
And you're going to see the
rhyme-- you're going to see

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.420
the reason to this naming
soon enough.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.120
This is methane; this
is propane.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.910
And there's an even simpler
way to write propane.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.340
You could write it like this.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.360
Instead of explicitly drawing
these bonds, you could say

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.010
that this part right here, you
could write that that part

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.710
right there, that is CH3, so you
have a CH3, connected to

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:06.350
a-- this is a CH2, that is CH2
which is then connected to

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.100
another CH3.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.300
And the important thing is, no
matter what the notation, as

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.010
long as you can figure out the
exact molecular structure, as

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.770
long as you can-- so there's
this last CH3.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.850
Whether you have this, this,
or this, you know what the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.870
molecular structure is.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.780
You could draw any one of these
given any of the others.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.370
Now, there's an even simpler
way to write this.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.350
You could write it
just like this.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.030
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.370
You literally could write it
so we have three carbons.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.550
So one, two, three.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.750
Now, this seems ridiculously
simple and you're like, how

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.710
can this thing right here give
you the same information as

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.180
all of these more complicated
ways to draw it?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.040
Well, in chemistry, and in
organic chemistry in

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.670
particular, any of these-- let
me call it a line diagram or a

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.870
line angle diagram.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.190
It's the simplest way and it's
actually probably the most

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.350
useful way to show chains
of carbons or to

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.860
show organic molecules.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.150
Once they start to get really,
really complicated, because

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.050
then it's a pain to draw all of
the H's, but when you see

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.470
something like this, you assume
that the end points of

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.110
any lines have a carbon on it.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.970
So if you see something like
that, you assume that there's

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.430
a carbon at that end point, a
carbon at that end point, and

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.830
a carbon at that end point.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.790
And then you know that carbon
makes four bonds.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.880
There are no charges here.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.440
All the carbons are going to
make four bonds, and each of

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.020
the carbons here, this carbon
has two bonds, so the other

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.860
two bonds are implicitly going
to be with hydrogens.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.820
If they don't draw them, you
assume that they're going to

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.460
be with hydrogens.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.170
This guy has one bond,
so the other three

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.940
must be with hydrogen.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.200
This guy has one bond, so the
other three must be hydrogens.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.300
So just drawing that little line
angle thing right there,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.320
I actually did convey the exact
same information as this

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.400
depiction, this depiction,
or this depiction.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.580
So you're going to see
a lot of this.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.050
This really simplifies things.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.930
And sometimes you see things
that are in between.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.820
You might see someone draw it
like this, where they'll write

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.490
CH3, and then they'll
draw it like that.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.430
So that's kind of combining
this way of writing the

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.270
molecule where you write the
CH3's for the end points, but

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.660
then you implicitly have
the CH2 on the inside.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.590
You assume that this end point
right here is a C and it's

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.850
bonded to two hydrogens.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:23.900
So these are all completely
valid ways of drawing the

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.390
molecular structures of these
carbon chains or of these

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.220
organic compounds.
