00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.529
I'm Sean Carroll and I'm a theoretical physicist
at the California Institute of Technology

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:06.759
in Pasadena, California.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.780
And I think about how
the laws of physics came to be,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.460
what they are and how they
make the universe that we live in.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.800
So the Big Bang doesn't break
any of the laws of thermodynamics.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.289
The two big ones are
the first law and the second law.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.570
The first law basically says
that energy is conserved.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.419
The second law says that entropy increases,
the disorderliness,

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.910
the disorganisation of things increases over
time.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.860
So the Big Bang... we don't know if it
was the beginning of the universe or not.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.940
If the universe has zero energy total,
which is possible,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.260
then the Big Bang could have
been the beginning of the universe.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.079
And it could have been the first
moment in the history of the universe

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.539
without violating conservation
of energy because energy is zero.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.780
The second law, the entropy increasing,
is an interesting case

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.219
because near the time of the
Big Bang entropy was very, very, very low.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.929
That's why it's been increasing
for the past 14 billion years.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.650
So that doesn't violate the
second law but the question is -

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.330
why did the Big Bang have such a low entropy

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.080
and the answer there is that nobody knows.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.470
This is an open question for cosmology.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.630
Why was the condition near the Big Bang
so special, so organised?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.300
There are, as you might expect,
many theories and many guesses

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.530
as to why
the Big Bang had such a low entropy.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.140
I'm responsible for some of them myself.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.960
For example, maybe before the Big Bang,
maybe there was something before the Big Bang,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.970
and before the Big Bang maybe there was a
condition where the entropy was very, very

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.970
high,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.560
but maybe the laws of physics are such
that there is no maximum value for the entropy.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.860
So that no matter how high the entropy gets,
it can always get higher.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.530
And maybe the way it gets higher is by spitting
off a new universe by a quantum transition

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.310
that bubbles into existence a whole other
universe

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.030
that breaks off from its parent and goes its
own way.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.780
Maybe that's where we came from.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.180
Maybe our Big Bang started tiny and low entropy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.000
because it just pinched off from
a larger, high entropy universe.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140
If there are many different universes

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.130
we don't know what the laws of physics
are going to be like in the other ones.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.760
We have theories of course.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.659
According to some of those theories, the laws
are exactly the same in all the different

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.659
universes.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.819
In other models some of the laws are different
but there's still basic principles that are

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.819
the same.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.799
So for example the idea of electric charge
might

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.329
be slightly different in one universe than
in another.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.859
The charge on one particle or another.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.200
But the idea that charge is conserved
is probably true in all of the different universes.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.420
The idea that energy is conserved is probably
just true no matter what universe you live in.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.100
Well if there are different regions of space
where there are different laws of physics,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.260
apparent laws of physics, what
we call low energy laws of physics,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.450
then probably the boundary between
them would be pretty crystal clear actually.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.379
It's very much like space itself is in a
different phase from one place to another

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.889
in the same sense that we
use the phrase "phases of matter".

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.459
Ice. Liquid water. Water vapour.
Different phases water can be in.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.150
And you know where the boundary is
between the ice and the liquid water.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.790
In the multiverse it's like different regions
of space are in different phases altogether

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.010
and we'll probably be able to know
where the boundary between them lies.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.279
As far as we know there is no necessary way
to be able to observe these other universes

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.870
even if they do exist.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.150
Now that's not necessary there's
possible ways to observe them

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.319
if we get lucky two universes
can actually bump into each other.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.019
You could actually see this sort of bruise
on our universe when we got bumped into

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.189
by another universe at a very, very early
times.

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.700
Of course we really don't mean universes at
all.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.330
What we really mean is a region,
an area, of our universe,

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.529
that there are different regions that have
different apparent laws of physics.

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.180
So this would be like a bubble in a pre-existing
space

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.510
and the bubbles grow and
the bubbles can bump into each other.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.510
How would you know?

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.659
Well if it happened early on
in the history of our universe,

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.310
it could either dump energy into us
or leech energy out of us.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.410
So there'd be a region of our early universe
that was

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.310
at a slightly different temperature than the
rest.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.610
Now we have a record of what
the temperature was in our early universe

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.660
from the cosmic background radiation,
the leftover radiation from the Big Bang.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.680
So what you do is you look at this cosmic
microwave background radiation and you ask

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.880
are the regions, hopefully circular regions,
where the temperature is a little bit different

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
over all.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.840
Now of course we have done this very, very
carefully.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.260
We've seen nothing. There are tiny variations,
but they do not look like circles,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.880
they don't look like universes bumping into
each other.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.750
So the parameter space for this to be real
is very, very small right now.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.570
I suspect it's not going to happen but we'll
keep looking.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.810
Otherwise we just have to ask -
is this idea of the multiverse

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.000
the best way we have of explaining the
universe that we do see and if not, we'll

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.500
abandon it.
