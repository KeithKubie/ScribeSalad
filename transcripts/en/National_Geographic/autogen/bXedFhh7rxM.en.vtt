through the burnt patch and so I guess

through the burnt patch and so I guess
 

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.120

that was why he was actually had a bit

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.130
that was why he was actually had a bit
 

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.419
that was why he was actually had a bit
of a theory as to why he was there

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:29.429
of a theory as to why he was there
 

00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:33.049

obviously the burn patch being

00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059

very short he's seeing a lot of food but
 

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.470
very short he's seeing a lot of food but
they're also seeing him and so he was

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480
they're also seeing him and so he was
 

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.419
they're also seeing him and so he was

looking hungry but also constantly
constantly trying to hunt something so I

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:50.650
constantly trying to hunt something so I
 

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.529
constantly trying to hunt something so I

nothing and I don't think it flew off
 

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:06.650
nothing and I don't think it flew off
because it was young for it to fly

not as much water it's great for for the
 

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.079
not as much water it's great for for the
places where the roads can get quite

another so if they are eaten the leaves
 

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.500
another so if they are eaten the leaves
are eaten they will start to produce I

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:29.510
are eaten they will start to produce I

only tastes unpleasant towards the
 

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.260
only tastes unpleasant towards the
giraffe itself but we'll send a chemical

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:38.270
giraffe itself but we'll send a chemical
 

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.230
giraffe itself but we'll send a chemical
message downwind to other trees and so

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240
message downwind to other trees and so
 

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.060
message downwind to other trees and so
they will up the production of this

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:43.070
they will up the production of this
 

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.420
they will up the production of this
compound as well and then well the

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:46.430
compound as well and then well the
 

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.980
compound as well and then well the
giraffe can't either so they will have

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:47.990
giraffe can't either so they will have
 

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:50.230
giraffe can't either so they will have
to eat downwind I mean sorry upwind I'm

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240
to eat downwind I mean sorry upwind I'm
 

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.790

just going to reverse of it so we don't

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800
just going to reverse of it so we don't
 

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:57.650
just going to reverse of it so we don't
lose a picture here

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.390
 
and so yeah it's really interesting I've

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400
and so yeah it's really interesting I've
 

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.770

actually been reading a little bit of a

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:01.780
actually been reading a little bit of a
 

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.960
actually been reading a little bit of a
book called the secret life of trees

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:03.970
book called the secret life of trees
 

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:06.390
book called the secret life of trees
going on about their communication and

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400
going on about their communication and
 

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.840
going on about their communication and
how they actually well they have more

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:09.850
how they actually well they have more
 

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:11.700
how they actually well they have more
forms of communication than we know

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:11.710
forms of communication than we know
 

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:15.150
forms of communication than we know
their roots in some forest areas the

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160
their roots in some forest areas the
 

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.450
their roots in some forest areas the
roots of trees can actually donate

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460
roots of trees can actually donate
 

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.730
roots of trees can actually donate
nutrients to trees that have been broken

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:20.740
nutrients to trees that have been broken
 

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.610
nutrients to trees that have been broken
down or are dying somehow and actually

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:23.620
down or are dying somehow and actually
 

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.810
down or are dying somehow and actually
help to bring them back to life so

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:24.820
help to bring them back to life so
 

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.270
help to bring them back to life so
there's actually communal care in some

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280
there's actually communal care in some
 

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.060
there's actually communal care in some
untouched tree ecosystem or not

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.070
untouched tree ecosystem or not
 

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.170
untouched tree ecosystem or not
untouched but less spoiled and they can

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:34.180
untouched but less spoiled and they can

or some sort of impulse through fungus

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:38.770
or some sort of impulse through fungus
 

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:42.710

in the soil which is just unreal

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720
in the soil which is just unreal
 

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.150
in the soil which is just unreal
absolutely unreal and they even have

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160
absolutely unreal and they even have
 

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.340
absolutely unreal and they even have
their own sort of nerve impulse I think

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:47.350
their own sort of nerve impulse I think
 

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.930
their own sort of nerve impulse I think
it goes with about a third of an inch

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:48.940
it goes with about a third of an inch
 

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.570
it goes with about a third of an inch
per second so very slowly but there is

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:51.580
per second so very slowly but there is
 

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.440
per second so very slowly but there is
some sort of impulse there yet cool

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:55.450
some sort of impulse there yet cool

I can see right here very nice against

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:05.860
I can see right here very nice against
 

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:10.110
I can see right here very nice against
the ole ole ole ole escarpment

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:10.120
 
 

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.620
 
keV can giraffe swim well I've never

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:13.630
keV can giraffe swim well I've never
 

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.050
keV can giraffe swim well I've never
actually seen a giraffe swim and I

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:16.060
actually seen a giraffe swim and I
 

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.850
actually seen a giraffe swim and I
wouldn't imagine if they could they

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:17.860
wouldn't imagine if they could they
 

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.510
wouldn't imagine if they could they
would be able to do it very well but I

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520
would be able to do it very well but I
 

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.180

basically and can kind of study it at a
 

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:23.600
basically and can kind of study it at a
later stage I suppose but that's what

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:23.610
later stage I suppose but that's what
 

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.740

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:29.110
hopefully the two boys cichlid without
 

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.870
hopefully the two boys cichlid without
hurting each other they were both got a

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880
hurting each other they were both got a
 

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.300
hurting each other they were both got a
few little kind of surface scratches and

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:35.310
few little kind of surface scratches and
 

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.830
few little kind of surface scratches and
so but a few scratches on their faces

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840
so but a few scratches on their faces
 

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840
so but a few scratches on their faces
nothing too major there's not like these

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:39.850
nothing too major there's not like these
 

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.600
nothing too major there's not like these
blood coming out of either one of them

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:41.610
blood coming out of either one of them
 

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.820
blood coming out of either one of them
at this stage and they they kind of just

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:44.830
at this stage and they they kind of just
 

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:47.040
at this stage and they they kind of just
like I say doing this amazing dance

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:47.050
like I say doing this amazing dance
 

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.410
like I say doing this amazing dance
basically where these steps forward and

01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:49.420
basically where these steps forward and
 

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.760
basically where these steps forward and
back and forward and back and eventually

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:50.770
back and forward and back and eventually
 

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:52.530
back and forward and back and eventually
they all get tired and one will move off

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:52.540
they all get tired and one will move off
 

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:54.720
they all get tired and one will move off
and they'll split but it's the effects

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:54.730
and they'll split but it's the effects
 

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:57.000
and they'll split but it's the effects
of basically dry season right now so why

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:57.010
of basically dry season right now so why
 

01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.380
of basically dry season right now so why
they fighting is because we're starting

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:58.390
they fighting is because we're starting
 

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:00.870
they fighting is because we're starting
to get drier the dry season is starting

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880
to get drier the dry season is starting
 

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.520
to get drier the dry season is starting
to take effect and so mud wallows are

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:02.530
to take effect and so mud wallows are
 

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.980
to take effect and so mud wallows are
far less and so attraction to water is

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:04.990
far less and so attraction to water is
 

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:07.920
far less and so attraction to water is
one two is I'm 99.9% sure that there is

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:07.930
one two is I'm 99.9% sure that there is
 

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.420
one two is I'm 99.9% sure that there is
a female in heat walking around there

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:09.430
a female in heat walking around there
 

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:12.780
a female in heat walking around there
was a huge fight between rhinos and a

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:12.790
was a huge fight between rhinos and a
 

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.880
was a huge fight between rhinos and a
few weeks ago very close to where Seb

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:14.890
few weeks ago very close to where Seb
 

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:18.570
few weeks ago very close to where Seb
and I stay and it looked from the tracks

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:18.580
and I stay and it looked from the tracks
 

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.190
and I stay and it looked from the tracks
like a female and a male that it's kind

01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:20.200
like a female and a male that it's kind
 

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.780
like a female and a male that it's kind
of had a bit of a go at each other which

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:21.790
of had a bit of a go at each other which
 

01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:23.340
of had a bit of a go at each other which
is quite common if there's a female in

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:23.350
is quite common if there's a female in
 

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.920
is quite common if there's a female in
Easter's and so I think maybe there's a

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:25.930
Easter's and so I think maybe there's a
 

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.060
Easter's and so I think maybe there's a
female interest which has brought both

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:27.070
female interest which has brought both
 

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:28.800
female interest which has brought both
of these equally sized bulls and it was

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:28.810
of these equally sized bulls and it was
 

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:30.330
of these equally sized bulls and it was
amazing to see because the two of them

01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:30.340
amazing to see because the two of them
 

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.920
amazing to see because the two of them
at one point we had them side on in

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:31.930
at one point we had them side on in
 

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:35.010
at one point we had them side on in
front of us and they are exactly the

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:35.020
front of us and they are exactly the
 

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.410
front of us and they are exactly the
same shoulder height and bulk wise

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:37.420
same shoulder height and bulk wise
 

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.420
same shoulder height and bulk wise
exactly the same width but they're

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:39.430
exactly the same width but they're
 

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.040
exactly the same width but they're
whitener has got a slightly longer horn

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.050
whitener has got a slightly longer horn
 

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:42.330
whitener has got a slightly longer horn
and when I say slightly longer and it's

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:42.340
and when I say slightly longer and it's
 

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.610
and when I say slightly longer and it's
just a little bit longer so they really

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:44.620
just a little bit longer so they really
 

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.990
just a little bit longer so they really
evenly matched and that's why I think

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000
evenly matched and that's why I think
 

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.640
evenly matched and that's why I think
they're being so delicate about this

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:47.650
they're being so delicate about this
 

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:49.560
they're being so delicate about this
process at the stage and pretty sure

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:49.570
process at the stage and pretty sure
 

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.830
process at the stage and pretty sure
they trying not to kind of want or one

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840
they trying not to kind of want or one
 

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.110
they trying not to kind of want or one
doesn't want to actually die or kill

01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120
doesn't want to actually die or kill
 

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.360
doesn't want to actually die or kill
itself by being too close so it's this

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:57.370
itself by being too close so it's this
 

01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.100
itself by being too close so it's this
kind of dramatic dance that takes place

01:15:59.100 --> 01:15:59.110
kind of dramatic dance that takes place
 

01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:01.350
kind of dramatic dance that takes place
with dust and lights and animals which

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360
with dust and lights and animals which
 

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.900
with dust and lights and animals which
is amazing so James the black rhino is

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:06.910
is amazing so James the black rhino is
 

01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:10.200
is amazing so James the black rhino is
not as much I think as the white rhinos

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:10.210
not as much I think as the white rhinos
 

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:12.380
not as much I think as the white rhinos
but they do have it and it's quite a

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:12.390
but they do have it and it's quite a
 

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:14.940
but they do have it and it's quite a
real revelation a few years ago when

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:14.950
real revelation a few years ago when
 

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:17.040
real revelation a few years ago when
they realize how social black rhinos can

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:17.050
they realize how social black rhinos can
 

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:19.410
they realize how social black rhinos can
actually be I mean etosha there's a pan

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:19.420
actually be I mean etosha there's a pan
 

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.720
actually be I mean etosha there's a pan
there that's at nights they proceeded up

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:21.730
there that's at nights they proceeded up
 

01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:24.570
there that's at nights they proceeded up
a camera and these rhinos came in and it

01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:24.580
a camera and these rhinos came in and it
 

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.980
a camera and these rhinos came in and it
was incredible to see that they were

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:25.990
was incredible to see that they were
 

01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:29.670
was incredible to see that they were
actually a lot more sociable than what

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:29.680
actually a lot more sociable than what
 

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.470
actually a lot more sociable than what
we think and so I think you know it

01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480
we think and so I think you know it
 

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.479
we think and so I think you know it
depends also where they occur if

01:16:33.479 --> 01:16:33.489
depends also where they occur if
 

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:34.919
depends also where they occur if
a lot of resources and those kind of

01:16:34.919 --> 01:16:34.929
a lot of resources and those kind of
 

01:16:34.929 --> 01:16:36.060
a lot of resources and those kind of
things then generally they'll probably

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:36.070
things then generally they'll probably
 

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.089
things then generally they'll probably
be a little bit more kind of tolerant

01:16:39.089 --> 01:16:39.099
be a little bit more kind of tolerant
 

01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:42.239
be a little bit more kind of tolerant
but very very very interesting kind of

01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:42.249
but very very very interesting kind of
 

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:43.649
but very very very interesting kind of
to see that the the black rounders seem

01:16:43.649 --> 01:16:43.659
to see that the the black rounders seem
 

01:16:43.659 --> 01:16:45.209
to see that the the black rounders seem
to be in some ways a little bit more

01:16:45.209 --> 01:16:45.219
to be in some ways a little bit more
 

01:16:45.219 --> 01:16:46.830
to be in some ways a little bit more
tolerant of one another except I think

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840
tolerant of one another except I think
 

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.270
tolerant of one another except I think
if there's a female in Easter so I think

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280
if there's a female in Easter so I think
 

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.069
if there's a female in Easter so I think
if females and eustress tends to be the

01:16:50.069 --> 01:16:50.079
if females and eustress tends to be the
 

01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:52.560
if females and eustress tends to be the
tipping point for both black and white

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:52.570
tipping point for both black and white
 

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:55.410
tipping point for both black and white
and that will make both of them quite

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:55.420
and that will make both of them quite
 

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.020
and that will make both of them quite
grumpy with one another but it's an

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:58.030
grumpy with one another but it's an
 

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.120
grumpy with one another but it's an
amazing thing to see animals of that

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:00.130
amazing thing to see animals of that
 

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.040
amazing thing to see animals of that
size fighting it's like a hippo fight or

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.050
size fighting it's like a hippo fight or
 

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.720
size fighting it's like a hippo fight or
a elephant fight which actually reminds

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:03.730
a elephant fight which actually reminds
 

01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:06.209
a elephant fight which actually reminds
me funnily enough talking about elephant

01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:06.219
me funnily enough talking about elephant
 

01:17:06.219 --> 01:17:07.049
me funnily enough talking about elephant
fights I don't know if everybody

01:17:07.049 --> 01:17:07.059
fights I don't know if everybody
 

01:17:07.059 --> 01:17:09.629
fights I don't know if everybody
remembers a few weeks ago I saw an

01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639
remembers a few weeks ago I saw an
 

01:17:09.639 --> 01:17:12.689
remembers a few weeks ago I saw an
elephant that I said had lots of blood

01:17:12.689 --> 01:17:12.699
elephant that I said had lots of blood
 

01:17:12.699 --> 01:17:14.970
elephant that I said had lots of blood
coming down from the side of its ear and

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:14.980
coming down from the side of its ear and
 

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.049
coming down from the side of its ear and
we didn't really get a good view of it

01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:16.059
we didn't really get a good view of it
 

01:17:16.059 --> 01:17:17.819
we didn't really get a good view of it
they kind of just rush past as two bulls

01:17:17.819 --> 01:17:17.829
they kind of just rush past as two bulls
 

01:17:17.829 --> 01:17:19.649
they kind of just rush past as two bulls
chasing one another and it actually

01:17:19.649 --> 01:17:19.659
chasing one another and it actually
 

01:17:19.659 --> 01:17:22.439
chasing one another and it actually
turns out that that bull elephant was

01:17:22.439 --> 01:17:22.449
turns out that that bull elephant was
 

01:17:22.449 --> 01:17:24.120
turns out that that bull elephant was
the elephant that was found on before

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.130
the elephant that was found on before
 

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:26.370
the elephant that was found on before
Zook that died and the Tusk went through

01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:26.380
Zook that died and the Tusk went through
 

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.339
Zook that died and the Tusk went through
his ear and through the back of his leg

01:17:29.339 --> 01:17:29.349
his ear and through the back of his leg
 

01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:30.930
his ear and through the back of his leg
and actually punctured and got infected

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:30.940
and actually punctured and got infected
 

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.509
and actually punctured and got infected
and huge caused a huge infection in both

01:17:33.509 --> 01:17:33.519
and huge caused a huge infection in both
 

01:17:33.519 --> 01:17:36.569
and huge caused a huge infection in both
his ear and his side and he was found to

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:36.579
his ear and his side and he was found to
 

01:17:36.579 --> 01:17:38.100
his ear and his side and he was found to
be dead on that side of the world so

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:38.110
be dead on that side of the world so
 

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:40.770
be dead on that side of the world so
it's it's a shame that he died but

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:40.780
it's it's a shame that he died but
 

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.239
it's it's a shame that he died but
there's at least an update so I know a

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:42.249
there's at least an update so I know a
 

01:17:42.249 --> 01:17:43.799

kelp and the brown algae that we get
 

01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:28.890

unfortunately though we were very far
 

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.410
unfortunately though we were very far
away from Australia so I could have a

01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420

one of those days where the gremlins

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:27.870
one of those days where the gremlins

and so that was a bit of a

01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600
and so that was a bit of a
 

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.540
and so that was a bit of a
disappointment but we did find some very

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:35.550
disappointment but we did find some very
 

01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.300
disappointment but we did find some very
very cool stuff on our dives out there

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:38.310
very cool stuff on our dives out there
 

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:45.389
very cool stuff on our dives out there
in the Caymans

01:38:45.389 --> 01:38:45.399
 
 

01:38:45.399 --> 01:38:48.839
 
so right now just kind of edging a bit

01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:48.849
so right now just kind of edging a bit
 

01:38:48.849 --> 01:38:55.100
so right now just kind of edging a bit
of a bend in the river and then that

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.110
of a bend in the river and then that
 

01:38:55.110 --> 01:39:01.799
of a bend in the river and then that

01:39:01.799 --> 01:39:01.809
takes it takes us left to where the plan
 

01:39:01.809 --> 01:39:05.759
takes it takes us left to where the plan
was sewing well it depends it depends

01:39:05.759 --> 01:39:05.769
was sewing well it depends it depends
 

01:39:05.769 --> 01:39:10.979
was sewing well it depends it depends
where I decide to go so there'll be okay

01:39:10.979 --> 01:39:10.989
where I decide to go so there'll be okay
 

01:39:10.989 --> 01:39:12.869
where I decide to go so there'll be okay
so this I don't always follow this

01:39:12.869 --> 01:39:12.879
so this I don't always follow this
 

01:39:12.879 --> 01:39:15.029
so this I don't always follow this
process but this just to generalize

01:39:15.029 --> 01:39:15.039
process but this just to generalize
 

01:39:15.039 --> 01:39:18.509
process but this just to generalize
things should help so firstly if I have

01:39:18.509 --> 01:39:18.519
things should help so firstly if I have
 

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.790
things should help so firstly if I have
a known update or a known sighting that

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800
a known update or a known sighting that
 

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.679
a known update or a known sighting that
I'm interested in and would like to show

01:39:22.679 --> 01:39:22.689
I'm interested in and would like to show
 

01:39:22.689 --> 01:39:24.899
I'm interested in and would like to show
you off then I will go straight to that

01:39:24.899 --> 01:39:24.909
you off then I will go straight to that
 

01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:27.989
you off then I will go straight to that
area and look around there but a lot of

01:39:27.989 --> 01:39:27.999
area and look around there but a lot of
 

01:39:27.999 --> 01:39:29.580
area and look around there but a lot of
the days there just isn't the updates

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:29.590
the days there just isn't the updates
 

01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:32.489
the days there just isn't the updates
and we don't know what's going on and so

01:39:32.489 --> 01:39:32.499
and we don't know what's going on and so
 

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.770
and we don't know what's going on and so
if that's the case I'll decide on an

01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:34.780
if that's the case I'll decide on an
 

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:36.389
if that's the case I'll decide on an
animal I would like to look for a lot of

01:39:36.389 --> 01:39:36.399
animal I would like to look for a lot of
 

01:39:36.399 --> 01:39:37.979
animal I would like to look for a lot of
the time in his lines because I am

01:39:37.979 --> 01:39:37.989
the time in his lines because I am
 

01:39:37.989 --> 01:39:40.379
the time in his lines because I am
following the prides quite closely at

01:39:40.379 --> 01:39:40.389
following the prides quite closely at
 

01:39:40.389 --> 01:39:43.379
following the prides quite closely at
the moment and so I would go to their

01:39:43.379 --> 01:39:43.389
the moment and so I would go to their
 

01:39:43.389 --> 01:39:46.290
the moment and so I would go to their
known territories or perhaps if it's

01:39:46.290 --> 01:39:46.300
known territories or perhaps if it's
 

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.119
known territories or perhaps if it's
something like a leopard or a rhino or

01:39:48.119 --> 01:39:48.129
something like a leopard or a rhino or
 

01:39:48.129 --> 01:39:51.149
something like a leopard or a rhino or
go to their known habitats and so it can

01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159
go to their known habitats and so it can
 

01:39:51.159 --> 01:39:53.189
go to their known habitats and so it can
all depend and I mean a lot of the time

01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199
all depend and I mean a lot of the time
 

01:39:53.199 --> 01:39:55.199
all depend and I mean a lot of the time

quickly here we might get two right
 

01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:14.640
quickly here we might get two right
there so we've got some banded mongoose

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:14.650
there so we've got some banded mongoose
 

01:40:14.650 --> 01:40:18.480
there so we've got some banded mongoose
here and so yeah sorry I mean it can

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:18.490
here and so yeah sorry I mean it can
 

01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:22.740
here and so yeah sorry I mean it can
really vary but yeah signs I mean

can completely change the direction but

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:35.190
can completely change the direction but
 

01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:37.770

other the other reserve so they have to
 

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:57.910
other the other reserve so they have to
cross let's see what's happening they're

01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920
cross let's see what's happening they're

this boundary in the eastern western
 

01:56:13.789 --> 01:56:19.330
this boundary in the eastern western
part of the reserve so they're coming

01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:19.340
part of the reserve so they're coming
 

01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:22.839

from the east going to the west let's

01:56:22.839 --> 01:56:22.849
from the east going to the west let's
 

01:56:22.849 --> 01:56:25.979
from the east going to the west let's
see who will make it to the next

01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:25.989
see who will make it to the next
 

01:56:25.989 --> 01:56:31.409

we have vehicle coming and it's going to
 

01:56:37.939 --> 01:56:45.520
we have vehicle coming and it's going to
spoil the migration

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:45.530
 
 

01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:49.300

its back it's going to - it's going to
 

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:59.020
its back it's going to - it's going to
destroy our migration here he's doing

01:56:59.020 --> 01:56:59.030
destroy our migration here he's doing
 

01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:01.810

let's hope it's going to be the real

01:57:01.810 --> 01:57:01.820
let's hope it's going to be the real
 

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:13.879
let's hope it's going to be the real
migration of - Valda pierced

01:57:13.879 --> 01:57:13.889
 
 

01:57:13.889 --> 01:57:16.649
 
been here in Toomer we don't have

01:57:16.649 --> 01:57:16.659
been here in Toomer we don't have
 

01:57:16.659 --> 01:57:21.120
been here in Toomer we don't have
migration like the Mara animals like

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:21.130
migration like the Mara animals like
 

01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:24.320
migration like the Mara animals like
these ones they used to migrate from

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:24.330
these ones they used to migrate from
 

01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:29.189
these ones they used to migrate from
east to west north to south but they had

01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199
east to west north to south but they had
 

01:57:29.199 --> 01:57:32.419
east to west north to south but they had
to do that now because we have this

01:57:32.419 --> 01:57:32.429
to do that now because we have this
 

01:57:32.429 --> 01:57:34.830
to do that now because we have this
man-made water hole so they don't need

01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840
man-made water hole so they don't need
 

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.760
man-made water hole so they don't need
to migrate because there's abundant of

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:38.770
to migrate because there's abundant of
 

01:57:38.770 --> 01:57:43.260
to migrate because there's abundant of
water and vegetation so that's why we

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:43.270
water and vegetation so that's why we
 

01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:48.450
water and vegetation so that's why we
see them often in in one area or they

01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:48.460
see them often in in one area or they
 

01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:53.540
see them often in in one area or they
are migrating here they go here they go

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:53.550

going to pull it off by it so especially

02:00:07.890 --> 02:00:07.900
going to pull it off by it so especially
 

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.950

when there are so many zebras here so we

02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960
when there are so many zebras here so we
 

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.400
when there are so many zebras here so we
take a look from the front of the line

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:14.410
take a look from the front of the line
 

02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:26.390
take a look from the front of the line
which is way down to my right here

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400
 
 

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.980
 
that's not even the beginning where

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:28.990
that's not even the beginning where
 

02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:32.220
that's not even the beginning where
we're looking right now is not even the

02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:32.230
we're looking right now is not even the
 

02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:34.920
we're looking right now is not even the
start and we are nowhere even near the

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:34.930
start and we are nowhere even near the
 

02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:37.380
start and we are nowhere even near the
end of it so I just in between segments

02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:37.390
end of it so I just in between segments

took me about a minute to drive from one

02:00:45.930 --> 02:00:45.940
took me about a minute to drive from one
 

02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:47.580
took me about a minute to drive from one
end to the other and this was going

02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:47.590
end to the other and this was going
 

02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:49.470
end to the other and this was going
against them as well so they were moving

02:00:49.470 --> 02:00:49.480
against them as well so they were moving
 

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:51.570
against them as well so they were moving
in my direction which made it even

02:00:51.570 --> 02:00:51.580
in my direction which made it even
 

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:54.270
in my direction which made it even
quicker to pass them so that just gives

02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280
quicker to pass them so that just gives
 

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:57.120
quicker to pass them so that just gives
you an idea of just how many there are

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:57.130
you an idea of just how many there are
 

02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:01.770
you an idea of just how many there are
out here right now so wonder how long

02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679
here but maybe maybe one there's been a
 

02:08:35.679 --> 02:08:37.500
here but maybe maybe one there's been a
kill may which I don't think has

02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:37.510
kill may which I don't think has
 

02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:40.350
kill may which I don't think has
happened or perhaps the zebra won in

02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360
happened or perhaps the zebra won in
 

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:50.370
happened or perhaps the zebra won in
defense because ya know hyena senior

02:08:50.370 --> 02:08:50.380
 
 

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:55.130
 
oh I've got exciting for me then but

02:08:55.130 --> 02:08:55.140
oh I've got exciting for me then but
 

02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:59.360
oh I've got exciting for me then but
yeah they must offended bended them off

02:08:59.360 --> 02:08:59.370
yeah they must offended bended them off
 

02:08:59.370 --> 02:09:01.290
yeah they must offended bended them off
that's very confusing

02:09:01.290 --> 02:09:01.300
that's very confusing
 

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.850
that's very confusing
well there's still those two that were

02:09:02.850 --> 02:09:02.860
well there's still those two that were
 

02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:06.660
well there's still those two that were
waiting over the other side so we'll see

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:06.670
waiting over the other side so we'll see
 

02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:10.250
waiting over the other side so we'll see
if they are still doing something

02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:10.260
if they are still doing something
 

02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.690
if they are still doing something
haven't heard any calling it from the

02:09:12.690 --> 02:09:12.700
haven't heard any calling it from the
 

02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:15.480
haven't heard any calling it from the
hyenas to get others so we come and join

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:15.490
hyenas to get others so we come and join
 

02:09:15.490 --> 02:09:18.720
hyenas to get others so we come and join
them in the hunt hopefully there are a

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:18.730
them in the hunt hopefully there are a
 

02:09:18.730 --> 02:09:31.489
them in the hunt hopefully there are a
few more lurking around

02:09:31.489 --> 02:09:31.499
 
 

02:09:31.499 --> 02:09:34.040
 
Connie why won't the zebras just trample

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:34.050
Connie why won't the zebras just trample
 

02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:36.379
Connie why won't the zebras just trample
them well I mean I suppose they could

02:09:36.379 --> 02:09:36.389
them well I mean I suppose they could
 

02:09:36.389 --> 02:09:38.000
them well I mean I suppose they could
but they were kind of walking it in a

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:38.010
but they were kind of walking it in a
 

02:09:38.010 --> 02:09:39.259
but they were kind of walking it in a
single-file line

02:09:39.259 --> 02:09:39.269
single-file line
 

02:09:39.269 --> 02:09:41.029
single-file line
I think the hyenas are a bit too clever

02:09:41.029 --> 02:09:41.039
I think the hyenas are a bit too clever
 

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:43.729
I think the hyenas are a bit too clever
to get trampled by them as well but I'm

02:09:43.729 --> 02:09:43.739
to get trampled by them as well but I'm
 

02:09:43.739 --> 02:09:45.770
to get trampled by them as well but I'm
sure if they all dare to group together

02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780
sure if they all dare to group together
 

02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:48.109
sure if they all dare to group together
and make a fast movement at the hires it

02:09:48.109 --> 02:09:48.119
and make a fast movement at the hires it
 

02:09:48.119 --> 02:09:52.549
and make a fast movement at the hires it
would be very effective so I just don't

02:09:52.549 --> 02:09:52.559
would be very effective so I just don't
 

02:09:52.559 --> 02:09:55.100
would be very effective so I just don't
think that they would really know or use

02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:55.110
think that they would really know or use
 

02:09:55.110 --> 02:09:59.739
think that they would really know or use
that tactic

02:09:59.739 --> 02:09:59.749
 
 

02:09:59.749 --> 02:10:03.180
 
it's very strange though I've seen

02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:03.190
it's very strange though I've seen
 

02:10:03.190 --> 02:10:07.649
it's very strange though I've seen
hyenas around a number of prey items and

02:10:07.649 --> 02:10:07.659
hyenas around a number of prey items and
 

02:10:07.659 --> 02:10:10.989
hyenas around a number of prey items and
even though they are wary of them they

02:10:10.989 --> 02:10:10.999
even though they are wary of them they
 

02:10:10.999 --> 02:10:12.879
even though they are wary of them they
always seem to be able to get into close

02:10:12.879 --> 02:10:12.889
always seem to be able to get into close
 

02:10:12.889 --> 02:10:14.979
always seem to be able to get into close
distance without trying too hard to

02:10:14.979 --> 02:10:14.989
distance without trying too hard to
 

02:10:14.989 --> 02:10:17.830
distance without trying too hard to
really hide themselves or camouflaging

02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840
really hide themselves or camouflaging
 

02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:20.020
really hide themselves or camouflaging
themselves I'm not sure what that is

02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:20.030
themselves I'm not sure what that is
 

02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:26.109
themselves I'm not sure what that is
about them but wouldn't the epic

02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:26.119
about them but wouldn't the epic
 

02:10:26.119 --> 02:10:28.689

like it was intent on something but it's

like it was intent on something but it's

like it was intent on something but it's
just a vehicle off in the distance that

02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:54.150
just a vehicle off in the distance that
 

02:11:54.150 --> 02:11:55.910
just a vehicle off in the distance that
was looking at so I'm going to see if I

02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920
was looking at so I'm going to see if I
 

02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:58.160
was looking at so I'm going to see if I
can find I'm not sure whether these are

02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:58.170
can find I'm not sure whether these are
 

02:11:58.170 --> 02:12:00.680
can find I'm not sure whether these are
actually north playing hyenas or not I'm

02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:00.690
actually north playing hyenas or not I'm
 

02:12:00.690 --> 02:12:03.560
actually north playing hyenas or not I'm
going to see if I can find the rest

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:03.570
going to see if I can find the rest
 

02:12:03.570 --> 02:12:07.280
going to see if I can find the rest
anyway I'm not too far off where I was

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:07.290
anyway I'm not too far off where I was
 

02:12:07.290 --> 02:12:10.370
anyway I'm not too far off where I was
when I found them in the potential den

02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:10.380
when I found them in the potential den
 

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:14.600
when I found them in the potential den
site so that's why I'm thinking that

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:14.610
site so that's why I'm thinking that
 

02:12:14.610 --> 02:12:17.060
site so that's why I'm thinking that
this was north by hyenas just because of

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:17.070
this was north by hyenas just because of
 

02:12:17.070 --> 02:12:24.290
this was north by hyenas just because of
where we are right now

02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:24.300
 
 

02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:28.190
 
but we need oh the Lauren area and she

02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:28.200
but we need oh the Lauren area and she
 

02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:31.700
but we need oh the Lauren area and she
is good with her hyena ID is if I am not

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:31.710
is good with her hyena ID is if I am not
 

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:33.950

so much in tumor in Zoomer I was

02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960
so much in tumor in Zoomer I was
 

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.980
so much in tumor in Zoomer I was
definitely getting there but out here my

02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:36.990
definitely getting there but out here my
 

02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:39.140
definitely getting there but out here my
focus has more being lions and hyenas so

02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:39.150
focus has more being lions and hyenas so
 

02:12:39.150 --> 02:12:42.050
focus has more being lions and hyenas so
well so no a lot of general stuff about

02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060
well so no a lot of general stuff about
 

02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.540
well so no a lot of general stuff about
hyenas the the characters themselves I'm

02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:44.550
hyenas the the characters themselves I'm
 

02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:47.840
hyenas the the characters themselves I'm
not 100% familiar with at this point in

there is both time and space out here to
 

02:12:52.890 --> 02:13:05.920
there is both time and space out here to
learn and observe

to get darkness descend upon us now it's
 

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:13.720
to get darkness descend upon us now it's
always an exciting time

02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:13.730
always an exciting time

dusk ERT it was a very interesting
 

02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:20.920
dusk ERT it was a very interesting
interaction that one every one wasn't it

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:20.930
interaction that one every one wasn't it
 

02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:23.650
interaction that one every one wasn't it
it was yeah definitely not what I

02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:23.660
it was yeah definitely not what I
 

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:27.400
it was yeah definitely not what I
expected I the first time I saw a hyena

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:27.410
expected I the first time I saw a hyena
 

02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:29.890
expected I the first time I saw a hyena
go into the grasses if it was going to

go into the grasses if it was going to
 

02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.750
go into the grasses if it was going to
ambush the zebra I just thought no

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760
ambush the zebra I just thought no
 

02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.430
ambush the zebra I just thought no
surely not it's just going into the

interested so this might be worth
 

02:40:04.090 --> 02:40:06.631

following up on so it's just a very
 

02:40:06.641 --> 02:40:09.660
following up on so it's just a very
tight road here so it will probably take

02:40:09.660 --> 02:40:09.670
tight road here so it will probably take
 

02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:15.460
tight road here so it will probably take
me four or five turns to get around
