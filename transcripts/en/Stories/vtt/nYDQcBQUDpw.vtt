00:00:05.122 --> 00:00:06.830
LAURA LING: The average
American produces

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.460
4.3 pounds of trash a day.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.460
That's almost 1600
pounds a year,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.160
but if we took
some simple steps,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.740
we could go off the
trash grid and minimize

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.760
thousands of pounds of waste
into just a single jar.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.770
LAUREN SINGER: So
this is my trash jar.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.349
LAURA LING: Two years of
trash in this tiny little jar.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.140
LAUREN SINGER: Yep.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.181
LAURA LING: That's crazy.

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:34.990
I probably produce 20
times this much in a day.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
LAUREN SINGER: Yeah, this
is everything basically

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.300
that I couldn't compost, or
couldn't recycle, or couldn't

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.280
figure out what to do with.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.829
LAURA LING: Where did you get
this idea to become zero waste.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.370
LAUREN SINGER: It
kind of all started

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.540
when I was a senior at NYU
studying environmental studies.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.980
And one day after class, I
went home to make dinner,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.380
and I open my fridge, and I
saw that everything in there

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.570
was packaged in plastic.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.946
And I felt like
such a hypocrite.

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:02.570
We're supposed to be
saving the planet,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.360
and here you are making
all of this trash.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.750
I feel like it's really
important to live your values,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.820
and my values are
having a really low

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.800
environmental impact.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.010
I have to live like I want
that, and so that's why I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.820
decided to change my lifestyle.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.384
LAURA LING: What was the easiest
part about reducing your waste?

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:20.800
LAUREN SINGER: I
think it was just

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.930
seeing that I didn't have
to do that much to produce

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.610
very little waste, and by
composting and buying in bulk,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.410
I essentially eliminated
80% of my waste.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.710
Buying package
free means needing

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.710
to have containers to
buy things that you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.140
can't hold with your hands.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.950
For instance, I
buy bulk olive oil,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.910
so I bring a mason
jar to fill it up.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.240
I'll pick up some beer from
a local shop that sells it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.290
in growlers that are
actually reusable,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.140
so that's a totally
waste free way to drink.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.250
LAURA LING: I imagine you
get asked a lot of questions

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.979
about how do you do this.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.520
I've been curious
about a few things.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.150
I'm going to throw out
a few questions too.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.024
Plastic toothbrushes?

00:02:02.024 --> 00:02:04.233
LAUREN SINGER: I use a
compostable bamboo toothbrush.

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:05.065
LAURA LING: Sponges?

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.069
LAUREN SINGER: I use a
compostable dish brush.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.110
LAURA LING: Paper towels?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.039
LAUREN SINGER: Cotton napkins.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.900
LAURA LING: Plastic cookware?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.430
LAUREN SINGER: Wood or
stainless steel utensils?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.240
LAURA LING: Cotton balls?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.500
LAUREN SINGER:
Reusable cotton rounds.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.720
LAURA LING: Dryer sheets?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000
LAUREN SINGER: Dryer
balls that I make myself.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.660
LAURA LING: What about shampoo?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.980
LAUREN SINGER:
Bulk castile soap.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.771
LAURA LING: Makeup?

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.561
LAUREN SINGER: Organic vegan
makeup in recyclable packaging.

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:22.810
LAURA LING: Feminine products?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.018
LAUREN SINGER: Menstrual cup.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.080
LAURA LING: Gift wrap?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.277
LAUREN SINGER: Why?

00:02:26.277 --> 00:02:28.110
LAURA LING: OK, so you
are going to teach me

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.260
how to make toothpaste.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.525
LAUREN SINGER: Yes.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:30.350
LAURA LING: What do I do?

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.850
LAUREN SINGER: So
we're going to mix

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.660
two tablespoons of
organic coconut oil,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.380
and then a tablespoon
of baking soda, and then

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.054
about 20 drops of the
organic peppermint oil.

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:42.220
LAURA LING: So this is how
you make your toothpaste.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.010
LAUREN SINGER: Mm-hm.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.424
LAURA LING: Let
me see your teeth.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:44.924
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:46.010
They look very nice.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.230
LAUREN SINGER: Yeah.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.396
LAURA LING: What does your
dentist think about this?

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:50.840
LAUREN SINGER: They haven't
gotten mad at me yet.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.727
So I'll just take this spoon
and scoop it onto my toothbrush.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.044
LAURA LING: It's not bad.

00:03:00.044 --> 00:03:01.210
It's actually kind of salty.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.262
LAUREN SINGER: Yeah,
that's the baking soda.

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:05.345
LAURA LING: Yeah, my teeth
really do feel cleaner.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:08.590
So, thank you.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.040
So do you have any garbage
cans in your home here?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.680
LAUREN SINGER: No, I don't have
any garbage cans in my home.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.940
LAURA LING: Because you
don't have any garbage.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.898
LAUREN SINGER: Exactly.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.350
LAURA LING: It
really does compel

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.970
me to want to try
to reduce my waste.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.910
So what tips can you
give me or somebody else

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.540
that wants to do that as well?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.040
LAUREN SINGER: I would suggest
look in your garbage can

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.254
and see what your
garbage is, and until you

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:32.420
do that, you don't really
know what you're reducing.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.990
Step two, using a reusable bags
instead of a plastic or paper

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.490
bag.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.430
Just easy one time changes.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.570
And then the last one
would be to actually

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.860
make your products yourself.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.240
So learn how to make toothpaste.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.590
Learn how to make deodorant.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.060
It's a really fun thing to do.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.490
LAURA LING: What is
your ultimate goal?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.300
LAUREN SINGER: Before
I lived my lifestyle,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.890
I wonder why is there all
this trash and why is that OK?

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.879
We have to find solutions
before it gets out of control.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.295
I've never told anyone, oh,
you should live this lifestyle

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.860
or you have to live this way.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.235
I kind of just
live my lifestyle,

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.140
put it out there,
and see what happens.

00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:09.500
LAURA LING: Be sure to check
out another episode of "Going

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.347
Off Grid" with Mike Basich and
his 225 square foot tiny home.

00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:17.430
MIKE BASICH: I like to
think of it as getting back

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.529
to the basics of humanity.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.260
I like feeling
connected to the earth.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.750
LAURA LING: This episode is
a part of seeker stories.
