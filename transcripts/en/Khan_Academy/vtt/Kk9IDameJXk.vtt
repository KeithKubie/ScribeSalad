00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.030
Hello.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.490
We're now going to do some more
slope, and then maybe some

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.550
y-intercept problems as well.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.660
Let's get started.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.090
So let me make up a problem.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.330
Let's say we have
the points 2, 5.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.790
The other point, let's make
that negative 3, negative 3.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.410
Well, first let's just
graph those two points.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.760
I'm going to graph
them in yellow.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.280
So 2, 5.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.920
Let's see that's one two.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.720
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.320
So 2, 5 is going to
be right over there.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.310
OK.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.080
And then let me graph
negative 3, negative 3.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.520
So it's one, two, three.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.260
One, two, three.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.820
So negative 3, negative
3 is right over there.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
And then now let me draw a
line that will connect them.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.760
That's my new technique.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.720
I draw it in two pieces.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.800
I think that's good enough.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.170
OK.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.963
So let's see if we can at least
first figure out the slope of

00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:20.640
the line, and then if we have
time we'll try to figure

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.470
out the y-intercept.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.990
And then we'll know the whole
equation for the line.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.570
Let me pick a slightly thinner
color, and we'll get started.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.060
So the slope, if you saw
the last module that just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.040
introduces how we calculate
the slope, that's

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.430
just rise over run.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.730
Or, change in y
over change in x.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.840
This is y.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.630
So let's just do
that real fast.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.490
So let's take this as
our starting point.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.430
So change in y could be
5-- remember, y is the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.930
second coordinate--
5 minus negative 3.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.860
And that's this one.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.210
Over-- now you do the change
in x-- 2 minus, this

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.690
is also negative 3.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.360
Well 5 minus negative 3,
that's 5 plus plus 3.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.190
So that equals 8.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.300
And then 2 minus negative 3.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.310
Once again that's 2 plus
plus 3, so that equals 5.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.530
So we figured out the
slope of this equation.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.060
It's 8/5.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.640
And let's see if
that makes sense.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280
Let's figure out what the
rise and the run is.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.160
If we were to start at this
point right here, let's see how

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.750
much we have to rise to get to
the same y-coordinate

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.940
as the other point.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.400
So let's see.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480
We're here, and the
other point is up here.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.840
So let's figure out
what this distance is.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.830
Actually, now is a good
time to use the fat.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.110
Oh man, I have a shaky hand.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.530
OK.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.780
Let's figure out what
that distance is.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.620
That distance is delta y,
which is change in y.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.420
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.170
That equals 8.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.710
And that makes sense, because
if you think about it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.800
what did we just do?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.130
We just took y equals 5,
which was up here, minus

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.220
y equals negative 3.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.440
And so obviously we just
calculated that distance

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.240
just by looking at the two
coordinates 5 minus negative 3.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.930
When you do this calculation
it actually gives you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.590
this distance right here.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.990
So that's how we figure out
how much we have to rise.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.550
So now let's do the run.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.170
Well the run, to go from
this point to the other

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.290
point, we went this far.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.300
And let's count
how far that is.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.880
Well, it's one, two,
three, four, five units.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.126
So we can say delta
x is equal to 5.

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:55.120
And that's exactly what we did.
delta y over delta x was equal

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.820
to 8/5, or rise over
run is equal to 8/5.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.540
And it would have been the same
thing if we calculated run here

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300
or if we calculated rise here.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.430
But it's the same thing.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.650
Hope that's making
sense to you.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.020
And I hope that also makes
sense that if the rise for a

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.765
given run becomes more, then
the slope of the line is going

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.650
to become steeper and it'll
become a bigger number.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.380
So let's see what we
have so far for the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.490
equation of this line.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.680
So so far we know the equation
of this line is equal to, y is

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.710
equal to the slope
8/5 x plus b.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.740
So we're almost done.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.390
We just have to figure
out this b right here.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.200
Now that b, just so
you remember, that's

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.400
the y-intercept.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.130
And that's where we
intersect the y-axis.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.200
And since this graph is pretty
neat, we can actually inspect

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.530
it and see that, well, it looks
like we're intersecting

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.450
the y-axis at 2.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.460
So my guess is we're going
to come up with b equals 2.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.170
But let's solve it, just in
case we didn't have this

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.020
neatly drawn graph here.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.200
So how can we solve for b?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.860
Well, we can substitute
values that we know

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.310
that work for x and y.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.280
Well either of these points
are on that line, so we can

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.340
substitute them in for x and y.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.310
So let's use the first one.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.730
OK.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:21.915
So the y we get 5, will
equal 8/5 times x.

00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:24.050
Well, x there is 2.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.670
Times 2 plus b.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:37.080
Well, now we just get 5
is equal to 16/5 plus b.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.590
And then we get b equals--
well 5 is 25/5, right?

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:53.080
5 is 25/5 minus
16/5 equals 9/5.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.320
All right.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.140
See, so I was actually wrong.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.150
When I looked at this graph
I said, oh that looks like

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.930
almost 2, so yeah it's
probably going to be 2.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.780
But when we actually did it
using algebra, when we did it

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.010
analytically, we actually
saw that b is equal to 9/5.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.340
So it's almost 2.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.480
9/5 is 1 and 4/5, or 1.8.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.430
So that's almost 2,
but it actually turns

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.240
out that it's not.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.610
It's at 1.8.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.870
And I can write it
down as a decimal.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.290
1.8.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.330
So the final equation for the
line, I'm going to try to

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.210
squeeze it in at the bottom of
this page, it's going to be y

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.290
is equal to-- well,
we know the slope.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.560
8/5 x.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.010
Now we just add
the y-intercept.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.860
Plus 9/5.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.260
There.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.740
We solved it.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.390
Let's do another one.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.200
And so-- that's 9/5.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.840
I don't want to be
too repetitive.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.400
Let's do another problem.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.920
Time to do another problem,
and let me put that

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.270
graph back there again.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.950
There you go.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.420
All right.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.180
I'm going to think of two
random numbers again.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.410
Let me try to do this fast,
because YouTube puts a

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.610
10 minute limit on me.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.890
So let's say I had the
points 2, negative 3.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.890
And I had the point
negative 4, 5.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.240
So 2, negative 3.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.270
Let's plot that
sucker real fast.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.810
So x is 2, so it's here.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.690
And the negative 3.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.120
One, two, three.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.510
So 2, negative 3 is there.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.080
And negative 4, 5.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.150
So that's one,
two, three, four.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.180
One, two, three, four, five.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.180
I have to count like
this because this

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.560
graph is unlabeled.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.720
But if we actually were to draw
in the coordinates you would

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.750
that see this is 5, and this
is negative 4, and so on.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.460
And this is 2, and
this is negative 3.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.770
And now let's just draw a line.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.875
Let's draw it right there
with my shaky hand.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.470
OK.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.030
There you go.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.850
Good line.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.470
And another good line.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.960
All right.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.910
So first we need to
figure out the slope.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.240
Well we could just do
that doing the algebra.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.760
So its slope is just delta--
I'm still using the line tool

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.270
again-- delta y over delta x.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.730
Change in y over change in x.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.620
Let's take this y as
the first point now.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.460
So we'll say 5 minus
this y, negative 3.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.930
Over-- now since we used the
5 first we have to use the

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.390
negative 4 first as well.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.360
Negative 4 minus 2.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.990
Well 5 minus negative
3, that equals 8.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.305
And negative 4 minus 2, well
that equals negative 6.

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:52.080
And negative 8/6, well
that equals-- they're

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.210
both divisible by 2.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.070
So that equals minus 4/3.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.740
And let's see, does that
make sense as the slope?

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.310
Well, if we were to go down
four from this point.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.660
So if the rise was negative
4-- one, two, three, four.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.630
So if we go down--
woops, I'm using white.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.060
So that's why you can't see it.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.940
We go down by four here, and
then we go to the right

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.350
three, positive 3.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.580
We still end up on the line.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.190
So it works.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.950
Looks good to me.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.600
Let's see if I can solve the
y-intercept in 30 seconds.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.170
Otherwise, I'll start
it on the next module.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.970
So we get y is equal to
minus 4/3 x, plus b.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.160
And actually what we'll do is
we'll leave off here, and I'm

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.540
going to solve for b-- and you
could try to do it on your

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.990
own-- in the next installment
of this presentation.
