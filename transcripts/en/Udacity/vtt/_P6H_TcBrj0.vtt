00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello! Welcome to Unit 5 Office Hours.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Jonathan, an assistant instructor for an upcoming course.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Peter is out of town this week, so I'll be handling the Unit 5 Office Hours this week.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First question, how's that readability survey coming?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a great question and relatively timely.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It turns out that readability survey, the research project

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we give everyone a chance to be involved in, is going really, really well.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Over 6,000 people have started taking the survey, and over 2,000 people completed it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
all the way through, and the results are still coming in.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Again, this is officially unrelated to Udacity or your grade.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's totally optional, although it would make me so happy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if you would take the survey--still totally optional.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We have a number of students with no experience taking the survey, which is great.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We have a number of students with quite a bit of experience,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we even have interesting students who appear to posses the power of time travel

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or have made slight typos when filling it at the end how much experience they have.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There are people who have more years of experience in Python

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
than Python has actually been around--presumably Guido's father or something like that.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We are pleased as punch with the current results of the survey, and I think it speaks to

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the charity and the kindness of students at Udacity and elsewhere

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
who are interested in helping out with this sort of thing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My graduate student, Jonathan Dorn, and I will definitely be

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
giving the song reward later on.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
However, since this is a family, show since anyone could be signing up

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for Udacity classes, a number of the more interesting suggestions for things

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that we will sing even though they're more humorous and outlandish

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
may have to be pushed aside because we, in essence, want it to be rated G at the end.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Still cast your votes for how you would like us to sing or otherwise reward you,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and let me just once again thank everyone who took the time to participate.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I know it did take time, and I know this sort of survey or research

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
might seem hard to understand when you first get involved in it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Why is he asking me these questions?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Why is he not showing me the entire context of a function?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Why doesn't he define what readability is?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
All of those things that appear to be tricky about the survey or about the study

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
were set up that way in order to help us scientifically isolate or control for various variables.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It's tricky, and I'm glad you took the time to do it, and I think it will help us out a lot.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We've had more than an order of magnitude more people participate in this survey

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
than previous similar surveys in software engineering.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It is a really exciting time and it seems that classes like the classes here at Udacity

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
have the opportunity not just to transform education but to have an impact on research

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
near and dear to my heart on both fronts.
