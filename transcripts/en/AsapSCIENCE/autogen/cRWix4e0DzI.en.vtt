00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720
 UN expects by 2050 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.300
 3.2 million people will be 100 years old and over 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.920
 Compared with 316,000 in 2011 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.580
 If so, what can you do to become one of them 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.140
 Elite centenarian club 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.240
 How can you live for 100 years? 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.120
 There are clear steps 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.300
 Such as stopping eating outside the home 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920
 Those who are 65 are cooking five times a week 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 They have a 45% chance of living for centuries 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.740
 The vegetarian person has less chance 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.720
 For early death at 12% 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.320
 If you continue to eat meat 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.700
 Keep away from cold meats 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.900
 Processed meat such as sausage, bacon, cold meat 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.340
 Linked to a high rate of infection 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.260
 Death from cancer and heart disease 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.460
 Less clear, you can win an Academy Award 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.360
 Winners, on average 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 They live four years more than the losers 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.100
 Even the Nobel Prize 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.408
 May help to live 

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:52.340
 One to two years more 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
 Twenty province in the United States with lots of life benefits 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.660
 At an average altitude of 5,967 feet above the sea 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 In Japan, women live to age 87 on average, and men for 80 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.300
 Compared to the United States 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 82 for women and 77 for men respectively 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.840
 So, like the Japanese 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.480
 You should start by consuming green tea and fish 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.540
 A scientific study of 40500 Japanese people 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480
 I proved that those who drink five cups of green tea a day 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.060
 They have a lower chance of dying from heart disease 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.280
 And who diet Omega 3 of the fish 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.120
 Living 2.2 years increase 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.280
 WHO advises 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.760
 Exercise for at least 150 minutes per week 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.940
 Increases your chances of living for 4 more years 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.440
 You may be swimming or even shopping 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.920
 A Taiwanese study found that those who shop daily 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.500
 Even if they did not buy anything 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.480
 Reduces the chance of their death by 23% to 28% 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.300
 As for sleep, study is lengthy 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.760
 I found that men slept for at least 6 hours 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.840
 They have a greater chance of four times dying 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.460
 Resulted from 14 years of study 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 It is important to be a realistic person 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.680
 Literally ! 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 German study found 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.080
 Those who exaggerate the happiness of their future 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.980
 They have a great chance to die compared 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.000
 Of those who expect a dark future 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000
 The Spaniards live at a normal rate 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.620
 Two and a half more than 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.780
 Americans are at a natural rate 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.260
 The researchers assume that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740
 Maximizing the family increases the length of life 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.980
 A Polish study found that the daughters of girls 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.740
 They live 74 weeks more than normal 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.000
 From the fathers of children 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.340
 And if you are a woman 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520
 Be more like Beyonce and wish for twins 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.480
 A new study has revealed that twins have twins 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.320
 Evolution may be adaptation 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.060
 Healthy mothers pass weakness 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.280
 Gene once 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.420
 Twins are known to live longer 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.940
 And when planning comes to your life 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.040
 Married, Danish study for gay men 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.240
 I found that those who marry 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.700
 They have a lower mortality rate 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 But . Do not marry a person 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.280
 Another study of 1700 adult married found that 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.880
 Whenever the couple quarrels 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.040
 Their health 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.860
 Do not force to retire 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.300
 He found the Harvard longevity project 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.340
 Those who have a satisfactory job 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.360
 They continued to work until the age of 70 years 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.740
 I have lived for many years 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.960
 And pet breeding 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.080
 A study showed that those who breed for dogs and cats 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600
 They lived for years more than those who do not pet pets 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.060
 Even if you have not lived a healthy life yet 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.440
 It is not too late to start a healthy life 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.560
 The study of JET 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.400
 Starting a healthy habit is like eating well 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.540
 Doing exercises, thinking, 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.500
 Encourage friends and family 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.620
 It can increase the length of telomeres 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.660
 The layer at the end of the chromosomes 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.740
 Which wear out over time 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.880
 If so, start doing these tips 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.460
 And start preparing to live for 100 years 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.780
 and see where regions of the world 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 your ancestors come from, 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.720
 Egypt, how your DNA influences 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.960
 physical hits and health,

 We've tried it ourselves, 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.320
 and found out that Greg has a lot of Neanderthan DNA 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.940
 while Mitch found out why he likes pizza so much. 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.060
 All you have to do is spit in a tube, and they'll 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.160
 analyze your 23 pairs of chromosomes. 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 (Which is where the name comes from.)
