While Disney movies may be made for kids,
they are also made by adults and the adults

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.189
behind these movies have been known to hide
secret messages and adult jokes in almost

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.290
all of their films.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.200
For this list, we are taking a look at some
mature Disney movie moments that kids probably

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.340
didn’t catch.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.220
Here are 10 Adult Moments That Disney Snuck
Into Kids Movies.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.150
Monsters Inc.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.190
In a moment when Sully is entering a child’s
room to give them a scare, there is a very

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.950
adult drawing that we definitely hope kids
didn’t catch.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.120
Looking at the drawing on the left hand side,
Monsters Inc. is not as innocent as it seems

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.030
as it looks like the kid has drawn her mother
in a pretty compromising position with someone

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.210
named “Uncle Roger”.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.369
Not only is this drawing shockingly dirty,
it also might be uncovering a scandalous story

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.369
of adultery.

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.930
This is one of the more R-Rated Disney moments
we have ever seen, but you have to have a

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.700
good eye to catch it!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.250
Lion King
It’s no secret that The Lion King is one

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.470
of the best movies that Disney has ever made,
but what is surprising is how many dirty jokes

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.640
are actually hidden in the film.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.390
It’s hard to pick just one, so here’s
a few!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.250
First off, the poster/DVD cover for film looks
a heck of a lot like the backside of a woman

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.250
in a bikini.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.240
Next, there is the famous moment when Simba
blows dust into the air and if you pause at

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.570
right time, the dust spells out sex.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.220
There is also the oddly sexual moment between
Nala and Simba in the jungle that definitely

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.750
caught some viewers off guard.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.830
All in all, Lion King may just be the ruler
of the adult jokes hidden in Disney films.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.450
A Bug’s Life
A Bug’s Life is one of Disney Pixar’s

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.870
oldest movies, but that doesn’t mean it
isn’t just as good as the newer films.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.960
Along with quality storytelling and some fun
characters, the movie also showcases Pixar’s

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.159
famous talent for slipping adult jokes into
their kid’s films.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.200
In one scene from the movie, a bunch of bugs
are gathered to watch girl bugs perform.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.840
One of the raunchier bugs yells out from the
audience yells out to the girl on stage, saying:

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.099
“Hey cutie, wanna pollinate with a real
bug?”

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.090
Pollinate, of course, means to fertilize,
so it’s pretty easy to understand what the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.659
catcalling bug was getting at here.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.060
The Santa Clause
Disney has made a lot of Christmas movies

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.519
over the years and one of the best ones has
to be 1994’s The Santa Clause.

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.519
Near the start of the movie, Charlie is watching
his dad fly off the roof and remarks, “You’re

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.519
flying!”

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.459
Without missing a beat, Tim Allen’s Santa
responds that he is used to flying as he lived

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.459
through the sixties.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.069
This is clearly a reference to the drug filled
decade that was the 60’s and it is definitely

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.310
a joke that most kids would have totally missed.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.120
We’re guessing that more than a few parents,
who may or may not have been flying themselves

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.769
in the sixties, enjoyed this sneaky joke!

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.439
The Emperors New Groove
Kronk is probably the best part of The Emperor’s

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.689
New Groove so it only makes sense that he
was at the center of the film’s most cleverly

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.499
placed adult joke.

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:59.459
When we see Kronk out camping in a tent that
was so small, it’s easy to just brush this

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.029
off as a joke about his size.

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.200
But, once you realize that the tent is strategically
placed over his crotch, it becomes pretty

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.749
clear that Disney is playing off the idea
of men “pitching a tent” in bed.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.340
This is one of the studios cleverest mature
moments and we have to give them full points

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.150
for execution!

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.760
Cars 2
While Cars 2 may have not been anywhere near

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.860
as good as the original movie, it did give
the world one of the sneakiest and most risqué

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.700
dirty Disney jokes of all time.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.730
In one particular scene from the film, the
cars are having a party.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.730
What kind of party?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.019
Well, a lemon party, of course!

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.730
If you aren’t sure why that is included
on our list of adult jokes, that’s probably

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.290
for the best as Lemon Party is one thing that
you should never Google.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.590
Peter Pan
Peter Pan is a classic Disney movie and follows

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.580
the story of a young flying boy who never
wants to grow up.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.180
Well, it turns out that the movie actually
featured a pretty adult moment that you definitely

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.319
had to be grown up to catch.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.769
Near the beginning of the film, Peter is dancing
around in front of his shadow and if you pause

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.049
the movie at right time you can see that his
shadow has his…uhm…”peter” hanging

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.049
out.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.419
It’s a very quick moment that we’re guessing
slipped by most kids but when you look back

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.749
at it, it’s quite shocking!

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.629
Zootopia
While it can be argued that Disney’s 2016

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.780
movie, Zootopia, is really just an adult movie
in disguise, the majority of the content in

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.389
the film is kid friendly.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.480
That being said, there are a few moments that
are definitely aimed at older audiences.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.720
For example, in one scene between Judy Hopps
and Nick Wilde, Hopps makes a joke about how

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.181
bunnies are great at multiplication.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.960
While kids may have thought this was just
a random math joke, adults in the audience

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.350
will know that the young bunny is making a
reference to the promiscuous nature of her

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.500
species.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.860
The Incredibles
The Incredibles is a pretty great movie and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.300
a safe bet for parents to pop on the TV for
their kids without having to worry.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.000
That being said, there is one mature moment
that may have caught some older viewers off

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
guard.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.190
When Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl first meet,
there is definitely some sexual tension between

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.310
the two heroes.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.310
What starts out as friendly chatter easily
escalates to a more flirtatious encounter.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:01.690
A very suggestive line about what Elastigirl
can do with her flexibility caps off this

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.690
scene.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.370
Most kids probably just thought she was talking
about gymnastics, but we are guessing the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.280
adults in the room had other ideas.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.950
Ratatouille
When it comes to great Disney movies, Ratatouille

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.080
is often over looked.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.901
It really shouldn’t be as it tells a really
great story and even manages to sneak it some

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:17.990
pretty fun adult jokes.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.970
There’s a scene in which Linguini is trying
to confess to Colette that he’s been getting

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.700
assistance from Remy the rat, and he reluctantly
says, “I have this tiny, little, little…”

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.100
The words "tiny" and "little" prompt Colette
to quickly glance down at Linguini’s junk

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.970
with concern, and he instantly is worried
that she thinks he has a small package.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.440
In the end, Colette and Linguini seem to get
along just fine, so it looks like there was

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.590
no cause for concern after all.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.270
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 adult moments that Disney snuck into kid’s

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.270
movies.
