00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.900
What puts you in the mood for, you know…..

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.920
Is it oysters?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.840
Chocolate?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.560
What about weed?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.960
The pot smoker stereotype is pretty ingrained in popular culture.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.800
They are depicted as lazy, unmotivated, sleepy.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.360
Nothing that really screams, “filled with
crazy sexual desire.”

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.620
And these headlines from a few years ago would
agree with that: I mean, marijuana is obviously

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.300
bad for your sex life.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.029
But fast forward to 2017 and the 
opposite now seems to be true.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.939
So, if you’re looking to increase your sex
drive: which is it?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.720
Should you be hitting the joint or passing
it along?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.340
Dr. Michael Eisenberg, an assistant professor
of urology at Stanford University wanted to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.520
answer this question for his many patients
who were concerned that smoking weed was leading

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.060
to problems in the bedroom.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.120
What he found was that both men and women
who self-reported as being daily marijuana

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.410
users had sex more often than those who abstained
from marijuana use completely.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.880
His study took data from the CDC-sponsored
National Survey of Family Growth.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.610
More than 28,000 women and nearly 23,000 men
were asked a number of questions about their

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.540
relationship status and daily habits, including their use of marijuana and how often they had sex.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.360
The women who used marijuana daily had sex
an average of 7.1 times in the four weeks

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.490
leading up to the survey.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.680
This is compared to the six times for women
who did not partake in marijuana use.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.780
For men, daily marijuana smokers got down
and dirty an average of 6.9 times, get it?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.480
Compared to the 5.6 times of abstainers.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.520
These findings remained true across age, race,
education, income level, and marital status,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.960
but the study focused primarily on heterosexual
sex.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.830
Before you get out those rolling papers, though,
let’s take a closer look.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.760
The data from this paper is limited.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.840
For one, it fails to indicate if the participants
had THC, the active ingredient in marijuana,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.060
in their system while having sex.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.620
I mean someone could easily smoke or consume THC in the morning and have it out of their system

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.480
by the time they got home and were in the mood for romance.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.460
The study mostly just shows a positive correlation
between those who smoke weed daily and how

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.470
many times that person has sex, without providing
any real basis for a cause and effect relationship

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.420
between the two.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.660
And Dr. Eisenberg himself said that this is
a case of correlation and not causation.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.359
He just hopes that the positive association
will prompt more research on the subject rather

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.040
than be the definitive guide to marijuana
use and sex.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.920
But unfortunately, it can be really difficult
to study marijuana’s effects on our physiology,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.420
especially in the U.S.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.000
This is because it it still considered a Schedule
1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Agency.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.400
This puts it in the same category as heroin
and ecstasy and means that it is very hard

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.500
to use it for research purposes.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080
But there’s been some research.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.300
And spoiler: it’s about to get weird.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.500
One small study published in 2010 in the journal
European Urology did find that THC could cause

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.280
sexual dysfunction for men.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.760
The researchers found that the penis muscle
from five male patients and six rhesus monkeys

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.700
had receptors for THC.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.500
And upon further examination, the THC seemed to have an inhibitory effect on the said penis muscle.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.160
But wait, there’s more.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.720
For weed and sex-loving women, there is also
some bad news, according to physician and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.320
author Dr. Julie Holland.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.159
Dr. Holland says that something comparable
to cotton mouth can happen to your vagina

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.600
after you smoke marijuana since it dries similar
mucus membranes in both regions.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.840
That said, not all strains will do this and
not all women will experience the same effects.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.600
So, there’s that.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.360
But in general, there are very few studies
on marijuana and the body, including how it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.680
relates to sexual experiences, and most of
the information we have is entirely based

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.349
on anecdotal experiences.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.059
So while the current study did show a correlation
between sex drive and smoking weed, headlines

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.489
like these might be getting a little too excited.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.020
So smoking weed maybe kind of increases your sex drive, but you know what weed definitely does?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.680
Make you want to binge on a bunch of videos.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.880
Check out this one from our friends at Now This Nerd, it’s all about the history of Thor's costume.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.600
I mean if you’re like me and you love comics, you’re gonna really like it.
