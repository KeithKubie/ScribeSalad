BONITA STEWART: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.650
I'm Bonita Stewart, and I
lead our Global Partnerships

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.430
at Google.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.940
And I've been at the New
York City Office since 2006,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.370
so this is an exciting
afternoon for us.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.230
And I am absolutely
honored to bring

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.850
to the stage, the entire cast,
as well as the playwright

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.170
and director of Eclipsed.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.600
So let's give them a
warm Google welcome.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.572
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.660
Now as they're--
as the cast is--

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.370
as everyone's getting situated,
the one thing to know about

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.240
this particular Broadway play,
is that they've actually made

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.120
history.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.990
And this is the first,
believe it or not,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.250
in 2016, the first Broadway
play that was directed by,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.240
written by, and
starring all women.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.070
I personally had the opportunity
to see the play about two

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.030
weeks ago.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.770
So I will not have-- I won't
have any spoiler alerts.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.200
But it's such a gripping
story and I encourage

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.910
all Googlers to attend.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.180
So one of the things that
we've done is that each of you

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.680
will receive a 34% discount
to actually go see the play.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.402
You'll want the go link so
its go/eclipsed-discount.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.130
So just keep that in mind
as we hear from our guests

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.370
here today.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.942
So Danai, let's start with you.

00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:58.400
And we're going to
introduce-- have

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.900
each one introduce the cast
and the role in the play.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.729
Why don't you give the audience
the context of the play itself.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.107
Entertainment Weekly called the
play harrowing, heartbreaking.

00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:15.690
And I'm not going
to give me a spoiler

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.270
alerts here, but, a glimmer
of humor In this environment.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.450
And you, personally,
have just spanned--

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.130
you've been an actress
in the Walking Dead,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.980
and now you're an award
winning playwright.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.060
So what inspired you
to write this play

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.300
and what message were you trying
to convey to men and women

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.801
everywhere?

00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:39.550
DANAI GURIRA: Wow.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.050
OK.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.280
So why I write is
really quite basic.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.520
I'm a Zimbabwean-American.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.360
I am an African woman,
and I was outraged.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.303
You know, I'm driven by outrage.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.380
And I was driven by the outrage
that there were so few stories

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.980
that reflected that experience.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.450
The experience of African women.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.480
The stories of women
of African origin.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.830
So that really is
my artistic mandate,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.600
is to make sure
that these voices--

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.651
these faces are front and center
in whatever I create, anyway.

00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:12.400
So that's really at
the core of everything

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.080
I do and of course
Eclipsed is no exception.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.770
In terms of the exact story, I
came across an article about,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.000
actually the liberation
fighters-- well rebel fighters

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.684
as many different
perspectives on what

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:26.850
they were these ladies were.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.970
But they were in
the Lord Rebel Army,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.420
which is one of the rebel
factions that were fighting

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.680
against Charles Taylor.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.180
And when I came
across this article,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.700
actually in the
New York Times, it

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.650
was these women who
were just really

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.500
clad in these
really cool clothes,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.060
and really looked kind of cool.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.099
They're like early 20s,
and they have these AK-47s

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.140
slung around their backs.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.030
And I had just never
seen anything like it.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.020
I grew up in southern
Africa during peace time

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.330
so I had never seen a war.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.560
I'd never seen the
images of women in war,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.390
and I knew that was a
story I had to pursue,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.440
in whichever way,
shape, or form I could.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.549
And so that's where the
journey really began.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.840
I only actually started to
pursue it a few years later,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.450
because I had another
play in between.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.500
But it became a journey
that I didn't expect.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.870
I went to Liberia.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
Met women who really
devastated and astounded

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550
me, and inspired
me, and entrusted me

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.500
with their stories.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.380
And ultimately, I synthesized
it into this story.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.430
In terms of what I want, it's
very interesting the idea

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.610
of a message, you know.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.170
Because as a playwright
I think you're not--

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.070
you can't really
pursue a message.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.250
You're not a pastor.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.900
You're not-- you're
a storyteller.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.610
And all you can
do is really hope

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.760
that the story
connects and relates

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.200
to people in whatever way.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.340
So I don't know how it will
relate to her versus to him,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.920
but I hope that at some
point somewhere in there,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.090
they will lose their
sense of time and place,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.250
and they will start to feel
a human connection to what's

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.750
happening on the stage and to
the characters that maybe they

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.360
never really ever get to see.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.380
Which is kind of the
goal of what I write.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.690
It's really about trying to
give those voices a space.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.450
So that's the goal really.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.430
Is to say, is there really
a difference between you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.722
and any of these women up here?

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:13.346
You know, because I think that's
what happens to African women.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.380
We get other otherized.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.830
We get put in a category of the
other, and those over there,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.380
and you know, wh-- statistics.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.870
And so the goal is
really to decimate that,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.750
and to make it
something where you

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.660
have to walk out
and feel that there

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.680
is no difference between
you in those people.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.570
They are connected to you.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.040
It's just geography.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.800
And if you were in a
situation this dire,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.060
you could end up,
kind of, probably

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.470
responding in a way that's kind
of similar to one of these five

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.034
women.

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.700
Like, it's the same
as the Walking Dead,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.540
actually, funnily.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.410
The premise.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.910
It is.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.180
It's who would you be if
the world got this dire?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.440
You'd be one of them.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.270
And that's really the goal.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.170
The humor, yeah it's strategic
because it takes down guards.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.780
If you're laughing,
you're getting

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.780
more and more connected.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.640
You're finding yourself
more involved and more--

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.150
more in love with these people.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.000
And so once again, they
can't be the other anymore.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.130
That really sums it up.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.280
BONITA STEWART: Great.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.946
Thank you Danai.

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:11.110
So, Saycon?

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.780
SAYCON SENGBLOH: Saycon.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.000
BONITA STEWART: Saycon, yes.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.210
Let's start with you.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.410
This his wife number one.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.170
But why don't you
introduce yourself

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.380
to the audience and
the role that you play.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.141
And if anyone wants to go into
character we're-- we're fine

00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.123
with that.

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.820
SAYCON SENGBLOH: Hey, you
want me to bring my character

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.170
to the stage?

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.980
Yes, Hi everybody.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.280
Thank you Google for having us.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.600
I'm Saycon Sengbloh, and
I do play wife number one.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.240
And-- do you-- what
was the other question?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.010
Just next person?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.910
DANAI GURIRA: And Helena.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.910
SAYCON SENGBLOH: And Helena.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:46.410
Yes.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.770
Wife number one, AKA Helena.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.279
Yes.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:51.570
PASCALE ARMOND: Pascale Armand.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.890
I play Bessie,
wife number three.

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:57.850
AKOSUA BUSIA: Akosua Busia.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.920
I play the peace woman.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.020
So since you said go into
character, peace be with you.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.750
And Rita.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.589
She's also called Rita.

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.672
LIESL TOMMY: I'm Liesl
Tommy and I'm the director.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.385
ZAINAB JAH: I'm Zainab Jah and
I play former wife number two.

00:07:18.385 --> 00:07:18.884
Disgruntled.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.180
BONITA STEWART: The soldier.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.690
ZAINAB JAH: And the soldier.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.230
LUPITA NYONG'O: I'm Lupita
Nyong'o and I play wife number

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.290
four.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.737
Also known as, The Girl.

00:07:29.737 --> 00:07:30.570
BONITA STEWART: Yes.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.530
Yes.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.500
So, Lupita.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.960
I work up with all of
our publishing partners.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.770
And so when I saw the picture on
the cover of In Style, and then

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.300
having seen the play, you
know, just a couple weeks ago.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.070
But the juxtaposition of,
just the character, and I

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.950
do want to just take a
moment, because I'm still

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.550
beaming from the
Oscars when Lupita won.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.440
And so I just think,
on behalf of all of us,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.757
congratulations on your
Oscar for 12 Years a Slave.

00:08:01.757 --> 00:08:02.840
LUPITA NYONG'O: Thank you.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.770
BONITA STEWART: Now you play
the character of The Girl

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:18.850
And I saw you, in that
character, tremble on stage.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.590
And being in the audience,
the entire theater

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.670
trembled with you because
of your character.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.870
And at the Oscars, and
I still remember this,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.130
you said, no matter where you're
from your dreams are valid.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.760
So can you tell us a little
bit about your character

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.120
and the dreams that you
felt that The Girl had.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.020
And maybe share a little
bit with the audience

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.280
on why this was so important
for that character.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.630
LUPITA NYONG'O: Well, excuse me.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.800
So The Girl is our way into the
world that Danai brings us to.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.810
The play takes place in a
compound where a rebel soldier

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.420
is holding these women captive.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.600
They're his sex
slaves, his wives.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.740
And The Girl is the newest
addition to this compound.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.990
And so, really, we learn
the rules of this world

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.070
through her eyes because
she's the new one.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.980
She's absorbing it
for the first time

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.190
and she's learning how
to be in a world at war.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.000
And so she goes through
a very, very large arc

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.260
from being completely
green, to knowing way

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.450
more than a 15-year-old should.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.420
And, I think, Danai
talks about why

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.770
she called this play Eclipsed
because-- she's right here,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.700
she can talk about it.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.450
Well, I'm going to try.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.670
It's about the fact
that the women we meet

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.640
have a light in them that is
momentarily eclipsed by war.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.160
And so, I think that is like the
symbol, really, or the metaphor

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.240
that we see the girl go
into a total eclipse.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.220
And yes, so I think
she starts off

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.970
having dreams and goals
and ambitions and a future.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.780
And war changes what her
future might look like.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.104
And dot, dot, dot,
come see the play.

00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:26.020
BONITA STEWART: Great.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.730
So Liesl.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.534
As the director,
tell us a little bit

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:32.700
about the naming convention.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.130
Because we have-- the
wives are nameless.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.250
But maybe give us the
back story on that.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.730
And also, as you were
directing Eclipsed,

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.310
how with this ensemble of
women-- phenomenal women,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.000
I must say, how were
you trying to create

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.690
the sisterhood across
the various characters

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.140
within the play?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.870
LIESL TOMMY: Well,
Danai can answer

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.080
the question about the naming.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.110
BONITA STEWART: Go ahead, Danai.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.572
Because it's interesting-- it's.

00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:08.280
DANAI GURIRA: OK.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.259
You mean how they are
named amongst each other?

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:13.800
BONITA STEWART: Yeah, just the
fact that there are one, two--

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.210
DANAI GURIRA: Right.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.668
Well they're ranked
because they're

00:11:15.668 --> 00:11:17.370
with a commanding officer.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.970
So they're literally
being ranked,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.800
and he's sort of reflecting
his ranking of their very--

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.240
his very ragtag rebel army in
how he deals with his wives.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.880
It's also supposed to, I
guess, in a very brash way,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.470
reflect an idea of a
polygamous family situation.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.200
But of course it's, right,
but of course it's an end.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.080
So the ranking does involve
power order, in a sense

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.320
as well.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.840
And yes, so then there's--
they don't really tend to use

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.460
their own names and the
namelessness that is reflected

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.170
in the play was about the
idea that-- the identity--

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.795
the eclipsing that occurs
through these dire circumstance

00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:01.460
that, of course, is
none of their making.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.784
So that's kind of
the quick answer.

00:12:03.784 --> 00:12:05.200
BONITA STEWART:
Liesl, do you want

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.780
to follow on the ensemble
and the sisterhood?

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.500
LIESL TOMMY: Sure.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.260
So when Danai and I started
working on this play

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.960
about five or six years ago,
I got it in an early draft

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.200
and after page five I knew
that it was something profound

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.870
and that she was doing--
she was pushing form.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.500
She was writing in a way
that I had not yet seen.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.101
I didn't even finish it before
I called my agent and said,

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:32.350
I'm going to do this for sure.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.140
It was really when
the CEO entered

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.540
the first time, and the
way the device-- the way

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.180
she chose to write
about that moment.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.630
I knew that no matter
what came after,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.280
that this play was
worth investing in.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.840
And so we've worked
with different actresses

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.620
along the way.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.370
And what I learned
then and what I--

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.160
I know from the beautiful,
beautiful ensemble work

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.450
that you will see on the stage
is, for this play to work,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.560
there has to be a completely
democratic environment

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.090
in the rehearsal room.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.720
And, fortunately, I have
true theater animals

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.750
in the ensemble who left all
ego at the door the minute

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.390
they walked into the room.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.260
Made it about the
women's stories,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.610
made it about the work.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.730
And I-- you can say a
lot of things about me

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.777
as a director but,
probably easy probably

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:38.360
isn't one of the
things you could say.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.620
DANAI GURIRA: I love it.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.370
I'm like, Yeah!

00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:52.590
LIESL TOMMY: It's a very
rigorous rehearsal room.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.460
There is a great deal
of research that we did.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.190
A very intense approach.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.030
And, you know, the
devotion to the ensemble.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.790
The devotion to putting
the women's stories

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.520
first is something
that we crafted

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.160
and it's what you see on stage.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.680
What they do on stage
together is seamless.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.762
Their kinesthetic
awareness of each other.

00:14:17.762 --> 00:14:19.220
The way that they're
breathing, you

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.860
know-- my intention is always
for audiences to forget

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.340
that they're watching a play.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.260
For them to lean forward so
they don't miss a single breath.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.770
And I really believe
that with the work

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.347
that the ladies are doing
we are achieving that.

00:14:33.347 --> 00:14:34.180
BONITA STEWART: Yes.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.320
I would say so.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.242
I mean I certainly think that
you captured that feeling.

00:14:39.242 --> 00:14:40.700
If you have questions
why don't you

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.737
start lining up at the mics.

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:45.070
And this is really for everyone.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.770
Anyone can jump in here.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.960
But we started t o see
in my Netflix binging.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.500
Sometimes it's occurring.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.350
There's a number of,
now movies, whether it's

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.010
Beast of No Nation,
there was War Witch.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.260
And to see the
struggles of what's

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:11.440
happening, whether it's child
soldiers as well as sex slaves,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.850
you know, that are happening.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.880
And here we are in the US.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.750
Tell us how you were
able, as an actress,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.980
to get into this character.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.470
So if anyone-- because you
have different characters

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.300
that you play, but if anyone
wants to, maybe share with us,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.210
how do you go about
making that transformation

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:42.272
into something that is pretty
horrific from our side.

00:15:42.272 --> 00:15:43.980
SAYCON SENGBLOH: I
would say, personally,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.360
I carry Liberia
with me every day.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.460
Every day of my life
I carry the issues

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.956
that have come-- that
have happened as a result.

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:57.330
I carry the issues
that have come

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.510
as a result of the
civil wars in Liberia

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.990
with me so that pain is just
something that's very tangible.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.370
My father was from Liberia.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.450
He's now deceased.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.770
My mother is American.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.770
But my family was affected
by the war in separation.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.420
And my sister's having to
leave Liberia and come here

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.580
to the United States,
on a personal note.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.200
Then, as an actress I
did additional research

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.250
and studies.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.275
We studied documentaries.

00:16:30.275 --> 00:16:32.650
There are so many books and
journals and different things

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.640
that are available to us.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.570
And I spoke with
people from Liberia

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.990
who had their own
varying experiences.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:45.660
And, you know, it's a really
painful and serious thing

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.050
to perform this type of work.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.720
Yes, there is so much levity.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.720
There is laughter that you
would be surprised to see.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.970
But people do-- people do often
laugh to keep from crying.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.180
And so between the
reading and-- I'm

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.970
a very-- I personally
am a very visual person,

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.780
so I watch more videos.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.450
I watch a lot of videos
and I listen a lot

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.890
to people talking-- talk radio,
talk-- people in little blogs.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.460
You just go to YouTube
and-- go to YouTube

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.500
and put in Liberian tag and
you'll see all kinds of people

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.290
and their expressions
and their feelings.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.359
And all of that sort
of, I use to motivate

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.210
what I bring to the stage.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.070
But the script that she
wrote is so precise.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.020
The character is on the page.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.330
There's not a lot that we
have to do to bring that.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.290
She she's written
it so precisely.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.900
Every character,
I say, is written

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.270
within an inch of her life.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.800
And so, it's just there and it's
just a really beautiful piece

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.150
to be able to do in that way.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.310
AKOSUA BUSIA: I would
like to address--

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.930
I don't play one of the wives.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.870
But when you said,
how do we address it,

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.554
because from your
side-- you know,

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:56.720
you're in the United States.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.940
That's happening here.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.820
And I found that
interesting because one

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.360
of the things I love
about Danai's play

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.480
is that, and actually
plays, because she

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.990
has another play like this,
is that there's a commonality.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.480
You see, as you say
that, I'm from Ghana.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.470
I came from Ghana
here a long time ago.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.670
I live in Ghana now but
then I was coming here

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.300
and I was coming to do a film.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.600
My mother was
absolutely terrified.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.260
Because at that
time I was flying

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.380
into Los Angeles, California
where there was a huge Essence

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.220
article about how now, the
new prostitution in America

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.040
is with teenage
girls-- they don't

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.520
look like they used to with
the uniform-- the prostitution

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.110
uniform.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.070
They're picking up pony-tailed
little girls at school

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.460
at taco stands.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.340
They're putting them
in vans, and they're

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.330
running the train on them, which
I didn't know what that meant.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.910
Now people probably do.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.850
That terrified me, and
terrified my mother.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.990
This is not their side.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.150
This is us as women.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.920
This is what they do,
in one form or another,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.067
all over the world.

00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:05.900
BONITA STEWART: Yes.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.399
AKOSUA BUSIA: I've
read stories here

00:19:07.399 --> 00:19:10.350
where you got police chiefs
in towns where they've

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.320
had girls locked up
underneath and they

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.580
found that some of the
police were going in there,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.560
and the girls were chained up.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.460
And until one of them escaped
and had a baby nobody knew.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.060
This is not our side.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.710
This is not your side.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.810
This is the female side.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.650
We are fighting a female war.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.950
And that's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.000
BONITA STEWART: Well said.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.640
Thank you.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.550
Thank you.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.630
Thank you for-- thank
you for clarifying,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.690
because I do think--
just in talking

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.580
about the sisterhood and the
fact that this is historic,

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.120
you are bringing a
voice to all women.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.980
And, quite frankly, putting
it at the forefront.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.810
Because it really
can happen anywhere.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.020
So thank you so much.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.430
And you play the
peacemaker so well.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.380
So well.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.120
So questions for our cast.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.720
Come on.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.767
I know the Googlers.

00:20:07.767 --> 00:20:08.850
I know you have questions.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.420
Come on.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.710
Come on.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.520
Yes, here we go.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.021
Yes.

00:20:14.021 --> 00:20:15.895
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
everybody for coming.

00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.870
I had a quick question
for Danai and Liesl.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.490
I mean, everybody in the cast.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.090
After writing the characters,
and I haven't seen it yet,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.600
I have my tickets
for next month.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.970
How much change, once you
got into the, kind of,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.880
ensemble rehearsals
and you started

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.350
to recognize, maybe,
new interactions

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.080
or new depths of the character.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.950
Or how much was it
that you, kind of,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.740
adapted to the characters
as they were on the page?

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.160
DANAI GURIRA: Actually,
because our first run at this

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.490
was at the McCarter in 2009.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.440
And there were
rewrites happening

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.660
throughout that process.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.710
And there were
things that, largely

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.589
was more dramaturgical, rather
than swayed towards the actor.

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:56.380
LIESL TOMMY: Which
means structural, right?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.690
Like, this scene maybe, should
belong in act two rather than

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.260
act one-- maybe that's-- that's
when you're first starting

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.140
the process.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:12.150
There's a lot of structural,
dramaturgical questions

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.570
that have to be ironed out so
that the thing makes sense.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.940
And then you start, kind of,
ironing out the relationships.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.250
And you kind of have to start
with the big picture and then

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.500
you can--

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.250
DANAI GURIRA: And just
to say, in addition

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.458
to something that was asked
earlier, the idea of what

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:30.690
these actresses have to do.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.110
It is really-- we are asking a
great deal of the actress who

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.730
walks-- I mean she's
very kind, Saycon, to say

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.150
that I wrote them that clearly.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.280
But we are asking for a whole
other level of commitment--

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.720
LIESL TOMMY:
Emotional commitment.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.980
DANAI GURIRA: When we take
on an actor for this job.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.420
Because they have to
be able to drop into--

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.290
to be in a survivor mode.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.810
An, I'm alive and
I'm here and I'm

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.059
trying-- I'm going to make
it through this world mode.

00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:56.580
And then drop into a
place of very dark trauma

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.545
at the flip of a coin.

00:21:57.545 --> 00:21:58.920
Like, It has to
happen very fast.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.836
SAYCON SENGBLOH: Yeah.

00:21:59.836 --> 00:22:01.300
Liesl demanded that of us.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.841
BONITA STEWART: And,
of course, Liesl

00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:05.391
will demand that of you, which
is what's amazing about Liesl

00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:05.890
also.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.694
Because, I've worked with
other, many directors and some

00:22:09.694 --> 00:22:11.860
are a little tentative about
how they push an actor.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:17.286
Liesl, not tentative.

00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:20.730
Never use that word to
describe this woman.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.630
But, like, the idea-- it's
great because she was an actor,

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.210
and I think there's
an understanding

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.184
she has about when an
actor is holding back.

00:22:27.184 --> 00:22:29.100
Well, I know there's an
understanding she has.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.495
She understands exactly when
they're holding back, when

00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:31.744
they're holding back too much.

00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:32.670
When they're scared.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.000
She gets when they're
scared and she

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.230
knows how to sever through
their pain and get them to--

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.350
- When they're playing too safe.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.880
DANAI GURIRA: Their
most courageous place.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.046
When they're being too safe.

00:22:39.046 --> 00:22:41.060
And so that allows
this production,

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.920
and every production she's
helmed, to be dangerous,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.590
which is what I love.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.510
Because I want-- I want the
audience to feel danger.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.890
I want them to feel
they are not safe.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.390
Like these girls are not safe.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.520
And that we can
take this anywhere.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.410
And that's the power that
she bring so astoundingly.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:00.420
And that we ask of
these amazing actresses,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.060
to-- she was talking about how
she has got to get into it.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.710
Because we asked them to go
so deep into the research

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.310
and the trauma, and things
that are dark, places

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.530
you don't want to go.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.411
But then also know how to bring
that laugh about through living

00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:15.410
on the other side of it.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.105
So, I mean, it's pretty
amazing what these ladies do.

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:19.230
LIESL TOMMY: It is amazing.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:23.980
And I also want to-- want
to add that we are all,

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.280
either from various parts of
Africa, I'm from South Africa.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.145
Zainab is from Sierra Leone.

00:23:30.145 --> 00:23:34.332
Lupita is From Kenya,
or the Caribbean.

00:23:34.332 --> 00:23:36.481
Pascale's From Haiti.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.022
And I felt that was
really important.

00:23:38.022 --> 00:23:39.630
AKOSUA BUSIA: Ghana.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.140
DANAI GURIRA: Zimbabwe.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.330
LIESL TOMMY: You already said.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.780
OK.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.270
Akosua's from Ghana.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:48.770
Zimbabwe.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.180
And I thought that was really
important in the casting

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.120
process, because I-- I knew
how-- where we wanted it to go.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.490
The depth that we wanted.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.390
There's a lot of
things out there

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.010
in the world where violence
is a part of the storytelling.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.910
But I always feel like sometimes
that violence is unearned.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.090
It's cheap.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.260
And for this play to do
what we wanted it to do

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.720
I felt that depth was the
most important thing for us

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.560
to achieve.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.610
And the relationship that
every single one of these women

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:30.610
had to a country on the
continent of Africa,

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:34.840
their understanding of our
desire for specificity,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.450
and they're also
understanding-- I

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.530
grew up during apartheid
in South Africa.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.870
The concept of, cry
the beloved country.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:49.740
You know, where you experience
deep, deep pain at what

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.190
your country has experienced.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.920
You experience deep, deep pride.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.480
But also the pain.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.080
Which I don't know if every
American I've ever encountered

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.520
has that same sense
of personal anguish

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.060
about what you, your
people, and your country

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.130
have lived through.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:15.530
And so that, that essence is
sort of the starting point

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.234
that every one of these
incredible women come with.

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:20.150
BONITA STEWART: Great.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.190
Over here.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.544
My name is Sophie.

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:26.460
Thank you so much for
coming today, and Bonita

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.740
for organizing.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.750
It's so inspiring
to hear you speak.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.890
And I can't wait to see the
play, which I haven't seen yet.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.300
But I have a question
for Lupita, specifically.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.340
Because I've been
amazed by what you've

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.000
been able to achieve
in such a short time.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.860
And I was wondering,
because too--

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.775
I don't know your name but
the beautiful red skirt--

00:25:49.775 --> 00:25:50.650
AKOSUA BUSIA: Akosua.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: But I was--
I can relate to your speech

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.720
about, we're all
women, and we all

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.770
face, to some point-- to some
degree or another at limits.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.960
And I think in the world
we all face limits,

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.520
whether we're women, whether
we're coming from minorities,

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.410
whether we are working
in tech and there

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:08.800
are more men than women.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.560
There are always some barriers
that we can help break.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.080
And I was wondering,
for you Lupita,

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.530
in a world, Hollywood,
that's so white,

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.180
and the latest controversy
about the Oscars,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.770
demonstrate that again.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:28.060
How have you been able to
make those barriers fall?

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.960
And so that they
don't limit you,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.870
and not only do
they not limit you,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:38.330
but you thrive in an environment
that's not very welcoming.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:44.690
LUPITA NYONG'O: Well, Yeah, so.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:53.720
I-- I always credit
my parents because-- I

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.220
was raised with a sense
of internal focus.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.450
Like, there's the growing
up, and there's development

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.230
that you do.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.770
And then there's the limitations
that the world puts--

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.370
imposes on you.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.740
Those limitations really
don't have anything

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.650
to do with the person
you are or can be.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:24.640
So, when it comes to Hollywood--
I mean, I grew up in Kenya.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.540
I had this dream to be an actor.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.290
I didn't have a plan for it.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.240
I didn't know how
it could happen.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.500
But what was instilled
in me was this idea

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.370
that you do your best
exactly where you are.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:42.300
Like, you challenge yourself,
you compete with yourself,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.400
first and foremost, before
you compete with anybody else.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.180
And when that is the focus,
then you become your own bar,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.970
you know?

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.130
And that's what you're
chasing, your own bar.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.760
Not someone else's.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.280
And I think that's just
the philosophy with which I

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.359
go about living my life.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:27:59.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very inspiring.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.930
Thank you.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.910
BONITA STEWART: Right over here.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.701
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:04.300
Hi ladies.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.950
So nice to meet you all
and listen to your stories.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.960
I'm from Uganda and I
am an African woman.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.950
And I just wanted to ask
you, Danai, I think--

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.410
or-- the question is similar
to what, you know, she asked.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.610
I think as African
women and girls, and men

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.690
we're raised to, sort
of, like Lupita said,

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.010
work hard, and stand
out, and do your best.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.890
Like this is what
parents expect.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.430
They don't expect any less.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.840
But I think, when you
come here, there's

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.590
always-- there's not
enough space for everybody.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.090
If there is one
African story running,

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.240
then they're kind of not
interested in hearing

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.140
another African
story at that time.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.260
You know, if there's
Lion King on Broadway,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.580
then there's no space for
another African story.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:01.600
Or, you know, if there's a movie
you know, about-- there's not--

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.680
you have to wait.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.670
Like maybe a few
years and then maybe

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.960
you can-- so I know that the
play started out off-Broadway,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.540
and it did really well.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.050
I came to see that.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.230
And now it's on Broadway.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.960
So I wanted to hear about
how you guys were actually

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.180
able to break those barriers
and tell this story, regardless

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.890
of what other African
stories are going on,

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.696
and how you've then able
to bring it to Broadway.

00:29:27.696 --> 00:29:29.320
I know it's a long
story but, you know,

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.632
that sort of question.

00:29:30.632 --> 00:29:32.590
DANAI GURIRA: I mean, in
terms of the barriers,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.950
I mean it's really
beautifully said by Lupita.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.700
It is that idea that--
the thing that you

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.685
said that was key to me was you
said, and then they tell you.

00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:43.560
And the key thing, which
is what Lupita said,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.670
is you don't listen
to what they tell you.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.560
Those are imposed barriers
which have nothing

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.690
to do with who you are
or what your destiny is.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.040
And I think-- I come across
a lot of young writers

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.580
who come up to me, young African
women, African-American women.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.260
And that question comes up
about-- but they-- and I just

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.390
read this about this
theater not doing that.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.910
And I'm like, what does
that have to do with you?

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.960
And it is a counter
way of thinking.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.680
But it is actually
the way of thinking.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.740
It is the only way of
thinking because we are,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.500
and this is what we
have to bear in mind,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.290
especially when you are,
for instance like you

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.580
and I, African women.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.140
We are creating brand new paths.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.140
There is no precedent,
largely and often.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.040
So if you're looking for people
to tell you whether or not,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.910
or what, or when, you
can't because they

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.220
don't know, because
there's nothing before you.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.560
So you actually have
to lead the way.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.120
And there are going
to be setbacks.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.580
We had a setback with
this play six years ago

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.370
when it did not
come to New York.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.510
And I remember lamenting to God.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.940
And you know what I felt
spiritually, was, just

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.760
write the next one.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.450
Just write the next one.

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:56.960
And so I had another
story to tell.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.240
And I was going to make
sure I got that one told.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.170
And that's what I did.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.440
And then this one I
took care of itself.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.070
Little did we know a
wonderful understudy at Yale

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.800
was going to turn
into an amazing star.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800
Thankfully we were
very sweet to her.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.120
But that's the beauty.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.694
I mean, that's a beautiful--
that is that astounding story.

00:31:19.694 --> 00:31:21.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Life
works out that way.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.720
DANAI GURIRA: We
had done our best

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.020
we had competed with ourselves
we've pursued excellence

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.340
and we put it all out there
myself and Liesl and we knew

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.760
and some of the ladies on this
I must mention Pascal Armand

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.710
and John who were with
us back at Yale also,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.290
who have held these
characters stunningly together

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.100
for a long-- and kept evolving
them into amazing realms

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.360
right now on the stage
where you see them.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.220
And so, we did our all.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.260
And then we-- you trust that
those seeds have been planted.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.460
And sometimes they're not
going to sprout tomorrow.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.876
And sometimes they're not going
to sprout for a few years.

00:31:54.876 --> 00:31:57.320
But you keep going on with
your mission, and your destiny,

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.270
and your calling.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.200
Because you're needed.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.075
Your voice is needed.

00:32:00.075 --> 00:32:02.600
It doesn't matter if
they don't see it yet.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.124
The voice is needed and you
cannot listen to the they.

00:32:05.124 --> 00:32:06.540
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That is the truth.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.970
PASCALE ARMOND: And not
only that but it's doubled.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:09.750
It has doubled.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.600
Because not only is Eclipsed
going on, on Broadway,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.500
but Danai also has another
play off-Broadway, Familiar.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.970
Another African story.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.050
So if comes back.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.500
It comes back and it multiplies.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.500
LIESL TOMMY: I want to also add,
because I feel like both of you

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.690
asked versions of
the same question,

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.190
and it's a question that comes
up again and again and again.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.920
Which is, how do we make
space for ourselves?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.230
And, you know, I had a similar
parent situation as Lupita.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.900
Which is that my
father was a Marxist,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.630
so it was very hard core.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.290
But what he always
said is, you do not

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.430
let the dominant culture
tell you who you are

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.740
or what your culture is.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.716
They've got nothing
to do with you.

00:32:56.716 --> 00:32:58.860
You ultimately will
be teaching them.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.360
And here's an example, cause
I feel like we've sort of been

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.370
saying, just do it.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.780
But there are
practical questions

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.420
around how do you just do it?

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.100
So for example, I'm working on
a project at Disney right now.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.370
And it's a big project.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.530
It's got about a
$28 million budget.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.000
They've probably never
hired a woman of color

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.180
to helm a project like that.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.760
The first thing I did
was hire an entire design

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.180
and creative team who are
basically people of color.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.540
They've never seen that before.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:35.430
Choreographer, set
designer, costume designer,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.430
music director,
all people of color

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.660
because this is what I do.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.510
I think it's my job to advocate
for women and people of color,

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.520
because I don't know
who else will, right?

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.870
So that's the first thing.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.740
I don't ask for
permission, you just do it.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.430
And then the next thing
was, I started advocating

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.590
for diversity in casting.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.710
And I didn't ask permission.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.620
The first presentation in front
of Bob Iger and Tom Staggs,

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.610
you know, there were just
people of color there.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.980
And I could see that
people were startled,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.770
because with Disney it's really
about the precise re-creation

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.679
of a film.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.500
And there was a
lot of discussion.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.170
I never got permission
because people were too

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.080
nervous to actually say yes.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.592
And then as we moved
through the gates

00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:22.050
I just kept pushing
it to the point

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.780
where now I have princesses
playing leads who

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.699
are white people on camera
but, in our production,

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.850
they're all people of color.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:36.850
So you can't-- you just
have to forge ahead.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.570
Trust your instincts
and, as Danai said,

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.210
you have to enact your mission.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.340
Because if the
work is undeniable,

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.790
it doesn't matter
what people look like,

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.570
or what their sex is.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.070
They're going to respond
to the work, right?

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.980
But if you ask
permission, or if you

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.090
think their rules
are your rules,

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.710
you're going to be screwed.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.530
AKOSUA BUSIA: I'm so
glad Liesl said that.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.970
Because I grabbed the mic from
Danai, because I don't want

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.000
it to be left out, which
you just addressed.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.140
There is a financial
reality to all of this,

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.890
and unless you have
people like this--

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.380
because this play is
put on by the only two

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.510
black producers on Broadway.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.170
And that is Alia Jones
and Stephen Byrd.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.380
And there's a reality that,
who is going to take the risk,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.300
as they call it,
and back something?

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.390
And it's generally
people of color

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.050
that will back people of
color, or they'll forget.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.590
You know I had said this
before that, Lupita,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.370
she was asked to do
something at the public.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.930
And she chose this from
having done it at Yale.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.380
And her star power
made them go, OK.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.090
And then you get
producers who say,

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.220
I'll take the risk on that,
because other people won't.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.600
Most of the Trip to
Bountifuls, and all

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.670
that, you've seen
on Broadway have

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.770
been by a production
team who are black.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.620
I did a film years ago
called The Color Purple.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.980
And Alice Walker and Quincy
Jones said a certain amount,

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.160
I think it was 50% or 60%
of the crew had to be black.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.210
Now a lot of that crew
were not unionized,

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:19.080
had to get unionized, and have
been working on top, top films

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.970
ever since.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.060
With the big name directors
because they named--

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.390
they worked with Spielberg.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:28.240
Now they didn't get their
talent from working,

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.760
they got their
chance from someone

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.130
who wrote a book, and someone
who has the power to say,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.110
this is what I need when
you're doing this project.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.140
So there's also that reality.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.590
And I'm an artist, and
an artist at heart.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.440
So we love to just be
artists and, you know,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.880
and you feel that--
finally my art.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.830
But there's a financial reality.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.312
And you have to
have that backing.

00:36:52.312 --> 00:36:53.270
DANAI GURIRA: And yeah.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.617
Just to throw in there also.

00:36:54.617 --> 00:36:55.700
I've heard this sometimes.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.050
Go where you're loved.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.710
Sometimes people are-- they want
to go where-- what about them?

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.710
What about that theater?

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.690
What about those folk?

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.700
Go where your loved.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.260
It might not be
where you expected,

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.140
but they're-- the people who
appreciate your voice are going

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.960
to stand underneath it and help.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.490
The theaters that helped us
create and develop this play

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.250
will always be a part
of what it's become.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.910
Because they loved
us, we went there,

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.270
and we were able to nurture it.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:22.330
And so it might not always be
where you expect, but don't

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.810
always look at that, I want
that, it might be that,

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.244
and that it's great because
they believe in your voice.

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.160
BONITA STEWART: Great.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.244
Over here.

00:37:30.244 --> 00:37:31.035
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:37:31.035 --> 00:37:33.760
First of all I saw the play
last night and you guys

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.260
were so amazing.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.650
I can't-- I kind of can't
believe that you're at Google

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.960
right now, like, all of you.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.290
But I was just
wondering-- so the play

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.900
deals with some really, really
heavy, traumatic, dark material

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:53.190
and-- I mean, in particular
I'm kind of always,

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.300
physically pained hearing
about rape in any context.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.460
So I was wondering
how you, basically

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.230
keep from succumbing to, sort
of, hopelessness or depression

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.210
after living this material?

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:23.140
LUPITA NYONG'O: Well
I will say, may I?

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.420
The circle of trust that we
have built with each other

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.320
is something that, physically
and emotionally keeps me

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.080
together.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.910
We have-- we've developed just
some organic rituals together

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.100
and we've played so
hard, and so open

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.930
heartedly together,
that it just feels,

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.240
like, it feels very safe because
we have each other's back.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.520
And it's, in this play,
it's like a tightrope

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.290
between the five of
us on stage, that we

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.340
have to keep taught
the whole time,

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.920
and we trust each
other's weight.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.660
We know each other's weight now.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.300
And so we lean on that rope
and just hold it tight.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.300
And I think-- had there been--
I mean, this ensemble, I

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.500
feel so blessed to be
with a group of women who

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:25.010
have similar work ethic
and just a [GRUNT] kind of,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.020
commitment to the story.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.650
I mean it's just, [GRUNT].

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.140
That's the only way to put it.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.710
And so it's just
it actually is fun

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:40.410
because you know that you're
being held up by each other.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.660
BONITA STEWART: Let's get
these last two questions in.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.860
Maybe we can do it
a speed round so

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.370
that you do have an
opportunity-- the cast has

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.230
agreed to-- if you'd like
to take a picture you'll

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.700
be able to do so with them.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.241
But let's try to get these last
two questions because there's

00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:56.491
questions have been very nice.

00:39:56.491 --> 00:39:57.949
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Alright, thank you.

00:39:57.949 --> 00:39:58.880
Hi I'm my name's Jan.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.760
I saw the play last week and
I'm happy to use the discount

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.980
to take more women in my life to
see the play, thank you Bonita.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.290
So, last week I
also re-read a book

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.890
that's very important
to me for colored girls,

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.400
that I read many times
at different stages

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.860
in my life to figure out my
identity in these spaces.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.230
And so, I want to ask a
question about the decision

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:25.910
to keep this ensemble all women
and keep the crew all women,

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.030
similarly with for colored
girls it's all-female ensemble.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.510
But, you know, when it was
adapted to a screenplay,

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.290
for instance, male
characters were

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:38.590
added and a lot of male decision
makers in reproducing it.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.280
So how important is that?

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.385
Have you all faced
adversity with keeping women

00:40:42.385 --> 00:40:45.340
as, you know, the center--
the crew and everything.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.190
And can you speak to that?

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.390
DANAI GURIRA: Well, initially
yeah, the goal-- the vision

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:55.710
was to make it an all
woman-- to take out-- I

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.460
feel like there's this
thing that happens.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.960
If you put a white
person on stage sometimes

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.672
in a black story, or you put
a man in a woman's story.

00:41:03.672 --> 00:41:05.380
Suddenly that's where
all the focus goes.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.290
And that's all
people talk about.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.130
And I'm like, well how about
we just take that person out?

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:15.020
So now we only have
women to look at.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.350
And you just remove
that problem.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:21.880
So that was definitely
the goal with creating it.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.800
You know, when you bring on
the collaborator in a director,

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.850
though I have seen-- it has
been directed once by a man,

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.870
I do feel absolutely
and completely, this

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.780
is a woman directed play.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.360
And that's my thing now.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.220
Just like it was
done in London and I

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.053
had to go choose a
director, and I was like,

00:41:39.053 --> 00:41:43.664
just bring me
women, just chicks.

00:41:43.664 --> 00:41:46.330
You know, of course Liesl is the
ultimate director of this play.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:51.900
And so it is, very much so, I
think the places as was asked,

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.920
these ladies have to go to.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.600
And the way that they have
to be driven to a very,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.060
to the very edge, but
with vulnerability.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:04.840
I just believe it requires a
very powerful woman to helm.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.400
And yeah, the more we
can-- I mean the idea

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.380
of how it can
evolve beyond that,

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.277
I think retaining that as its
integrity, is crucial to me.

00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:14.360
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.517
Thank you for this
black girl magic.

00:42:16.517 --> 00:42:18.600
DANAI GURIRA: Also, I have
to throw this in there,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.350
we do have-- the producers have
created an amazing thing called

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.510
10,000 girls.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.060
And that's also
about making sure

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.070
that more and more girls
get to see this, hopefully,

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.816
this example of an all
girl creative team,

00:42:31.816 --> 00:42:32.940
an all woman creative team.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.565
And so, girls and
women who would never

00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:36.110
usually get to come to Broadway.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.500
And they have raised
over $110,000.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.350
They've brought in
3,000 girls so far.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.808
That's only a third of the way
that we're trying to get to.

00:42:42.808 --> 00:42:44.670
So 10000girls.org.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:48.230
Check it out and help some
girls come see this play.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.970
BONITA STEWART: And now
for our last question,

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.670
you're the sole male.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.307
Lots of pressure here.

00:42:55.307 --> 00:42:56.890
SAYCON SENGBLOH:
Proceed with caution.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.174
We welcome you.

00:43:01.174 --> 00:43:02.160
We love men, it's OK.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.210
MALE SPEAKER: I'm like many
in the cast, I'm from abroad.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:07.440
I'm from Uganda and Kenya.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.421
I came here for college
I've been here since.

00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:10.920
And I think that
maybe you guys were

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.961
agree that, one of the
things that helps you with

00:43:12.961 --> 00:43:13.985
is just an adaptability.

00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:16.620
The experience of living between
different kinds of cultures

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.060
and different kinds of worlds.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.840
But sometimes it's funny for a
country like the United States

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.710
where there are so many
different mixtures.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.293
Sometimes the pressure
would, sort of,

00:43:24.293 --> 00:43:26.965
like to conform to the cultural
norms and that kind of stuff.

00:43:26.965 --> 00:43:29.298
Either in the workplace,
whether it's on set or wherever

00:43:29.298 --> 00:43:30.020
you work.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.800
I think that for
you guys, I wanted

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.029
to ask how you sort
of manage making

00:43:35.029 --> 00:43:36.570
sure you don't
compromise who you are

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.040
and where you,
sort of, come from?

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.800
Specifically in the
stories you write?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.383
And whether there
is ever any pressure

00:43:41.383 --> 00:43:44.610
to make sure there's a certain
kind of comprehensibility

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.490
for, let's say,
a local audience?

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.102
Even as you think about the
story you're trying to tell,

00:43:49.102 --> 00:43:51.060
and even though it's very
specifically grounded

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.430
in a foreign culture?

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.490
AKOSUA BUSIA: I heard--
I heard you go, oh.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.500
Like you had
something to say so.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.316
I want you to talk.

00:44:00.316 --> 00:44:01.815
You look so pretty,
you better talk.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.210
PASCALE ARMOND: Well.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.230
Well.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.800
And I understand what you're
talking about, compromising.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.600
And we sort of had to
do that with this play,

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.570
because when we went full
out on the Liberian accent,

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.250
people could not understand.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.780
They were leaning
forward in their seats,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.870
but for the wrong reason.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:30.310
SAYCON SENGBLOH: And I get all
the Facebook messages about it.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.320
LIESL TOMMY: We should have
Saycon do the pure Liberian

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.570
accent so that people
can understand the un--

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:39.236
understandability of it.

00:44:39.236 --> 00:44:40.460
LUPITA NYONG'O: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.312
LIESL TOMMY: Go ahead Pascale.

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.770
PASCALE ARMOND:
With doing that, we

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.940
had to have a
dialect coach come in

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.190
and tell us to put back our
consonants and everything.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.850
And to make sure
that, now that we're

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:59.489
reaching a broader audience
who is more eclectic,

00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:00.780
as far as where they come from.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:01.600
They're tourists.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.540
There are people from
different countries

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.700
that are coming to
see the show and they

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.720
may be used to
hearing one thing,

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.280
but we're doing
something different.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.890
We're just like, OK so we need
to cultivate this in such a way

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.430
that everybody
would understand it.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:21.834
However, people from
Uganda, Kenya, Liberia,

00:45:21.834 --> 00:45:23.875
who have come to see the
show, they're just like,

00:45:23.875 --> 00:45:25.320
you are great.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.620
That was wonderful.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.740
So we are, we're
riding that fine line,

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.170
but we're still
being understood.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:38.780
And for the intents of being
understood so that people take

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.220
more away from it,
and not in our not

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.720
leaning in for
the wrong reasons,

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.290
we had to finesse
it in such a way.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.870
Yes, massage it in such a way.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:57.220
But compromising other aspects
of that, in who we are in order

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:03.210
to conform-- I don't do that.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.250
DANAI GURIRA: And
honestly I think

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.062
that would defeat the purpose.

00:46:07.062 --> 00:46:08.520
And I've come across
this question.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.850
That's why I'm sorry
I'm jumping in.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.724
I've come across this
question from Africans,

00:46:11.724 --> 00:46:15.850
and I always say, if
we dilute ourselves,

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:18.040
then we're not
telling a true story.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.170
And it's not compelling.

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.830
That's the irony, right?

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:23.500
The more we make it like
not truthful to who we are,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.440
and what we do, and the
specifics of our culture, then

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.630
the less we actually create
something that's compelling.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.852
And so, it's really
like, we have to-- I

00:46:31.852 --> 00:46:35.860
do always pursue authenticity
and accessibility.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.070
But that does not have
to involve compromise.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.190
Because the thing
is, they, the they,

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:45.160
will dilute it for us
if we are not vigilant.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.850
And part of, I think,
what we are after is,

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.440
once and for all,
for God's sake,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.300
is seeing something
specific when

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.430
it comes to African
storytelling on stage, right?

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.930
The accent is actually
from the region, the music,

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.600
the clothes-- you know that
it's not-- so many times

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.440
I've seen something
that's about East Africa

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.640
and there's ladies with
black mambazo playing, which

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.070
is Southern African music.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.070
And I just, and then
I have to turn it off

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.950
because I can't get involved.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:19.120
It's just, if they didn't
make the effort, you know.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.910
If you're making a French
film and suddenly you

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:25.500
hear Russian music playing,
it doesn't make any sense.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.150
And we need the same level
of specificity and respect.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:35.900
So, for me, why this is
successful is because we--

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:40.610
we're uncompromising in
the search for specificity.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.665
Because other people can do
the other thing, and have.

00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:45.540
DANAI GURIRA: It is a
daring thing sometimes.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.665
My play the convert, the
first scene is all in Shona.

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:49.290
And I wrote it.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.664
And I remember
writing it saying,

00:47:50.664 --> 00:47:53.610
I don't think anyone is going to
produce this, but I don't care.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.760
Because I is having such
a good time writing it.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.380
And it did get produced a lot.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.400
But the interesting thing was,
we created it in such a way

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.484
that I got-- the right
people came to it, in terms

00:48:03.484 --> 00:48:04.983
of loving it in the
sense of saying,

00:48:04.983 --> 00:48:06.240
let's bring out that Shona.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.510
But let's just make sure
the action of the stage

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.040
makes it clear what's going on.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.030
Pascale starred in that
as the convert herself,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.980
and she had to do some
really risky stuff.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.560
We had to keep it authentic.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.040
It was in 1896.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.720
So she wasn't wearing a shirt.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.220
And that's how the
play started off.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.285
She's topless.

00:48:23.285 --> 00:48:24.410
LIESL TOMMY: Because Shona.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:25.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: And ended.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:26.990
DANAI GURIRA: Yeah,
and ended that way too.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.230
And so the audience really
got to know Pascale.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.890
But that was the
authenticity thing.

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:33.900
We had to do it.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.410
BONITA STEWART: Well
thank you so much,

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.460
to the entire cast of Eclipsed.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.230
I don't know-- I am leaving.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.050
I'm going back to my office.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.520
I am personally, just lifted.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.020
And so I think it's
going to lift us

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.850
all going into the
weekend, hearing

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:55.030
the inspiration from these
phenomenal women and sisters,

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.820
I will say.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.140
So thank you so much, everyone.
