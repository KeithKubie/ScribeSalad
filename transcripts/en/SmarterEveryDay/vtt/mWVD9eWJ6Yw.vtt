Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So before we start the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.080
butterfly deep dive, the one question I get more than anything else here on

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.120
Smarter Every Day, is what's your educational background. So, I figured I'd tell you.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.150
I got my Bachelors degree from the University of Alabama in mechanical engineering,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.180
and I got my Masters degree at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in aerospace engineering, specificially

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.230
in rocket propulsion. Anyway, so now that's out of the way, the cool thing about this video for me is

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.250
that both of my university alma maters are working together to unravel the mystery

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.300
of butterfly scales, and I think that's pretty awesome.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.370
Where'd he go? ... Anyway, so what they're gonna do is here at the ATOM lab, the Autonomous Tracking and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.410
Optical Measurements lab there's a bunch of cameras setup and we're gonna track butterflies

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.430
and we're gonna try to determine if they are more efficient with or without their scales.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.480
It's pretty cool. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go joust myself.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500
[music]

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.980
 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.560
If you're new to Smarter Every Day, a deep dive is a clickable play list

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.610
that you can check out at any point in this video and research one specific topic in great detail.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.640
For example, in the past we did a deep dive with helicopters.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.710
Look at that, I'm still powering this thing and it fell out of the sky.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.730
Why is that? It's because micro air vehicles are historically

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.770
inefficient flyers, which is interesting because butterflies are super

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.860
duper efficient. You think about it. These things can migrate thousands

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.890
and thousands of miles. Dr Amy Lang at the University of Alabama has

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.910
been researching the aerodynamics of butterfly flight, and Dr Nathan Slegers

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.930
at the University of Alabama in Huntsville has a 3D facility for tracking micro air vehicles.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.980
So is there a way we can combine the two? We'll take the aerodynamic research from Dr Lang

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and the ability to track a 3D vehicle by Dr Slegers

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.030
and see if we can baseline the efficiency for a butterfly and then make modifications to the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.050
butterfly in hopes of increasing the efficiency of a micro air vehicle.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
If we have a butterfly wing, we've marked it with a retro reflector marker on it, we can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.080
reconstruct where it is. We have cameras all over the walls over there and if they

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.140
know exactly where those markers are, you can combine all that data and figure out a 3D

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.150
position of the butterfly. What does this mean? This means you can fly this butterfly

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.200
in 3D space, wherever

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.230
he wants to go, and then you can analyze the data after the fact.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.250
Now that's very important if you're trying to figure out efficiencies of flight. Think about this.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.310
You can fly a butterfly with scales on his wing and without scales on his wing

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.360
and you could figure out if he's more efficient or less efficient

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.380
because he has scales.
- Micro air vehicles, the major problem is batteries run down.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.430
People can build roboflies like they do at Harvard,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.460
but they're powered by car batteries with tethers. I'm looking at ways

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.500
with Dr Lang to improve the efficiency. So if you can increase the efficiency

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.580
10%, that's the same thing as improving your batteries 10%.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.590
- Gotcha.
- And you start tying up, you start integrating all these efficiencies in every part

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.660
of the UAV and eventually we'll get there.
(Destin) Think back to our last episode when we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.690
looked at the structure of butterfly scales with a scanning electron microscope.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.710
Any structural or mechanical engineer can tell you that these scales are designed to resist bending in one particular

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.760
direction. So does that mean that they're actually designed to capture more air

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.780
with each wing beat? Dr Lang and Dr Slegers are actually testing this theory

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.840
with real data. They put reflectors on the butterflies and fly them in the ATOM lab

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.870
and record the data of the flight. Then they're able to virtually play back the flights in slow motion.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.940
You can do really cool things like measure the wing beats, you can measure the position,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.960
the velocity, you can get the kinetic and the potential energy at any one point along the flight

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.970
to get an average of how hard that butterfly is having to work to move across the room.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.990
In the end they only got two good data sets. Basically the same butterfly that flew with

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.020
and without scales. So what do you think the data showed after they removed the scales from the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.090
butterfly wings?
- So their flapping frequency increased

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.160
by about 5-10%. To achieve the same

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.210
increase in energy. By increased energy we meant a combined

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.230
speed and change in height.
- OK, so what does this mean

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.240
for science?
- So it meant that they were say 10% less efficient.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.270
They had to try 10% harder by flapping harder

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280
to get the same amount of motion out. I'm looking at ways

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.320
with Dr Lang to improve the efficiency. So if you can increase the efficiency 10%

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.340
that's the same thing as improving your batteries 10%.
- OK and so what's the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.360
application? That we're gonna start putting scales on micro air vehicles?

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.390
- That's exactly what it means.
- It's because of research that's going right now at UAH right?

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.430
- Yes.
- [laugh] Thanks. So if you want to, check out the deep dive

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.450
and go back through all the stuff we've learned on butterflies together. I mean we've covered caterpillar

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.460
locomotion, complicated cocoon designs, how they gather nutrients in order to mate, how they

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.470
lay eggs, we even covered the incredible optomechanical design associated with their

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.490
wing scales, some pretty cool stuff. There are still several things that we don't

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.530
know about butterflies. For example, scientists do not know

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.570
how metamorphosis came to be. It's a pretty crazy thing if you think about it. I mean this creature

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.590
that has the ability to eat and sustain itself, destroys almost everything

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.640
about his old ways and is reborn to live life in a totally new and

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.660
exciting way. But before he enjoys this new more productive and fruitful life,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.740
he first has to die to himself, and then allow himself

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.770
to be remade.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.800
OK there's one other thing that I think you deserve to know.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.830
The first sponsored video on Smarter Every Day was the butterfly lifecycle video

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.910
and your response to that video was so big

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.940
that Audible have decided to sponsor Smarter Every Day for six months.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.950
And that doesn't sound like a big deal, like in the grand scheme of things, but I want you to know

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.960
that I really appreciate that, because that was six months of uncertainty

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.980
in my job. I was furloughed at one point, the government shut down at another point.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.020
But I had stability for my family and I had peace of mind because

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.050
you guys were downloading free audio books. So it is with great joy

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.070
that I would recommend to you

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.100
audible.com/smarter. Go get your free audio book, you can do whatever you want, there's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.160
tons of titles. If you don't like it you can return it and get a different one.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.230
But, I just want to say thank you. Thank you to you,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.260
and thank you to audible.com for sponsoring Smarter Every Day, it means a lot.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.310
Anyway, I'm Destin. You can check out the deep dive if you're interested in that.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.360
You can also get your free audio book. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380
Have a good one.
