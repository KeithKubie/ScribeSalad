takes research it takes careful analysis
but it also takes a different set of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
but it also takes a different set of
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.160
but it also takes a different set of
tools and we saw a lot of terrific tools

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
tools and we saw a lot of terrific tools
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.259
tools and we saw a lot of terrific tools
being developed in the business context

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
being developed in the business context
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970
being developed in the business context
to make companies competitive and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
to make companies competitive and
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310
to make companies competitive and
profitable and successful we didn't see

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
profitable and successful we didn't see
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.290
profitable and successful we didn't see
a similar set of tools being as widely

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
a similar set of tools being as widely
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.990
a similar set of tools being as widely
developed in the nonprofit sector and so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
developed in the nonprofit sector and so
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910
developed in the nonprofit sector and so

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
we wanted to create a firm that brought
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.760
we wanted to create a firm that brought
the same kind of analysis and strategy

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
the same kind of analysis and strategy
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130
the same kind of analysis and strategy
and reasoning and research into solving

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
of the first barriers is the fact that
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.119
of the first barriers is the fact that
people don't really expect to solve

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
people don't really expect to solve

good cause of worthy organization give
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870
good cause of worthy organization give
that organization money and that's a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
that organization money and that's a
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300
that organization money and that's a
great thing to do but there's a real

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
great thing to do but there's a real
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.340
great thing to do but there's a real
problem with our nonprofit sector today

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
problem with our nonprofit sector today

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.020
in this country you know we have the
most vibrant most creative largest

nonprofit sector in the world and yet
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950
nonprofit sector in the world and yet
when you look at where the United States

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
when you look at where the United States
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410
when you look at where the United States
stands on social issues on things like

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940
education things like health care things
like the environment we're at the bottom

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
like the environment we're at the bottom
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100
like the environment we're at the bottom
of the list of developed countries so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
of the list of developed countries so
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780
of the list of developed countries so
somehow in the one hand we have this

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
somehow in the one hand we have this
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120
somehow in the one hand we have this
wonderful nonprofit sector and on the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
wonderful nonprofit sector and on the
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.260
wonderful nonprofit sector and on the
other hand we're not solving the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
other hand we're not solving the
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.330
other hand we're not solving the
problems that the nonprofit sector is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
problems that the nonprofit sector is
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280
problems that the nonprofit sector is
supposed to be solving so there's a real

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
supposed to be solving so there's a real
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.280
supposed to be solving so there's a real
basic problem there and we believe the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
basic problem there and we believe the
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660
basic problem there and we believe the
problem really has to do with the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
problem really has to do with the
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.740
problem really has to do with the
behavior of donors that donors are not

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750
behavior of donors that donors are not
 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.200
behavior of donors that donors are not
expecting or demanding results they

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
expecting or demanding results they
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.289
expecting or demanding results they
aren't being realistic and strategic in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
aren't being realistic and strategic in
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.810
aren't being realistic and strategic in
their giving to actually try and solve

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
their giving to actually try and solve
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.950
their giving to actually try and solve
the problem and without that incentive

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960
the problem and without that incentive
 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.499
the problem and without that incentive
nonprofits respond to the way donors

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
nonprofits respond to the way donors
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529
nonprofits respond to the way donors

how can they actually achieve a
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.070
how can they actually achieve a
meaningful

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.420
first n courses there may not be an

first n courses there may not be an
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.630
first n courses there may not be an
organization that they should choose I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
organization that they should choose I
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.470
organization that they should choose I
guess the best way to think about it is

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
guess the best way to think about it is
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.540
guess the best way to think about it is
we did a very interesting engagement for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
we did a very interesting engagement for
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.880

practices but we're not really sure what
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.500
practices but we're not really sure what
that means so what does it mean to be

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
that means so what does it mean to be
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.660

technology all across the country but we
 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.990
technology all across the country but we
actually found something very

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000

seemed to change and they were kind of

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250
seemed to change and they were kind of
 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.180
seemed to change and they were kind of
discouraged and at some point they came

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
discouraged and at some point they came
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.670

and real personal significance to them
 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.550
and real personal significance to them
so in one case someone's son had a rare

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
so in one case someone's son had a rare
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.930
so in one case someone's son had a rare
brain disease and there wasn't much

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940
brain disease and there wasn't much
 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.330
brain disease and there wasn't much
research in another case there was a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
research in another case there was a
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.190
research in another case there was a
beautiful theater downtown that was

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
beautiful theater downtown that was
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960
beautiful theater downtown that was
going to be torn down as in development

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970
going to be torn down as in development
 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.570
going to be torn down as in development
and what happened was they stopped

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580
and what happened was they stopped
 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.130
and what happened was they stopped
thinking about how do I give away money

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
thinking about how do I give away money
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.140
thinking about how do I give away money
and they started thinking about how do I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150
and they started thinking about how do I
 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.260
and they started thinking about how do I
solve a specific problem and it changed

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270
solve a specific problem and it changed
 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.960
