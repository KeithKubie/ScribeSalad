00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's my answer--we extract the factor and then just take

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the square root of the variance divided by the length of the list.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is exactly the formula I gave you. When you run this you get the desired answer.

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Finally, I will add the hypothesis for example h equals 200.
