00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.600
This I think it would be nicer if you'd
go in that direction.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.120
This is a female chameleon and she has
adopted the typical green coloration

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.170
used to match foliage, which I don't
particularly think she's happy because

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.080
she started to turn just a little bit
black but if we introduce a friend of hers...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.019
Oh thank you.
Now this is a male chameleon and I'm

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.030
very sorry to say that these two
don't get on terribly well together and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.399
I think we might produce a reaction from
the female if we can put the male

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.400
reasonably near.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.620
How about going upwards? 
We are seeing a darkening of the female.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.140
It takes a few moments.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.560
This is a social signal. 
An aggressive signal from the female in

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.680
these circumstances are from they
being watched by a large number of people.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.160
An aggressive signal... Can you see now quite clearly?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.200
And the male as well has also changed his colour.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.013
The darkening of the body, the blotchy black areas on the body.

00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:19.960
The animals using the ability to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.280
change its color which it uses usually
for camouflage to communicate to another animal.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.880
That's very clear I think now.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.520
Thank you Bill.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960
Shall we leave them alone for a while?
