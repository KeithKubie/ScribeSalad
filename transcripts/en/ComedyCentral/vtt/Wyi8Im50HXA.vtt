00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.036
The new Nintendo Switch
game console hits stores

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.771
this weekend,
uh, giving gamers a new way

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:07.174
to ignore their loved ones
at home or on the go!

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:08.375
(cheering, applause)

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:12.145
I know, I'm very excited.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.448
But crusty critics have been
slamming the Switch

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.251
for its limited roster
of game titles, like, uh,

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.419
<i>1-2 Switch,</i>
where you can milk a cow

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.321
and take care of a crying baby.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.757
Um, listen, I think that's fine.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.459
Finally, we have
the technology to simulate

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:29.129
being a Kentucky teen mom.
You guys wanted that.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.398
Or <i>Little Inferno...
Little Inferno,</i>

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.800
where you can burn stuff
in a virtual fireplace.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.537
Comedians, I want you to give us
some even more atypical

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.505
video games other than
the ones on the Switch.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.575
I'm gonna put 60 second on
the clock, and begin. Natalie.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.210
<i>Call of Booty: Modern Dating.</i>

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.512

<i>Gynecologist Lara Croft:
Womb Raider.</i>

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.733
Ha! Very good.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.368
Points. Pete Holmes.

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.406

<i>-Duck</i> (bleep).
-(buzzer sounds)

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.883
(game over sound effect)

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.185
Wait, <i>Duck</i> (bleep)?
