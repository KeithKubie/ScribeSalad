Today, we're going to take some
of this weirdly liquid,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.700
weirdly solid Silly Putty,
and see if we can use it

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.382
as a mold for casting metal.

00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:15.880
[Music]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.560
YouTube user Kermit on Weed says,
"Now cast into silly putty."

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:23.712
This comment has
more thumbs up than

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.780
I think I've ever seen on one
of our videos at almost 2000.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.340
Probably isn't 2000 by now.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.200
So we're going to do that.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.300
We've got a bunch of Silly Putty,
and we are going to try casting

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
molten metal in Silly Putty.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.780
The premise is simple.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.860
We're going to empty
out all of these eggs.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.700
Smoosh all of the Silly Putty
together into a big blob,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.672
press something into it,

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:45.400
to turn the Silly Putty into a mold,
and then try to fill that cavity

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100
with two different types of molten metal.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
Let's start opening these eggs.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.692
I remember when I was an egg,
that's a lot of eggs.

00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:53.020
It's gonna be a lot of silly putty.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:18.502
[Music]

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.500
Well, this is the most Silly Putty
that I have ever had at once.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.200
I'm gonna try and
squish this all into a ball.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.200
I don't want to mix it,
because I kind of like

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.800
the separate colors,
but I do need to combine it.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.000
It's all joined together pretty well,
now, I want to try

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.502
and roll it into a ball,
and see how it bounces.

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:39.460
[Music]

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.000
That kind of worked,
I made a ball.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.560
It bounces.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.240
[Music]

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.200
Oh, it's popping apart.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
The seams are letting go,
probably just need to let

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.300
it sit for like an hour
to really bond everywhere,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.520
but... I'm not going to do that right now.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.100
So, let's try turning this into a mold
that we can cast molten metal in.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700
The first time we did this,
we used a 3D print of Grant's face.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.800
Well today, we have a 3D print of my face,
and I think it's only fair that we try

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.262
doing the same thing with this.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:03:08.760
[Music]

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.900
I thought our Silly Putty did
a really good job of taking

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.500
our impression of Mini-Me,
but unfortunately, Silly Putty

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.600
is not quite solid.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.200
In fact, that's what's
kind of cool about it.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.000
But in this case,
it meant that the Gallium,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.700
which is quite heavy,
was just pressing down on it

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.600
as a liquid for a good amount of time.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.900
The gallium was really barely
over its melting temperature,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.960
but it takes quite a while
for it to fully solidify.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.700
And in the time lapse,
you're able to see that it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.400
just sort of smooshed everything down,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.800
and eventually,
pushed the Silly Putty,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.160
and broke free and spilled onto our table.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.400
And so now what we have is this just
blob that really doesn't resemble

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.352
my face even a little bit.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.700
Let's peel this up,
and see what kind of shapes we've got.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.800
Okay, so we have the shape
of crystallized gallium.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.400
It does form some cool
geometric looking shapes.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.500
And that made a cool dent right
into our Silly Putty.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.200
I don't see any remnant
of my face in that.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.500
A nice smooth surface that once
again bears zero resemblance

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.600
to the sweatshirt that I had on here.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.500
As casting goes,
I would say this is one

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.200
of our worst failures ever.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.100
Zero resemblance,
like just none whatsoever

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.500
to what it was supposed to be.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.240
Part of the problem of course was
that it took so long to solidify,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.700
and so I think we now need to do
another test with a different metal,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.960
and for that, we're
going to move onto aluminum.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.800
So let's fire up our furnace,
melt some aluminum,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.900
press this little face down
into the Silly Putty a second time,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.900
and then pour some 2,000 degree
molten metal down into it

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.700
and see what happens to Silly Putty
under those conditions.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.000
Guys, I gotta admit.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.400
I am not very hopeful that this is
gonna turn out well in aluminum.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.480
[Music]

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.572
Our aluminum is
melting already.

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:56.400
So we're now going to press
the little plastic mini me down

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.280
into the Silly Putty,
make a new mold,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.300
pull out our molten aluminum,
pour it in and see how

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.300
the Silly Putty fares against
our very very hot aluminum.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:15.400
[Music]

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.100
All right.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.080
There's me.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.000
Decent mold.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:32.320
[Music]

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.680
3, 2, 1.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.100
That immediately lit on fire.

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:44.440
[Music]

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.500
I'm just gonna back off
a little bit in case

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.712
it decides to start
spurting aluminum.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.460
It's on fire yo.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:59.420
[Music]

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.340
Oh, the aluminum
is still molten.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.660
[Music]

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.420
Our Silly Putty
is getting ruined.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.760
Oh, we've got some good
drippage going on.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.880
Silly Putty is melting
in some spots.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.840
[Music]

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.940
The aluminum is still nice
and molten as well.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.800
Our putty is melting.

00:06:20.802 --> 00:06:23.592
It might break down the walls
that are holding in the aluminum.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.520
We'll see.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.060
I don't know if the aluminum is
quite liquid enough to run it.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.392
So this is kind of interesting.

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:31.500
Our aluminum has now
been recovered in almost all

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.600
of it by the burning Silly Putty.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.300
There's one spot here still exposed,
but there's actually sort

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.400
of a bubble over it.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.220
Watch this.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:47.220
[Music]

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.800
I can blow it out briefly,
and then the heat just

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.940
brings it right back.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:07:02.420
[Music]

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.200
Our aluminum has
now cooled down.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.140
[Music]

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.980
Well, I'm not going to say
that's a good casting,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.880
but amazingly, it is a better
casting than the gallium.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.700
Just did a fantastic job
of lighting our silly putty on fire,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.752
and then just melting it.

00:07:23.572 --> 00:07:27.242
Really nice and liquid,
and full of burnt Silly Putty ash here.

00:07:28.662 --> 00:07:31.592
Nice little scoop
of hot Silly Putty.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.700
I'm trying to see
if the Silly Putty that got melted,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.912
so it was really runny.

00:07:36.912 --> 00:07:39.200
We'll sort of reconstitute
as it cools down,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.212
and return to normal Silly Putty.

00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:43.400
So far it seems
like it is actually.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.100
It's still very warm.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.800
So it's a little softer
than it was before,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.400
but it's acting pretty much how you
would expect Silly Putty to act.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.580
I would say it looks
like you can melt

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.000
and resolidify Silly Putty,
as much as it ever gets solid,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.522
which is of course, not much.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:04.500
[Music]

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.500
Well, that didn't work,
and it smells bad.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.000
Mmm...

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.800
Burning plasticky smell.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.200
So not all of this silly putty is ruined,
but I don't think I can separate

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.400
the unruined Silly Putty
from the ruined Silly Putty.

00:08:22.672 --> 00:08:25.022
So, for that reason,
this might all just be gone.

00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:28.500
Casting metal into silly putty.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.900
Thank you for your suggestion,
Kermit on weed.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200
As you can see,
it did not work.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.600
We tried gallium, which is
like the coolest casting we can do,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.500
and it still took so long
to completely solidify.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.900
It just smooshed all
the silly putty out and ran,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.300
and I do think this is probably
the worst casting we have ever got

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.920
off of anything.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.400
No one would ever be able to look at that,
and guess that it was even supposed

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.440
to be a cast of a small person,
like a bust or anything like that.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.000
The aluminum, also bad,
but I think many people

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.632
would at least look at that and say like,
oh that kind of looks like a deformed

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:02.100
outline of a human bust shape.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.200
Like you can see there's a head,
and the shoulders,

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:05.300
and a little bit of the chest.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.300
Whereas with the gallium,
there's just three puddles,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.400
and some geometric
shapes that have formed in them.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.202
None of which look anything
like little plastic me.

00:09:14.082 --> 00:09:15.900
Thank you guys for sending
in your questions.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.360
Now, it's time to give
you some answers.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.900
All right, we've got a question here
from @Seth_Burrow, who is asking,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.800
"Does Nate have his own Twitter handle,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.100
or does he use
The King of Random Twitter handle?"

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.600
The real answer to this one
Seth is that I don't have Twitter.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.220
I don't use Twitter.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.640
I don't tweet.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.900
I rarely read tweets,
and it's something that

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.200
I probably should get into.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.740
But I think I tried it once
about four or five years ago,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.400
and I realized I did not have
anything worth tweeting about.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.300
So I just I tweeted like once,
and then I was like,

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.600
well, I don't know
why I'm doing this.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.000
This is just like screaming
off the edge of a cliff,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.500
and no one's listening,
and I didn't really see much point

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.800
in continuing to tweet in that situation.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.300
Maybe now, I'm in a position where
more people would be interested

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.000
in what I'm doing, what I'm saying,
and especially if I were giving commentary

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.540
on some of the videos,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.400
or some of the projects,
or some of my ideas,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.800
or if I wanted to get more ideas,
so I should probably jump back on Twitter.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.560
But at the moment,
I have no Twitter.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.660
Sorry.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.400
Guys, thanks for watching,
but that's not all.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.800
That box up at the top
will take you directly

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.682
to our last video.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.860
You should go
check that one out.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.560
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:10:19.562 --> 00:10:20.300
you should be watching next,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.900
and if you haven't subscribed yet,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.580
and that way, you'll never
miss out on the fun.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.900
