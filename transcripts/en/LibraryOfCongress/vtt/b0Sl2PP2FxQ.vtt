&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Our
special guest is J.D. Vance.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.910 position:56%
I'm going to ask him to come up now.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.710
J.D.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So thank
you, very much, for coming.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.560
Let me give people who may
not know your background a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.090
little introduction.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.510
JD is Native of Middletown, Ohio.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.970
Okay. And a graduate of
the Middletown High School.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.510
He then went into the marines
for four years, served in Iraq.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.760
[ Applause ]

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.020
And came back, went to Ohio State,
and finished it in two years.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.860
Then went to Yale Law School,
graduate there are a member

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.700
of the Yale Law Journal, clerked
for a federal judge for a year.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.540
He is now in the investment world
and based, in part, in Washington,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.270
D.C. He is married to a former
classmate from Yale Law School,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.070
who is here, somewhere,
maybe on her way,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.380
with bringing his 2 month old son.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.320
So if you see a 2 month old
son somewhere, that's his son.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.810
So let's start.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.110
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Surely, when
you started to write this book,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.270
in your wildest imagination you
could not have thought you were

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.660
going to write a New
York Time's Best Seller

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.130
on your first book, or did you?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.570
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I certainly
didn't think that I would.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So was it,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.060
where did the idea for
the book come from?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.130
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it
actually started in law school.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.040
And really, the genesis was that
I was very interested in some

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.310
of the concepts and the ideas
that I wrote about in the book,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.610
and most specifically this question

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.900
about vulnerability
in the United States.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.310
And at Yale, we had to write this,
basically this thesis by the end

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430
of our 3rd year in order to
graduate, and I really wanted

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.430
to write it about, sort of, the
legal and policy implications

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.110
of social mobility in the United
States, or the lack therefore.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.480
And the more that I started to talk
through the idea and the people

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.630
that were advising me, the more,
and especially my primary adviser,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.260
a woman named Amy Chua,
who, herself,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.260
is a pretty successful
author, she continued.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:She's
the author of Tiger.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.950
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She's the author of
Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.050
And she encouraged
me, more and more,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.180
to bring my personal experiences
to bear, because she thought

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.120
that I could write something
that was both, hopefully,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.150 position:56%
intellectually interesting, but also
personally and emotionally powerful.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.980
And as I continued
to write the book,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.470
I was obviously a little
resistant to that at first,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.460
I didn't like the idea of
opening up my personal life

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.430
and telling all these
personal stories.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.460
But the more that I wrote, the more
that I realized that to the degree

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.000
that I had a unique contribution.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.340
It was that I understood
these things from the inside,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.340
as opposed to just as an academic.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.500
So you had the idea
of writing a book.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.090
How long did it take
you to write the book?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.080
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I was
always working on it part time,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.350
so I always had another job
while I was writing the book.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.400
And I think that it probably
took me about 2 1/2 years.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.650
So I started writing it, yeah,
towards the middle of 2013,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.110
and I finished towards
the end of 2015.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.410
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
did you write in long hand,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.730
or did you do it on a computer?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.570
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I
did it on my computer.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.280
My handwriting is absolutely
terrible.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.580
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.140
And so, as you're writing it, did
you have any publisher lined up,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.770
or did you just say, I'll write
it and then I'll get a publisher?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.070
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.370
So this is interesting.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.830
And, in some ways, it exemplifies
something that I really write

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.720
about in the book, this
idea of social capital

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.630
and how social connections can have
these really important benefits.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.600
So because of Amy, when I started
to really think about making this

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.850
into a book project, you know, she
said, okay, let me introduce you

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.720
to these people that I know
in the publishing world.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.430
And so, one of the people she
introduced me to is this woman,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.450
who eventually became my agent, and
really good friend, Tina Bennett,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.140
and as I quickly learned, when you
have an idea and you have somebody

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.570
like Tina really advocating
for it, the publishing,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.220
finding a publisher
is, is relatively easy.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.140
And that's sort of what happened
with me, is that the hard part

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.260
for me was getting into
the agent publishing world,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.860
and then once I was there it
wasn't so hard to find a publisher.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.160
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Sometimes
first authors,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.380
first time authors say, you
know, this shouldn't be that hard

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.100
to write a book, and then about
half way through, they say,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.730
how can I get out of this project?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.420
So were you in that category?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.340
Did you ever want to abandon it?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.170
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, I
definitely did want to abandon it,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.470
and if my wife is here,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.910
she can probably tell you how
miserable I was about that 50% way

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.970
through the writing process.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.650
Yeah, I mean, for me, what was
so tough is that once I got

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.330
about half way through
the book, you know,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.540
obviously it was too
late to give up.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.410
I couldn't just stop writing it.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.560
But, you know, writing
an additional 40,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.700
50,000 words just seemed
so imposing.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.140
And I realized then what I didn't
realize going into the project is

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.420
that I probably had about a 10 to
1 ratio of words typed to words

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.220
that made it into the
final manuscript.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.620
And so I just didn't realize what
a long slog it would be until I was

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.080
about halfway through it.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.290
And yeah, I definitely
thought to myself,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.820
would it be possible
to get out of this?

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.540
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, your
publisher had some confidence.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.240
The initial print run was 10,000.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.540
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
10,000 isn't 500,000,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.550
but 10,000 is good
for a first author.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.000
At what point, when the book
came out, did people say, hey,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.520
there aren't enough
copies out anymore,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.280
and we have to go print more?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.580
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.400
So this happened relatively
quickly after the book came out.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.770
I want to say, in two
or three weeks, maybe.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.990 position:56%
There was an interview I did with a
magazine, The American Conservative,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.860 position:56%
that went viral, as they say online.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.240
A lot of people were sharing it on
Twitter and Facebook and so forth,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.320
and I went to go check my
Amazon ranking, which, you know,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.210
those of you who have
written a book will know

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.000
that your Amazon ranking
is a way to check

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.290
in real time how your
book is actually selling.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.330
So there was a point in my
life where I was checking it

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.210
like obsessively, probably
every 7 or 8 seconds.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.690
And I go to check my Amazon
ranking and it says, you know,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.510
like book is out of stock,
will ship in about a week.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.340
And I realized then that, oh, wow,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.270
we don't have enough
books that are out there.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.540
And so that's when they
really started to turn

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.840
on the proverbial presses.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
how many, now,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.530
have been printed, would you say?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.310
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: So, I don't know
how many total are in print.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.870
I know that hard copies, we've
sold just under a million,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.710
and it's a little over a million
if you count digital copies

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.620 position:56%
and audio copies and all that stuff.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
the title, okay.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.220
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.520
[ Applause ]

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, the
title, very often authors don't come

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.720
up with a title right away, and
was that your idea for the title,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.230
or where did it come from?

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.590
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: It came
through a conversation

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.810
with my agent, this woman, Tina.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.800
You know, I wanted the word
hillbilly to be in the book title.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.060
And the reason I wanted that
word to be in the title is

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.060
because I thought it captured
both this sort of particular,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.920
kind of cultural sub-segment
that I was trying to write about.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.830
But I also thought that
it captured, obviously,

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.350
this sort of interesting insider
outsider dynamic that existed

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.820 position:56%
in my family, where my grandma would
say, you know, we're hillbillies,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.550
we're allowed to call
each other hillbillies,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.520
but if anybody else
calls you a hillbilly,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.300
then you have to punch
them in the nose.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.480
And so it was this sort
of interesting word,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.800
that it always had a really
textured meaning as I grew up,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.920
and so I wanted that
word to be in the title.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.210
Bet elegy was really
something that it really had

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.960
to take awhile before I was one,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.870
comfortable with making
it Hillbilly Elegy,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.310
and I think that was Tina's idea to
actually pair Elegy with Hillbilly,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.490
and there were a couple
of reasons for that.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So now that
the book has become so well known,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.190
you are reasonable well known,
can you go to a restaurant

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.290
without people asking for
autographs or selfies,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.940
or that hasn't come
to be a problem yet?

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.210
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: It depends
on where I'm at.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.340
So I get noticed, you know,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.530
so back in Columbus I get
noticed a pretty fair amount.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.380
I get noticed sometimes in D.C. I
certainly get noticed a lot back

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.280
in Eastern Kentucky or
in Southwestern Ohio.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.540
But, you know, like I was in
Nashville, I don't know, a week,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.060
week and 1/2 ago, and I
didn't get noticed once there.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.730
So it definitely appears.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.030
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You have

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.770
to make a record there,
I think, or something.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.070
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, that's right.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.370
I think so.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So,
now what has been the reaction

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.110
of your family?

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.510
Many of the family secrets that
many people don't really want

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.010
about themselves, everybody
has family secrets.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.010
You seem to reveal
every family secret.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.240
What was the reaction
of your family to this?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.140
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I didn't
reveal every family secret,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.350
I have to keep material
for a second book, yeah.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.690
[ Laughter ]

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.020
You know, it's interesting.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.340
I, in talking to my family about
revealing some of these secrets,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.950
I think that I've noticed
there's been a slight tone shift

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.160
from when I started to write the
book to where it is now, right?

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.690
I think the people
were much more open

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.360
about spilling the family
history on the pages of a book

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.070
that no one expected
anybody to read.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.430
I think now, now that we're at
the number of copies we've sold,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.840
and people are talking
about the book,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.020
there's maybe a little
more sensitivity.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.810
But yeah, you know, some
people definitely say, look,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.000
it's in the family, we shouldn't
air the family's dirty laundry.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.790
Some people, I think, appreciate
that it was an important

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.870
and worthwhile story to tell.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.280
Some people come down a
little bit in the middle.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
do any of them say, well,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.160
how come I don't get
any royalties from this?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.460
They don't say that to you yet?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.760
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I
haven't gotten that yet,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.830
but maybe I will now, especially
since this is on C-SPAN.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.420 position:56%
So let's talk about the book itself.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.030
I have read it, and I
enjoyed it a great deal.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.940
I would say, I think it's
success is due to three things,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.900
and I'd like to go through
each of those three.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.900
One is, I think, the writing
style is very crispy clear,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.670
very to the point, not a
lot of excess verbiage.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.500
Second, your personal story is
extraordinary, which is the kind

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.320
of thing that, it's
almost like a novel.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.960
It's hard to believe it was true.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.650
And then third, the impact, the
relationship between what's going

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.280
on in the country, the opioid
crisis, the problem of unemployment

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.580
in certain parts of the country.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.470
So let's go through
each of these first.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.770
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.370
First, the writing style.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.910
Were you a gifted writer
in college, in law school?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.010
Where did you get this, what
I would call, very crisp,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.150
very clear, writing style?

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.350
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah,
I think, definitely,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.150
law school helped a
lot in that regard.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.610
Because one of the things they
teach you in law school, you know,

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.270
is don't write with a lot of
excess verbiage, try to be clear

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.120
and concise, direct,
but also engaging.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.280 position:56%
And so, you know, thinking about how
to write as a lawyer cut out some

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.090
of the excess words,
was definitely helpful.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.880
But, you know, it's
interesting that you ask

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.990
if I was a talented writer always.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.480
I mean, I don't necessarily think
that I am a talented writer.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.500
But it's funny, because there
was this 8th grade biography

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.330
that I had to write.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.590
And when my family, my family
still has this 8th grade biography.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.150
And it's interesting, because it's
obviously very similar to what's

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.440 position:56%
in Hillbilly Elegy, and they'll pass
it around and go, oh, JD, you know,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.360
he was such a great writer,
even when he was 14 years old.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.670
And then when my wife picks up that
same thing and reads it, she'll go,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.160
your family is not being honest
with you, you were not that good

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.360
of a writer when you
were 14 years old.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.700
So, I don't know.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.580
I do think that law school helped.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.060
I mean, there's this story
that I tell in the book

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.820
where the first big writing
assignment I had in law school,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.970
I handed it in, I was
pretty proud of it,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.430 position:56%
and this law school professor handed
it back and circle this big section

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.730
and said, this is a vomit

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.900
of sentences masquerading
as a paragraph.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.940
So I think if you asked him
if I was a talented writer,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.110
he'd probably say no.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now
today, you know,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.450
having had a first book
that's very successful,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.720
normally publishers will
go to the author and say,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.250
you are Ernest Hemingway,
you are great,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.920
let's have another book right away,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.490
and the sooner you
get it out the better.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.200
So surely they are after
you to write another book.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.950
Are you thinking of
writing one right now?

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so definitely
thinking about writing another book.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.700
And I think I eventually will.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.750
You know, my view on this
is that it's not something

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.630
that I'm trying to
undertake tomorrow.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.470
So if I write another book, it'll
be a couple of years from now,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.110
as opposed to immediately.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But
eventually they'll be a paperback

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.110
edition of this.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.410
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: That's right.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.710
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And will you
edit it, or change it a little bit,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.010
or will you just go
at it the same way?

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.880
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think I'll
just go at it the same way.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.900
I would like to add a chapter
just to contextualize some

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.040 position:56%
of the political salients that a lot

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.470
of people have contributed
to the book.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.720
Because, of course, when I
started writing this in 2013,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.480
I had no idea that it would be
attached to the 2016 election

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.320
in this really, you know,
frankly to me, pretty bizarre way.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.010
So I think I would like to write
at least a little bit about that,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.020
because I haven't talked
a ton about that.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.840
But otherwise, the rest of
the book will stay the same.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.440
Before the book, paperback
comes out,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.770
or maybe after the
paperback comes out,

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.740
there is supposed to be a movie.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.420
Ron Howard is, I guess,
producing a movie,

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.870
or maybe directing it as well.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.330
Who is going to play you?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.860
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I don't know.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.250
The thing about this
is that, you know,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.490
I wanted to be somebody who's good
looking, but not so good looking

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.510
that people are disappointed
when they actually meet me.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.130
[ Laughter ]

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.740
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: But yeah,
this is the question

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.200
that I have a real trouble meeting,
because, you know, who really fits

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.640
into that, you know, not too
warm, not too cold category.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:I'm
sure you'll find somebody.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.630
Let's go to the second part of why
I think the book is so successful,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.930
and that is your life story.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.870
For those who may not have
read the book, and I don't want

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.360
to give away everything in
it, but give away a fair bit.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.660
Where were you born?

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I was born in
Middletown, Ohio, Southwestern Ohio.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.120
And your biological mother

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.420
and biological father
were married at the time?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.720
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: They were.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.730
and did they get divorced
shortly thereafter?

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.030
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Very shortly after.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.790
I think I was maybe a year
old when they got divorced,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.280
but before memories, certainly.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So your
biological mother was raising you

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.240
for the early years?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.540
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Correct.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then
you have a very close relationship

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.140
with your maternal grandfather
and maternal grandmother, right?

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.440
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what was
their name, that you called them?

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.040
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I called
them Mamaw and Papaw,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.340 position:56%
and their names were Bonnie and Jim.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.370
And is that a hillbilly type word,

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.270
or are they just unique
to your family?

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.510
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I think that
it's definitely pretty common

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.810
in the broader culture.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.120
It's not exclusive, I've
learned, to, you know,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.180
sort of hillbilly culture.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.100
But it's definitely something
that people from that region

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.860
of the country, disproportionately
they call their grandparents Mamaw

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.160
and Papaw.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now
people who might live

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.050
on the East Coast would say,
what's hillbilly about Ohio?

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.740
That's the center of
the United States.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.040
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you
might describe that your roots,

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.640
and your family's roots,
were really from Kentucky.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.530
Describe how you came to Ohio,
and how your family came to Ohio.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.830
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah,
so they were part

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.610
of this really massive migration
from places like Eastern Kentucky,

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.440
East Tennessee, West Virginia to
the industrial Midwest, right?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.380
And, I think, when they
moved, they also brought a lot

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.330
of their cultural attributes
with them, and so, again,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.660
even though my family lived in
Southwestern Ohio, you know,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.160
we traveled back to
Eastern Kentucky a lot.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.230
Because I spent so much
time with my grandparents,

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.880
I spent a lot of my formative years
in Eastern Kentucky and always felt

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.260
that that was sort
of our real homeland.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.840
And it's interesting, that's a
pretty common attitude, you know?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.530
Folks, there are country
music songs about this.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.890
There are a lot of stories similar
to mine, where people who grew

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.570
up in the industrial Midwest, who
grew up in Michigan or Indiana

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.750
or Ohio, felt like their real
home was back in West Virginia,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.290
because they spent so much of
their lives back in those places,

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.660
and that's where their
family was really from.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.440
So you're growing up and you have
a step sister or a whole sister.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.740
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sister, yeah.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.390
So, yeah. Different dad, same mom.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.690
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.490
And so both of you are being
raised by your single mother?

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.790
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.050
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And
how does she support herself?

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.290
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so
you know, mom, I remember,

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:57.130
became a nurse sometime after, you
know, maybe I was 8 or 9 or so,

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.470
so for a couple of
years she was a nurse.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.100
And, actually, as I
write about in the book,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.990
those were pretty good times
economically, you know,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.080
we weren't struggling economically
during that period of our lives.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.580 position:56%
Before then, you know, I don't know.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.960
I think that, you know,
she worked odd jobs,

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.080
my grandparents helped
out a little bit.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.390
And then, certainly, one of the
stories in the book is that,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.950
you know, after mom was no longer
working in nursing, you know,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.760
thinks were pretty tough
for our family economically.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.280
And I think, more importantly,
they were tough socially.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.630
There were a lot of issues.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So your
mother, as you write in your book,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.220
was married, or had male
relationships with people

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.350
who were living with her like
4, or 5, or 6 different times.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.500 position:56%
So wasn't that kind of disconcerting
to you to see a different man

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.640
in the house all the time, or?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.590
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, it was
definitely an unstable childhood

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.880 position:56%
from the perspective of people who
were coming in and out of our lives.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.880
And I think that, you
know, I didn't realize

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.650
until I was older what
effect that was having on me.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.950
I didn't like it when I was a kid.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.580
I certainly didn't like that,
you know, I'd befriend this guy,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.760
or I'd feel like this guy
was starting to become a bit

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.730
of a father figure, and then all of
the sudden he was out of our lives.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.030
I knew that was common.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.830
I knew a lot of my friends
from back home were going

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.740
through the same thing, and that
none of them liked it either.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.570
I didn't quite appreciate the
effect that maybe it was having

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.710
on me until, you know, until
I was older and started

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.010
to look back on these things.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.310
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:At
some point, you know,

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.610
as you write in your
book, you develop,

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.880
you redevelop a relationship
with your biological father.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.180
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You went and
actually lived with him for awhile,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.030
but that was not as
pleasant an experience

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.330
as you thought it would be.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.630
Is that correct?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it was pleasant
in the sense that, you know,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.630
he really had his life together.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.470
He was living with my step mom
and they had a really, I think,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.380
a happy home life, and I think in
some ways, I was looking for that,

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.800
I was searching for
that family stability.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.170
I think I was in the 8th grade
or so when this happened.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.030
But I also realized that I
had become incredibly attached

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.000 position:56%
to my grandma, right, because even
when I was living with mom as a kid,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.960
even when my sister and I
were living with mom as kids,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.080
we spent a ton of time
with our grandparents.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.890
And as mom sort of struggled with
problems, we more, we spent more

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.740 position:56%
and more time with our grandparents.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.080
So there was this real weird moment
where I was living with my dad,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.090
and I recognized that he
had sort of normal home,

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.550
as people understood it, but I
just felt so desperate to get back

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.650
to my grandma's house
and live with her,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.020
and that's eventually what I did.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.580
You know, I don't think I
realized until that moment

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.570
that in my own mind, and in
my own heart, Mamaw had sort

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.470
of become my chief caretaker.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.200
So you lived with your
biological father for awhile,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.660
it wasn't as happy an
experience as you had hoped.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.500 position:56%
You then moved in with your maternal
grandmother and grandfather.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.800
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.840
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Papaw, he had
passed away at that point.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Let's
talk about that.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.440
He was very close to you.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.740
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.040
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So the shock

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.240
of his passing away,
how did that effect you?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.580
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it, I
mean, it effected me, I think,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.030
in all the ways that the death

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.470
of a parent effects a
young kid, you know?

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.970
Papaw, because of the
situation growing up,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.870
because of the revolving door
of father figures and so forth,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.390
Papaw was the closest
thing that I had

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.850
to a dad during those
formative years, you know?

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.270
He was the person who
took care of things.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.730
He was the person who made sure we
had all the things that kids need.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.920
And also, he was just an
emotional support for me,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.670
and my sister, and my grandmother.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.340
You know, I always had this
sense that if Papaw was around,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.850
things would be taken
care of, you know?

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.840
He was always the person
who was calmest

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.360
when family drama was happening.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.610
He was the person who
never lost his temper,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.890
who never flew off the handle, who,
even Mamaw, as much as I loved her,

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.650
she had a temper, and Papaw didn't.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.430
And so, I think that it
effected me in a number

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.750
of different and negative ways.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.150 position:56%
But the way that it effected me most

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.400
of all is really what
came after it, you know?

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.910
I understood as a kid,
very instinctively

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.760
that Papaw was the glue that
held the family together.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.040
And I realized it in a non
instinctive and very obvious way

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.180
when he wasn't there, just what,
you know, just what would happen.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.240
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, you
lived with your mother for awhile,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.910
then at one point, she was violent
with you, and very difficult

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.010
to deal with, and she
had a drug problem,

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.520
as you refer it in the book.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.820
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.120
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what was
it like, you recount, in the book,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.130
an experience where, in
fact, the police came

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.820
and saved you from your mother.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.710
Is that fair?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.010
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.530
You know, I think about this story
a lot, because, you know, I wonder,

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.450
you know, I was 12 or 13 when
this happened, I always wonder

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.740
if maybe it wasn't quite
as dangerous as I remember.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.080 position:56%
I think, in part, that's just
because I'm a lot closer to mom now,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.010
and I think in some
ways, people, you know,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.700
they try to remember things in a
way that, you know, reflects fondly

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.310
on people that they love.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.670
And I certainly love my mom,

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.490
and we're doing pretty well
in our relationship now.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.550
But, you know, yeah,
I was terrified.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.180
I mean, I thought that
we were going to die,

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.320
and I thought that mom was
going to try to kill us, and so,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.020
and this was in a car, the
car was traveling very fast,

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.040
and she was certainly, didn't
seem especially stable.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.570
And so I got out of the car and
ran and eventually found this woman

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.920
who called the police, and the
police came and arrested mom

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.640
and she was, and she was
charged with domestic violence.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.230
So you know, that was obviously a
pretty traumatic moment, you know?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.070
There's no other way to cut it.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And after
that happened, did you go, then,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.370
live with your grandmother,
or did you go back and live

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.770
with your mother after
that incident?

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.110
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, for a time,
I live with my grandmother.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.500 position:56%
You know, again, I was always living
with Mamaw for weeks or months

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.190
at a time, even when things
were going really well.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.270
And so it wasn't that different
of a, it wasn't that much

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.510
of a departure from
our normal routine.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.190
But yeah, I went and lived
with Mamaw for a little while,

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.330
and then eventually went
and moved back in with mom.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.180
But, again, that was sort of the
way that things went with us.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.770
And when you were growing up,
you know, when I was growing up,

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.420
I didn't have the experiences
that you did,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.650
but I wouldn't have the ability
to totally recall what happened

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.830
when I was 12 or 10 or 9.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.300
How do you recall that,
and did you have documents?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.550
Or how did you know
these incidents so well.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.130
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, well, I
think this is where, you know,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.350
being able to rely on your
family really helps, right?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.860
So, you know, a lot of this stuff
I tried to cross reference as much

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.820
as possible with my aunt, or
my sister, my mom, my dad.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.470
You know, what happened here?

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.890
This is sort of, you know, here's
the draft, here's the manuscript

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.190
of this particular story.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.600
You know, what am I leaving out?

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.900
What am I missing?

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.750
What haven't I quite
remember correctly?

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.410
And I do think, you know, going
back to how the family reacted

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.460
to the book, that's one of the
reasons they reacted pretty well,

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.670
because I tried to make them
part of the writing process.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.950
This wasn't just sort of
from my memory onto the page.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.840
I really tried to make it a
family memoir in that sense.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.710 position:56%
But as I said in the introduction,
I'm sure that things aren't perfect,

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.120
but they're certainly
how I remember them.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.540
And I think that they're pretty
well documented, at least as much

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.700
as you can with what
is primarily a memoir.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now as you go
through, in the book, you point out,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.670
obviously, your grandmother
died as well.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.970
That must have been
fairly traumatic.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.090
Were you living with her
at the time that she died?

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.880
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I was in
the Marine Corp at the time.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.940
This was actually just a few months
before I left for Iraq in 2005.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.240
And, you know.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You were
living with her when you, when you,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.940
you were getting ready,
when you graduated

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.240
from high school you
were living with her.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.540
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, that's right.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.840
No, no, no, no.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.140
So, well, I lived with her
for almost all of high school.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.470
And left for the marines,
you know, from her house.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So you
were filling out applications,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.850 position:56%
you write in your book, for college.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.330
And then either you thought you
couldn't afford the college,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.650
or you weren't sure
you were ready for it.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.670 position:56%
What was the reason you didn't go
to college right out of high school?

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.190
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it was both.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.120
Definitely I didn't
feel ready for it.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.590
I thought that, you know, I had at
least enough maturity at the time

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.650
to recognize that this maybe
was my one real opportunity

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.560
to have anything in the way of
a good job, or a good career,

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.470 position:56%
that if I screwed this college thing
up, that would be pretty much it,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.500
that would be me blowing
my one chance.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.920
And so, you know, because of that I
didn't want to take it for granted,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.780
and I thought that I was in
this position just as a person,

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.580
where if I went to college,
I felt like I would have,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.310
I would have taken advantage of it.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.200
You know the cost part of it was
definitely a significant issue

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.500
as well.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.800
You know, it wasn't just the cost.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.500 position:56%
I mean, obviously I knew that I'd
have to take out all of these loans,

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.160
and we sort of knew that there
were these Pell Grants and things

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.370
like that that I'd be
able to take advantage of.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:17.820
But even with that, I knew

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.420 position:56%
that it would be a pretty
significant amount of debt to incur.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.870
But it was more actually
the logistical side of it

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.150
that made college seem so imposing.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.560
You know, if you think
about like filling

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.790
out the financial aid paperwork.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.010
What is your dad's annual income?

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.310
What is your dad's address?

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.360
I mean, at that time,
I hadn't spoken

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.380
to my legal father in 6 or 7 years.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.050 position:56%
Going and finding that information
would have required a certain amount

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.770
of detective work.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.420
You know, there were sort
of these pages to sign off

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.560
on these massive loans, and it was
my grandma, who hadn't graduated

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.500
from high school, and me, and
it just seemed really imposing,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.860
and in some ways, a
little terrifying to go

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.650
through this entire administrative
process that no one really,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.930
in my family, had gone through,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.600
and I didn't feel comfortable
doing it myself.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.900
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.200
So you just said, I'll
walk down the street and go

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.500
to the Marine recruiter,
is that what happened?

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.800
Or?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.100
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well,
yeah, that's, I think,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.400
a similar version of what happened.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.130
I mean, at that point, so there
are six kids in my generation

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.840
of grandchildren, my two
older cousins, my sister

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.600
and my two younger cousins, and of
the six of us, three of us enlisted

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.580
in the Marine Corp, both
of the older cousins have.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:32.010
So I was encouraged pretty
strongly by my cousin Rachel,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.280
who was in the Marine Corp. She
said, you know, if you're worried

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.430
about how you're going
to pay for school,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.610
and more importantly you're
worried about whether you're ready

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.280
for college, you should just
go join the Marine Corp. Like,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.580
that'll be great for you.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.820
You'll, you know, you'll get out
of town, you'll see some stuff,

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.970
you'll gain some financial
independence,

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.400
and you should really go
and think about doing that.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.700
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.710
So you signed up for the Marine
Corp. Did your family tell you

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.010
that was a good idea?

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.660
Your mother?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.960
Your?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.260
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I, you know,

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.720
it's definitely a patriotic
community and a patriotic family,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.700
so people were proud of me.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.200
But they were not especially happy
that I had chosen, yeah, remember,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.180
this is, I guess I
signed up in 2003.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.290
We had just invaded Iraq.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.900
We'd been involved in
Afghanistan for awhile.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.490
There was definitely some real
apprehension, justifiably so,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.330
about what joining
the Marine Corp meant,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.080
what I was getting myself into.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.810
And Mamaw, especially,
reacted very negatively.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.800
You know, I think, in some ways,
she framed my decision to go

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.720
into the Marine Corp
instead of college,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.430
you know, almost as a betrayal.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.300
That you're going off and leaving
me, leaving me to take care

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.700
of myself, you could get hurt.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.560
And I think that was,
obviously, very hard,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.280
but ultimately she understood
why I needed to do it.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.580
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.880
So you went to basic training.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.180
And what was that like?

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.860
Did you, I mean, fear you couldn't
get through basic training?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.730
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I was never afraid
that I couldn't get through.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.470
I mean, maybe when I was in high
school, I was a little bit afraid

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.210
of the physical demands,
and so forth.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.400
You know, but a drill instructor
told me, actually, you know,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.660
if you think those drill
instructors are going to be mean,

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.570
they'll be nothing like
that grandma of yours.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:03.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: And I really thought,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.720
that so long as I could
physically cut it,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.130
the psychological part would be
fine and I'd be able to make it.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.200
and that was true, you know.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.920
Marine Corp boot camp is definitely
challenging, but it's also,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.610
in a weird way, it's kind of fun.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.480
Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.780
But I know a lot of Marines

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.410
who actually enjoyed their
Marine Corp boot camp experience,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.940
and I was no different
in that regard.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.240
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Your
grandmother, by the way,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.750
recounting your book, she
has a colorful language.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.880
Did that rub off on you?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.390
Or how did you avoid, or
she never was embarrassed

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.730
to use those words around you?

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.020 position:56%
Or you didn't say anything about it?

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, well, I think
my son is too young to show evidence

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.690
of how foul my language is.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.610
You know, I definitely try to
cut back on the language relative

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.080
to my grandma, just
because, I mean, she really,

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.120
she loved a dramatic
and well placed f-word.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.230
[ Laughter ]

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.410
And, I, you know, you
go from Mamaw's house

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.040
to the U.S. Marine Corp,
you know, the phrase curse

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.410
like a sailor doesn't come from
nowhere, and the Marine Corp's part

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.970
of the Department of the Navy.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.780
And I think that I definitely have
had to scale back my language just

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.080
to like operate in civil society.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.380
[ Laughter ]

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.300
But it's like ingrained in me, and
I definitely don't always succeed.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.600
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.900
So you're in the Marine Corp,
you get through basic training,

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.200
and then you go over to Iraq.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.500
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.800
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And were
you afraid you wouldn't come back

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.770
in one piece, or you weren't
sure you would survive, or?

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.070
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well,
I think anybody,

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.610
when they're about
to deploy to Iraq,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.060
is worried about whether
they'll come back in one piece.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.960
The thing to remember
is that I had an MOS,

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.300
meaning a military occupation
specialty, where, you know,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:48.240 position:56%
we had lost some people in my MOS to
combat deaths and combat injuries,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.970
but it wasn't quite, you know,
I wasn't thinking quite as much

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.350
about the danger as maybe I would
have been if I was, you know,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.210
working in the infantry,
for example.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:01.790
So I was worried about it, but
I also tried to talk myself up

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.710
and recognize that, you
know, it'll be dangerous,

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.470
it'll certainly be more dangerous
than driving down the street,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.820
but I'll probably end up, you know,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.450
most Marines end up
coming back okay.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.950
So after four years, you
leave the military, right?

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.250
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.720
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then you
decide you want to go to college.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.020
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You felt
you were then ready for it.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.620
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you
were then 40 years older than many

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.280
of your college contemporaries,
right?

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.580
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.510
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So why do
you decide to go to Ohio State,

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.030
not that it's not a
great place to go,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.410
but did you consider
any other place?

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.510
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, some
OSU fans out there, go Bucks.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.040
[ Applause ]

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.810
Well, you know, I think
it's possible to sort

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:43.810
of make these decisions seem
more rational than they were.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.580
I mean, honestly, the reason I
wanted to go to Ohio State is

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.210
because I grew up rooting and
loving Ohio State and a lot

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:51.510
of my friends had gone there.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.480
I was not nearly as, maybe,

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.420
thoughtful about my college
decision as I should've been.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.980
I had a great experience there, and
I'm really glad that I went there.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.070
But it was basically luck that
I found myself at Ohio State.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.110 position:56%
I wasn't sort of thinking as smartly
about it as I should've been.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.410
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.270
So normally people go to
college for four years.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.570
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And
you seem to get

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.170
through Ohio State in two years.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.470
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:How do you
get through Ohio State in two years?

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.240
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, you
take a lot of classes,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.100
you go during the summer,
and you transfer credits

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.240
that you gained during the
Marine Corp over to Ohio State.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.220
Those three things were able
to, or were enough to enable me

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.520
to cut a couple of years off.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.120
So how did you support yourself.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.420
Where would the money
come from for Ohio State?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.720
Did you have grants then,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.170
or the Marine Corp salary
was enough to supplement you?

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.470
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah,
a couple of things.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.440
So I was no longer in the Marine
Corp, so I wasn't getting a salary

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.910
from the government anymore.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.720
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But
the money you had saved.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.020
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.690
So, you know, a little bit of
savings, a little bit of debt

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.580
that I incurred, you know,
I borrowed some, you know,

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:54.570
some of the subsidized loans,
had some Pell Grants at OSU,

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:59.440
had the GI Bill, which I was
trying to save for law school,

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.160
but I used some of the
GI Bill during college.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.980
And then I, you know, I
worked jobs during college.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.220
So it sort of, those
multiple different sources

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.680
of income were enough
to get me through.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.980
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.670
So you graduate in two years.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.970
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yep.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And then you
decide you want to go to law school.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.570
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But as
you point out in your book,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.170
there aren't as many
people going to let's say,

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.060
Yale or Harvard Law
Schools, from Ohio State.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.360
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Though
there obviously are some.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.490
But how did you happen to
decide to go to Yale Law School,

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.250
which is a great law school, as
opposed to Ohio State Law School,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.450 position:56%
or some other school in the Midwest?

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.750
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.050
So this is another thing

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.030
where I wasn't thinking
super strategically about it.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:39.100
You know, I applied to a few
law schools, I got into them,

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.750
and sort of was thinking
about just, you know,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.610
going to one of those schools,
and my friend, you know,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.670
one of my best friends, he was the
best man in my wedding, actually,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.980 position:56%
who, himself was a lawyer, you know,
said, look, you've got good grades

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.720
and you think you can get into
a good place, this is 2009,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.720
this is right after the
Great Recession, he's like,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.760
I've got friends from law school
who are struggling to find work,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.380
so you should try to get
into the best school you can,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.350
because that'll be your
best insurance policy

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.740
against unemployment.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.340
And so then I actually ended up
taking off a little bit of time,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.980
and then reapplying and
that's when I applied to Yale.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But you were
an average high school student,

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.040
but in college you did much better.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.900 position:56%
How did you change from a mediocre,
average student, to a great student?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, I think average
is probably putting it charitably

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.900
in high school.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.310 position:56%
You know, a couple of things, right?

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.030
I mean, so one, I was
just a more mature person.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:36.360
This goes back to me being ready
for college in a psychological way.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.120
I sort of appreciated that it
was this opportunity as opposed

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.790
to just a responsibility that
somebody had hoisted upon me.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.430
And so I just tried harder.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.340 position:56%
I think, you know, paying for it and
sort of seeing that debt bill go up

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.240
and up maybe gave me some
sense to the fact that it was,

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.690
I was lucky to be able to go there.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.780
You know, but I also thought a lot

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.920
about my grandma when
I was in college.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.580
You know, this is a woman
who left school, I think,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.010
when she was 14 years old
to come north to Ohio.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.190
She had not had many
educational opportunities,

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.170
she was super, super smart.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.030
And I just thought
to myself, you know,

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.150
if Mamaw can sacrifice all those
things to get me to a place

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.930
like this, I should
actually take advantage of it

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.540
and I should actually try hard.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.840
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.140
So you go to Yale Law School.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.090
Now Yale Law School is about
the hardest law school to get

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.260
into in the United States,
very small law school,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.400
many people go there from
Harvard, Yale, Princeton,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.050
similar kind of colleges.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.420
Did you feel a little out of place
when you got to Yale Law School?

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.720
There weren't that many
people in your class,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.800
as I recall, from Ohio State.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.150
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah,
I think in my year,

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.970
I was the only Ohio
State grad at Yale.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:44.900
You know, it was weird
to me, because I realized

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.140
that there were high schools,
you know, preparatory schools,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.400
where there were more students from
that high school at Yale Law School

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.900
than there were of my University,

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.370
which just struck me
as a little bit weird.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.110
But yeah, it was definitely
culture shock.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.790
It was more of a culture
shock, frankly,

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.090
than any place I had ever been.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.190
It was more of a culture
shock than the Marine Corp,

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.080
more than Ohio State, you know,

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.400
it was sort of astonishing just
how different the expectations

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.460
and the backgrounds were
from some of my classmates,

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.300
relative to where I came from.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, another
person who went to Yale Law School,

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.370
Bill Clinton, came from Arkansas,
and he used to, apparently,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.300
take a lot of pride and
say, I'm from Arkansas,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.690
it's a great state, and so forth.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.070
Did you say, I'm a hillbilly from
Kentucky, and Ohio, and, you know,

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.690
I'm really different,
but I'm really as good

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.170
as you guys, or how did you fit in?

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.450
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I don't know that
I ever introduced myself and said,

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.030
I'm a hillbilly from
Ohio, how are you?

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.040
[ Laughter ]

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.340
But I think that definitely came

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.950
through in the way that
I conducted myself.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:42.840
I mean, I was definitely a
pretty strong Ohio partisan,

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.380
even in undergrad.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.280
I think everyone, or
even in law school,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.980
I think everyone knew
where I was from.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.830
But, yeah, I don't know if
I used that precise phrase.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.430
So how did you do at, how did
you do at Yale Law School?

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.720
Were you academically at
the top, or in the middle,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.020 position:56%
or at the bottom, or where were you?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.320
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I did okay.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.620
I mean, I don't think I was
at the top, by any means,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.920
I think my wife was at the top,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.010
which is why she's clerking
for the Chief Justice.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.480
I definitely didn't do as
well as her, I know that.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.410
The weird thing about Yale, for
those of you who sort of know some

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:14.130
of these law schools, is they
don't give traditional grades,

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.370
so it's actually really
hard to sort of know

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.500
where you rank relative
to your peers.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.360
My sense is that I was doing fine.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.860
I wasn't at the bottom of the pack,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.350
but I certainly wasn't
at the top, either.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.450
And I was sort of, I was
comfortable with that.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.050
So you wrote your way onto the Yale
Law Journal, which is usually one

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.540
of the most prestigious things
that you can do at Yale Law School.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.770
And then did you decide that
you wanted to practice law

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.320
or be a clerk, or what did you
decide that you wanted to do?

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.820
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, so my wife and
I had this opportunity, actually,

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.270
to go to the Eastern
District of Kentucky.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You
met your wife in,

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:42.870
was she in the same class as you.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.170
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, was
in the same law school.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Is
she here now?

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.770
Or where is she?

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.070
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She probably.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Is
the wife here, somewhere?

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.670
I don't see her here.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.970
But I thought she was coming.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.270
Where is she?

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.570
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: There she is.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:There she
is, okay, there she is, okay.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.720
[ Applause ]

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.050
Okay. Okay.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.360
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sorry.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.690
So you met her, and you
were in the same class?

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.990
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:06.290
So we were in the same class.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:07.590 position:56%
So we had an opportunity to clerk
on the Eastern District of Kentucky,

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.240
which both of our judges, we
worked for separate judges,

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.540
but they were both in Covington,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.110
which is just over the
river from Cincinnati.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.490
And so it's sort of this perfect
opportunity to go and, you know,

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.700
clerk for a federal judge, but be
close to home, and work on things

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.460
that were both really
interesting to us.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You had
spent most of your life trying

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.960
to escape Kentucky and then
you went back to Kentucky.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.440
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I
don't know that I was trying

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.920
to escape Kentucky, so much as the
chaotic home that I grew up in.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.220
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.740
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I've always sort of
loved, you know, loved the places

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.210
that I came from, and
always wanted to go back.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:41.260
But yeah, you know, it
definitely was a really exciting

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.560
and a really good year.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.600
We both worked for like
really good people.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.270 position:56%
You know, sometimes people get stuck
with bad judges, so we both worked

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.170
for great people and
had a great year.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:52.770
So, as I said at the beginning,

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.640
there were three reasons why I
think the book is very successful,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.940
at least in my view.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.030
One is, it's very well written,
very precise and very, a good read.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.160
Secondly, the life story
is almost like a novel,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.140
so it's very interesting.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.690
But the third is, I think, one of
the reasons the book has become

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.130
so popular, because as
you point out yourself,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.430
the world has changed a fair bit

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.730
since you conceived
of writing the book.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.030
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.440
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And now,
what you wrote about is seen as one

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.460
of the problems of our country,
which we have a lot of drug abuse,

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.430
opioid abuse, unemployment,
particularly, I'd say,

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.510
in the Midwest, and a lot of the
kind of people that you come from,

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.210
the roots where you come
from have these problems.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.960 position:56%
So let's talk about that for awhile.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.260
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Let's talk

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.860
about the opioid problem,
for example.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.160
And you growing up, you
point out in your book

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.140
that drug abuse was a
problem in your area

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.810
and you think it's gotten worse.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.440
And why do you think it's so bad?

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.920
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, yeah,

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.550
it's definitely something
I saw growing up.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:50.610 position:56%
And I remember when, you know,
addiction hit our family and I found

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.640
out that mom was addicted to, you
know, prescription pain pills,

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.940
as we called them back then.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.240
I just didn't understand it, right,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.780
I didn't understand why anybody
would be addicted to pain pills.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.160
It wasn't especially common.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.120
This was back in the mid 90's,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.960
so the problem had not gone
main stream as it has now.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.160
Now, of course, in 2017,
we sit here and we talk

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.430
about the opioid epidemic, which is
now, really, a nationwide crisis.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.880
And so I did feel in some ways
like I got an early insight

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.450
into what would later
become a significant crisis.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.460
Why has it gotten worse?

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.560
There are a ton of
different reasons and a ton

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.860
of different explanations, right?

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.430
So one is, I think,
you know, to be honest,

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:32.090
a lot of these drugs were
marketed as non addictive

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.280
and they were addictive, and
so people got hooked on them,

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.730
and it caused a lot of problems.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.970
I think that you have
a really significant

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:42.210
over prescription problem in some
of these areas where, you know,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:46.010 position:56%
I was just in Southeastern Ohio a
few months ago talking to some folks

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.310
who are dealing with this.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.910
And they tell me that, you know,
when high school kids used to hang

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.160
out and get into their
parent's liquor cabinet,

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.420
or get into their parent's
beer, now they will get

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.830
into grandma's medicine
cabinet and pass around drugs.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.520
Well, that's a different
kind of problem.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.140
And I also think that, you
know, it is, in some ways,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.040
a consequence of some really
negative social problems

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.340
that exist in these communities.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.950
You know, if you have domestic
violence, and you have a lot

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.790
of family instability, if you
have a lot of unemployment,

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.460
then people do eventually get,
they find some way to deal with it.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.420
Maybe 50 years ago, they
dealt with it with alcohol,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.720
and now they're dealing with it

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.490
through a substance that's
just much more addictive.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:How did, but
you largely seem to have avoided,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.730
you know, the opioid problem,
and you write, as I recall,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.560
maybe some use of marijuana
or something,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.280
but not really anything
that was addictive.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.270
So how did you avoid that in the
environment in which you grew up?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.920
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, Mamaw was
very cognoscente of the problems

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.260
of addiction and was really,
really strict about this stuff.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.530
I mean, if she found out that
we were smoking a cigarette,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.420
or that we had anything to drink,
Mamaw would fly off the handle.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:57.280 position:56%
And I think, I think she appreciated
just how bad addiction could be,

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.890
and that it clearly had this
role in our family, you know?

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.770 position:56%
This is the thing that really ruined
her life for the first 30 years

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.090
of her marriage, was alcoholism,

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.350
and then it was ruining the
life of one of her kids.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.910
And so, I was very much on guard,
I mean, almost obsessively so.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.310
I'm one of these people who
doesn't like to take ibuprofen

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.030
for a headache because I'm like
really uncomfortable with the idea

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.610
of putting foreign
substances in my body,

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.050
because I've seen addiction
trap a lot of people.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.090
You know, I got really sick
when I was at Ohio State.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.390
I had mono.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.210
And they gave me this synthetic
opioid called delaudid,

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:35.180
because I had to, you
know, take some medicine.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.730
Anyway, I had this delaudid, I
was in the hospital at Ohio State,

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:43.710
and I remember calling, basically,
everyone in my family saying,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.180
I know why Mamaw didn't like us

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.010
to take this stuff,
because it is fantastic.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.310
[ Laughter ]

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.130
So I just think being on guard
about that stuff is good.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:What
about alcohol?

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.970
You avoided alcohol?

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.010
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, I
haven't avoided alcohol.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.600
[ Laughter ]

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.090
I certainly have never felt

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.650
that I've been addicted
to alcohol, you know?

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.660
I'm sort of, when they ask you at
the doctor, I'm one of these once

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.710
or twice a week type people.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:11.530
But no, I, I've never
felt especially addicted

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.580
to anything except for chocolate
chip cookies and ice cream.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.180
Now let's talk about unemployment.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.750
As you point out in the book,
many people left Kentucky,

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.140
and places like that, to go north.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.440
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:To
look for jobs.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.040
But those jobs have
now been hollowed out.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.540
So you see a lot of
unemployment in the kind

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.840
of background that you have.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.140
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Right.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Can you
describe whether it's getting better

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.740
or worse, and what's being done
about it, or can be done about it.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.040
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Is it getting,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.360
it's certainly getting better
the past couple of years,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.920
just because the economy
has picked up a little bit.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.830 position:56%
But I don't think that it's improved
significantly over, you know,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.050
where it was 30 or 40 years ago.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.760
What I mean is that the number
of people that the coal industry

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.700
or the steel mill industry employed
in, let's say, the 1950's and 60's,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.570
that hasn't returned in
the past couple of years.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.030
It's not, you know,
maybe as bad as it was.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.700
But I do think that you're
seeing a really, long term,

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.280
significant economic shift
in some of these areas.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.100
And, you know, it's something,

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.100
honestly I think policy
makers were a little blind to.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.250
I think that everybody just
thought that the economy adjust,

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.520 position:56%
that folks would get different jobs,
that they would skill up and move

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.890
into different professions.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.110
But what's actually happened
is that you've seen a lot

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.530
of communities get really
significantly decimated,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.490
and that's obviously one of
the undercurrents of the book.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.970
You know, what is there
to do about it?

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.520
There are, I think, a
lot of different things

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.450
that we could do about it.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.250 position:56%
You know, the first is that, I think
we have a pretty significant problem

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:38.030
with the fact that you're
effectively given a choice,

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.600
when you graduate from high
school, between going and working

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.200
in a fast food job, and going
and getting a college education.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.310
And I think that we should
provide more pathways than that.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.070
I think it's not surprising when
those are the only two pathways

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.010
that you see people going
in those two directions.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.460
[ Applause ]

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.880
But I also think, but
I also think we have

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.550
to think a little bit
more constructively

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.370
about regional economic
development, you know?

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:03.560
The way that this has gone for
the past 10 or 20 years is that,

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.860
I'm a local municipality, I offer
somebody a tax credit to set

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.230
up a restaurant in my
home town, that's great.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.440
New restaurants are fantastic,
but that's not the sort

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.560
of long term economic
redevelopment that has

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.860
to happen in some of these areas.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.960
And I think that's it's
something that, basically,

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.650
all levels of policy makers have

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.700
to be thinking differently
than they are right now.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now if
somebody writes a book that's

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:29.370
as successful as yours, and about
the subjects that you deal with,

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:32.410
at some point, somebody from the
Democratic National Committee

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:37.560 position:56%
or the Republican National Committee
will say, you are a great candidate

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.070
to be a member of congress,
governor, senator,

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.040
and maybe something even higher.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.650
So have you ever thought about,

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.380
and have you been importune
to run for something?

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.280
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think
we're out of time, right?

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.580
Thank you.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.880
I appreciate that.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.180
[ Laughter ]

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:All right.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.780
So, it's, so you would say?

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.080
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.630
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:You wouldn't
preclude anything from happening.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.650
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: No, certainly not.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:04.280
You know, yeah, certainly when
that progression is exactly right.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.300
When you have a book
that's successful,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.950
people from various political
parties come to you and ask you

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.600
if you'd be interested
in these things, and.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.900
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Have
you talked to any people

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.750
who have these jobs who
actually like these jobs, though?

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.670
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I actually
don't think that I have.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Right.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: You know, I've talked
to a couple of members of congress,

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:25.580
you know, not about me running,
but just certainly about, you know,

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.310
in this environment do you
actually enjoy what you do?

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.230
And they say, yeah, you know, I
really like working on policy,

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.000
the problem is we don't
do any of that.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.300
So, no.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, but, or
leaving aside whether you would run

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.820
for something, because the
platform you now have is so great,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.120
you can be a spokesman about
alcoholism, unemployment,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.310
opioid addiction, and are you
going to kind of make a part

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.480
of your career talking about
these issues, or do you want

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.880
to not be seen as a
spokesman for these issues?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.180
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.940
I don't know that I want to be seen
as a spokesman for these issues,

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.260
but I certainly think
that it's, you know,

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.960
now that I have this
platform it's, you know,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.930
I might as well do something with
it, productive, other than just,

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:09.360
you know, go and talk
about the book.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.700
There are other issues that
are worth talking about.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.910
So, you know, I've tried to be a
constructive participant in some

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:18.230
of these policy debates, you know,

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.280
during the health care reform
debate of a few months ago.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.980
I went on to Capitol Hill and
I tried to talk to folks about,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.010
this is how this might
effect the opioid crisis,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.980
this is how this might effect
some of the people from back home.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.380
So I try to be a constructive
participant as much as possible.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.620
But, you know, we live in an
especially non constructive time.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:40.460
So I think that you have to be
careful, and you have to be smart,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.600
and you have to be, you know, you
have to recognize that sometimes,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.380
even when you try to
be careful and smart,

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.100
you're not actually
being careful and smart.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.050
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So when you
go to talk to members of Congress,

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.310
or get involved with
Congressional staff people,

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.510
did they just want a picture
with you, or your autograph

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.190
on their book, or did they
actually listen to what you say?

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.490
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, it depends.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.500
It depends on the member
and it depends

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.660
on some of the staff members.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.650
But no, I found, generally
speaking, you know,

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.920 position:56%
that I've become maybe more cynical
about our political process at large

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.350
since the book came out, just,
you know, from talking to folks

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.270
and spending some time
in these areas.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:19.060
I do feel more optimistic about
individual members and their staff.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.350
I think that, by and large, people
actually want to make a difference

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:24.430
and care about the policy, and care

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.330
about what effect it's
going to have.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.910
It's just we happen to
live in a political period

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.120
and a political time where it's
really hard to translate interest

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.420
in policy to constructive
accomplishments.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.110
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:But
people who might be called,

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.480
not pejoratively, but people
might call themselves hillbillies,

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.270
or from hillbilly culture,
are the proud of your book

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:45.230
for having exposed some of
the challenges they have?

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:49.030 position:56%
Or are they upset for having exposed
some of the challenges they have?

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.340
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I think
opinions differ.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.620
Right? I mean, you, there are
people out there who think

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.320
that I'm basically a
traitor and who hate my guts.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.770
There are people out there who
think that I have shed a light

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.220
on really important issues,
and they appreciate it.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.050
I think that the thing that I hear
most from people back home, when I,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:08.240 position:56%
you know, when I go and talk about
the book, or just when I hear people

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.390
when run into me on the
street, is that they appreciate

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.450 position:56%
that the book has talked about these
problems in a way that they feel

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.100
like wasn't talked about before,

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.310
that nobody really wrote
the story from the inside.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:23.820
Nobody really talked about, you
know, what is it like to grow

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.490
up in a household with a lot of
instability, a lot of addiction?

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.250
What's it like to grow up in
a household where, you know,

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.970
you're really worried about
whether you can pay for college,

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.280
or even pay for more
fundamental things.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.780
You know, that is the part that's
been the most gratifying to me.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.860
But I also think that, you know,
it's a region that's really large

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.500
and really diverse, and so you
have opinions that are probably

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.130
as diverse as any large population.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So what
is the most frequent question you

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.960
get asked?

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.930 position:56%
You're in the speaking circuit a
little bit, and you're on TV at CNN,

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.230
you're a contributor at CNN.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.530
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:What is the
question you get most frequently

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:02.410
asked by audiences about your
book, or about your background?

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.910
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: The question I get
most frequently asked, I mean,

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.890
it's probably how my
family reacted to the book.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.640
I think that's definitely something
that people are curious about.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.830
I get asked a lot how
my mom's doing.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Well,
how is she doing?

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.430
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: And the answer to
that, she's doing really well,

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:16.730
yeah, she's doing really well.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.030
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
she's living,

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.330
she's not married now,
she's living in Ohio?

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.630
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, she's, yeah,
yeah, she's living back home.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:21.930
She's doing well.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.230
She's been clean for
a very long time.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.740
And I think, in some ways, you
know, while mom may not be ready

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.840
to play this role, and so I'm
not going to hoist it upon her,

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.760
I think she's a really good
example of what can happen when,

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.910 position:56%
even after five or six times you get
knocked off the horse of addiction

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:43.460
and back into relapse, that
it's still possible to sort

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.760
of climb back out, to
find the right supports,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.280
and to make another go at it.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.760 position:56%
And that, you know, that's
something I really admire about mom.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.250
She's incredibly tenacious.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.440
[ Applause ]

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Does she
now have like the business card

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.610
that says, J.D. Vance's mother.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.040
She doesn't have that
on her business card?

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.340
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: She does not.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And what
about your biological father, is he,

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.590
do you have contact with him?

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:08.890
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:10.190
Yeah, I actually just
got a text message

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.490
from him right when I went up here.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:15.150
Yeah, so dad and I are still
close and still talk quite a bit.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.830
You know, he's doing pretty well.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:23.190
He, you know, he's a great guy.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:26.790
And I think that he, you
know, he and I most often talk

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:30.100
about his grandson and that's
what he's most interested in,

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.070
and I think that's true
of a lot of grandparents.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.210
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So
you talked about in the book,

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.410
you grew up largely
with your sister.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:37.710
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.010
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now
what is she doing now?

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.020
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: So my sister has
three kids back home in Middletown,

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:48.090
has been married for 20 years
or so, and is doing well.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.920
You know, I think that what
Lindsey and I have wanted

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.500
to really accomplish, like what we
thought of as success in our lives,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.210
was being able to give our kids
the stability and the comfort

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.830
and the sense of security
that we didn't have as kids.

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:05.440
She has successfully done
that for almost 20 years.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.640
Her oldest kid is 18.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.010
I have done that for 3 months.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.700
So I'm hopeful I get there, too.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:And today,
do you find that your friends

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.650 position:56%
from high school, they laugh at your
jokes more than they did before,

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:22.440
or they treat you differently,
or how do the people grew

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.410
up with treat you now
that you're so famous?

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:27.710
And wealthy?

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.320
Do people ask you for money?

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.890
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, sometimes
people ask me for money.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.840
But that's, you know,
not a common occurrence.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.760
But yeah, you know, there
are definitely some people

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.710 position:56%
who laugh louder at my jokes, but
my real friends do not laugh louder.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:43.900
I mean, it's one of
the really good things

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:48.100
about having a successful book,
or what a successful book can do,

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.760 position:56%
is you definitely realize the people
who are loyal to you no matter what

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.860
and don't let you get too big for
your britches, as we say back home.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.090
Those are the people
that I really latch onto.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.390
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Okay.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.610
So leaving aside your
potential political career,

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.840 position:56%
right now you're not practicing law,
but you are in, what I would call,

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.050
the highest calling of mankind,
private equity and investing.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:12.410
So, why did you choose to go

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.560
into what I'll call the
venture capital space?

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.030
You're in an area, a narrow niche
of private equity, venture capital.

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:19.790
Why did you choose
to go into that area?

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.010
And you're doing it from
a firm that's based here,

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.540
and you're also living in
Ohio, though, is that right?

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.840
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Sure.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.360
Well, it, so that is right.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.780
And what I find so interesting
about what I'm doing right now is

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:35.040
that if it's done well,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.440
it can actually help
create amazing new products

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.190
and amazing new companies
and amazing new jobs

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:43.090
that didn't exist before, right?

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.030
And so one of the things that
I realized in law school,

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.000
and I think I came into this with
sot of this veil behind my eyes

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.740
that was lifted, is that you know,
what, the people who, I think,

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.590
really frankly call the
shots in our economic system,

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.510
are those who are figuring out,
you know, where capital goes.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.320
And I think that when I realized
that, I thought to myself,

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.280
I'd like to be a guy who is trying
to figure out how to get capital

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.870
to go into good places where
it's going to do a lot of good,

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:14.090 position:56%
and where it's going to create a lot
of value, not just for investors,

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.210
but for people on the
receiving end, too.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:18.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Now, some
people who write first books.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.590
[ Applause ]

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:24.670
Some people write a book, you know,
Margaret Mitchell, Ralph Ellison,

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:27.130
their first book is so successful

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.630
that they have a hard time
writing a second book.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:31.780
They get writer's block because
they think nothing can be

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.080
as good as the first book.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.520
You don't worry about that problem?

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.110
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, I don't know.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:41.530
I think that, I still don't know
that my first book was that good,

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:44.950
so I don't know that any
follow up will be measured well

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:46.550
or poorly compared to it.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.240
It certainly was very successful.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.690
And I think that I'd be an idiot

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:51.810
if I expected any other
to be as successful.

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.580
But I'll let other people
decide whether it's good or not.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.400
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So what
you want to do with your life,

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.140
and what you'd like, you'd be a,
let's say, a role model for people

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.470
who came out of the kind of
background that you came out of.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.020
And now, rightly or wrongly,
whether you want it or not,

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.800
you're a bit of a role
model for people who come

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.370
out of your kind of background.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.030
As a role model, do you
feel more responsibility

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:10.340
to live a life a certain way?

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.930
Do you feel you should give back
to your community a certain way?

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:16.960
What, how has your life changed
as a result of this book?

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.650
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Well, yeah, I
mean I definitely feel a certain

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.180
responsibility, when I go on TV,

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.310
not to make my entire community
seem like an idiot, right?

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:28.280
Because I think one of the things
that I have not appreciated,

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.630 position:56%
but I just have accepted as reality,
is that a lot of people see me

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.650
as sort of a spokesperson
for the white working class.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.000
A lot of times I'm asked to
go on TV and say, you know,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.730
what does the Trump voter
feel about this or that issue?

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.340
I think that's unfair.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.940 position:56%
I don't think that any person could
possibly speak for that many people,

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:49.850
or for the Trump voter at large,
but what I try to do is recognize

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.020
that some people see me
as that representative,

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.460
so I try not to sound like a
total buffoon when I go on TV.

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.060
That's one way that, I think,
things have really changed.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.880
But, I mean, you know,
it's crazy, right?

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.700 position:56%
I mean, a year and a half ago, I was
not sitting here in an auditorium

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.320
in front of hundreds of people.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.660
So it's, it's kind of impossible to
describe how my life has changed.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.170
It's changed in the way that, you
know, any person's life changes

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:17.760
when they go from sitting at
home eating pints of ice cream

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.260 position:56%
and watching Netflix, to sitting
here in front of hundreds of people.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Like
the people,

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.860
the President of the United
States called you and said,

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.100
I read your book, and you
really exemplify that kind

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.280 position:56%
of voter I appeal to, or you haven't
heard that kind of reaction yet?

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.150
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: I've never heard
that from President Trump.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.570
I have heard, you know,
people who work

00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:37.300
at the White House who've said
something similar to that.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.920
So, but no, I've never gotten the
phone call from President Trump.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.220
Still waiting.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.520
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:So, today,

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.120
you would say you're a very happy
person, you've got a child, a wife,

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.110
and your mother and
father are doing well,

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.030
so you're a very happy person
today, and the experience

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.050
of the book has made
your life even better?

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.350
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:56.650
I mean, things are
really going great.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:54:58.210
The book has changed my
life in a very weird way,

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.720
but in definitely a positive way.

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:Well,
I read the book.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.350
As I said, I thought
it was a great book.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.930
I highly recommend it to
those who haven't read it yet.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:08.040
And those who've read
it once, read it again.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.050
I do think it's very
instructive, well written.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:11.960
And I want to thank you for a
very interesting conversation.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.760
&gt;&gt; J.D. Vance: Thanks, David.
