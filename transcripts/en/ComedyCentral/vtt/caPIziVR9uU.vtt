THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:15.514 size:75% position:38% line:85%
UNLESS YOU'RE THEIR MOM.

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:18.985 align:start position:0% line:91%

THE HEAD BECAUSE SHE WAS SO

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:25.858 align:start position:0% line:85%
EMBARRASSED.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:26.892 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES!

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU DO NOT MESS WITH MOM.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:35.368 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SHE WILL TAKE YOU DOWN, SON!

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT, SHE'S NOT THE ONLY MOM
WARRIOR OUT THERE.

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:43.409 line:91%

ALL MOTHERS SHOULD DO WHAT OUR

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:56.989 size:78% position:39% line:85%
SISTER DID IN THAT VIDEO.

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.224 align:start position:0% line:91%
FORGET THE POLICE AND THE
NATIONAL GUARD.

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.592 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; Larry: AND-- AND YOU THINK
YOU MOMS CAN STOP A RIOT?

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.868 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE ALREADY ARE STOPPING IT.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY SON DARNELL WAS OUT THERE
LOOTING.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.839 line:85%
I KNOCKED HIM INTO WEDNESDAY.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL
TOMORROW.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:18.778 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.446 line:85%
IT DOES SEEM A LITTLE VIOLENT.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
ISN'T THAT CHILD ABUSE?

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.749 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY!

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.052 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN OUR

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.187 align:start position:0% line:91%
KIDS GETTING KILLED BY THE
COPS.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.355 size:88% position:44% line:85%

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
VERY GOOD POINT.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.828 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND YOU DON'T THINK THE NATIONAL
GUARD IS HELPING AT ALL.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HELL NO!

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.633 line:85%
THESE ARE TEENAGED BOYS, LARRY.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:45.037 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST A
TEENAGED BOY, THIS...

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.405 align:start position:0% line:85%

INTIMIDATION, WHATEVER WORKS.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:09.629 line:91%
IF I SEE MY BOY ABOUT THROW A TV
INTO A STORE WINDOW, I GO FULL

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:10.563 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAME ON HIM.

THAT'S HARD CORE.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.581 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I ALWAYS HATED THAT ONE.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.516 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST MY KIDS.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.919 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'LL USE THESE TACTICS ON
ANYBODY'S KIDS.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.654 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IT TAKES A VILLAGE, LARRY.

CARS AND THE OTHER, YOU KNOW,
THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON, WE

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:25.705 align:start position:0% line:91%
GAVE THOSE WHO WISHED TO DESTROY
SPACE TO DO THAT AS WELL. 

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME?

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:35.781 line:91%
