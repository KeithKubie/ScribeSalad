00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.250
The famous image of a comic book superhero
may look like a circus strongman in tights

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.490
and a cape, but muscles aren't the only way
to be powerful. Sometimes, the answer lies

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.300
in magic, science-fiction, or an alien world.
The question being: how does a comic book

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.440
character become the most powerful in the
world? Here are Screen Rant's 10 Most Powerful

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.710
Superheroes From Marvel and DC.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.370
Sentry
Modern comic fans may know Captain America

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.880
like the back of their hand, but it's another
Marvel super-soldier who takes the cake. The

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.680
being known as Sentry is absolutely one of
the most powerful characters in the Marvel

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.519
Universe, which means fans should all know
him, even if he hasn't appeared on film. Said

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.519
to hold the power of "a million exploding
suns," strong enough to fight the Hulk to

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.750
a standstill, and blessed with telepathy,
immortality, and even the ability to resurrect

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.890
the dead, there isn't much Sentry can't do.
In fact, he may be one of the truly invincible

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.430
characters in Marvel's entire universe.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.140
Jean Grey
There's no shortage of psychics in Marvel's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
catalogue, so being the best of them is saying
something. That honor *probably* goes to Jean

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.780
Grey, the fifth member of the original X-Men.
The live-action movies only scratched the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.130
surface of Jean's powers, since her decades
in print have shown her do just about anything

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.030
a mind can achieve: mind-reading, mind control,
telekinetic barriers, force fields, you name

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.700
it. And that's even before she unlocks full
access to the cosmic Phoenix Force - it may

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.609
make her a bit more villainous, but the power
it grants over the universe as a whole is

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.360
testament to Jean's dedication and focus.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.119
Cable
When Cyclops sent his son into the future

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.259
for protection, he never imagined that full-grown
powerhouse that would return. With a techno-organic

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.149
virus turning him into a cyborg tank, completely
with robotic arm and eye, Christopher Summers

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.909
took the name of Cable, and made time travel
his stomping grounds. As the son of Cyclops

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.060
and Jean Grey, he has the telekinetic and
psychic powers to be hoped for. But add in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.539
futuristic upgrades, superhuman strength and
reflexes, and a style that's just too badass

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.230
to be killed, and Marvel's baddest have all
failed to pushed Cable around. The only one

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.430
who's come close? Would have to be Deadpool.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.040
Shazam
We know what you'e thinking: it's Superman

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.599
who has to be DC's strongest hero, right?
Not necessarily. Superman was first, but with

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.870
updates and imitators came some serious upgrades.
Take Shazam, formerly known as Captain Marvel.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.010
All the powers, all the strength, all the
speed and invulnerability of Superman, but

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.170
drawn straight from the magical gods of the
ancient world. That basically means that the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.269
champion of the old gods can go toe-to-toe
with Superman, and actually hurt him (since

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.150
the Man of Steel, like most alien villains,
is vulnerable to magic). Not to mention being

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.320
fast enough to challenge The Flash, and not
needing to eat or sleep while in his superhero

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.290
form. Something almost no other heroes can
claim.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.250
Martian Manhunter
He may be best known as a Justice League member,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.549
but make no mistake: when you combine the
best parts of Batman and Superman, you get

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.549
a hero who might be as cool as J'onn J'onzz.
Based on superpowers alone, he's as powerful

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.659
as they come: psychic, telekinetic, able to
fly, and use nearly all of Superman's special

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.159
attacks. While also able to phase through
solid objects, and give the Dark Knight competition

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.019
when it comes to detective skills.

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.099
Firestorm
As one of the most famous superhero identites

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.099
who actually consist of&nbsp;two&nbsp;men in a single
form, Firestorm, the Nuclear Man draws his

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.750
powers from experimental physics as a whole.
He may not have the name recognition of other

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.680
Leaguers, but his appearance on The CW has
helped gain some cred. As far as his powers

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.549
go, he is able to manipulate all inorganic
matter in the universe. Transmute stone into

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.130
gold, turn a nuclear bomb into a cake, or
absorb the blast of a nuclear weapon are just

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.849
a regular weekday for this hero, even if it's
only the voice of the scientist in his head

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.260
that's giving him direction.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.670
Storm
Her power might not be as&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;gratifying

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.219
as Cyclops', but Ororo Munroe's mastery of
nature makes her one of the most determined

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.520
Omega-Level Mutants ever written. It isn't
just the weather, either: the comics have

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.650
shown Storm doing everything from changing
humidity in the air around the world, launching

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.250
concentrated lightning strikes, hailstorms,
gusts of hurricane wind capable of granting

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.970
her flight, and Storm is one movie heroine
who deserves a far better role than she got.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.870
Superman
We couldn't leave the Man of Steel out in

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.460
the cold, since he's easily DC's biggest icon,
and a representative of comics as a whole.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.670
By now, nobody needs to be told how his alien
skin renders him bulletproof to most attacks

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:53.940
- except magical - or how he flies from one
emergency to the next. But no matter how busy

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.040
or convoluted his stories have been over the
years, it's hard to argue the charm of a Greek

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.350
demigod like Superman in our midst.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.170
The Flash
It might sound like running really fast would

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.980
get old quickly, but Barry Allen's comic book
powers are on another level. When you have

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.330
the superhuman speed to casually stroll past
almost-frozen people beside you, it's hard

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.190
to think of a superpower that couldn't just
be faked using the same strategy. But that

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.290
was before Barry Allen realized he had the
speed to travel to distant worlds, or even

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.000
back in time. And for all the muscles and
alien physiology to choose from, a hero who

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.250
can rewrite time in the blink of an eye is
as powerful as they come.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.901
Doctor Strange
Imagine if Harry Potter was a grown man, and

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.510
well-trained in martial arts? Now picture
it a whole lot cooler, and you've got a rough

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.660
idea of why Doctor Stephen Strange is basically
just that. Having learned the ways of mystic

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.690
magic, martial arts, and claimed the title
of 'Sorcerer Supreme' for himself, it's true

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.190
that Strange relies on amulets and symbols
for power, not his powers or mutation. But

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.530
he's been referred to as the most powerful
human on Earth - so magic wands, necklaces,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.850
or orbs aside, Strange is the heavyweight
hitter of Marvels' supernatural side. Here's

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.950
hoping it makes it to the big screen soon.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.910
Those are some of the most powerful superheroes
from Marvel and DC that we love, but which

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.120
ones have we missed? Let us know in the comments,
