00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:08.840
Okay so we’re a month behind in meme time,
but we know goats crave that mineral but why

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.560
do we crave anything?

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.810
Cravings are a strange phenomena and it’s
not just pregnant women who get them.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.001
folk wisdom says that craving a mineral means
you have some mineral deficiency.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:27.130
But let’s be real here, if that worked then
we would all crave healthy foods rather than

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.730
mac and cheese and chocolate.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.830
Recently, researchers from the Picower Institute
for Learning and Memory

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.129
looked at sugar cravings in mice to see what
was going on in the brain.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.050
They looked at the relationship between the
the ventral tegmental area which is the brain’s

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.670
natural reward processing center and the lateral
hypothalamus which is responsible for feeding.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.690
They used a technique called optogenetics.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.389
This process uses light to trigger light sensitive
proteins that can activate or silence a set

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:53.000
of neurons that connect these two parts of
the brain.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
When activated, the mice stuffed their faces
with sweetness and overate even when they

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960
weren’t hungry.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
When silenced, the mice still ate regular
food when they were hungry, but they no longer

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.440
compulsively ate the sugar.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.930
This indicated that the neural circuit for
sugar cravings is a different circuit than

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960
the one that regulates healthy eating.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.850
Mice aside, for us most cravings start with
a cue.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.530
Think of Pavlov’s dogs.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.579
Something happens that just gets our mouth
watering.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.180
Like dreaming of your mom’s roast beef as
soon as you land back in your hometown or

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.270
craving ice cream on a hot summer day.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.390
Another cue for most people is stress, which
can trigger cravings for comfort food.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.600
We crave chocolate during hormonal fluctuations,
not for any biological reason.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.260
We’ve just come to associate the chocolate
with comfort during a pretty uncomfortable

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.530
time of the month.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
Cravings feel so strong because they are so
vivid in the mind.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.350
The very act of craving a food, not just being
hungry and wanting to eat, but craving something

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.570
specific like ice cream or chocolate, conjures
up images in the brain, which uses up cognitive

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.570
resources.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.010
One study showed that those who craved chocolate
did worse on memory and math problems.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.749
We can literally distract ourselves with our
cravings.

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.049
We typically crave high-caloric foods, stuffed
with fat and sugar, because they were a rarity

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.009
in our evolutionary past.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.630
We evolved a reward system associated with
these foods.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.720
When we eat sweets our brain kicks off a cascade
of chemistry, feel good hormones like dopamine

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.690
and serotonin flood our system, giving us
a bit of a sugar high.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.580
So when we’re stressed and need a bit of
a pick me up, we turn to these foods.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.400
While we all crave something at some point
in our lives, unusual cravings might be a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.670
sign of an underlying medical condition.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.670
Craving salt?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.970
You might have addison’s disease.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.130
Addison’s disease degrades the endocrine
system leading to electrolyte imbalances.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.680
The adrenal glands don’t make enough cortisol
and AL DOSS TER OWN aldosterone.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.330
Aldosterone helps the body hold on to the
salt it needs.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.280
When you don’t make enough of it, you can
get an unusually strong desire to eat salty

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.280
things.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.380
Craving chalk? or paint chips?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.080
You might have Pica, named from the Latin
for Magpie, because of the belief magpies’lll

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.500
eat anything.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.800
Pica is the bizarre behavior of eating things
like clay, chalk, soap, dirt, or rocks.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.230
Scientists think a lack of nutrients might
cause this craving maybe because of an iron

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.770
deficiency, celiacs disease or hookworm.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.810
Mental health related illness like OCD or
schizophrenia might also lead someone to chow

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.880
down on chalk.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.240
