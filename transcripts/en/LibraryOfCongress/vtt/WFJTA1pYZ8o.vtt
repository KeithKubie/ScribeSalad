00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.930
and thank you all so
very much for coming.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.540
It's a very special occasion today,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.000
and we have a very exciting
program ahead of us.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.810
So I am delighted that
we're able to be now here.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.490
And I would like before I start
to recognize the [inaudible],

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.220
who is here with us
and who has been one

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.200
of our speakers many
-- a few years ago.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.780
And I hope he will come again.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.990
And Princess Masente [phonetic],
and Princess Zeble [phonetic],

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.070
who are both here as well, who have
joined us for this presentation,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.200
a presentation which is very
special on the imperial exile

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.850
of Emperor Haile Selassie.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.620
And this program is part of
the programs that we have

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.970
when we invite speakers, scholars
to tell us about the history

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.330
of the countries that we
are responsible for here

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.980
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.030 position:56%
Ethiopia is one of the very
special countries for this division.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.880
We have a specialist just for
Ethiopia, and he, Fantahun Tiruneh,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.770
has collected materials, and built
a recollection at the Library

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.560
of Congress, which is one of the
top collections in the world.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.350
And we often have many scholars,
researchers from all over the world

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.150
who come to consult
these collections.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.110
And so this division -- I
always make a little commercial

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.570
for our division, because our
division is the African Middle

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.870
East Division.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.360
It is responsible for 78
countries around the world.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.020
And our collections
are in the vernacular.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.430
They are housed, preserved in our
stacks, which are closed stacks,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.830
and which we use to
serve our patrons

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.630
and our researchers as they come.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.840
These countries that
we're responsible for,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.490
or whose collections
we're responsible for,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.440
come from the whole continent of
Africa, north and Sub-Saharan.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.690
They come from the Middle East,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.350
including the Arab
world, Turkey and Iran.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.240
They include the Hebraic
world, which is very broad

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.810
because those connections
come from all over the world.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.070
They also include central
Asia and the caucuses.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.310
And our work here is to serve
our patrons and our researchers,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.920 position:56%
not only by recommending collections

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.130
by pulling the books
off the shelves,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.680
by letting them know
what treasures we have,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.250
but also by having displays,
exhibits, programs, conferences,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.640
briefings, especially
one-on-one briefings.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.580
We receive visitors
from all over the world

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.010
who come to use our materials.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.940 position:56%
We work with different universities,
government agencies and others.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.290
And I'm leaving the best for
last, we invite scholars,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.490
and we invite authors and
writers to come and tell us

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.540
about their research,
about their work,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.910
about the collections they have
used, and about the stories

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.420
from the countries that
we're responsible for.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.310
It is they who make those
collections come alive,

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.020
through their own experiences,
through their photographs,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.180
through the works that they have
done, and through their own passion

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.310
for the countries they
have written about.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.950
And so we have a case
in point today.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.420
We have Keith Bowers, a
BBC writer and author,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.750
who has written an exceptional
book, "Imperial Exile:

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.580
Emperor Haile Selassie
in Britain," 1936-1940.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.130
The book will be available
for purchase later on.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.210 position:56%
And now I want to introduce our own,
Fantahun Tiruneh, the specialist

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.180
for Ethiopia and Eritrea, who
is a librarian, a scholar,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.540
and who has singlehandedly built an
Ethiopian collection at the Library

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.450
to be one of the best in the
United States and in the world.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.290
So Fantahun will introduce
the speaker.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.090
Thank you.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.300
[ Applause ]

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.170
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh:
Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.160
Ladies and gentlemen, I
once again welcome you

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.170
to our beautiful reading room
for this tremendous event.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.760
And personally I'm very,
very happy for today's event,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.460
because it has drawn
a lot of scholars

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.540
that I have met for so many years.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:11.980
And some of my teachers, such as
Dr. Mulugeta [phonetic], are here.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.420
And very good friends
that I have lost

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.960
for some time have shown up today.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.680
And I especially recognize Princess
Masente, Princess Zeble, and Dr. --

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.960
Prince Emias [phonetic], for
making themselves available today

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.320
for this event.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.590
And I am very grateful
to David Reta [phonetic],

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.350
who has made the important
connection between me

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.580
and Keith Bowers, our guest today.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.160
Before I go into introducing
today's guest,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.780 position:56%
I'd like to make an announcement
that this event is being videotaped,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.070
and later broadcast on the
Library's webcast and other media.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.760
There will be a formal question and
answer period after the lecture,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.330 position:56%
in which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.140
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.540
and later broadcasted
as part of this event.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.890 position:56%
By participating in the question and
answer period, you are consenting

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.090
to the Library's possible
reproduction

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.380
and transmission of your remarks.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.260
With that said, I would
also like to inform you

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.500
that the book signing will take
place in this very room right

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.110
after Mr. Bowers' presentation.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.460
I now will introduce our guest.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.780
Mr. Keith Bowers is a former BBC
executive producer, a writer,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.490
an international broadcast
correspondent.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.710 position:56%
At the BBC Mr. Bowers ran two
international television documentary

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.020
series, assignments and
correspondent, and at one stage was

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.270
in charge of all the BBC's
international current affairs

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.240
outputs on television, domestic,
radio, and world service.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.800
He worked for 20 years for the BBC.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.840
For nine months in 2014, he
was based in Washington, DC,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.880
working as an executive
producer for Al Jazeera.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.080 position:56%
He has also taught journalism to
students at a number of universities

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.220
around the world, including
[inaudible] University,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.800
City University in London,
and New York University.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.450
Mr. Bowers has worked extensively
in Ethiopia over the past 15 years.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.110
He has taught in the School of
Journalism and Communication

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.840
at [inaudible] University,
and I'm glad to announce

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.500 position:56%
that Avi Fort [phonetic], my best --

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.330
my good friend, was the dean
when Mr. Bowers was a lecturer

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:09.830
at the university, and has worked
with young documentary makers

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.540
as part of the Ethiopian
Field Initiative.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.630
He is the author of two books,
his first book, "Viewing History,"

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.910
which is an eyewitness account
of key movements of change,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:29.270
and "Imperial Exile," of course the
one that we are discussing today.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.940
Mr. Keith Bowers is based
in the United Kingdom

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.760
as a broadcast consultant, and
now lives in the city of Bath.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.510
Please welcome Keith Bowers.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:44.010
[ Applause ]

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.310
&gt;&gt; Keith Bowers: [Speaks
Foreign Language].

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:51.510
[Laughter] Welcome to everybody.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:58.850
[ Speaks Foreign Language ]

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.370
So it's a great pleasure and honor
to be here in this wonderful,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.680
marvelous, inspiring building.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.270
When I was in Washington in 2014, I
came here and was inspired to study

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.950
and learn, just by the
walls and the books.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.030
It's a fantastic place to be.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.470
It's great also to have
friends, and colleagues,

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:27.050
and members of the emperor's
family as well, and especially

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.470
to Princess Zeble, who helped
me in the writing of this book.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.200
We had two interview sessions
at Annandale, and we also met

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.980
on Kings Road in Chelsea.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.120
So we're meeting again
in a different place.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.560
And it's a pleasure to
meet Prince Emias as well.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.080
We communicated by
e-mail, and the princess,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.970
his mother too, it's
great to meet you.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.840
And Abby Ford and David Greta, and
I have some friends I worked with,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.290
Josh and Cody, when I was here,
and thank you so much for coming.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.110
It's rather appropriate, I
think, that we're talking

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.150
about His Imperial
Majesty, the emperor

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.760
and his exile period
in the United States.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.150
But the story I'm telling
happened in Britain primarily.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.400
But there were many links between
the emperor and the United States.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.660
As you know, he met President
Roosevelt in 1944 at Bitter Late

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.470
on a destroyer, and was
the first African leader

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.400
to have a tickertape
reception on Broadway,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.710
where more than a million
people turned up to welcome him.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.760
And, of course, there were
links with the Americans

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.110
with the Foundation of Ethiopian
Airlines, which is now one

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.760
of the most successful
airlines in Africa,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.210
that was instigated
with American help.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.510
So there are many links.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.810
And I learned yesterday, excitedly,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:56.480
that the emperor also visited
the Library of Congress.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.890 position:56%
And lurking somewhere in these ogost
[phonetic] buildings is actually a

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:07.350
hand-drawn map by his Imperial
majesty, 1921, a map of Ethiopia

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:12.120
and it's in store here
somewhere, so yes.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.650
But that's not the subject
of the lecture today.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.500
That's a different
lecture, the relationship

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.160
between America and Ethiopia.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.460
Today we're going to be talking

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.700
about His Imperial
Majesty's exile time in Bath.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:36.830 position:56%
And the way I'm going to do this is
look at why did he end up in Britain

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.360 position:56%
in the first place, what happened to
him while he was there in the 1930s,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.480
and then how did he come to leave?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.780
It's a big story.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.340
And, of course, the emperor was
in power for many, many years,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.350
so we're not touching on a lot
of the aspects of his reign.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.640
We're just focusing on
the exile experience.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.820
Why was I interested in this?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.120
Well, I think first of all,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.960
the exile experience is a
universal human condition.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.410
Throughout history, people
have been refugees forced

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.960
from their countries.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.850
And today, as we know, this
is a very commonplace thing.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:22.050 position:56%
So I was very excited to look at
this through the eyes of one person,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.950
what was it like to be in exile?

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.430 position:56%
Of course, as we know the background
to this, the emperor came to Britain

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:36.580
in 1936 after Italy had invaded
Ethiopia a few months before.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.440
So this was a time of war
and international aggression,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.580
all issues of collective
security and peace,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.360
and having to protect the weak
from the strong, and the powerful,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.120
all of these are relevant.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.910
But most of all, I
wanted to write this story

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.960
because it's a fascinating story.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.190
It's a mingling of two cultures,
two countries at an incredible time

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.620
in world history, the 1930s.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.590
And I think thank you to the
Library of Congress for inviting me

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.100
and I think, as Fenta said,
I live in Bath myself,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.800
which is why I wanted to write
this book, because that's

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.750
where the emperor lived for
most of his time in Britain.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.760
And Bath itself is a
fascinating historical city.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.040
Anyway, now we're going
to have a few slides.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.280
I hope I can operate them.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.010
You know the old joke about
President Ford that could he walked

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.640
down the streets and chew
gum down at the same time,

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.720
I'm now going to test
whether I can speak

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.260
and operate this at the same time.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.930 position:56%
[Inaudible], we'll see what happens.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.650
So the picture you have in front
of you here is one of my favorites.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.190 position:56%
I don't know whether you've ever
seen this one before; probably taken

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:01.930 position:56%
around the 1930s of the emperor on a
hunting party with two of his sons.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.700
And the wonderful train,
the [inaudible],

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.310
on the French-built railway line
from Djibouti to Addis Ababa,

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.710
which incidentally, the
route has been built --

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.010
a new railway has been
built by the Chinese.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.870
So there will be a super-duper
fast link between Djibouti

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.050
and Addis Ababa fairly soon.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.150
This one, though, was this
wonderful narrow gauge train.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.080 position:56%
And we're going to be mentioning a
little bit about the train later on.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.250
So for those of you not familiar
with the history of Ethiopia,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.380
think of a map, top-right, Horn
of Africa, next to Sudan, Kenya,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:44.420
Djibouti, Somalia, that's where
Ethiopia is, in the 1930s,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.430
a very different place
to what it is now.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:54.930
And the emperor came to power
in his coronation in 1930.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.100
But before that, he'd
been in power for 14 years

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.410
as crown prince and prince regent.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.120
So he was not inexperienced
in domestic

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.440
and international affairs;
far from it.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:13.300
But in 1930 around the
time of this photograph,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.500
he had a massive coronation
in Addis Ababa.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.980
Guests came all over the world, he
was announced on the world stage,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.600
he was on the front
cover of Time Magazine.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.350
Ethiopia had announced
itself to the world,

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.480
and people were beginning
to take interest.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.070
So this is a backdrop
to the early '30s.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.950
Within a few years, of course,

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.320
he finds himself manning
an antiaircraft gun

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.220
in the north of Ethiopia.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.170
The Italians invaded in 1985;
why, Mussolini wanted a colony,

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:52.430
a fascist flag waving exercise.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.420
He wanted to show his power,
and so he just invaded.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.910
The Italians, of course,
were also smarting very much

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.870
after they were defeated at
the Battle of Adwa in 1896,

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.200
the first African army
to beat a European one.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.130
And the Italians were
still very sore about that.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:19.030
And the Empress Father, of course,
fought in that battle in 1896.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:25.180
In 1935, 1936, it was a
bit of a difficult battle.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:33.180 position:56%
The Ethiopian army was out-gunned,
out-maneuvered, had worst equipment.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.670
And so soon, the emperor had
to retreat to Addis Ababa,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:43.500 position:56%
and in a historic occasion statement
decision, he left Addis Ababa

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.260 position:56%
for the coast to escape his
country, and to appeal to the League

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.830
of Nations, which Ethiopia
had joined in 1923,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.640
quite an internationalist move.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.640
The Italians had supported this
move after the initial reluctance.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.000
UK government, of course,
opposed it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.710
We'll see this as something
of a theme.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.630
I have to apologize
for my government

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.280
in the 1930s, but there we go.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:15.530
And so he had a council of
ministers, and they decided, "Yes;

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.350
let's promote the case of
Ethiopia at the League of Nations."

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.830
The emperor goes there in person
and he can be a figure head

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.800
of the opposition to
the Italian occupation,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.000
and he could speak up for Ethiopia.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.040
So he decided to leave, going
against thousands of years

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.200
of Ethiopian history where kings
and rulers either died in battle,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.660 position:56%
or on some occasions, even committed
suicide rather than be captured.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.910
So this was a modern
decision, you might say.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.040
It's an extraordinary story we
don't have time to go into today

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.440
of how the emperor and his family
left Addis Ababa on a train

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.220
like we saw, worried about Italian
bombers maybe attacking them.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:07.880
And they went to the Port of
Djibouti where a British ship ended

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.500
up had been arranged
to pick them up.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.180
Now, the catching of
the ship, which goes --

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.320
to those of you who
are "Star Trek" fans,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.810
the name of this boat
was "HMS Enterprise."

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.620
And believe it or not,
there was a captain's log.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.960
Captain Morgan kept a
log, which I have read

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.040
in the queue national archives
in the UK, an extraordinary diary

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.930
of this event, of picking up --

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.100
he was told to expect
12 guests, 12 visitors.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.200
When he arrived and when he saw
the [inaudible] side at Djibouti,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.320
he found 150 people, more than
100 cases of [inaudible] dollars,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:50.660
that was the currency they used in
those days, the European currency,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.840
two lions, a dog, a
Cadillac, a Buick,

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:01.260 position:56%
and a lots of people running around,
saying they needed to escape.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.700
So after much negotiating
and discussion,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.920
it was agreed he would
take 50 people.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.080
The lions didn't make
it onboard, the dog did,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.950
the cases of [inaudible],
they made it onboard as well.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.880
And an extraordinary journey as the
boat went up through the Red Sea,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.420 position:56%
people on the shore would follow the
ship by motorbike, other boats came

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:36.560
after it, and he eventually landed
in Haifa in what is now known

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.390
as Israel, and went to Jerusalem.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.230
While he was on that ship,
according to the captain's log,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.510
there was much discussion
between British naval authorities

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.030
and the emperor as to
where he should go.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.060
It seems pretty clear he'd had some
injuries in the war in the North

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.810
with some poisoned gas
injuries, and he was --

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.890
he was thought at one stage to
go for treatment in Germany.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.780
The empress wanted
to go to Jerusalem

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.230
to join the Ethiopian
community there.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.080
But there were discussions about
the emperor coming to Britain.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.700
Now, the British government
was like many governments,

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.400
torn between showing interest
and doing the right thing,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.110
and being open to what
should happen.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.620
The big issue was they didn't want
to upset the Italian government.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.750
They thought Mussolini
might go towards Hitler,

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.740
which of course, he eventually did.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.370 position:56%
But they didn't want that to happen.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.490
But equally they knew that
Ethiopia had suffered injustice,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.000
had been invaded, and the public
opinion in Britain was keen

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.200
that the Ethiopians were supported.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.790
So they tried to have it both ways.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.180
They said he could come,
but he could only come

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.280
under certain conditions, only
bring a small party of diplomats,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.840
and that he couldn't engage
in political activity;

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.990
and that he couldn't be
given an official welcome.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.470
So this is the captain's
log, by the way.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:04.030
It does exist, five pages of
sheer historical amazement.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.500
Here is the emperor.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.530
See, I'm already failing; I
haven't been able to chew gum

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.830
and walk down the street.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.870
Here he is in Jerusalem,
these wonderful photos.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.410
And here he is in Gibraltar
on the way to the UK.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.290
He was given British naval
protection until Gibraltar,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.180
and then the government
said, "No; you can't arrive

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.720
on British shores on
a British ship."

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.620
So he had to transfer to a
civilian passenger liner.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.520
Such are the [inaudible]
international diplomacy.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.980
Here he is arriving.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.720
I'm sure some of you here know some

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.200
of these other figures
in these photographs.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.040
Some of you here will know a lot
more about this history than I do.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.220
So apologies for my -- if
I make any mistakes here.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.040
So but here he is at Southampton,

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.600
arriving on the wonderful
Orient Line.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.860
So that's why he ended
up in Britain,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.070
to get away from the Italians,
to use it as a base to speak

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.720
to the League of Nations
in Switzerland.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.890
And of course, Britain then
was a major world power,

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.760
and it was a good base to
have to manage to do some sort

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.960
of politic [inaudible], but I would
say under the counter, as it were.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.230
The emperor gets to London.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.890
Here is the reception from
the British people; big crowd.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:33.470
This is Princess Gate near
Harrods in [inaudible] Bridge,

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.240
very convenient for shopping,
but just opposite Hyde Park.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.420
It's actually just up
the road from here is

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.490
where the current Ethiopian
Embassy is as well.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.670
And keeping the American connection
going, JFK lived somewhere

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.470
on this street when
he was a student.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.770
So look at the reception here.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.510
This is -- oh from the top,
but you can see the balcony

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.120
where the Royal Family were.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.600
And it caused major attention.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.970
This was big news in Britain

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.060
and around the world,
the Italian invasion.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.060
And, of course, as we
saw, it actually --

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.730
some people argue was the
start of the Second World War.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.030
You can make that case.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.970
So it was a big international news,
and he was big news in the UK.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.560
Here it is, I love this photo of
the old London taxi being greeted

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.160
by what's his face, Anthony Eden,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.870
the British foreign secretary
at the time, Lord Avon.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:41.730
Note the bowler hat has
already sort of assimilated some

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.370
of sort of British culture.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.360
And if I was doing another
book, I would do the hat wear,

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.650
the headgear of His
Imperial Majesty,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.940
because seeing what he wears
at different times of his life

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.800
and during this exile
period, it tells you a lot.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.440
Anyway, here he is.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.190
Here is Anthony Eden.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.230
Anthony Eden was fairly
pro-Ethiopia.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.990
The prime minister at that time,
Baldwin, was more ambivalent,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:12.940
and his predecessor --
one of his successors,

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.710
[inaudible] Chamberlain was
less inclined towards Ethiopia.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.670
Suddenly Baldwin himself
was embarrassed about --

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.710
he wanted to welcome the
emperor, but he didn't want

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.110
to be seen to be welcoming him.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.870
And the emperor was taken on a
tour of the House of Westminster,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.100
the parliament on the
banks of the Thames.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.820
He went in there to the tea room.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.700
Lo and behold, the [inaudible]
Baldwin is at the end of the room.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.020
And when he sees the emperor,

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.900
he dives under a table
to avoid seeing him.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:48.400
[Laughter] So actually it's British
diplomacy; we're very good at it.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.120
And they also changed the
route of his motorcade

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.020
so he couldn't be received by
a lot of cheering supporters.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.130
So there was the ambivalence
that he survived

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.650
in for the next four
years in actual fact.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.300
But the people were
very, very supportive,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.390
and the people of Bath especially.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:17.190
Of course, its base in Europe
was to go to the League

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:22.750
of Nations in Geneva in June, 1936.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.930
Some people say this was the
best speech he ever gave.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.280
Some the Italian journalists
before it started tried

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.090
to drown him out with whistles.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.270
Mussolini had put them up to this.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.990
They didn't want him
to have a platform.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.770
They said, "Well, we are
now the rulers of Ethiopia.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.390
Why is he there?"

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.000
But anyway, eventually,
they were thrown out.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.180
A Romanian delegate,
[inaudible], got up and said --

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.660
forgive my French here,
"[Speaks Foreign Language],"

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.760
"Let's get rid of these savages."

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.640
And they were duly thrown out.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.430
[Inaudible], though, his government
thought they embarrassed them,

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.230
and he was sent into exile
after this, apparently.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.030
Amazing times, the 1930s.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.590
So anyway, he made a speech

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.500
and everybody nodded their head
accentually and said, "Yes;

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.150
Italian aggression very bad."

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.120
But within a week, the League

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.910
of Nations had actually lifted
sanctions against Italy,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.850
and so his speech fell
on deaf ears essentially.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.850
So suddenly it was dawning on
the emperor that he might be

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.530
out of his country
for some time; indeed,

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.960
maybe he might never get back.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.160
Because that's what we have to do,
we have to suspend our knowledge

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.990
of what happened in rest
of the 20th century.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.910
This story -- we have to see
through the emperor's eyes.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.860
He had no idea when
he would get back.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.500
And of course, he did.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.540
But it could have been different.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.700
The areas where some of his
aides and advisors, [inaudible].

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.630
He goes back to the UK, and
people like making statues of him.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:11.640
This is by Hilda Seligman, who
he stayed with in Wimbledon.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.950
She was a sculptress.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.890 position:56%
It's now in Cannizaro Park, and when
I took this photo about a year ago,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:23.110 position:56%
it was restored a few years ago, but
it needs probably restoring again.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.810
The emperor, believe it or not,
entered into British cultural life.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.710
I looked through many
reports about his time there.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.510
He was a favorite for a costume
at many fancy dress parties

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.570
that Britain had, [inaudible]
of Britain.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.450
People would go dressed
as Emperor Haile Selassie.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:47.560
He was in the fashion pages
for his capes and shawls.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.420
And there's a wonderful --
at the same time in 1936,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:29:00.880
this is by Epstein, the American
British sculptor; wonderful.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.060
And another here I like
here by a Serbian sculptor.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.850
So he was still famous, and people
were still following what he was

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.150
up to.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.810
This is Bath Abbey.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.110
Why did he go to Bath?

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.670
Well, it seems he went, first
of all, just for a rest.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.800
He'd been at war, he'd
been to Europe,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.230
under a lot of stress and strain.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.970
Someone recommended that he go
to Bath in the west of Britain,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:32.340
100 miles west of London,
a spa city, a Roman city.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.510
And the irony of that,
turning up in an Italian city,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.380
having fled from the Italians.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.760
Also, a famous city for its
18th century architecture;

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.180
people come from all
over the world to see it.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.650
This would have been
the view from the train.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.960
He went on the train built

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:59.330
by the wonderful British
engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.180
The line is still going
today strong.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.640
On this site in 973
AD, the first king

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.860
of all England was crowned king.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.040
So quite an auspicious place.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:20.760
This is not my house, [laughter],
neither is it the emperor's house.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.740
This is the wonderful royal
present, Palladian architecture,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.310
balanced proportion
harmony, [inaudible].

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.110
You'll see it there.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.410
[Inaudible].

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:37.470 position:56%
So the wonderful Marlboro buildings,

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.690
His Imperial Majesty took
his dog for a walk near here.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.980
He was being spotted
here definitely.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:50.120
So these wonderful buildings; one
of the few bridges in the world,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.270
Pulteney Bridge that
has working shops on it.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.180
When he first came to Bath,
the emperor, in August 1936,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.040
this would have been
the route to the hotel.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.220
He stayed in a hotel,
first of all, for a month.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.560
He wasn't going to settle there,
he just came for some leave,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.880
and some rest and recuperation.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.840
And you see these elegant
-- this is the canal,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.080
but it's not the Manchester
Ship Canal.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.740
This is a sort of elegant
[inaudible] canal,

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.970
very close to the hotel
where he stayed.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:29.440
The Bath Spa Hotel where the
emperor, his three eldest children,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:36.150
one or two advisors stayed for
the month they were in Bath.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.970
This was state-in-the-art
in those days.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.260
It had 100 rooms, 60 with hot and
cold running water, an orchestra,

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.790
a ballroom, and several
acres of grounds.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.970
And the emperor made
quite a stir there.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.810 position:56%
So that his daughter, Princess Sahai
[phonetic] one day at the ballroom,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.780
she was invited to dance by
a young English gentleman;

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.120
she was 16 or 17 at the time.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.250
One of the emperor's
advisors, Dr. Bian [phonetic],

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.800
who eventually ended up living in
America, was worried about this

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.190
and said to her, "Princess, I
think it's maybe time for bed."

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.100
And she was with a British lady,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.200
and the British lady said,
"Oh, come on, it's fine.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.500
I'll look after her.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.800
It's no problem."

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.060 position:56%
Dr. Bian went off to see the emperor
said, "Your daughter's dancing

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.380
with this young English gentleman.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.610
And apparently the
emperor just laughed,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:31.940
fine he wasn't that
worried about it.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.010
[Laughter] And in May when I had
the British version of the book,

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.020
we had an event to
celebrate 80th anniversary

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.590
of His Imperial Majesty's
arrival in Bath.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.920
And we dug out this
iconic photograph

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.220
with the then mayor of Bath.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.720
A day after he arrived, August
the 5th or 6th, the mayor of Bath,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.800
James Carpenter, they stood on
the steps of the Bath Spa Hotel.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.180
I have a friend who used to
be in the army and he said,

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.480
"What is the emperor carrying?

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.780
I'm going to read that."

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.030
And he's been studying it in
microscopes, but he hasn't been

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.810
yet able to discover what it is.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.460
I think it's probably a postcard.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.430
So 80 years later, we
had a wonderful event;

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.910
over 100 people came.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.590
The high sheriff of Somerset,
the local NP, the local head

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:22.780
of the council, some people
who were in Bath alive

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.950
at the time the emperor was there,
and we recreated this photograph.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:32.280
This is Prince Michael, one
of the emperor's grandsons,

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.310
and this is the great
niece of the mayor of Bath.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.240
So we recreated this history.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.340
So it's living history,
as indeed we are today.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.120
Princess Zeble was actually --

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.590
not at this time, she came
to Bath a year after this.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.810
She was in Jerusalem at the time,
and then came a little bit later.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.820
But we are -- you know, we have
in the audience, someone who lived

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.120
through this exile period.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.700 position:56%
He was very well-received everywhere
he went in Bath at this time.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.690
These are not Nazi salutes,
I think people are --

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.920
it's just the greeting
that people had.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.380
[Laughter] So he went to the
royal bath for some treatment.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.440
And I've seen in the book,

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.470
he had Tivoli [phonetic]
treatment, whatever that is.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:22.120
I haven't been able to
discover what that is, but --

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.340
and behind him in the
beret is Princess Sahai.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.690
And he was offered the chance to
escape in secret and said, "No;

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.060
I'll come out in the front."

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.460
And so he was well-received.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.700
People were pleased to see him.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.330
And he went on a tour of Bath.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.590
Of course, being the lion
of Judah, he liked lions.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.160
And actually the city
of Bath likes lions.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.890
It's on the coat of arms.

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:52.910
There are many -- more than 500
statues of lions in Bath itself.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:55.780
This is one of them at
the Royal Victoria Park.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.850
And this may be one of the
reasons why the emperor maybe felt

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.150
at home in Bath.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.390
It's quite a royal,
elegant, regal city.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.600
The people give him
a good reception.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.810
He was beginning to realize he
may not go back soon to Ethiopia.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.900
He was running out of hard cash.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.480
His advisor said, "You
can't afford to keep living

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.110
in all these expensive
hotels and traveling around.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.350
You need to make a base."

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.240
So he maybe thought about
maybe going to Switzerland

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.410
and settling there, but the Swiss
said they didn't want them there;

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.480
they were neutral, and
next door to Italy.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.450
And so he decided to
stay in Britain.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.500
London was a possibility, but
maybe too close to the government.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.600
So Bath became suddenly
a real possibility,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:44.210
because of its royal heritage,
pleasant place, only two hours

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.390
on the train from London so
you could still get to London.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.840
Property was cheaper
there, of course.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.580
And it was a convivial
place to be, maybe.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.530
And so this is empress
with him here.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.880
By October 1936, they bought
a house and they bring some

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.500
of the rest of the family.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:10.600
This is the house, Fairfield House,
actually an Italianate villa,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.960
another irony, built around
1850, two acres of grounds,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:23.930 position:56%
some big bedrooms, but not a palace;
I mean, just a big family house.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.550
They are the royal couple.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:34.620
We think this is the outbuildings
of Fairfield house in Bath,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.170
and probably taken in 1937, 1938.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.410
Some of you will know
some of these people.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:46.060
I'm sorry to say Princess Zeble
-- the photographer was very bad,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.540
so she's at the bottom
with half her head cut off.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.840
Apologies.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.600
They wouldn't have known all
these years later that --

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.880
and some of these will be
known to you in the family.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.440
So they were there
together as a family.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.190
And, of course, during the summer,
the weather's not bad and so,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.430
you know, you can play some
tennis and table tennis

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.970
and Prince [inaudible]
would go around on his bike.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.970
This is an old photo I dug out.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.860
Sorry for the quality.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.790
This is Princess Ida, another
grandchild, going to school

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:26.620
in Penzance in the
southwest tip of Britain.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.930
So some of the grandchildren came.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:34.020
They had to be looked after, and
educated, and everything else.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.780
Why I've been able to find
some of these photographs is

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.090
that in Britain, we
have the lottery scheme,

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.080
and they put money
into cultural projects.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.480
And they -- in 2012, they put money

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.430
into developing regional
newspaper archive

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:50.300
from the year, I think, 1750.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:55.450 position:56%
Between 1750 and 1949, many regional
newspapers have been put online,

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.050
and they're searchable; incredible.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.670
So you put in "Emperor
Haile Selassie,"

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.500
and all of these entries come up
from the Dundee Evening [inaudible]

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.870
and the Nottingham Evening Post,
which we would have never been able

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.010
to -- I wouldn't have even
known they were there.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.190
But we found all sorts of
things, all sorts of photographs,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.360 position:56%
even the fact that he tried kippers,
if you know what kippers are,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.140
sort of herring, smoky
fish; even tried some

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.670
of those apparently, so we're told.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.280
Because many diary
items were written

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.580
about the emperor and his family.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.880
He was still new.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.210
Some people wanted to
know what he was up to.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:34.590
And in 1936, still had some
cash, so here is a [inaudible].

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.480
In the car is Prince [inaudible].

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.300
I think he's too young to
drive it in the moment,

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.390
but there's the man
from Bath Garages.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.880
The emperor, of course, as you
probably know, he loved gadgets,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.100
and planes, and clocks, and
watches, and cars, [makes sounds].

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:55.210
Now, in the grounds of
the garden, of course,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.790
the Orthodox faith very important.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.640
There was no church --
Orthodox Church in Britain.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.350
What there was, was a greenhouse,
and at the time, the emperor wrote

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.890
to the church in Ethiopia
-- church in Jerusalem,

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:13.660
and arranged for a tabot
[phonetic] or a concentration stone

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.190
to become over to the greenhouse.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.000 position:56%
So they made this into their church.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.200
It no longer stands today, but that
was the couple of priests there,

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.120
and there were services
regularly to pray for the country.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.450
Of course, while the emperor
is there, he's obviously aware

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.120
of what is going on in Ethiopia,
and a lot of the news is very bad.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.330
This is actually on the steps
of Addis Ababa University,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.240
the palace -- it used
to be the palace

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.390
where the emperor set
off from for his exile.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:51.330
This is the Italian
viceroy Graziani.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.920
I taught -- this is a campus,
and I taught on this campus.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:01.200
Here in beginning of 1937, he's
distributing arms to the poor.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.390
But there's a plot to kill him.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.950
Two people throw a bomb,
he's injured a couple

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.590 position:56%
of people are killed, the Italian
army and the Blackshirts go berserk.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:16.630
They mow down hundreds of
beggars, and women, and children,

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:23.630
and then go on the rampage for
basically four days killing maybe

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.730
as many as 19,000 people
over four days.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.750
And so some terrible times.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.300
This, of course, comes to the
Fairfield house, the news,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.680
the Gloucester Evening Paper,
which is close-by to Bath.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.980
They had an appointment with him,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.880
but they said His Imperial Majesty
had to cancel the appointment

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.140
because of the distressing news.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.890 position:56%
And it was said later in a later
interview he gave a few years later,

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.290
this was the only time his
servants apparently saw him break

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.650
down in front of them.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.540
So terrible news.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.550
You're there on the other
side of the world powerless,

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.870
you can't do anything about it;

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.550
some people have accused
you of running away.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:11.840
And then there was a whole
series of news of people he knew

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.980
who had been killed and murdered.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.450
And this is a service in
London a few weeks later

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.300
with the foreign minister
and [inaudible], his cousin,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.620
and the London representative
for Ethiopia.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.200
Now, of course, some
British people helped him.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.500
Here's another bit
of living history.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.960
This is a tapestry based
on a photograph taken

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.930
by a young boy called
"Richard Pankhurst."

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.100
For those of you who know Ethiopia
and for those in the library

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.510
and studies business, Richard
Pankhurst is the founder

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.310
of the Institute of
Ethiopian Studies.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.220
His mother was Sylvia Pankhurst

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.800
of the famous Pankhurst
suffragette family.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.720
And she took to the
emperor and his cause.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.040
Even though she was opposed to the
idea of royalty and the monarchy,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.560
she wanted to support him because
of what the Italian government had

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.660
done, and she was speaking
out for freedom.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.420
So she went to visit the
emperor at Fairfield House.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.370
This is his friend
in the background.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.970
And so an angle like this is
taken by an eight-year-old boy,

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.270
Richard, who is still alive.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:20.100
So I talked to Richard about
this, he took this photograph,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:24.480
and she was one of many
British people who rallied

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.100 position:56%
to the cause and supported Ethiopia.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.730
And see if you can spot
Princess Zeble on here.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:37.460
This is at the wedding of
Richard Pankhurst and Rita,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.560
his wife in the middle there.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.970
They still have this house
in Addis Ababa to this day.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.020
This is [inaudible] next
to the emperor, who --

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.700
again, they're there
in Central London.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:02.640
And David Greta, thanks to him
for facilitating my visit here.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.730
This is his father, [inaudible]
Greta, with the emperor.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:15.590
So this is Sidak [phonetic],
the foreign minister's son,

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.610
one of his sons who
was also in Bath.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.920
So there's a whole range of
characters who themselves were

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.390
in exile, and had to suffer being
away from your own country, losing,

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:30.530
you know, identity, not knowing
what was going to happen next.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:33.020
So you can see this is
basically a map I put together

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.570
of where the emperor went
during his stay in Britain.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.720
He didn't just say in Bath.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.240
He did go -- you see these
points in the southwest.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.880
He opened many faiths and festivals
you see on the south coast.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.820
He went to various places
to have a look around.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.250
The tip of Wales at the bottom,
he went to a holiday home,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.910
some people in Bath lent him that.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.440
And then you'll see
he went to Manchester,

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.220
Liverpool where his
son went to university,

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.800
and right up into Scotland.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.010
Many biographies of
the emperor and --

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:10.210
both in American English
basically just say the emperor was

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.750
in exile for four to five years.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.810
He did the speech at
the League of Nations.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:16.410
He went to Bath, and it
was cold and miserable.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.820
And then he turned
up in Sudan in 1940.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.870
So I've tried to fill
in these missing years.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.260
He didn't just stay in Bath --

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.940
he was cold and miserable some
of the time in the winter,

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:33.580
but I can testify that during
the summer, it's pretty nice.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.180
So he did get around
a bit, he did --

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.330
you know, and he spoke
at various rallies.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:41.190
He did one in Cambridge,
north of London,

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.030
600 students wearing pink
carnations drummed their feet

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.320
as he came in to speak to them.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.360
So people were taken
with this cause.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.470
The didn't like fascism,
popular opinion,

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:58.130
and the emperor was an
embodiment of opposition to it.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:03.570
But of course -- but now
we're talking about 1938.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.870
It's beginning is dawn

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.910
on His Imperial Majesty maybe
he's not going to get back.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.430
Bad news is coming from home.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.030
The British government has changed,

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:19.960
the Foreign Secretary Eden
is replaced by Lord Halifax,

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.470
who's much more hard-lined,
much more pro-Italy.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.700
And Halifax basically says, "Look,

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.250
we've got to recognize
Italy's occupation.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.860
That's the reality.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.500
That war is over, we've
got to move on.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.340
King Emmanuel III --
Victor Emmanuel III,

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.370
he is the rightful
ruler of Ethiopia now."

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:42.090
And he suggested a meeting of
League of Nations to discuss this.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.770
The emperor went this time
to make another appearance.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.120
He was exhausted, he had
been ill, and he wasn't able

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.830
to complete his speech this time.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.540
Lorenzo Taezaz had
to finish it for him.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.500
And it was clear the writing was
on the wall that many countries

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.680
in Europe were going to
recognize Italy's occupation.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.450
And this was clear that it
was very depressing news.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.840
Here he is on the west
pier of Brighton.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.180
Note now he's wearing Western
gear, the hats and the overcoat.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:22.010
This is another bit of
headgear, [inaudible] White.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.730
And the [inaudible]
White newspaper reports

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.980
that the emperor's coming here,
and he has been depressed,

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.260 position:56%
so this is openly said in the press.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.310
So it shows how quite
disturbing it was, really.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:38.850
This I found in the
National Archive.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.850
By the end of 1938, the British
government did indeed act

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:48.490
on their promise of recognizing
Italy's occupation of Ethiopia.

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.230
That meant the British government
did not see the emperor anymore

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.530
as head of state.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.830
He was now the ex-head of state.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.980
So they slapped him with
an income tax return.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.420
[Laughter] I love it.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.830
Yes; that's -- [laughs]
I don't, but --

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:13.860
then the emperor wrote to the king
1939 saying, "Look, I'm still here.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.950
Don't forget me."

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:25.260 position:56%
As war was coming in Europe, 1939,
he goes to a Bible college in Wales,

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.000
just before the world breaks out.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.140
He gets some money from the
British government eventually.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:34.160
Churchill becomes prime minister.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.510
Mussolini declares war on Britain.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:39.450
I'm going to finish in a second.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:42.000
Mussolini declares war on Britain.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.080
Churchill eventually
sends the emperor back.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.860 position:56%
And here he is in Sudan, entering --

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.250
I know this date, this is January
the 20th, that's my birthday,

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:56.570
just in case you don't know;
1941, the Dinder River,

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.870
he crosses the Dinder River.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:00.740
There was some more British
government maneuvering while

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:06.300
deciding when to go into Sudan,
but he goes into territory here.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.780
And now he's back in
Addis Ababa in 1941,

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.170 position:56%
five years to the day after he left.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:19.010
So it's time for questions, is it?

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.120
Yes. So far so good.

You're still following?

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.570
[Laughter] So here he
is with George Steer,

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.950
a wonderful British
South African journalist

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:34.570
who wrote a lot about the emperor.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:38.950
The story and relations with
Britain and Bath were not over.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:42.870
In the mid '50s, he
came back to Bath

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.710
to be made free man of the city.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.840 position:56%
We have this quaint thing in Britain
where you have these things --

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.080
where you can be recognized
to be a free man of the city.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.730
In London, it means
you can drive cattle

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.040
across the Thames on a bridge.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.350
And if you're caught for any
dismeanor, you can be hanged

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.520
with a silken cord
instead of a rope.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.280
[Laughter] So it's quite
good being a free man.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.090
Anyway, so he was a
free man of Bath;

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.790
this time big state
reception, huge turnout.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:12.780
He gave these elephant
tusks to the city.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:17.060
Unfortunately, they were
stolen a couple years later.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.290
Fairfield House is still -- he
gave to the people of Bath in 1958.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.630
It's still being use
as a community center.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.320
And of course, he didn't
forget the people of Bath.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.270
This is Fairfield Palace
in Debre Zeyit,

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.940
which he named after
the house in Bath.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.610
And this is a picture I found
not long before his death

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:43.980
at Fairfield House.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.980
Of course, those of you who
know the history, 40 years on,

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.590
things were very different.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:58.450
And eventually, after being
murdered by the dirge in 1975,

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:02.130
after the dirge had deposed,
and a few years later,

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:06.430 position:56%
the emperor's buried in Holy Trinity
Cathedral, which he'd completed

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:10.100
as a monument to his
victory over the Italians.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.830
So in terms of my story,
his time in exile,

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.360
in some ways you could say it's
fitting that he is laid to rest

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:20.130 position:56%
at this place, which symbolizes one
of his defining moments of his life.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:24.250
Plus in the lead at the top, there
is a photograph of the League

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.440
of Nation's speech and debate.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.310
So this exile period, this time of
fighting the Italians, was very,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.320
very important in his life, I
submit, and is therefore worthy

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.920
of just thinking more than
he went to Geneva and Bath

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.560
where he was cold for four years.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.100
So that's what I tried to
do, ladies and gentlemen.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:49.510
So please, if you've got
any questions, please do.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.000
Yes; well, I mean, there are
some missing holes in the story,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.570
but basically I've seen
some of the Cabinet papers

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:30.980
for the discussions they had
when Mussolini declared war

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.280
and the time running up to that.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.240
And they analyzed would the emperor
gain support from the patriots

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.280
and from the people back home?

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.290
What -- how should we support him?

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:43.770 position:56%
By this time, you're right, Eden was
back in the Cabinet by this time.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:47.420 position:56%
And I don't know the answer to that,

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.910
because I haven't seen
anything that said specifically.

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:54.820
The Emperor said that he had
been promised modern weapons,

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:59.430
and that he would be supported
very quickly to go back.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.970
In the end, he ended
up nine months waiting.

00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:06.640
And it was only sort of facilitated

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.380
where Eden himself would had been
promoted again the Cabinet went

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.980
to Khartoum, and basically pushed
the deal that led to the invasion.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.460
So there were still factions
in the British government.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:24.360
There was still opposition in
Africa among the British diplomats.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.870
Some of them didn't want
the emperor to come back.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.850 position:56%
And, of course, as we saw -- I mean,
this is not the subject of today,

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:33.300
but more British sort of
government to-ing and fro-ing,

their own eyes liberated --

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.920
or helped to liberate Addis Ababa.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.840
They wanted to carry
on and run the place.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.510

fight them not literally --

to cause trouble for Mussolini.

He saw this was a way of doing it.

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.020
Yes; so this was a feature
for the next two years.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:16.360
And this in fact led really why
the Ethiopian policy went much more

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.490
towards the United States
in subsequent years.

the end, it was done quite quickly,

but he thought they weren't --
maybe weren't going to send him.

-- she wrote an article saying,

was a tremendous amount

of appeasing, of course.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.220
Yes; and I think that
the actual decision

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.570
to recognize Italy's occupation,
that was a betrayal, definitely,

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:00.490
when they said, "Well,
you know, let's move on."

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:02.300
But it was different times.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.700
They were frightened
of war in Europe,

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.300
and it was a frightening
war, as we saw.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.220
So no wonder they were
-- you have to try

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.540
and understand it from
their point of new.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.500
I'm not justifying it, but
I'm saying they were trying

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.090
to make political calculations.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:17.450
And in the end, even though public
opinion was very pro Haile Selassie

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:21.910 position:56%
at the beginning, they began more
and more to be worried about Europe,

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.660
and Africa then seemed far away.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.770
So British public opinion wasn't --

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:30.390
in some ways, the emperor was
becoming a little bit forgotten.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:32.930
And maybe if Mussolini hadn't
have come back into the war,

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.520
he would never would have
come back to Ethiopia.

And some factions said,
"Well, we can't --

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.020
you know, who does he think he is?

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.900
We can't let him think
he can get back his power

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.900
on French and British bayonets."

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.700
That is what someone said.

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:19.380
So they did eventually try
and help him with his funding,

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.970
because they didn't
want the embarrassment

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.160
of the emperor going bankrupt.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.460
That was one of the features.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.760
I haven't really gone into it.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.200 position:56%
They were short of ready cash to pay

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.080
for the household bills
and everything.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:34.790 position:56%
They did find a benefactor who gave,
I think it was 2,500 pounds a year,

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.900
which is not a bad
sum in those days.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.470 position:56%
There was then a squabble within the
British establishment as to whether

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:42.550
that should be subject to tax.

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:46.190
The mysterious benefactor, Sir
William Collier, then collapsed

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:47.800
and died of a heart
attack on a train.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.400
And there was another
[inaudible] over whether his legacy

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.890
to the emperor was then
subject to more death tax.

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:59.390
I mean, it was quite
extraordinary, really, the --

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:01.760
he was spied on by
the tax authorities.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.820
And so I would say
no, I think we have

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.290
to understand he preoccupation
wars with the rise of Nazism.

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:15.960
You know, people quite
understandably, in some ways,

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.960 position:56%
were not frequently straight, you
know, and the policy of appeasement,

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.670
as we know, turned out
to be an utter failure.

00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:27.500
So no, I don't think it's --

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.910
I think the story of his exile
really you could say I think the

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:33.220
British people come out of it
pretty well in favoring Ethiopia

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.210
and justice, international justice.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:39.490
British government was
sort of comme ci, comme ca,

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:41.510
I think we could probably say.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.140
&gt;&gt; I think we have to end it here.

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.040
And please give an applause.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.840
&gt;&gt; Keith Bowers: Yes.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.530
[ Applause ]

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:54.190
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
