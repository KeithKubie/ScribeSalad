Let's do one more, critical rendering path diagram, but this

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.130
time I want you to create, the diagram for a real

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.000
website. If you have your own site, I want you to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.110
analyze that, and, if you don't, you can analyze any site

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.470
you want. But, be careful, lots of sites, especially the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.961
large ones, have long and complicated, critical rendering paths. I recommend

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.660
analysing a simple or a static page. I have included a

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.770
couple of links in the instructor notes for you to try.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
&gt;&gt; Cool. And let me guess, you want us to post our diagrams on the forums?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.240
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.990
&gt;&gt; Along with the three CRP metrics.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.410
&gt;&gt; You got it. And, don't forget to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.960
tell us what you're page you're actually analyzing.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.280
&gt;&gt; That sounds like fun. I can't wait

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.180
to comparing CRP diagrams for all kinds of websites.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this will be a fun exercise. Also, in addition to analysing your own

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.760
site, take a look at what other

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.200
students have found, and, provide feedback. Good luck.
