00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.840
Separating the data and control plane can allow

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.880
for independent evolution of the data and control plane.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.080
Separating vendor hardware from the logic that controls

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.770
the behavior of the network, and the potential to

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.080
more easily reason about network behavior since the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.790
behavior is now controlled from a single logically-centralized control

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.380
program. While it's possible that separating the control

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
plane from the data plane Could result in architectures

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.710
that are more fault tolerant or more scalable.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.960
The separation of data and control plain does not

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980
inherently make the network more fault tolerant or more

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.690
scalable. Therefore, neither of the first two options apply.
