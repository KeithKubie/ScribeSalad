00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.460
 who are young people of 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.140

 own traditional media makes and is 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.430
 to trivialize the violence of trivializing

 of trivializing death and sometimes 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 that in the story of those who suffer
