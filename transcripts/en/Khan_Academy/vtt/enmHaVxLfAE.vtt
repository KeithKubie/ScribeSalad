00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.640
I am back.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.510
Where were we?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.750
We were saying that we know that
velocity, or kind of a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.440
change in velocity, is
acceleration times time.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.660
I just wrote that a little bit
more formally, really kind of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.990
incorporating the change
in velocity.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.580
Right?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.460
The final velocity is equal to
the initial velocity plus

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.535
acceleration times time.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:22.180
I actually could have written
it like this: I could have

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.640
written vf minus vi is equal
to acceleration times time,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.010
and this is the change
in velocity.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.190
Actually, that's the way
I should be doing it.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.280
As you can tell, I kind of do
some of this stuff on the fly,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.070
but I do that for a reason--
it's because I want you to get

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.460
the same intuition that I
hopefully have, instead of

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.480
just kind of doing it in a very
formal way in a book, and

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.400
sometimes the book doesn't
necessarily make the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.110
connections in the
most natural way.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.130
This is going straight from my
brain to this video, and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.410
hopefully into your brain.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.560
These are all ways of saying the
same thing, and I actually

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.960
should write this as change in
velocity-- that triangle, or

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.910
delta, just means change.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.220
The final velocity, my initial
velocity, is equal to

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.590
acceleration times time.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.200
The average velocity, you could
just figure-- you take

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.830
the final, and you take the
initial, and you average the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.220
two, and it's equal to this.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.280
Then I said, we know what the
final velocity is-- this is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.920
the final velocity, and the
average velocity is this.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.470
We substitute it for the final
velocity, and then we came to

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.860
this equation for average
velocity.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.650
Then before I almost ran out of
time, I said I'm going to

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.720
take this formula for the
average velocity-- and I

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.820
really encourage you to just
play around with these

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.100
formulas yourself and derive
it yourself, because it's

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.930
going to pay huge rewards later
on when you forget the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.650
formulas on your exam, but you
can work it out anyway.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.430
We have this formula for average
velocity, and let's

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.600
substitute it back into this, so
we can say that distance is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.290
equal to the average velocity,
and that's this: vi plus at

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.680
over 2 times time.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160
If we just distributed that t,
we have the initial velocity

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.440
times time, plus acceleration
times time squared over 2.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.670
So, distance is equal to the
initial velocity-- let me draw

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.200
a line here, so we don't confuse
things-- distance is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.400
equal to the initial velocity
times time plus acceleration

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.510
times time squared
divided by 2.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.250
Sometimes the physics teacher
might just teach at squared

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.100
2-- that's sometimes what people
memorize, and that's

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.490
because in a lot of these
projectile motion problems,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.460
your initial velocity is 0,
especially when you're

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.440
dropping a rock.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.610
If your initial velocity is 0,
this term would cancel out.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.640
If you do that last problem that
we just did using this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.680
example, you'll get
the same answer.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.230
I said we're accelerating with
gravity, so a is equal to 10

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.490
meters per second squared,
then time is equal to 2

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.600
seconds, and then initial
velocity is equal to 0, and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.110
let me make some space here.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.420
The initial velocity is 0-- so
this term just cancels out--

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.570
plus acceleration, 10
meters per second

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.170
squared times time squared.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.620
You have 10 meters per second
squared times time squared,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.750
time is two seconds,
so it's 4.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.210
Since we've squared the number,
we should also square

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.780
the units, so it's 4 seconds
squared, and all of

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.180
that is over 2.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.620
Like we learned before-- 10
times 4 divided 2 is 20, and

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.800
we have seconds squared the
denominator and we have

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.430
seconds squared in the
numerator here.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.353
They cancel out, and we're
just left with meters.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.690
Actually, I'm going to leave it
there for now, and in the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.630
next presentation, I'll
explore some of these

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.150
mechanics even further.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.840
I'll see you soon.
