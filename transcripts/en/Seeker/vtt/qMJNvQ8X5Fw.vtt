00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
We’ve gotta get rid of these gas guzzlers
and switch to electric cars that plug into

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.769
the land of rainbows and unicorns.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:13.019
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.070
Often called “zero emissions” vehicles,
electric cars are surely better for the environment,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.070
right?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.880
Ehhh not so fast...Their entire life-cycle,
from manufacture to use to disposal, needs

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.900
to be considered when determining their environmental
impact.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.640
We can’t just look at their tailpipes.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
So, taking everything into consideration,
are electric vehicles actually better for

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.470
the environment than our old timey cars?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.480
The Union of Concerned Scientists, or UCS,
recently conducted a cradle to grave study

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.800
to dig into this question, starting by comparing
the manufacturing of battery electric and

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.730
petrol cars and materials and resources used.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.000
They used a Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf
to represent battery-electric vehicles, also

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.760
known as BEVS, and comparable midsize and
fullsize gasoline cars.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.719
They found that before they even hit the road
- electric vehicles actually are responsible

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.079
for about 1 ton more emissions than their
traditional counterparts.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.420
Yes, that’s a winning point for your gasoline
powered car.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.090
This is largely because of the BEVs lithium-ion
batteries, which require the extraction of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.210
rare earth metals... often through drilling...
just like with oil.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.359
Not a very eco-friendly activity.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.060
When it comes to disposing of BEVs, they don’t
seem to be any better than regular cars either.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.819
In fact, they may have a greater environmental
footprint because it’s tricky to dispose

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:35.440
of their lithium ion batteries.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.140
But data here is lacking.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.850
Now when on the road, BEVs don’t emit CO2,
but their batteries need to be charged from

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.859
electricity that has to come from somewhere
- and this somewhere might have a CO2 output

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:47.859
of its own.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.540
A report based on 2009 national averages found
that If the electricity is coming primarily

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.630
from a country like India where coal accounts
for about 60% of electricity generated, your

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.479
BEV ends up emitting C02 at about the same
levels as a 20 mpg car.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.210
In the US, where the fuel sources are cleaner,
this figure only rose to 40mpg - which is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.840
basically the average for a really efficient
petrol car.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.070
So, at this point you may be thinking, if
electric cars pollute more when they’re

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.750
built, just about the same when they’re
junked, and their battery charges can pollute

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.500
even more than an efficient gas car… then,
of course electric vehicles aren’t greener.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.550
Figures from studies like this one are often
cited to make the case against electric vehicles.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.570
But, here’s the thing, since 2009 BEVs have
become more efficient and while India has

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.680
added more coal powered plants, the US has
not, opting instead for renewable sources.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.990
Looking at 2015 data, the UCS determined that
BEVs in the US are now the equivalent of cars

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.060
that go 68mpg.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.221
And in countries like Paraguay and Iceland,
the electricity is so clean that a BEV there

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:05.000
would be like having a car that goes more
than 200 miles per gallon Their electricity

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.760
grids are powered by more water, wind, and
solar energy, than other countries.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.670
When it comes to emissions, BEVs here are
many times better for the environment than

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.670
petrol cars.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.790
What’s more, the longer you drive an electric
car, the better it stacks up against gas vehicles.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.670
The UCS found that basically, it you drive
an EV for a month, you might as well buy a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.670
car.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.770
But drive that puppy for 2 years and you’re
helping the environment.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.370
All said and done, the UCS found that electric
vehicles produce about 50 percent fewer emissions

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.660
than a regular car in the US.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.160
Basically, the comparative environmental benefits
increase the more you drive and the cleaner

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.380
the electricity source.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.790

Now, we are of course, only talking about

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.860
global warming emissions, we’re not saying
that one type of car is better than another.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.890
You might have personal preference for other
reasons.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100
Maybe you’re into salt powered cars.
