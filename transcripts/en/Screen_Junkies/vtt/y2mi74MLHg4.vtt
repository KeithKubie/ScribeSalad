00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.580
From Bryan Singer, the director with the mutant
power to make Brett Ratner disappear, comes

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.260
X-Men: Days of Future Past.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.509
If First Class wasn't enough prequel for you

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.609
and Last Stand wasn't last enough for you,

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.009
experience the prequel-sequel that made the
worst X-Men movie

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.039
irrelevant

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.119
and the worst Wolverine movie into a bad dream.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.000
It's OK, it's OK, it's all gone now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.030
Shhh.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.670
Journey to a time when humanity and mutants
alike are trapped in a Tron Legacy prison

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.989
Where only the plot of Terminator 2 can save
them, as an indestructible badass gets sent

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.320
back in time

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660
without his clothes

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.760
to protect a vulnerable young man with long
hair

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.769
who will one day become a leader

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.149
and stop a shape-shifter from destroying the
future.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.960
"Who sent you?"

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.740
"You did."

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.620
"The person who sent me... was you."

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.150
"What?"

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.840
In a world full of other cool X-Men, meet
Wolverine for the 7th

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.990
f***ing time.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.229
Hugh Jackman returns to the role he could
play in his sleep by now

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.990
... which he does.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.270
Watch as he's sent back to alter history the
only way he knows how:

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.180
spoiler alerts.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.910
"You and I are gonna be good friends."

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.610
"I spent a lot of years trying to bring you
down."

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.500
"I was your most helpless student."

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.560
"In the future, do I make it?"

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.170
"No."

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.930
Spend the other half of your time with characters
like

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.880
Charles Xavier, the young mutant heroin addict,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.020
Hank McCoy, his enabler,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.840
"I added a little extra cuz you missed a dose."

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.000
Quicksilver, a mutant so powerful he could
single-handedly solve

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.320
every problem the X-Men will ever have

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.720
which is probably why they leave him at home,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.660
and Mystique, a mutant so stubborn she'd rather
cause the apocalypse than listen to reason.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.330
"Humans use your blood, your genes, to create
a weapon that wipes us all out."

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.100
"Please do not make us the enemy today."

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.350
"Get out of my head, Charles!"

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.860
"If you kill Trask, you'll be creating countless
more just like him."

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.349
"Then I'll kill them too."

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.860
When your psychic friend, his mortal enemy,
and a dude from the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.890
future are all telling you the same thing,
you should probably listen to them, idiot.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.000
So get ready for a super-powered snuff film
where everybody dies

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.740
but, also, nobody dies.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.810
And witness an epilogue that ties up all loose
ends, where all your favorite X-Men show up

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.290
alive and well,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.010
which totally undermines the stakes of X-Men:
Apocalypse,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.730
but who cares? This scene was awesome!

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.460
Top that, Avengers!

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.620
Starring

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.980
PowerPoint

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.240
Magnets, How Do They Work?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.370
The Flash

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430
Reverse Austin Powers

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.900
Storm Thurmond

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.290
Mysteets

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.630
Kelsey Syntax

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.460
Oldneto

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.680
Megamind

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.480
The Other Gay Ellen

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.709
I'm Tiny Ron Burgundy?

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.760
And Ultron

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.220
X-Men: Timecop.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.220
So, if this movie takes place in 1973, and
Wolverine: Origins takes place in 1986, Charles

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.140
is gonna go from this to this 
in 13 years?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.100
Yikes.
