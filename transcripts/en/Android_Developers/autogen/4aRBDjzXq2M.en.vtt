the past is to go and create a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
the past is to go and create a
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.840
the past is to go and create a
transparent activity like a pop-up and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850
transparent activity like a pop-up and

transparent activity like a pop-up and
you have a button and when you push that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
you have a button and when you push that

you have a button and when you push that
button pop up your map in that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
button pop up your map in that
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.440
button pop up your map in that
transparent activity and that will let

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450
transparent activity and that will let
 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.600
transparent activity and that will let
you go and display a map without having

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.020
is explained pretty well in the current
documentation for notifications in the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030
documentation for notifications in the
 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.080
documentation for notifications in the
API guide so um in general we don't want

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
API guide so um in general we don't want
 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.200
API guide so um in general we don't want
it on use the same task over again

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210
it on use the same task over again
 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.920
it on use the same task over again
because going backwards from it would

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930
because going backwards from it would
 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.960
because going backwards from it would
cause the user to go to a different

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970
cause the user to go to a different
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.600
cause the user to go to a different
place than what they expected and that's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
place than what they expected and that's
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.120
place than what they expected and that's
documented in the current documentation

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130
documented in the current documentation
 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.060

yes that's a good point also I was doing

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070
yes that's a good point also I was doing
 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.590
yes that's a good point also I was doing
some testing I want to go here on my on

my tablet and let's take gmail as an

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350
my tablet and let's take gmail as an
 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.260
my tablet and let's take gmail as an
example so if you have a gmail

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270
example so if you have a gmail
 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.240
example so if you have a gmail
notification in your notification bar

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250
notification in your notification bar
 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.760
notification in your notification bar
and then you switch into gmail it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770
and then you switch into gmail it
 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.580
and then you switch into gmail it
removes that notification so you might

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590
removes that notification so you might
 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.600
removes that notification so you might
want to consider whether it's even

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610
want to consider whether it's even
 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.980
want to consider whether it's even
appropriate to still have that

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990
appropriate to still have that
 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.420
appropriate to still have that
notification present when the user is

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430
notification present when the user is
 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.490
notification present when the user is
already inside of your life I think

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500
already inside of your life I think
 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.990
already inside of your life I think
actually pretty much all of this new

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000
actually pretty much all of this new
 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.240
actually pretty much all of this new
maps work that way I think talk does the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250
maps work that way I think talk does the
 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.850
maps work that way I think talk does the
same thing I mean it makes a lot of

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860
same thing I mean it makes a lot of
 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.340
same thing I mean it makes a lot of
sense the idea of FDI notification is if

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350
sense the idea of FDI notification is if
 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.540
sense the idea of FDI notification is if
the user somewhere else you want to

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550
the user somewhere else you want to
 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.280
the user somewhere else you want to
bring them into your app if they're

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290
bring them into your app if they're
 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.560
bring them into your app if they're
already inside of your app it might make

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
already inside of your app it might make
 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.630
already inside of your app it might make
sense to use a notification mechanism

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640
sense to use a notification mechanism
 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.650
sense to use a notification mechanism
that's actually part of your application

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660
that's actually part of your application
 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.750
that's actually part of your application
itself and then hide the system if

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760
itself and then hide the system if
 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.430
itself and then hide the system if
occations it's a little awkward to go

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440
occations it's a little awkward to go
 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.680
occations it's a little awkward to go
and you have to pull down the bar in the

and you have to pull down the bar in the
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.760

present so maybe just taking a step back

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
present so maybe just taking a step back
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.870
present so maybe just taking a step back
from the code now just looking at your

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880
from the code now just looking at your
 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.270
from the code now just looking at your
UI design it might not be the best

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280
UI design it might not be the best
 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.890

option to keep that notification there

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900
option to keep that notification there
 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.430
option to keep that notification there
um yeah I think that what the original

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440
um yeah I think that what the original
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.900
um yeah I think that what the original
poster is saying is that um he or she

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910
poster is saying is that um he or she
 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.969
poster is saying is that um he or she
wants to be able to have the user click

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979
wants to be able to have the user click
 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.969
wants to be able to have the user click
on an of notification and go back to the

on an of notification and go back to the
 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.230

if it is in the foreground you shouldn't

if it is in the foreground you shouldn't
even have that notification to begin

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:39.809
even have that notification to begin
 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.879
even have that notification to begin
with ah there's a Gilman yes go ahead so

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889
with ah there's a Gilman yes go ahead so
 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.129
with ah there's a Gilman yes go ahead so
there I mean which I agree I think it's

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139
there I mean which I agree I think it's
 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.959
there I mean which I agree I think it's
pretty rare that you would need to call

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:47.969
pretty rare that you would need to call
 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.149
pretty rare that you would need to call
on that location for all your in your

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159
on that location for all your in your
 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.769
on that location for all your in your
application already there can be a

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:51.779
application already there can be a
 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:53.419
application already there can be a
couple of occasions where that makes

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:53.429
couple of occasions where that makes
 

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:56.869
couple of occasions where that makes
some sense and if your app it maintains

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879
some sense and if your app it maintains
 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.319
some sense and if your app it maintains
a variety of parallel context talk could

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.329
a variety of parallel context talk could
 

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:02.269
a variety of parallel context talk could
actually be a good example where I could

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279
actually be a good example where I could
 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.779
actually be a good example where I could
be in one chat but I might wish to still

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:05.789
be in one chat but I might wish to still
 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.189
be in one chat but I might wish to still
be notified about activity that's

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199
be notified about activity that's
 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.989
be notified about activity that's
happening in a different chat that isn't

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:08.999
happening in a different chat that isn't
 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.509
happening in a different chat that isn't
for grams so there are occasions where

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:11.519
for grams so there are occasions where
 

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.889
for grams so there are occasions where
you can call that word but I think the

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:12.899
you can call that word but I think the
 

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.199
you can call that word but I think the
general guidance have been given of you

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:15.209
general guidance have been given of you
 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:17.119
general guidance have been given of you
know you want to come Holy recreate that

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:17.129
know you want to come Holy recreate that
 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.519
know you want to come Holy recreate that
test stat upon that switches it's

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:19.529
test stat upon that switches it's
 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:23.029
test stat upon that switches it's
completely appropriate right I can see

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039
completely appropriate right I can see
 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.529
completely appropriate right I can see
some situations in which the

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539
some situations in which the
 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.509
some situations in which the
notification would be issued by a

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:26.519
notification would be issued by a
 

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:29.439
notification would be issued by a
background service while the user was in

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449
background service while the user was in
 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.929
background service while the user was in
an activity that works in conjunction

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:32.939
an activity that works in conjunction
 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.739
an activity that works in conjunction
with that service okay again you know we

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:36.749
with that service okay again you know we
 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:38.359
with that service okay again you know we
actually just lost our junior miners

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:38.369
actually just lost our junior miners
 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:41.689
actually just lost our junior miners
right okay cool so yeah I think that so

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699
right okay cool so yeah I think that so
 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.489
right okay cool so yeah I think that so
we all have to be from the market team

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:43.499
we all have to be from the market team
 

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:44.629
we all have to be from the market team
here so I don't think any of us can

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639
here so I don't think any of us can
 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.709
here so I don't think any of us can
actually say where the office has been

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:45.719
actually say where the office has been
 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:48.609
actually say where the office has been
considered signing is certainly an issue

00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:48.619
considered signing is certainly an issue
 

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.949
considered signing is certainly an issue
there are ways that in theory can be

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:51.959
there are ways that in theory can be
 

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.689
there are ways that in theory can be
worked around for example signing each

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699
worked around for example signing each
 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.249
worked around for example signing each
individual package but it would require

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259
individual package but it would require
 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:57.079
individual package but it would require
some pretty substantial architectural

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:57.089
some pretty substantial architectural
 

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:00.079
some pretty substantial architectural
modifications to the way the APK format

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:00.089
modifications to the way the APK format
 

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.229
modifications to the way the APK format
works so I'll just say that that's

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:03.239
works so I'll just say that that's
 

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:04.639
works so I'll just say that that's
really good feedback will make sure that

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:04.649
really good feedback will make sure that
 

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:06.649
really good feedback will make sure that
the team hears about it and if they

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:06.659
the team hears about it and if they
 

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.350
the team hears about it and if they
haven't considered it will let them know

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360
haven't considered it will let them know
 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.540
haven't considered it will let them know
but as far as whether or not we actually

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
but as far as whether or not we actually
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.069
but as far as whether or not we actually
have or not I don't think anybody here

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:13.079
have or not I don't think anybody here
 

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.469
have or not I don't think anybody here
is actually qualified answer that but

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479
is actually qualified answer that but
 

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:17.600
is actually qualified answer that but

just kind of use of the product that we

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060
just kind of use of the product that we
 

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.449
just kind of use of the product that we
went through well one observation we had

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459
went through well one observation we had
 

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:05.540
went through well one observation we had
is that when users kind of learned that

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.550
is that when users kind of learned that

kind of that there was also so it became

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:16.889
kind of that there was also so it became
 

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:19.129
kind of that there was also so it became
actually more laborious for those types

00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:19.139
actually more laborious for those types
 

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:22.160

those notifications and sequence with
 

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:31.610
those notifications and sequence with
discrete touches and we also were little

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620
discrete touches and we also were little
 

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.590

concerned about the scalability how many

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600
concerned about the scalability how many
 

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.780
concerned about the scalability how many
of those icons we could present in

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:38.790
of those icons we could present in
 

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.150

general we just kind of in ICS we did a

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160
general we just kind of in ICS we did a
 

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:51.049
general we just kind of in ICS we did a
lot of

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:51.059
 
 

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:54.139

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:54.149
tablet experience more direct more
 

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:56.659
tablet experience more direct more
consistent and I guess I would further

00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:56.669
consistent and I guess I would further
 

00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:58.039
consistent and I guess I would further
add that with some of the new

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.049
add that with some of the new
 

00:11:58.049 --> 00:11:59.479
add that with some of the new
notification behaviors that we've

00:11:59.479 --> 00:11:59.489
notification behaviors that we've
 

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:01.759
notification behaviors that we've
introduced in jelly bean with kind of

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:01.769
introduced in jelly bean with kind of
 

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:05.059
introduced in jelly bean with kind of
expandable and compatible notifications

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:05.069
expandable and compatible notifications
 

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:07.399
expandable and compatible notifications
and it's all the more reason to kind of

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:07.409
and it's all the more reason to kind of
 

00:12:07.409 --> 00:12:09.529
and it's all the more reason to kind of
drive users to a single location and

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:09.539
drive users to a single location and
 

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.569
drive users to a single location and
where they can reveal where they can

where they can reveal where they can
 

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:13.459
where they can reveal where they can
open up we can present the most

important notifications in a more

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:14.879
important notifications in a more
 

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:17.389
important notifications in a more
expanded fashion and we're doing more in

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399
expanded fashion and we're doing more in
 

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:20.689

or doing this feature differently I

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:17.269
or doing this feature differently I
 

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:20.119
or doing this feature differently I
would I would advise against it and I

00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:20.129
would I would advise against it and I
 

00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:29.300

Google Plus does it I suspect what they

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.290
Google Plus does it I suspect what they
 

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.960
Google Plus does it I suspect what they
do is they have something like a grid

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:24.970
do is they have something like a grid

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.370
make sure your device can't be installed
 

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.960
make sure your device can't be installed
on platforms where you know doesn't work

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:38.970
on platforms where you know doesn't work
 

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.760
on platforms where you know doesn't work
we have a very robust layout system that

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:41.770
we have a very robust layout system that
 

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.110
we have a very robust layout system that
makes it very easy to go and handle

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120
makes it very easy to go and handle
 

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.460
makes it very easy to go and handle
different screen sizes and different

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:44.470
different screen sizes and different
 

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.650
different screen sizes and different
densities and there's a lot of tools

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:46.660
densities and there's a lot of tools
 

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.300
densities and there's a lot of tools
here that you know I don't want to bash

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:48.310
here that you know I don't want to bash
 

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.210
here that you know I don't want to bash
iOS but we do provide a lot of tools

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.220
iOS but we do provide a lot of tools
 

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.740
iOS but we do provide a lot of tools
that they don't for handling different

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:52.750
that they don't for handling different
 

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.000
that they don't for handling different
screen sizes because it's something that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.010
screen sizes because it's something that
 

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.440
screen sizes because it's something that
androids had to deal with some pretty

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.450
androids had to deal with some pretty
 

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.780
androids had to deal with some pretty
much the very beginning since android

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:57.790
much the very beginning since android
 

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.110
much the very beginning since android
1.6 to be specific so we've gone to

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120
1.6 to be specific so we've gone to
 

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.090
1.6 to be specific so we've gone to
great lengths to go and make this easy

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:03.100
great lengths to go and make this easy
 

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.400
great lengths to go and make this easy
for developers yes it's an extra

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.410
for developers yes it's an extra
 

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.170
for developers yes it's an extra
consideration but the tools are there to

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.180
consideration but the tools are there to
 

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.210
consideration but the tools are there to
go and make your life you know to make

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.220
go and make your life you know to make
 

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.530
go and make your life you know to make
your life Pleasant while you do this to

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:10.540
your life Pleasant while you do this to
 

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.570
your life Pleasant while you do this to
end I don't think it flows close things

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:12.580
end I don't think it flows close things
 

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.090
end I don't think it flows close things
down if anything it's actually a benefit

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:15.100
down if anything it's actually a benefit
 

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.380
down if anything it's actually a benefit
to the Android ecosystem because it

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:16.390
to the Android ecosystem because it
 

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.400
to the Android ecosystem because it
means you have more devices out there

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:17.410
means you have more devices out there
 

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.550
means you have more devices out there
with more options OEMs are able to

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.560
with more options OEMs are able to
 

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.290
with more options OEMs are able to
innovate faster developers are able to

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.300
innovate faster developers are able to
 

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.490
innovate faster developers are able to
innovate faster on top of those features

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:23.500
innovate faster on top of those features
 

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.740
innovate faster on top of those features
and I think the end result is a much

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:25.750
and I think the end result is a much
 

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.390
and I think the end result is a much
better experience for end-users a much

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400
better experience for end-users a much
 

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.870
better experience for end-users a much
better chance for developers so I think

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880
better chance for developers so I think
 

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.850
better chance for developers so I think
I've been that to death but anybody else

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:32.860
I've been that to death but anybody else
 

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.650
I've been that to death but anybody else
have anything they want to add to that

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:33.660
have anything they want to add to that
 

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:39.540
have anything they want to add to that
um yeah I'm not really I have a question

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:39.550
um yeah I'm not really I have a question
 

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.580
um yeah I'm not really I have a question
about what's really meant here because

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:41.590
about what's really meant here because
 

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.850
about what's really meant here because
um stability to me suggests that in

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:44.860
um stability to me suggests that in
 

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.370
um stability to me suggests that in
every new version of Android that's

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:47.380
every new version of Android that's
 

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.720
every new version of Android that's
released there are a lot of bugs that

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:48.730
released there are a lot of bugs that
 

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.300
released there are a lot of bugs that
were introduced in that version yes yes

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.310
were introduced in that version yes yes
 

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.050
were introduced in that version yes yes
debility is a lot of different

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.060
debility is a lot of different
 

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.700
debility is a lot of different
definitions yeah it could be is it

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:53.710
definitions yeah it could be is it
 

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.190
definitions yeah it could be is it
bugginess api changes right I'm not

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200
bugginess api changes right I'm not
 

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.170
bugginess api changes right I'm not
clear what you mean by stability I mean

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:58.180
clear what you mean by stability I mean
 

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.710
clear what you mean by stability I mean
as far as you know bugginess I I don't

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720
as far as you know bugginess I I don't
 

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.290
as far as you know bugginess I I don't
think that's the case at all and android

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.300
think that's the case at all and android
 

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.250
think that's the case at all and android
on the whole is

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:06.260
on the whole is
 

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.560
on the whole is
the very stable especially especially

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:08.570
the very stable especially especially
 

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.700
the very stable especially especially
the things you're talking about here

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:09.710
the things you're talking about here
 

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.840
the things you're talking about here
like screens have something like that

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:10.850
like screens have something like that
 

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.630
like screens have something like that
and API changes you know again we had

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640
and API changes you know again we had
 

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.120
and API changes you know again we had
one big API change back in 1.6 where we

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.130
one big API change back in 1.6 where we
 

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.550
one big API change back in 1.6 where we
headed support for multiple resolutions

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:17.560
headed support for multiple resolutions
 

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.540
headed support for multiple resolutions
but since then there hasn't been very

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:19.550
but since then there hasn't been very
 

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.490
but since then there hasn't been very
much this change there I mean we've

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:21.500
much this change there I mean we've
 

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.220
much this change there I mean we've
added additional functionality but we've

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:24.230
added additional functionality but we've
 

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.350
added additional functionality but we've
we've maintained backwards compatibility

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360
we've maintained backwards compatibility
 

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.350
we've maintained backwards compatibility
all the way back to Android 10 right um

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360
all the way back to Android 10 right um
 

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.770
all the way back to Android 10 right um
I think that the point here is maybe

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:32.780
I think that the point here is maybe
 

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.060
I think that the point here is maybe
that Apple developers make apps that

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.070
that Apple developers make apps that
 

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.250
that Apple developers make apps that
they can focus on one particular device

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.260
they can focus on one particular device
 

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.780
they can focus on one particular device
and Android varies because their new

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:43.790
and Android varies because their new
 

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.270
and Android varies because their new
devices coming out all the time and so

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280
devices coming out all the time and so
 

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.010
devices coming out all the time and so
um you risk so-called stability because

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.020
um you risk so-called stability because
 

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.530
um you risk so-called stability because
you're writing for a device that you for

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:53.540
you're writing for a device that you for
 

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.720
you're writing for a device that you for
devices that you may not be aware of and

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:55.730
devices that you may not be aware of and
 

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.480
devices that you may not be aware of and
that so-called changes your app it

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:58.490
that so-called changes your app it
 

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.070
that so-called changes your app it
shouldn't and we try to make it so that

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080
shouldn't and we try to make it so that
 

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.400
shouldn't and we try to make it so that
we provide tools that allow you to write

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.410
we provide tools that allow you to write
 

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.980
we provide tools that allow you to write
the same app for a variety of different

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:08.990
the same app for a variety of different
 

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.780
the same app for a variety of different
devices of different sizes ram sizes

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:13.790
devices of different sizes ram sizes
 

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.980
devices of different sizes ram sizes
screen sizes some um that would you mind

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:17.990
screen sizes some um that would you mind
 

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.070
screen sizes some um that would you mind
comment any others yeah one thing that

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080
comment any others yeah one thing that
 

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.410
comment any others yeah one thing that
that is always a nice to point out is

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:23.420
that is always a nice to point out is
 

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.810
that is always a nice to point out is
that it's not 1,000 times the effort but

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:25.820
that it's not 1,000 times the effort but
 

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.150
that it's not 1,000 times the effort but
your app runs on 1,000 times the number

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:28.160
your app runs on 1,000 times the number
 

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.340
your app runs on 1,000 times the number
of devices so because Android is running

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:30.350
of devices so because Android is running
 

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.730
of devices so because Android is running
like 11 thousand devices so actually if

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:33.740
like 11 thousand devices so actually if
 

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.260
like 11 thousand devices so actually if
you think about desktop applications

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.270
you think about desktop applications
 

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.480
you think about desktop applications
every single best of that anyone has at

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:37.490
every single best of that anyone has at
 

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.520
every single best of that anyone has at
their home is a different device so into

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.530
their home is a different device so into
 

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.720
their home is a different device so into
though Android launches new devices

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:40.730
though Android launches new devices
 

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.140
though Android launches new devices
every now and then I mean it's not some

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.150
every now and then I mean it's not some
 

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.370
every now and then I mean it's not some
more death of them developing that

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:45.380
more death of them developing that
 

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.460
more death of them developing that
desktop applications so some people say

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.470
desktop applications so some people say
 

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.140
desktop applications so some people say
oh Android is fragmented i think it's

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.150
oh Android is fragmented i think it's
 

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.690
oh Android is fragmented i think it's
it's the the reverse and it's sort of

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:52.700
it's the the reverse and it's sort of
 

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.660
it's the the reverse and it's sort of
like etely answer to fragmentation

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:54.670
like etely answer to fragmentation
 

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.610
like etely answer to fragmentation
because we have very a very stable set

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.620
because we have very a very stable set
 

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.350
because we have very a very stable set
of tools and a very robust set of tools

00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360
of tools and a very robust set of tools
 

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.080
of tools and a very robust set of tools
to deal with device diversity so you can

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.090
to deal with device diversity so you can
 

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.460
to deal with device diversity so you can
talk about Android without talking about

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:03.470
talk about Android without talking about
 

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.740
talk about Android without talking about
diversity I mean diversity is one of

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:05.750
diversity I mean diversity is one of
 

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.510
diversity I mean diversity is one of
those core values that the platform

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520
those core values that the platform
 

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.620
those core values that the platform

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.200
would work the thing you do have to
watch out there for though is NFC is a

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.210
watch out there for though is NFC is a
 

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.720
watch out there for though is NFC is a
radio based technology and it is

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:57.730
radio based technology and it is
 

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.840
radio based technology and it is
susceptible to east dropping and

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:00.850
susceptible to east dropping and
 

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.730
susceptible to east dropping and
potentially cloning if you do that and

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:02.740
potentially cloning if you do that and
 

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.759
potentially cloning if you do that and
so the answer that is to build

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:04.769
so the answer that is to build
 

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:07.110
so the answer that is to build
cryptography on top of that and so

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120
cryptography on top of that and so
 

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.519
cryptography on top of that and so
that's how things like NFC enabled

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:08.529
that's how things like NFC enabled
 

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:10.769
that's how things like NFC enabled
credit cards work you go and do a

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:10.779
credit cards work you go and do a
 

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:13.740
credit cards work you go and do a
channel challenge response type exchange

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:13.750
channel challenge response type exchange
 

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.680
channel challenge response type exchange
or use something like RSA so you have a

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:16.690
or use something like RSA so you have a
 

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.259
or use something like RSA so you have a
private key inside of your phone and a

00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:19.269
private key inside of your phone and a
 

00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:21.330
private key inside of your phone and a
public key in your whatever you're

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:21.340
public key in your whatever you're
 

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.879
public key in your whatever you're
authenticating to and then your phone

00:29:23.879 --> 00:29:23.889
authenticating to and then your phone
 

00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:25.470
authenticating to and then your phone
would sign something like a time stamp

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480
would sign something like a time stamp
 

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.810
would sign something like a time stamp
