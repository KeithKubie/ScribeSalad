it's not that the quantities of data are

my favorite cute example of that is the
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.220
my favorite cute example of that is the
fact that in 2012 Cisco released a

of course the digital geeks are aware of

of course the digital geeks are aware of
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.680
of course the digital geeks are aware of
this and they've got a working group on
