00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.708
Looking at the compound inequality we have, which we can also write in interval

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:07.532
notation, of course. Seems like, considering we have the same number, almost,

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:11.297
written twice, just one of it with a negative sign. There should be some sort of

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:14.989
simpler way to write this. It's not exactly redundant right now, but it seems a

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:19.292
little bit redundant. What we really know is that we want the difference between

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:23.127
0 so we want the distance it takes from on a number line to get from 0 out to

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:27.352
either end of the tolerance is just .3, either in the positive direction or the

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:31.295
negative direction. One way we can denote this is by using what's called

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:35.311
absolute value signs. We can think of the absolute value of a number as the

00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.672
distance between that number and 0. This distance is absolute in that it ignores

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:44.347
direction. We can see that counting from positive point 3 back to zero takes us

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:48.761
point 1, point 2, point 3. But the same is true of negative point 3. Point 1,

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.848
point 2, point 3. So positive point 3 and negative point 3 have the same

00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:57.643
absolute value, because they're the same distance from zero on the number line.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:01:01.636
Now that you have an idea of what absolute value is, can you tell me what the

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:05.901
absolute value of negative 9 is? And what the absolute value of 4 and a half is?

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:09.683
The number line is here just for you to have a visual in case you feel like

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:11.002
counting on something.
