00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.360
AUDIENCE: That was awesome,
but my card was stolen.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.369
[LAUGHING]

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.910
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So this is the
Soil Moisture Inversion Level

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.481
Estimator, or SMILE,
for short, and it

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:27.610
will keep your plants happy.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.530
GUEST SPEAKER 2: By telling you
when your soil is too wet, too

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.808
dry, or just right.

00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:37.890
So it uses an RGB LED, and
any soil moisture sensor.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.700
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And
here's how it works,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.120
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So just water
turns blue, and that's too wet.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.578
GUEST SPEAKER 1: It says "Gone
Fishing" in the silly monitor.

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:54.522
[LAUGHING]

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.109
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Moist
soil will turn green

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:07.400
if you stick it in all the way.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.790
And then it says--

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.710
what does it say?

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.590
GUEST SPEAKER 2: I feel good.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.090
GUEST SPEAKER 2: I
feel good, so you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.530
don't need to water your plant.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.234
And then completely dry
soil is red, and it says--

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:20.810
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I'm thirsty.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.940
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
Water me, I'm thirsty.
