00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.580
We as Muslim women now . . . When I was a
Muslim woman, we were brought up to believe

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.370
in our own submission -- submission to the
will of God, submission to the will of your

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.550
parents, submission to the will of your husband.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.279
And submission to the will of the husband
is absolute except when he asks you to forsake

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.349
Allah.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.480
Now if we have been indoctrinated to believe
that, then that's how we act.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.190
That's how we behave.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.239
But not all of us . . . and that's I think
what's so fascinating about the human mind

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.660
-- is that you cannot enslave the human entirely.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.870
Many of us have been exposed to other ideas.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
We have our own personalities, seek freedom.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.480
We can't, I think, wake up to the programming
and de-program ourselves.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.460
And if we become aware of the fact that what
we are programming our kids from generation

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.300
to generation is repressive.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.960
We can decide not to do that and to take on
alternative ideas.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.800
We can be, for instance . . . We can wake
up to the fact that the God that says in Chapter

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.300
4 verse 34 . . . tells the husband "you have
the right to beat your woman", is the same

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.550
God that after we are beaten and bruised,
that we pray to for comfort.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:32.930
Just waking up to that dissonance alone will,
I think, create a platform for change.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:44.060
It will create the grounds for change.
