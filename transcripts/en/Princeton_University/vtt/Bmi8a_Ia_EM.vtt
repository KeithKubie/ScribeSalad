00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:03.260
MARGARET KOVAL: I
want to drill down

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.020
on the actual work
behind the Nobel.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.780
It was for the directed
evolution of enzymes.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.910
And you describe yourself
as a protein engineer,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.410
which, if I understand
it correctly,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.410
means you get under the hood of
these proteins, these enzymes,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.920
and tinker with them to
make them do something

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.540
that they don't do naturally.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.200
Can you explain why anybody
would want to do that?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.740
Why enzymes?

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.080
FRANCES ARNOLD: If you
look at how biology takes

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.730
renewable resources, simple
starting materials like carbon

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.020
dioxide and sunlight, and
converts that into life,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.680
into living
organisms, the enzymes

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.620
are the catalysts, the
workhorses of life that

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.500
do that magical transformation.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.380
So when I saw an enzyme
for the first time

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.620
and realized what a beautiful
molecular machine this was,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.190
I said, that's what
I want to engineer.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.100
MARGARET KOVAL: Your work
started maybe 25 years

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.960
ago or so.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.174
What has been the outcome in
the last couple of decades?

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:05.090
FRANCES ARNOLD: These
methods are sufficiently

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.230
simple that they
propagated to laboratories

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.370
all over the world.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.970
For example, Merck makes
some of their biggest drugs

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
using enzymes that replace
toxic metals that they used

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.590
to use in chemical
processes and really reduced

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.460
the waste footprint of
making pharmaceuticals.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.770
The enzymes you find in
your laundry detergent that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.870
take stains off
clothes -- nature never

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.320
made an enzyme that likes to
work in laundry detergents,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.630
but people bred them using
my methods to work very well.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.080
Enzymes help you use much
less energy so you don't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.640
have to use high temperatures.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.306
MARGARET KOVAL: Why
would a young person

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:48.230
go into chemical engineering
or bioengineering today?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.584
What might we see in 30
years as a result of it?

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:53.000
FRANCES ARNOLD: I
personally would

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.210
love to see a chemicals
industry that's

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.580
based entirely on clean,
green biological processes.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.280
Replace these
factories with bacteria

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.350
to make what we need
in our daily lives,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.500
and do it from
renewable resources.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.250
MARGARET KOVAL: I'm
going to spin you back

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.470
if I can a little bit
to when you started here

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.970
at Princeton University.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.040
What kinds of other
courses did you take?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.090
I know that you're a
linguist, for example.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300
FRANCES ARNOLD: I took a
lot of language courses.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.280
I took Russian.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.900
I took Russian literature.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.820
Those were fabulous courses.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.960
I took economics.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.630
I took developing
world economics.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.000
I took Marxist theory.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.180
I did all sorts of things
that you wouldn't normally

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.520
find on the engineer's docket,
but it made an educated person

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.150
out of me.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.025
MARGARET KOVAL: Yeah.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:45.710
But do you think it helped feed
the creativity that ultimately

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.660
made you successful
as a scientist?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.240
FRANCES ARNOLD: I
can't imagine not

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.410
being able to read and write
and make these connections

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.520
from literature and philosophy
that have helped inform

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.110
my understanding of evolution.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.059
So the answer is clearly yes.

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.850
MARGARET KOVAL: Now
and forever more you're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.390
going to be considered a
role model for women in STEM.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.860
Is that something
that you embrace?

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.360
FRANCES ARNOLD: So
what I want to do

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.440
is encourage women to take
on this incredibly exciting

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.980
and fun challenge,
to use their brains

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.140
for the benefit of humanity
through science and technology.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.040
Don't let the guys have this.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.394
This is great career material.

00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:29.310
MARGARET KOVAL: Right.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.410
Well, OK.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.780
With that, I'm going to say
thank you very, very much

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.560
for joining us, Frances Arnold.
