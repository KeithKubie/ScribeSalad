00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.280
Calculate the sum of all
positive divisors of 27,000.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.100
The easiest thing that
I can think of doing

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.237
is first take the prime
factorization of 27,000,

00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:12.570
and then that will help us
kind of structure our thought

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.370
of what all of the
different divisors of 27,000

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.020
would have to look like.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:26.140
So 27,000 is the same thing
as 27 times 1,000, which

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.470
is the same thing as 3 to the
third times 10 to the third,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.590
and 10 is, of course, the
same thing as 2 times 5.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.690
So this is the same thing
as 2 times 5 to the third,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.920
or it's the same thing as 2 to
the third times 5 to the third.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.560
So 27,000 is equal to
2 to the third times 3

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.660
to the third times
5 to the third.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.580
So any divisor of 27,000 is
going to have to be made up

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.590
of the product of up to three
2's, up to three 3's, and up

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.626
to three 5's.

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:05.459
So let's try to look
at all the combinations

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.000
and think of a fast
way of summing them.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.170
So let's just say it
has no fives in it.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.010
It has no fives in a divisor.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.710
So if it has no fives, then
it could have up to three

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.071
2's, so let's say
it has zero 2's.

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:20.820
So I'm just going to
take the powers of 2,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.900
so if it has zero 2's,
then we'll put a 1

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.960
here, if it has two 2's, it
has to be divisible by 4.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.860
If it has three 2's, it's
going to be divisible by 8.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.030
When I say three 2's, I
mean 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.590
Now, let's do it with the 3's.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.810
If you have, oh wait,
I forgot a power.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.660
If you have zero 2's, that means
it's just divisible by 1 from

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.630
looking at the 2's.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.830
If you have one 2, it's
divisible by just 2.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.460
If you have two 2's,
you're divisible by 4.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.050
And if you have
three 2's, and when

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.060
I mean that I'm saying
2 times 2 times 2,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630
that means you're
divisible by 8.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.716
Let's do the same thing with 3.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.340
From the point of view of the 3,
if you have no 3's, that means

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.460
at least you're divisible by 1.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.650
If you have one 3, that
means you're divisible by 3.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.800
Two 3's, or 3 times 3 means
you're divisible by 9.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.330
If you have three 3's, it
means you're divisible by 27.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.780
So let's look at all of
the possible combinations.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440
And for this grid that I'm
going to generate right here,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.760
we assume that you're
not divisible by 5,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.900
or you're only divisible
by 5 to the zero power.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.970
So what are all the
possible numbers here?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.720
Well, you have 1 times 1 is 1.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.020
That's divisible by 1 and 1.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.190
You have 1 times 3, which
is 3, 1 times 9 which is 9,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.480
1 times 27 which is 27.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.950
So these are all
the numbers that

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.760
are divisible by that have up
to three 3's in them, from zero

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.265
to three 3's in them, and
they have no twos in them.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:44.640
If you throw
another two in here,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.240
you're essentially going to
multiply all of these numbers

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.170
by two.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.655
If you throw
another two in here,

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:50.780
you're going to multiply
all of these numbers by 2.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.090
Now, before I do
this, because I want

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.490
to do this as fast as possible.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.239
I could figure out
what these numbers are,

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.540
I could multiply them.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.000
But instead, let's
just take the sum.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.040
Let's just take the
sum here of this row,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.390
of this first row
that we just did.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.770
We have 1 plus 3 plus 9
plus 27, 3 plus 27 is 30,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.330
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.160
So this is going to be 40.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.220
Now, whatever these numbers are,
they're all going to be 2 times

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.910
these numbers.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.660
So the sum is going to be
80, and the sum over here

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.390
is going to be 2 times
the previous row.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.670
Because here we multiplied by
2, here we're multiplying by 4,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.830
so it's going to be 160.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.240
And over here, we just
multiplied by 2 again,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.897
it's going to be 320.

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:37.480
Or another way of thinking about
it, whatever the sum is here,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.450
it's going to be eight times
the sum of the first row.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.340
And I could, just so
you know what I'm doing,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.756
I could actually
put numbers here.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:49.410
This number would be 8, 24,
72, and whatever 8 times 27,

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.730
I was at 160, 160
plus 56, so it's 216.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.120
But we don't want to do that.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.260
We just have to
think about the sums.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.710
So if you think about all of the
dividers of 27,000 that are not

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.870
divisible by 5-- so
they're only divisible by 5

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.910
to the zero power, I
guess you could say it.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.380
We've now figured
out their sum, it's

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.990
going to be the sum
of all of these rows.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.610
So if you take 40
plus 80, you have

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.430
120 plus 160 is 280
plus 320 is 600.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.290
So this is the situation.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.430
This is the sum of all of
the combinations of the 2's

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.290
and the 3's that don't
have any 5's in them.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.870
Now, if you took
the same combination

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.697
of 2's and 3's, so
these added up to 600,

00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:37.780
let me write it over here.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.740
So no fives Now, if you
did the same exact thing

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.220
that we just did
here, but we just

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.382
multiplied everything by 5.

00:04:49.382 --> 00:04:51.340
So we'd then be looking
at all the combinations

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.830
that have this many twos and
this many threes, and one five,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.930
what would happen to this sum?

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.730
Well, we would just
multiply it by 5.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.070
So let's multiply that by 5.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.300
So you multiply 600 by 5,
you get 30 with two zeroes,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.284
and so this is one 5 in
the prime factorization

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:11.950
of the divisors.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.500
Now, if I wanted two 5's, I
could just multiply by 5 again.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.610
So if I multiply by 5
again, I get 15,000.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.900
This is two 5's.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.490
Another way of
thinking about this,

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.730
if I just multiply
every term here

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.160
by 25, which is essentially
multiplying by 5 times 5,

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.120
this sum is going to be 600
times 25, which is 15,000.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.450
Now, if I have three
5's than I could just

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.030
multiply this by five again.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.506
5 times 15 is 50 plus 25 is 75.

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.620
So its 75,000.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.790
So now I know all the sums.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.664
If I have no 5's, the
sum of all the divisors

00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:06.096
is 600, if I have one 5,
3,000, so on and so forth.

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:07.720
If I want the sum of
everything, I just

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.320
take the sum of these numbers.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.670
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.630
So I get, well, I
have zero, zero,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.550
than in the hundreds
place, I only have a six,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.610
and then 3 plus 5 plus 5 is 13.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.350
Is that right?

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.320
Yeah, that's 13.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.634
And then carry the one,
and then I have a 9.

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:33.020
So 93,600.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:40.630
So the sum of all positive
divisors of 27,000, 93,600.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.800
Hope you found
that entertaining.
