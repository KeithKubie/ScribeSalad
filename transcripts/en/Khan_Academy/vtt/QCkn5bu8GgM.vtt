00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.130
Adolf Hitler got his
start in the military

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.850
during World War I. He
was a dispatch runner

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.070
on the Western Front.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.500
He actually gets
fairly decorated.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.120
And by most accounts, this
is where he finds meaning.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.550
He finds meaning in being
part of the military.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.040
He finds meaning in
frankly, the war itself.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.210
But then in 1918, we, of
course, have the end of the war.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.910
Well, first you have the
abdication of the Kaiser.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.470
You have the
Republican government,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.100
people who want to form
a republic, take control.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.250
And then they sign an armistice
with the Allies in November.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.022
And this is not well
received by Hitler.

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:38.480
And frankly, it's
not well received

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.466
by many in the military.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.090
From their point of
view, they somewhat

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.890
delusionally
believed that Germany

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.000
would have won World War
I if they weren't stabbed

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920
in the back by these
November Criminals,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.860
by the folks who had taken
over after the Kaiser.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.640
So you have this whole
stab in the back theory

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.250
by those who had taken over
and signed the armistice.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.800
And this wasn't just believed
by folks like Hitler.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.382
This was believed even by very
senior people in the military.

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:07.340
This right over here is
General Ludendorff, one

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.550
of two people-- the
other gentleman,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.770
Hindenburg-- who were in charge
of the entire German military.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.610
He believed in the stab
in the back theory.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.310
He thought that
they would have won

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.210
if they didn't
sign the armistice,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.085
if these November
Criminals, these people who

00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:22.585
had taken control
of the government,

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.640
did not sign this
with the Allies.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.130
And then you go to 1919.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.130
From the point of view
of people of like Hitler,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.430
things only got worse.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.950
You have the Treaty
of Versailles

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.590
that applied all the war
guilt to the Germans.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.370
You have these huge
reparations that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.040
would even be paid in resources.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.925
You have the former
German Empire,

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:41.890
a significant amount
of its territory

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.870
is given over to the Allies,
or to form new states.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.060
Then, you also have the
formal establishment

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.610
of the Weimar Republic.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.010
It's called the Weimar
Republic because

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.810
the new German constitution is
drafted in the town of Weimar.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.150
And it sets it up as a
parliamentary democracy.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.771
That's why it's
called a republic.

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:10.770
But it's a little bit of
a bizarre parliamentary

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.050
democracy.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.591
It actually gave a
good bit of power,

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.120
a directly elected
president that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.800
had a reasonable
amount of power,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.050
especially in emergencies.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.980
And that would
become relevant later

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.110
on when Hitler actually comes
to power over a decade later.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.370
But then in 1919,
Hitler was still

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.330
looking-- he was very
upset about the war ending.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.880
He stays part of the military.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.570
And part of the
military he's assigned

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.190
to start infiltrating or spying
on the German Workers' Party.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.895
And the acronym in
German is the DAP.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.270
But the English
translation would

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.100
be the German Workers' Party.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.480
But he actually gets quite
impressed by the German

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.810
Workers' Party, which is
really ultra-nationalist.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.710
And when we talk about
ultra-nationalist

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.380
it's all about German
race superiority.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.800
It's in line with
this whole idea

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.770
that they would have
won the war if they

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.330
weren't stabbed in the back.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.842
And it's also anti-communist.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.620
It's anti-capitalist.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.890
And it's anti ethnic minorities,
in particular anti-Jewish.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.410
And all of these ideas
Hitler found very impressive.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.900
And just to be clear, a lot
of times when people talk

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.340
about ultra-nationalist
groups they often

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.930
will call them as
ultra-right wing.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.730
And this bears
some clarification

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.290
because the right wing
is also often viewed

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.210
as very capitalist.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.280
But ultra-nationalists really
put the nation, and the race

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.290
that they view as
indicative of the nation,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.760
above all other concerns.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.410
So yes, they were
anti-communist.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.480
They were anti-distribution
of wealth.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.610
Communists believe
in no classes,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.900
as little private
property as possible.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.340
The German Workers' party
didn't believe in that.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.260
They were anti that.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.850
But they were also anti
unfettered capitalism,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.500
especially capitalism
that might get

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.150
in the way of the
nation's interests.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.339
But he becomes very
impressed with them.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.760
And he actually joins
as the 55th member.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.040
So you can imagine,
this, at this point,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.060
is a very, very small party.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.000
But then we fast
forward to 1920.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.430
By 1920, the party leadership
has taken note of Hitler.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.790
They actually notice him
when he's arguing with people

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.290
and that other
people are listening.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.887
He's actually a
really great orator.

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:42.970
And so they allow him to
give more and more talks.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.600
He has more and more authority.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.870
And in order for the party
to have more of an appeal,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.740
especially to
nationalists in general,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.580
they change their name.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.390
To German Workers' Party they
add the Nationalist Socialist

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.360
German Workers' Party,
DAP, German Workers' Party,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.057
or the NSDAP.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.980
And if you pronounce
nationalist in German,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.396
it sounds something
like-- and I'm

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:12.770
going to butcher it
right now-- Nazionalist.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.220
And so, if you
were to shorten it,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.760
they called
themselves the Nazis.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.710
And Hitler actually
designed the logo

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.800
for the Nazis, which
included this symbol

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.230
right over here, the swastika.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.410
And the swastika is
worth talking about

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.990
because it was really this
bizarre corruption of a very

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.710
ancient symbol.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.580
Hitler and the Nazis created
this entire mythology

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.240
around the Germans being the
descendants of the Aryans,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.300
or being the purest
example of the Aryans.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.080
And the Aryans are
the superior race

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.560
that's responsible for all of
civilization's advancement.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.370
It was a delusion
because frankly, there

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.350
was an ancient Aryan race.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.550
But the most indicative
descendants of them

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.516
are frankly, the
Persians or the Indians.

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:01.140
And actually, the
swastika symbol here,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.181
you might actually even
see it at a Hindu temple.

00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:07.000
It does not mean all of what
we associate with Nazism now.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.810
It actually is an ancient
Hindu symbol of auspiciousness,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.450
of good luck.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.480
But the Nazis usurped it.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.940
But for them, this was
a very important idea

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.052
to create this mythology
around race superiority

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:22.260
and to even have a symbol
like this as opposed to say

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.301
something like a cross
that's a religious symbol.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:28.764
Anyone could believe in
Christianity and say, hey,

00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:29.430
I'm a Christian.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.060
But the swastika, at least in
Hitler's mind and the Nazi's

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.370
mind, was a racial symbol.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.270
So it represented
their superior race.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.175
And obviously, if their
race was superior,

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:45.450
a lot of what they consider
the ills of Germany

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.380
were caused by being infiltrated
with what they considered less

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.150
pure races, like Jews,
and also infiltrated

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.760
with less pure ideas, like
the ideas of communism.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.560
But Hitler gets more and more
recognition with the party.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.220
The party membership
continues to grow.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.350
And by 1921, you have some
disagreements in the party.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.620
Some people threatened
to splinter off.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.794
And when Hitler says, hey look,
if this is going to happen,

00:07:13.794 --> 00:07:15.210
I'm going to leave
the party, they

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.230
realize that he has so
much value to the party

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.550
that the party would just
dissolve if Hitler leaves.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.170
And so they make
him the chairman.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.880
Hitler takes control.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.590
Hitler is the chairman
of the Nazi party.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.100
And by this point, he's
becoming more and more well

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.420
known on the speaking circuit.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.330
And we now have several thousand
members of the Nazi party.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.340
Although, it's still
a fairly small group.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.183
But then, things start to get
a lot worse in Weimar, Germany.

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:49.516
You start having hyperinflation.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:58.280
The government keeps printing
more and more currency.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.300
The economy is weak.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.070
It's trying to pay reparations.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.300
And so what you have
here-- and this is actually

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.740
one of the most famous cases
of hyperinflation in world

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.390
history-- you see the
value of their currency,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:13.030
it devalues from 1919 to
1923 not by a factor of 1,000

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.710
or a million or a billion,
but nearly a trillion.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.655
So the currency becomes,
frankly, worthless.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:25.050
The hyperinflation is
happening this entire time.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.700
And you see, it accelerates
through 1922 and then 1923.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.890
But then in 1922,
you have Mussolini

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.539
comes to power in Italy.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:36.909
And he comes to power
through his March on Rome.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.325
And Mussolini is a fascist.

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:40.700
That's where the
word comes from.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.630
He's a member of
the Fascist Party.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.940
And the Fascists' ideas were
very similar to the Nazis.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.850
It was all about extreme
nationalism, all about

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.040
racial superiority, a
very strong government.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.720
And this Hitler finds
quite inspiring.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.832
The Weimar Republic is
having economic difficulty.

00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:01.040
You have many other groups,
including the communists,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.170
attempt their own coup d'etats.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.100
They fail.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.070
But things are getting
less and less stable.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.220
And then you fast
forward to 1923.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.020
The inflation is getting
super bad, about as bad

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.000
as inflation can get.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.640
The currency is worthless.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.772
The economy is going
into a tailspin.

00:09:19.772 --> 00:09:21.230
And on top of that,
because Germany

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.730
can't pay the reparations
to France anymore,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.050
France occupies the Ruhr.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.280
So the Ruhr region is
occupied by France.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.920
And you might remember
from the terms

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.320
of the Treaty of
Versailles, the Saar region

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.480
was already being occupied.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.200
And all that coal was being
shipped out to France.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.530
The Ruhr region was
another significant region

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.490
of coal and steel production.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.350
And now the French are
fully occupying this.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.870
They're forcing a lot of the
civilians out of the region.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.370
They're forcing a
lot of the workers

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.480
to work in the mines
and the factories.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.940
And then they're shipping all
of that supply out to France.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.200
So this further
debilitates the economy,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.510
but it's a huge humiliation.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.780
The Treaty of Versailles,
in the minds of Germans,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.520
especially in the minds of
nationalists, was bad enough.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.435
But now you have this huge
humiliation by the French.

00:10:10.435 --> 00:10:12.310
And this isn't just
amongst the nationalists.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.530
The general German population is
getting very, very, very, very

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.030
upset about this.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.840
And so this gives a lot of fuel
to extreme nationalist groups,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.410
like the Nazis.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.250
So this fuels the Nazis.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.850
And based on the
estimates I've seen,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.475
entering into the
year they're starting

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:30.642
to have in excess
of 10,000 members,

00:10:30.642 --> 00:10:32.350
starting to be several
tens of thousands.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.020
And as we get into the
later part of the year,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.610
we're approaching,
I've seen estimates

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:42.250
of 40,000 to 55,000
members of the Nazi party.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.594
And that's just formal members.

00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:45.010
And then on top
of that, you might

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.610
have non-members who are growing
increasingly sympathetic.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.360
And so what we'll see in the
next video, at the end of 1923,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.870
Hitler sees this as his chance.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.730
He's inspired by Mussolini,
the economy is in a tailspin,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.830
the Germans have been further
humiliated by the French,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.830
and the Nazis, in
particular, are

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.550
starting to get quite popular.
