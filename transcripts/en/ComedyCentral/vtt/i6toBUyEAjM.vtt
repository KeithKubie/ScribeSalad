THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO
THE SHOW.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:03.770 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU!

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:04.904 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:08.541 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT WAS SUCH AN
AMAZING THING THAT HAPPENED.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.176 line:91%
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION
WHEN YOU SAW THAT IN YOUR SON'S

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
TEXTBOOK?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.180 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I KIND OF CHUCKLED
BECAUSE OF HIS TEXT MESSAGE.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.816 line:91%
I KNEW HE WAS BEING SARCASTIC
WAS, "WE WAS REAL HARD WORKERS,

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.752 align:start position:0% line:85%
WEREN'T WE?"

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.889 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT IT WAS EQUALLY
RIDICULOUS.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.157 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.526 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S JUST AMAZING TO
ME, IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE REPORTED

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON SOME STORIES.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.762 line:91%
DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOME SOFT
SELLING ON SOME OF THE BAD PARTS

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.131 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF AMERICAN HISTORY TO MAKE KIDS
FEEL BETTER?

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.699 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:34.933 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.336 line:91%
I BELIEVE WE WANT TO TELL THESE
STORIES CAN WE WANT TO SOFTEN

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.470 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEM.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:41.174 size:84% position:42% line:91%
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE WANT TO
WRITE HISTORY WITH A PENCIL

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:44.343 size:81% position:41% line:85%
INSTEAD OF A BLEEDING PEN.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.412 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.981 align:start position:0% line:85%
<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.182 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.784 line:91%
BUT IT'S LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
HURT THEIR FEELINGS IF WE TELL

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE TRUTH.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:56.155 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LIKE WE DON'T WANT TO TELL
THEM THEY WERE SLAVES AND WE

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:00.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
KIDNAPPED THEM.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.095 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES, YOU DID.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT MAKES US BETTER
TO KNOW THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.898 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: KNOWING THOSE TRUTHS
HELPS YOU MOVE PAST IT.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.003 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
TO SEE WHO WE WERE AS A COUNTRY

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:16.409 line:91%
TO SEE WHERE WE CAME FROM, TO
SEE WE DIDN'T START OFF-- WE'RE

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM, THAT

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.448 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE PERFECT AND THE BOTTOM
LINE IS WE HAVE SOME UGLINESS IN

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.550 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR PAST, TOO, AND WE NEED TO
OWN IT.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.686 align:start position:0% line:85%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.854 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.723 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO TRUE.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.058 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND ALL OF US WERE INVOLVED IN
THE PAST.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.260 line:91%
BUT ALL OF US ARE INVOLVED IN
MAKING A BETTER FUTURE, TOO.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.796 line:91%
HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS
FOR PARENTS TO BE VIGILANT WITH

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEIR KIDS' EDUCATION AND THAT
TYPE OF THING?

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.934 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, MY GOSH.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:43.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT IS EVERYTHING.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:44.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY PIECE OF PAPER THAT COMES
HOME.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.771 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVERY ASSIGNMENT.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.005 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, DIG THROUGH THAT
BACKPACK.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.877 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO FIND
OUT WHAT THEY WERE TEACHING THEM

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.677 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.914 align:start position:0% line:85%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.349 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.819 line:91%
AND TO McGRAW-HILL'S CREDIT,
THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THIS

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:04.257 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHAT ARE THEY, LIKE-- PUT
SOME STICKERS--

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO DO
STICKERS IS APPARENTLY THE NEW

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.360 align:start position:0% line:85%
THING.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.996 line:91%
I GUESS TEACHERS ARE SUPPOSED TO
TAKE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY AND

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.997 align:start position:0% line:85%
STICK BOOKS.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.532 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.500 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WASN'T COVERING UP
INFORMATION THAT GOT THEM IN

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.569 size:84% position:42% line:85%
TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.105 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO MORE STICKERS.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.674 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT I THINK YOU AND
YOUR SON HAVE DONE IS REALLY,

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:25.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
REALLY SPECIAL, AND WE WANTED TO
GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:33.486 line:91%
SOMETHING TO REMIND YOU OF THE
VIGILANCE AND WE ARE PRESENTING

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.190 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WITH THE "THE NIGHTLY SHOW"
STAY WOK AWARD.
