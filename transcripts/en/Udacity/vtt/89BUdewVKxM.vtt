00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.040
So that completes the last portion of this

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.990
lesson module, where we visited the structure of parallel

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.060
operating systems and in particular looked at tornado as

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.830
a case study. This completes the second major module

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.450
in the advance operating systems course, namely parallel systems.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870
I expect you to carefully read the papers we

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.170
have covered in this module which I've listed in

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.890
the required readings for the course, and which served

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.440
as the inspiration for the lectures that I gave you in this module. I want

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.830
to emphasize once more the importance of reading

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.530
and understanding the performance sections, of all the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.950
papers. Both to understand the techniques and methodologies

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.540
therein, even if the actual results may not

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.790
be that relevant due to the dated nature

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.090
of the systems on which they've been implemented.
