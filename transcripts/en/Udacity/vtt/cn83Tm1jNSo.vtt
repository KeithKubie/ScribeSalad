[David] I'm very excited to be able to announce our new class

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:06.454
and we found a fantastic professor to teach it. Welcome!

00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:09.078
[Wes] I'm Wes Weimer and I'm going to be your guide on a course

00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:13.477
about programming languages. And I think that's the topic of ultimate mastery.

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:17.612
We're going to cover concepts from engineering, the liberal arts

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.695
and the sciences as we work together to build a web browser,

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:26.644
a program that reads in web pages and produces pictures as a result.

00:00:26.644 --> 00:00:30.444
We're going to learn to understand HTML and Javascript

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:34.494
from the inside out, by writing a program that understands them.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:36.495
Come join me!

00:00:36.495 --> 09:59:59.000
CS 262: Programming languages. Taught by Professor Wes Weimer.
