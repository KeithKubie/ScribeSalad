00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.310
We know that new plate
material is being formed,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.090
and these lithosphere plates
on the surface of the Earth

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.420
are moving around.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.820
And that might raise the
question in your brain--

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.130
what happens if we
kind of reverse things?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.900
We know the direction
they're moving in.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.480
What does that tell us
about where they came from?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.340
So let's just do the
thought experiment.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.280
Right now, South
America and Africa

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.850
are moving away from each other,
because of new plate material

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.750
being created at the
mid-Atlantic rift.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.660
Let's rewind it.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.955
Let's bring them back together.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.480
We know that India is jamming
into the Eurasian Plate right

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.810
now, causing the Himalayas
to get higher and higher.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.310
What if we rewind that?

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.280
Let's bring India back
down towards Antarctica.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.710
Same thing with Australia.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.100
We have new plate
material being formed

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.550
between Australia
and Antarctica that's

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.480
making the continents
move apart.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.050
Let's bring them back together.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.550
Let's rewind the clock.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.090
Even North America-- it's not
as obvious from this diagram,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.170
but if you actually
look at the GPS data,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.290
it becomes pretty obvious
that North America, right now

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.990
is moving in a
counterclockwise rotation.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.610
So let's rewind it
into a-- let's go back,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.000
moving it in a
clockwise direction.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.640
Let's, instead of Eurasia
going further away

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.110
from North America, let's
bring it back together.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.890
And so what you could
imagine is a reality

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.890
where India, Australia
are jammed down

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.000
into South America--
sorry, into Antarctica.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420
South America and Africa
are jammed together.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.320
North America is
jammed in there.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.960
And essentially, Eurasia
is also jammed in there.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.580
So it looks like they
all would clump together

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.370
if you go back a few
hundred million years.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.890
And based on, literally--
based on just that thought

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.930
experiment, you could
imagine at one point,

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.580
all of the continents
on the world

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.070
were merged into
one supercontinent.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.460
And that supercontinent
is called Pangaea-- pan

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.710
for entire, or whole, and
gaea, coming from Gaia,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.370
for the world.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.240
And it turns out that all of
the evidence we've seen actually

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.360
does make us believe that there
was a supercontinent called--

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.796
well, we call it Pangaea, now.

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.170
Obviously, there
probably weren't

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.012
things on the planet calling
it anything back then.

00:02:20.012 --> 00:02:22.525
Or, there were things
back then, but not

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.900
things that would actually go
and try to label continents

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.310
that we know of.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.370
But all of the evidence tells us
that Pangaea existed about 200

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.540
to 300 million years ago,
roughly maybe 250 million,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.342
give or take, years ago.

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:37.300
And I want to be clear.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.990
This was not the
first supercontinent.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.490
To a large degree, it's kind of
the most recent supercontinent.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.800
And it's easiest
for us to construct

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.100
because it was the
most recent one.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.480
But we believe that there
were other supercontinents

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.830
before this.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.510
That if you rewind
even more that you

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.750
would have to break up
Pangaea and it would reform.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.170
But we're now
going back in time.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.920
Or that there were
several supercontinents

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.260
in the past that broke up,
reformed, broke up, reformed.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.380
And the last time we
had a supercontinent

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.210
was Pangaea, about
250 million years ago.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.050
And now it's broken up into
our current day geography.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.840
Now, I won't go into
all of the detail

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.540
why we believe that there was a
Pangaea about 250 million years

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.970
ago-- or, this diagram tells
us, about 225 million years ago,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.980
give or take.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.610
But I'll go into some of
the interesting evidence.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.350
On a very high
level, you have a lot

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.710
of rock commonalities
between things

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.156
that would have had to
combine during Pangaea.

00:03:36.156 --> 00:03:37.780
And probably the most
interesting thing

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.770
is the fossil evidence.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.840
There are a whole
bunch of fossils.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.940
And here are examples
of it, from species

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.110
that were around between 200
and 300 million years ago.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.740
And their fossils are found
in a very specific place.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.230
This animal right
here, cynognathus--

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.770
I hope I'm pronouncing
that right-- cynognathus.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.070
This animal's fossils
are only found

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.870
in this area of South
America on a nice clean band

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.620
here, and in this
part of Africa.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.710
So not only does
South America look

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.490
like it fits very
nicely into Africa.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.220
But the fossil
evidence also makes

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.810
it look like there was
a nice clean band where

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.600
this animal lived and
where we find the fossils.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.810
So it really makes it seem
like these were connected,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.870
at least when this
animal lived, maybe

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.840
on the order of 250
million years ago.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.070
This species right
over here, its fossils

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.310
are found in this
area-- let me do it

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.720
in a color that has more
contrast-- in this area

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.060
right over here.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.060
This plant, its
fossils-- now, this

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.670
starts to connect to a lot of
dots between a lot of cont--

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.390
its fossils are found
in this entire area,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.100
across South America,
Africa, Antarctica,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.230
India, and Australia.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.151
And so not only does it
look like the continents fit

00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.650
together in a puzzle
piece, not only

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.436
do we get it to a
configuration like this

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:00.310
if we essentially just
rewind to the movement

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.990
that we're seeing now-- but
the fossil evidence also

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.030
kind of confirms that they
fit together in this way,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.340
This animal right
here, we find fossils

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.180
on this nice stripe that goes
from Africa through India,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.920
all the way to Antarctica.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.880
Now, this only gives us evidence
of the Southern Hemisphere

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.780
of Pangaea.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.030
But there is other evidence.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.590
We find kind of
continuing mountain chains

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.960
between North
America and Europe.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.650
We find rock evidence,
where just the way

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.760
we see the fossils
line up nicely.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.980
We see common rock that lines
up nicely between South America

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.300
and Africa and other continents
that were at once connected.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.450
So all the evidence, as
far as we can tell now,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.970
does make us think that there
at one time was a Pangaea.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.889
And, for all we know,
all the continents

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:50.930
are going to keep moving.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.640
And maybe in a few
hundred million years,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.740
we'll have another
supercontinent.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.202
Who knows?
