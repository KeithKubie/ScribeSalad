&gt;&gt; Voiceover: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Hello everyone,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.900
my name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.440
I'm the director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.010
at the Library of Congress,
and I want to welcome you today

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.130
to the latest in our
ongoing lecture series,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.540
the Benjamin Botkin Lecture
Series, and I just want to note,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
for the record, and for
posterity, that I'm speaking

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.590
to a beyond standing-room-only
audience, which is terrific.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.510
The Botkin Series --

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.950
The Botkin series allows us to
highlight current scholarship

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.220
from distinguished scholars
in ethnomusicology, folklore,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.680
oral history, cultural
heritage studies,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.580
and other related fields.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.910
It also, for the
American Folklife Center,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.810
allows us to accomplish
a couple of other things,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.350
and one important thing is that
it feeds into our acquisitions.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.940
We record all of these lectures,
so that later, on the website,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.370
and generations later, folks
can hear this lecture today.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.270
So with that said, if you have
any electronics turned on,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.410
please turn them
off at this point.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.900
We'd appreciate it.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.450
Today I have the honor of
introducing a very distinguished

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.340
at ethnomusicologist,
folklorist,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.080
and musician, Jeff Todd Titon.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.460
Professor Titon received his BA
from Amherst College and his MA

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.700
in English and PhD in American
studies from the University

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.510
of Minnesota, where he studied
ethnomusicology with Alan Kagan.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.390
He's done extensive fieldwork
on religious folk music, blues,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.370
and old-time fiddling, and
he's the author, or editor,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.900
of numerous books, including
Early Down-Home Blues,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.700
for which he was awarded the
prestigious ASCAP Deans Taylor

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.030
Award; Worlds of Music, a
classic ethnomusicology textbook

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.050
that has gone through
five printings

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.750
since it first appeared in 1984.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.910
Powerhouse for God, a book, a
record, and a documentary film;

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.370
Old-Time Kentucky Fiddle Tunes,
and American Musical Traditions.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.500
In addition to all of this
writing and publishing,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.560
Jeff also served as the
editor of Ethnomusicology,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.510
The Journal for the Society

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.760
of Ethnomusicology
during the 1990s.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.140
His teaching career has, well,
began at Tufts University,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.460
and he later went
to Brown University,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.940
where he was a professor for
roughly -- almost 20 years,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.640
not quite, and he's been
a visiting professor

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.600
at numerous colleges, including,
I know, Indiana University,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.230
my alma mater, Carleton College,
Amherst, and Berea College.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.410
He's also a fellow of the
American Folklore Society

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.250
and was recently
elected to the board

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.740
of the American Folklore
Society.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.810
His current projects
include fieldwork with Old,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.600
Regular Baptists in
Eastern Kentucky,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.780
with whom he's already
produced two CDs

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.310
for Smithsonian Folkways.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.010
He is developing a website
on the life and preaching

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.660
of the Reverend C.L. Franklin,
father of Aretha Franklin.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.890
He has a fabulous blog on
music sound and sustainability,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.840
which I encourage you
to go and look at.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.430
Maybe he'll give you the URL.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.440
At any rate, as you can
imagine, I could go on.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.550
And so, I think I'll
stop right here.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.580
I'd just like to add that Jeff
has also recently donated some

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.720
of his collections to the
American Folklife Center,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.640
which we're very pleased about,
and I want to encourage you

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.670
to come and use that material.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.840
So without further ado, then,
I will just simply turn this

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.150
over to Professor
Jeff Todd Titon.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.750
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon:
Thank you, Betsy.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.550
Thank you, Betsy.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.840
Thank you, Betsy, and
thank you all for coming.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.140
Can you hear me?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.110
Is this all right?

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.410
It's good?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.550
Okay. It's a little overwhelming
to see all of you out here.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.090
I hope I have something
that might interest you.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.830
I'm sure I'll --

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.270
[ Laughter ]

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.980
-- have something to say,
I will at some point.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.110
I hope. This is a talk about
applied ethnomusicology,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.210
what it is, and why they said
such terrible things about it.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.850
It's not a very original title,
and I apologize for that,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.010
but I thought it
might be of interest.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.330
At least, some people wonder
what the terrible things are.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.980
They include such things as
irrelevant and imperialism

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.590
and political interference
and, let's see.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.190
A good phrase was manipulating
the destinies of people.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.000
Another one was spying.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.340
So we'll get to those
in a little while.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.800
I want to begin this with a
confrontation that took place

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.780
in the winter of 1939, an
encounter between Alan Lomax,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.500
who I'm sure is well known
to all of you, and somebody

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.830
who may not be so
well-known, George Herzog.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.240
Lomax had moved to New
York temporarily in 1939,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.670
with the permission of his
employer, then the Library

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.810
of Congress, to take
courses in music

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.800
and anthropology at Columbia.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.390
At that time, Herzog
was a Columbia professor

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.000
of anthropology and also
the most powerful figure

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.340
in comparative musicology,
which is one

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.290
of the ancestors
of ethnomusicology.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.290
No doubt, Lomax told Herzog
who he was and why he wanted

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.310
to take his course in folk
music as a special student,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.010
but Herzog refused to let him

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.570
in because Lomax had taken
the prerequisite course study

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.490
offered in primitive music.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.200
And those of you who knew Alan
can only imagine the scene.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.210
Herzog had a terrible
temper, and Alan wrote back

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.400
to his supervisor, Harold
Spivacke, at the Library

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.150
of Congress, and he said, "I met
a very much-surprised Dr. Herzog

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.060
at Columbia this morning,
a Dr. Herzog who told me

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.110
that I'd made a great
mistake in coming to school

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.610
to take his course this term.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.040
That I should've come next
term, should've come next year,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
and for a whole year,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.510
such a neurotic little academic
man you never saw before."

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.100
[ Laughter ]

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.230
So, he never took the course,
and I take this confrontation

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.700
between Lomax and Herzog
to foreshadow the problems

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.900
of applied work, that
applied work would have

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.180
within ethnomusicology, at
least in the early years,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.850
and why ethnomusicologists
might say

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.790
such terrible things about it.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.610
In 1939, when their
confrontation took place,

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.950
of course, the field
ethnomusicology didn't

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.250
yet exist.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.580
The word wasn't even coined
until 1950, and the Society

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.470
for Ethnomusicology wasn't
established until 1955.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.040
But if anybody was doing
ethnomusicology in America

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.530
in 1939, it was George Herzog,
and as both Daniel Sheehy

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.360
and Anthony Seeger
have pointed out,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.490
Alan Lomax was doing applied
ethnomusicology before it got

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.580
its name either.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.020
So between its naming in 1950
and the death of Alan Merriam

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.000
in 1980, ethnomusicology often
was described as a marriage

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.860
of comparative musicology,
with cultural anthropology.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.360
During that same period,
applied anthropology was one

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.210
of anthropology's emergent
and exciting growth areas.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.790
We would expect that an applied
ethnomusicology would have

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.120
emerged then and grown, as
well, but that did not happen

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.930
until the 1980s, and instead,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.680
ethnomusicologists said
terrible things about it.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.700
Why they did so, and why applied
ethnomusicology wasn't accepted

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.860
until the 1980s, is one of
my subjects this morning,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.210
or this noon I guess it is.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.800
The other, of course, is what
is applied ethnomusicology,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.170
and what do applied
ethnomusicologists actually do?

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.100
And of course, I'll
give you my take on it.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.370
There are different
opinions, of course,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.220
and what it is and what we do.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.700
But at any rate, it's
important to know that today,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.570
applied ethnomusicology
is well established as one

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.270
of the strongest branches
of academic ethnomusicology.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.380
Among the sections of the
Society for Ethnomusicology,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.740
the applied section is the
third-largest in membership.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.980
Only the student section and
the popular music section

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.280
are larger.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.900
Herzog would've been
rolling in his grave at that.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.630
And so, before going to
that history, before getting

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.890
to that history and some
of the terrible things

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.270
and what happened to
turn things around,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.290
I want to propose a definition
of applied ethnomusicology

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.670
and offer some examples of what
applied ethnomusicologists do.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.440
Many of you here will
be familiar with this,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.010
and some of you practice
applied ethnomusicology.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.960
There's a lot of
information here,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.350
much of it never before
presented to the public,

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.800
and that's why am
relying on my notes.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.110
I want to do what I can
to get it right for you.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.100
I like to think of
ethnomusicology as the study

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.530
of people making music.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.860
Applied ethnomusicology
puts the study

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.900
of people making music
to practical use.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.710
Now that's a very
broad definition.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.770
More specifically, as it's
developed in North America

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.920
and elsewhere, applied
ethnomusicology is a

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.980
music-centered intervention

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.300
into a particular
community whose purpose is

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.040
to benefit that community.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.890
For example, a social
improvement, a musical benefit,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.900
a cultural good, or
an economic advantage.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.430
It's music-centered,
but above all,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.650
the intervention
is people-centered.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.000
For the understanding

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.740
that drives it towards
reciprocity is based

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.140
in collaborative
partnerships that arise

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.540
from ethnomusicological
fieldwork.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.160
Applied ethnomusicology is
guided by ethical principles

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.870
of social responsibility,
human rights, cultural

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.240
and musical equity, and justice.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.550
Although some ethnomusicologists
regard applied ethnomusicology

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.980
as a career alternative
to academic work,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.940
I don't think it's helpful
to make that distinction,

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.350
because ethnomusicologists

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.270
who do applied work are
employed both inside and outside

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.400
of academic institutions.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.890
In other words, the place

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.740
of employment doesn't
determine whether the study

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.740
of people making music has
any application outside

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.380
of the world of scholarship.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.460
What matters is the
work itself, how, where,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.840
and why the intervention
occurs and the communities

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.700
to whom we feel responsible.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.260
What kinds of activities are
applied ethnomusicologists

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.560
involved in?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.940
Where, typically, do we
intervene in the public sphere?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.880
Applied ethnomusicology is
practiced internationally,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.330
but because I'm most
familiar with activities

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.420
in the United States, and the
professional organization based

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.770
here, that is, the Society
for Ethnomusicology, or SEM,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.240
as I'll sometimes call
it, all concentrate

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.300
on US-based applied
ethnomusicology.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.730
First, like public
folklorists, we're involved

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.920
in promoting music, dance, and
other cultural expressions,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.410
in order to benefit artists and
communities, whether undertaken

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.150
by ethnomusicologists acting
primarily on their own behalf,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.220
or whether supported by
cultural organizations,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.030
these cultural policy
interventions are among the

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.550
oldest types of applied
ethnomusicology

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.730
and remain one of
the most common.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.950
Lately, sustainability has
become the generally accepted

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.250
policy goal.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.390
At the moment, I am trying to
push cultural sustainability

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.530
in the direction of
cultural resilience,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.390
but that is a story
for another time.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.240
Examples of these policy
interventions include working

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.770
with and for granting
agencies to promote the arts,

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.290
and with organizations devoted

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.330
to expanding the creative
economy through musical heritage

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.430
and cultural tourism, sometimes
with a view to recovering

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.590
from disasters, such as
hurricanes, urban blight,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.960
and mountaintop removal.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.010
In the 21st century, as
most of you know very well,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.670
UNESCO has become the
major international force

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.690
and cultural policy, with
its treaties encouraging the

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.070
preservation of what it calls
"intangible cultural heritage."

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.790
The US has not signed
these treaties,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.270
but because our work takes
us all over the world,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.580
many US-based ethnomusicologists
are involved

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.060
with UNESCO activities anyway.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.380
Ethnomusicologists have
worked as consultants,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.760
as arts administrators,
ethnographic field workers,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.400
festival presenters, radio and
television producers, podcasters

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.950
and Internet site developers,
educators, facilitators,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.780
mediators, writers,
expert witnesses,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.290
and in various other
capacities, formulating

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.550
and administering cultural
policies whose purpose is

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.940
cultural, economic,
and musical benefit,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.400
as informed by social
responsibility and justice.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.150
Another area of practice

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.070
for applied ethnomusicologists
is advocacy, either on behalf

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.020
of particular music makers or
a music community as a whole.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.400
Rather than adopt the role

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.370
of objective observer
gathering information,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.540
the applied ethnomusicologist
assumes the role of a partisan,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.180
working in partnership
towards goals

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.650
that are mutually
understood and agreed on.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.530
Seldom has partnership worked

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.720
when the ethnomusicologist
plays the role of the expert

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.160
and imposes solutions

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.550
to problems perceived
from a distance.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.830
Advocacy includes grant
writing on behalf of individuals

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.420
and communities, writing
promotional and press materials,

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.130
acting as an agent to
arrange performances,

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.510
facilitating community self-
documentation initiatives,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.310
repatriation of recordings and
musical artifacts from museums

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.270
and archives, political
lobbying for arts spaces,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.240
facilitating community
arts education projects,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.530
of researching the history
of musical traditions

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.450
for the community,
acting as an intermediary

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.580
between cultural insiders and
outside, and long-term planning

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.310
for the sustainability
of music cultures.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.780
A third area that applied
ethnomusicologists are involved

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.640
with is education.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.850
Often, educators ourselves,
applied ethnomusicologists work

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.410
with other educators designing
curricula and to bring musicians

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.180
into the schools and community
centers to demonstrate

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.980
to teach and to perform.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.020
They also facilitate
visits to performance spaces

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.690
where people may observe
and sometimes participate

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.620
in music-making activities.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.920
Like folklorists,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.450
ethnomusicologists have been
active in fostering interest

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.810
in local musical artists
and traditions, particularly

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.330
from newly arrived
cultural and ethnic groups.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.420
Other areas of contemporary
practice include peace

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.480
and conflict resolution,
medicine,

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.960
law and the music
industry, libraries, museums

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.990
and sound archives, journalism,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.830
and environmental sound
activism and eco-justice.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.420
Peace-related applications
are more frequent outside

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.460
of North America, as
among refugee populations

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:36.230
and in conflict regions, such as
The Balkans and the Middle East,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.360
while music has been an
important part of labor

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.710
and civil rights movements
in the United States

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.660
since the 19th century
and probably before.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.570
Among the projects of medical
ethnomusicology are HIV/AIDS

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.690
work in Africa, therapeutic work

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.400
with posttraumatic
stress survivors,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.670
and music within
autism communities.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.810
Legal applications have involved
music copyright infringement

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.350
cases and work on
intellectual property issues,

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.160
as the question,
"Who owns culture?",

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.900
becomes increasingly
important when large sums

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.710
of money are at stake.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.440
Applied ethnomusicologists
are involved

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.810
in political action opposing
sound pollution, such as noise

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.570
from ocean vessels and military
activities that affect whales,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.790
dolphins, and other
sea creatures.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.190
We are contributing to the new
discipline of eco-musicology,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.270
which is the study of
music, sound, culture,

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.520
and nature in a time of
environmental crisis.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.600
Journalists educated and
ethnomusicology bring

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.390
to world music a broadly
informed, historical,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.340
and geographical perspective.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.280
We've written for
newspapers, magazines,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.180
and online publications.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.120
Ethnomusicologists working
in the music industry serve

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.090
as consultants, ethnographers,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.400
technical assists,
and producers.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.560
Many libraries, museums,
universities,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.950
and others institutions maintain
sound archives where archivists

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.470
with ethnomusicological training
offer expertise in acquisition,

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.530
cataloging, grant writing,
preservation, and outreach.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:07.100
Applied ethnomusicologists also
are gradually producing a body

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.250
of theoretical and
critical literature.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.860
In 1992, a special issue
of Ethnomusicology,

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.980
The Journal of the Society for
Ethnomusicology was devoted

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.820
to ethnomusicology in
the public interest.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.360
It featured essays by Daniel
Sheehy, Bess Lomax-Hawes,

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.510
Martha Ellen Davis,
and Anthony Seeger.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.760
In my own essay in
that special issue,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.900
I wrote that ethnomusicology
and the public interest,

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.170
"Is work whose immediate end
is not research on the flow

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.160
of knowledge inside intellectual
communities, but rather,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.050
practical action in
the world outside

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.600
of archives and universities."

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.300
and that, "As a way of
knowing and doing fieldwork

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.960
which is constitutive of
ethnomusicology, at its best,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.790
is based on friendship rather
than observation of objects."

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.990
Bess Hawes was invited to
give the Seeger Lecture

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.560
at the 1993 SEM Conference,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.520
and this autobiographical
talk meant, in part,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.050
to attract listeners to
applied ethnomusicology

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.320
and public folklore
as a calling,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.150
was published two years later
in the journal Ethnomusicology.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.620
An international conference

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.350
on applied ethnomusicology took
place at my university, Brown,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.620
in 2003, the same year
that a special issue

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.250
of Folklore Forum devoted

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.810
to applied ethnomusicology
was published.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.000
A book of essays entitled
Applied Ethnomusicology,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.620
Historical and Contemporary
Approaches, appeared in 2010,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.090
and the Oxford Handbook

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.400
of Applied Ethnomusicology
is scheduled for publication

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.400
in the summer of 2015.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.550
Let me give you an example
of applied ethnomusicology.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.520
Because I know my own work
best, please indulge me

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.420
as I show you something
from my own work.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.650
I hope it's not too
immodest to do so.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:56.410
In 1990, as a visiting professor
at Berea College in Kentucky,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.340
I spent my weekends with
Old Regular Baptists

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.400
in the southeastern part
of the state in the middle

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.820
of coal-mining country, and
after several months of getting

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.240
to know them and they me, the
head of their association,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.880
Elwood Cornett, asked me

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.660
if I could help them conserve
their singing tradition,

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.340
lined-out hymnody, which is
the oldest style and repertoire

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.050
of English language religious
music is an oral tradition

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.350
in the United States.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.610
It is a very, very complicated
and difficult way of singing.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.950
Each singer elaborates the
melody in their own way,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.250
and they don't have a conductor.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.750
They don't have musical
notation,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.230
and the music doesn't
have a pulse beat.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.290
One person sings a line,
and then the rest join in

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.920
and repeat the line to an
even more elaborate melody

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.110
in step, but out of phase.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.930
Here I want to show you a little
video clip of their singing,

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.200
so you have an idea of what
it's like, and to do that,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.500
I have to get out of here.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.680
This is a song called
Bold Soldiers.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.570
This is from a baptism, and it's

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.010
from video footage
that I shot 1990.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.510
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:20:15.510 --> 00:21:36.500
[ Singing Acapella ]

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.400
That's an example
of their singing.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.700
Women sing, too.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.370
It just happened
that in this example,

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:47.310
it was only men,
but women sing, too.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.650
Elwood Cornett, their
association leader,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.690
told me that the
elders had tried

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.750
to teach the younger
ones some years earlier,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.080
but in this culture where
modesty is palpable,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.770
the face-to-face instruction
put too much pressure

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.230
on the youngsters, and
the education failed,

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.110
and he wondered whether
I might have, you know,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.850
some ideas that might help.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.120
And we talked about it, and I
realized, I noticed that some

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.640
of the church members were
bringing cheap boomboxes

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.640
to church to record the
services, the singing

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.380
and preaching, especially
for friends and relatives

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.150
who are sick and
couldn't come to church.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.600
So I suggested that we try to
make good-quality recordings,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.220
so that the younger people might
learn the songs by singing along

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.690
in the privacy of
their homes or,

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.020
even better, in their
automobiles.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.940
And so, Elwood agreed,
and I got them a grant

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.800
from NEA Folk Arts Division.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.170
This was in the early
1990s, and I taught them how

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.800
to make good recordings
of their music,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.120
and we made some together,
and then, they made a lot more

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.800
and circulated cassettes for the
younger people to learn from.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.260
And then, Smithsonian
Folkways released a couple

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.270
of albums of their singing.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.540
Tony Seeger, on hearing
this music, said he felt

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.640
like he was surrounded by a
room full of Rosco Holcombs.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.490
Anyway, and now the singing
tradition is on firm ground,

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.910
and here's what Elwood Cornett
said about it in an interview

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.800
with Appalshop that
was broadcast

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.780
over the Appalshop Kentucky
radio station a few years ago.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.700
&gt;&gt; It would appear
to me that this way

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.660
of singing is probably much
more accepted right now

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.260
than it was a few years ago,
and I think the interest

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.150
of Jeff Titon and Willy Ruff
and some others that used to be

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.660
at Berea, Bill Talmans [assumed
spelling], and so forth,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.120
has made a lot of
difference in that, and then,

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.920
our people have begun
to say, hey,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.830
we've got something
here pretty special,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.870
and I think you know already

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:05.060
that the Smithsonian recorded
a couple of CDs of our singing,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.800
and all of that has caused
our people to say, hey,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.940
we want to hang onto
this way of singing.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.850
&gt;&gt; We couldn't have done it
without many of the people

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.950
and organizations
represented in this room.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.700
So congratulate yourself,
as well, successful project.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.550
I turn now to applied
ethnomusicology

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.540
and the terrible
things that were said,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.140
what you've all been
waiting for.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.930
The histories of
ethnomusicology taught

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.020
in most doctoral
programs traces its roots

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.840
to comparative musicology,
defined by Guido Adler

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.180
in 1885 as, "A division
of musicology

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.090
which involves the
comparison of musical works

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.210
of the various peoples of the
Earth," these are his words,

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.500
"for ethnographical purposes
and the classification

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.110
of them according to
their various forms."

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.600
Comparative musicology
arrived in the United States

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.290
in the person of none other
than Alan Lomax's nemesis,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.720
George Herzog in 1925.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.630
Herzog studied anthropology
with Franz Boas at Columbia,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.160
and this is an art
picture of Boas.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.800
Isn't that striking?

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.220
He studied with Boas, Herzog
did, and he received the PhD

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.800
in 1928 from Boas in Columbia.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.690
Herzog pursued an academic
career as a professor at Yale,

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.470
Columbia, and Indiana
Universities, one that lasted

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.650
until he went insane
in the mid-1950s.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.560
He was recognized
during this period

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.630
as the leading American
authority on indigenous music.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.810
He was also one of the leading
authorities on folk music,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.600
which is why Alan wanted
to take his course.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.490
Among his students were two
of the founders of the Society

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.540
for Ethnomusicology, David
McAllester and Willard Rhodes.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.300
Herzog's writings exhibited an
empirical scientific method,

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.560
which required musical
transcriptions and analysis.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.570
His methods added Boas-styled
ethnographic research

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.740
to the comparative
musical analysis

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.380
that often characterized
the work of the Germans.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.960
A Dutch comparative
musicologist, Jaap Kunst,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.940
coined the term ethnomusicology
in 1950 and proposed

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.170
that comparative
musicology change its name.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:35.080
His argument didn't rest on
the idea of ethno, but rather,

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.710
on eliminating the
word comparative.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.580
"All good science," he argued,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.830
"is comparative in
nature anyway."

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.780
Disciplines like
comparative linguistics

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.540
and comparative embryology
had, after all,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.880
dropped those adjectives

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.400
and just become embryology
and linguistics.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.640
Why should musicology have it?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.560
But then, if it was musicology,
that wasn't quite right either.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.450
So he added the ethno- prefix.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.370
His argument was persuasive,

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.460
and many comparative
musicologists began

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.910
to call themselves
ethnomusicologists,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.930
while those of a more cultural
persuasion saw a chance

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.630
to elevate the cultural
study of music

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.140
in the new field
with a new name.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.140
The founding of the
Society for Ethnomusicology

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.810
in 1955 might have moved
applied ethnomusicology

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.620
to a more central position.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.000
As Bruno Nettl observed,
"The beginning

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.930
of the SEM was deeply rooted in
the anthropological background

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.880
of its most influential
leaders."

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.980
Most prominent among
them were Alan Merriam

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:41.440
and David McAllester, both
among the four founders of SEM.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.720
Herzog was noticeably
absent from SEM's founding,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.020
and it's worth asking why.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.390
Nettl attributed his absence
to his growing mental problems,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.910
and no doubt, that was so.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.040
But the founders
also, certainly,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.020
wanted to escape
Herzog's dominance.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.290
McAllester reported that as far

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.460
as he knew he (McAllester)
was the only student ever

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.390
to finish the doctorate
under Herzog's supervision.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:14.930
Herzog had a habit of losing his
students' papers, never grading

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:21.370
or returning or returning them,
and anyway, McAllester came

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.050
to my seminar on the history
of ethnomusicological thought,

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.090
which I taught at
Brown for 27 years.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.870
McAllester came in 1989 and
talked about the history

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.900
of the founding of SEM and
his career and everything,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.900
and so on, and I'm
going to draw on some

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.580
of the things he said for this.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.360
"The campus was littered
with the bodies

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.830
of failed Herzog students."

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.070
McAllester told my seminar.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.870
"Herzog's habit," McAllester
said, "was to demonstrate

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.190
to them time after time

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.760
that they could not
meet his standards.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.690
He never failed them
in so many words,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.440
but they had a very hard time
ever getting an appointment

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.580
with him, and when
I finally did,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.800
it was all at such a high level
that they felt sort of defeated.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.720
If they brought in a
transcription, it was so bad,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.830
that he went over it note by
note to show them and said,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.240
'Now see if you can't, now

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.830
that you've had this
practice, do better next time.'

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.740
And then, a month or so
later, when I finally caught

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.070
up with him again, then the
same thing would happen again."

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:29.480
Herzog was Nettl's dissertation
supervisor at Indiana,

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.860
but before Nettle could
complete his doctorate,

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.530
Herzog's erratic behavior
forced Nettl to move

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.510
to a different supervisor.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.020
McAllester commented,
"Nettl left Herzog,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.080
but most of us couldn't do that.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.010
We were with Herzog, and it
was do or die, and many died."

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.070
One of those who died
was Willard Rhodes,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.860
one of the founders
of the society.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.910
Herzog would never approve his
work, and so, it's no wonder,

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.130
really, that Herzog was not
involved with these founders.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.340
But that must be only
part of the answer.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.430
In his memoirs, Nettl
reminiscing

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.680
about this early period, recalls
that he and others, he thinks,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.550
regarded these events
more as a revival

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.060
of comparative musicology, which
had been all but eliminated

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.270
in Europe during the Nazi
era than as a revolution

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.300
that brought about something
new, ethnomusicology.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.100
As a comparative
musicologist himself,

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.280
Nettl's bias towards comparative
musicology is understandable.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.430
However, he was not
one of the founders.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.930
This is Nettl.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:46.880
This is Bruno Nettl,
and here's kind

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.220
of a silly picture
of the four founders.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.660
It's -- you can see, left to
right there, Charles Seeger,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:04.320
Alan Merriam, Willard
Rhodes and Dave McAllester.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.960
And I asked them all
about this founding.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.760
I had conversations
with all of them.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.350
So some of this is
based on what they said,

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:16.300
McAllester in particular.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.190
Nettl was still a graduate
student when the Society

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.620
for Ethnomusicology was founded.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.130
He was not involved in the
conversations with McAllester,

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.090
Merriam, Rhodes, and
Seeger as they planned,

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.710
and then established,
the new organization.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.360
So let me try to reconstruct
something of its significance,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.240
as I believe it to have appeared
to the founders at the time,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.680
and as I said, in so doing,
I rely on my conversations

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.720
with Rhodes, Merriam, and Seeger

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.680
and especially McAllester,
about this period.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.650
McAllester recalled that after
Herzog was finally confined

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.310
to a mental institution,

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.420
he could no longer exercise his
former control over degrees,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.960
grants, and publications
in comparative musicology.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.360
"He became so ill that he
had to be in an institution,

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.930
and then the lid was off,

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:05.240
and the society could be
established," McAllester said.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.280
For the four founders, SEM
must've represented a move away

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.200
from comparative
musicology, not just an escape

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.090
from Herzog's iron
grip, but also,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.940
establishing a field
more welcoming

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.180
to the cultural study of music.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.450
The founders resisted
efforts from other societies,

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:25.350
who tried to dissuade them
from starting a new society,

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.550
including the American
Musicological Society

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.080
and The International
Folk Music Council.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.870
McAllester reported that,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.270
Moncarpolis [assumed
spelling] or is it Moncarpelis?

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.570
&gt;&gt; Carpolese [assumed spelling].

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.350
&gt;&gt; Carpolese, thank you,
"Came and pleaded with us

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.690
to become a wing

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.250
of the International
Folk Music Council.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.710
Alan Merriam, particularly
well, Charlie Seeger, too.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.930
They were both very insistent
that it not get into the hands

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.560
of the International
Folk Music Council."

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.550
Merriam thought they were
just a bunch of singers

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.850
and dancers, you know?

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.100
&gt;&gt; That would be terrible.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, really.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.840
So when -- this is
McAllester talking here.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.740
So when we started the society,
they, the IFMC, got wind of it,

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.040
and they were very upset,

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.390
because they had
their American branch,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.360
they were afraid we would
simply split their society

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.970
and draw membership
away from them.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.830
There were scholars among them,
great scholars among them,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.970
but they were not
anthropologically oriented,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.870
and it just happened by the way
we operated that the Society

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:30.590
for Ethnomusicology began with
an anthropological orientation.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.570
For Alan Merriam, even
more than for McAllester,

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.640
ethnomusicology would become
the anthropology of music rather

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.770
than comparative musicology.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.120
He lobbied hard for the
study of music as culture,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.110
not merely in culture,
and that's a viewpoint

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.430
that most contemporary
ethnomusicologists

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.060
have assimilated.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.300
Obtaining a full
professorship in anthropology

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.810
at Indiana University in 1962,
Merriam was not only a founder,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.960
but a forceful presence in
SEM from the very beginning

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.280
until his untimely death in
an airplane crash in 1980.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.070
He's still the forceful
presence.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.250
Nettl is still fighting
with him.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.620
For Nettl, ethnomusicology
was a subfield of musicology.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.820
For Merriam and McAllester,

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.970
ethnomusicology was a
subfield of anthropology.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.560
As I said, one would expect
that the anthropologists

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.110
who led SEM would've encouraged
and applied ethnomusicology.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.140
Anthropologists had by then
started putting their knowledge

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:32.400
to work in solving
social problems.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.710
John van Willigen, historian
of applied anthropology,

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.610
dates the rise of a
socially committed, applied,

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.700
or action anthropology to
1945, but this exciting,

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.520
albeit controversial,
development in anthropology,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.750
did not cross over into SEM with
any success until decades later.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.540
The reasons, in retrospect,
are not surprising.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.640
To establish ethnomusicology
within the most secure

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.380
of institutional bases, that
is, within universities,

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.000
it was necessary to
position ethnomusicology

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.960
as a research science.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.260
Musicological

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.930
and anthropological
ethnomusicologists might

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.100
disagree over the emphasis of
the discipline, but they agreed

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.480
that scholarship
and the production

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.580
of knowledge was in school.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.020
Applications of that research in
the public arena might be well

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.980
and good, but the
pursuit of knowledge

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.870
for its own sake had always
been valued most highly

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.790
in university settings
where it could be protected

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.780
from outside forces.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.680
In 1950, ethnomusicology
itself was a fringe discipline

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.260
within the United States,

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.390
with only a few courses
being offered,

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.330
and only a few professors
available

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.650
to advise doctoral
dissertations.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.600
For ethnomusicology to
expand, professors must succeed

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.070
in establishing more
faculty lines.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.610
Eventually, every music
department, every music school

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.640
or conservatory, and every
anthropology department would

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.360
have at least one
ethnomusicologist doing research

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.680
and offering music courses
with a worldwide scope,

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.270
and some would have
more than one

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.430
and establish graduate programs,
training future generations

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.960
about the musicologists, as
the discipline would expand.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.850
Second, for ethnomusicology
to become institutionalized,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.920
it had to be regarded as
a professional vocation,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.260
not as an amateur pursuit.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.590
Cultural anthropologists

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.420
and comparative musicologists
had always distinguished

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.480
between themselves as
professional scientists,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.580
and the amateurs who
traveled the world

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.400
and collected information
in the field,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.210
but were not properly
trained to analyze it.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.730
Besides, these amateurs
exhibited a dangerous tendency

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.560
to write popular books,

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.510
to present illustrated
lectures in public libraries,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.340
[ Laughter ]

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.690
and to catch the
attention of the media.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.870
Only by continuing
this gatekeeping could

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.250
ethnomusicologists keep their
jobs and professions secure

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.270
within the university world.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.830
I believe that a third reason
was the distrust among this

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.640
generation of scholars who
came of age during or soon

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.060
after World War II of
social engineering.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.670
Applied research put to
practical use in musical

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.410
or cultural interventions,
despite intended benefits,

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.430
was suspect, particularly
given the political uses

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.440
to which music and art,
generally, have been put

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.110
in the Nazi and Soviet spheres.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:26.520
Most important, many in
the previous generation

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.030
of United States music scholars
had been born in Europe and fled

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.640
to the New World to
escape persecution

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.840
and establish a musical
scholarship inside the

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.950
university world where
they could be free

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.100
from political interference.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.760
This third reason was
never directly articulated,

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.190
but it can be inferred from
the cautionary language

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.560
that they used when
they deigned to talk

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.340
about applied ethnomusicology,
as we shall soon see.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.420
The term, applied
ethnomusicology, did not appear

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.290
in SEM publication until 1963.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.060
Alan Merriam was the first US
ethnomusicologist to recognize

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.770
and apply ethnomusicology
by that name.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:10.200
In his book, The Anthropology
of Music, published in 1964,

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.560
he wrote that, "The
ultimate aim of the study

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.020
of man involves the question
of whether one is searching

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.640
for knowledge for its
own sake or is attempting

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.540
to provide solutions for
practical applied problems.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.120
Ethnomusicology has seldom
been used in the same manner

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.430
as applied or action
anthropology,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.510
and ethnomusicologists have
only rarely felt called upon

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.540
to help solve problems

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.090
in manipulating the
destinies of people.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.070
And in those circumstances,
it's also difficult

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.350
to avoid outside control
over the research project.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.360
Merriam's worry over
outside control is a worry

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.080
over outside threats
to academic freedom,

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.310
and his sardonic phrase,
manipulating the destinies

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.110
of people, voices is
distrust of social engineering

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.820
and his opposition to political
and cultural interventions.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:04.190
Bruno Nettl was born to a
Jewish family is Czechoslovakia

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.790
in 1930.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.300
In 1939, to escape Nazism,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.600
he and his family emigrated
to the United States.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.990
His father, Paul, was a
famous musicologist who taught

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.460
at Indiana University.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.610
Far more than anyone else,
Nettl has shouldered the burden

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.830
of writing the history
of ethnomusicology

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.270
and almost single-handedly has
done so for the past 60 years.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.120
Generation after generation

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.480
of graduate students have
absorbed his histories.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.900
He seldom mentions
applied ethnomusicology,

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.060
but when he does, he says
terrible things about it.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.300
In his most important textbook,
The Study of Ethnomusicology,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.550
published in 1983 and revised
in 2005, he writes this.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:52.640
This is the same language in
both editions, 1983 and 2005,

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.850
"In the course of the 1950s,
there developed a concept

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:59.390
in a subdiscipline, applied
anthropology, whose task it was

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.980
to use anthropological insight
to help solve social problems,

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.420
particularly those occasioned by
rapid culture change in the wake

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.280
of modernization
and westernization."

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.240
I believe that that Nettl
gets it exactly wrong here.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.350
Applied anthropologists
were enlisted then

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.570
to help solve problems such
as Third-World poverty.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:21.590
The solutions attempted, as
they advised US government

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:26.230
organizations, such as AID,
were agricultural modernization

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.800
and economic development,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.460
and the unfortunate result
often was rapid social change

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.240
and cultural upheaval.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.370
No wonder then," as
Nettle continues, although,

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.170
"anthropologists wanted to
help, they frequently ended

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.210
up offending the
local population

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.220
in doing what was
perceived as harmful.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.620
As a result, in the late
1960s and early 1970s,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.700
they were widely attacked for
doing work of no relevance

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:57.080
to social problems, of mixing
in local politics, of spying.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.560
Ethnomusicologists
shared in this criticism."

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.320
Nettl has somehow mapped applied
ethnomusicologists' efforts

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.700
to conserve traditional
music and culture

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.600
onto applied anthropologists'
efforts

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.740
to overturn traditional culture.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.240
Compounding this error,
he means to suggest

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.600
that applied ethnomusicologists
were offensive, harmful,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.760
and irrelevant and that they
barged into local politics

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.880
and were accused of being spies.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.760
These are terrible things to
say, but if they were true

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.810
about applied anthropologists
for one kind of intervention,

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.190
they could not be true about
applied ethnomusicologists

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.960
for the opposite, unless
Nettl means that any kind

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.470
of intervention was resented.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.940
Eventually, Nettl admits that

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.850
"The picture is not
entirely negative.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.960
Some societies are happy
to have outsiders come,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.760
appreciate their efforts, their
respect for the traditions,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.190
and their help in
restoring vigor

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.300
to rapidly disappearing musics.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.840
Even so, there is often the
feeling that the members

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.940
of the society itself, given
the right training, equipment,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.500
and time, could do it better."

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.820
To his credit, Nettl
recognizes the potential good

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.930
that can arise from
a collaborative,

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.090
applied ethnomusicology.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.200
Yet, his unease with
applied work is obvious.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.780
To be fair, Nettl may be
changing his mind late

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.080
in his life.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.740
He's now in his mid-80s,
and in a recent lecture,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.410
he acknowledged the appeal
of applied ethnomusicology

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.710
to a new generation
of ethnomusicologists.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.940
Those in ethnomusicologies
found a generation

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.240
who did some applied work.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.010
Mantle Hood and David
McAllester, for example,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.860
did so without calling
attention to it, as such,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.860
and they probably didn't even
consider it in that light.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.300
They simply did it out of a
sense of ethics and reciprocity.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.240
And ethnomusicology gradually
did become established

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.220
in the college and
university world.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.040
Yet, ironically, it was not
by positioning ethnomusicology

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.590
as a research science.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:53.490
Rather, beginning in the late
1960s, ethnomusicology benefited

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.140
from a combination of
external circumstances

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.600
that the founding
generation did not foresee.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.240
The most important of these
were, first, the sudden craze

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.860
for world music available as
never before on LP records

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.530
and in concerts by Ravi Shankar
and Ali Akbar Khan and others.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.210
Some of you are probably
old enough to remember that.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.420
Master musicians from Ghana,
North and South India,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.380
the Arab world, China, Japan,
and Indonesia soon were

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.830
in residence as world music
performance ensemble directors

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.040
at American colleges
and universities,

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.920
where ethnomusicologists
were already teaching.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.090
Enrollments in world music
courses grew exponentially.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:35.500
Secondly, America was moving
his cultural narrative away

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.320
from the universal melting pot
and towards ethnic roots, pride,

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.160
and cultural pluralism.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.730
In education, this opened
the humanities curriculum

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.230
to a variety of international

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.480
and minority subjects
and voices.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.150
Music schools that saw the
handwriting on the wall began

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.200
to hire ethnomusicologists.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.480
By 1977, it was possible
to obtain a doctorate

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.900
by studying ethnomusicology
with Nazir Jairazbhoy at UCLA,

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.930
Frederick Lieberman at Brown,
George List and Alan Merriam

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.530
at Indiana, Bruno Nettl at
Illinois, Robert Garfias

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:10.520
at Washington, Alan Kagan,
my teacher, and Minnesota,

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.440
William Malm at Michigan,
and David McAllester

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.100
at Wesleyan Universities,
among others.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.460
Today, most top and second-tier
colleges and universities have

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.360
at least one ethnomusicologist
on their faculties and usually

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.840
in the music department
or music school.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.250
In the 1980s, the Society
for Ethnomusicology, though,

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.080
remained chiefly a research
community of professors

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.570
and graduate students.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:38.080
It was not until most of
the founding generation aged

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.160
and gradually relinquished
leadership

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.140
that applied ethnomusicology
was able to enter SEM

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.980
in an institutional way.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.880
But it was not merely a
changing of the generations.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.410
Another significant change
within academia resulted

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.070
from the growth of cultural
studies and critical theory.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:58.420
The result, particularly among
those attracted to the study

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.430
of music as culture, was
a turn in ethnomusicology

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.320
from science toward
cultural critique,

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.040
from the musical object
to the musical experience,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.170
from analysis to interpretation,

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.120
and from explanation
to understanding.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.290
By the end of the 1980s,

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.370
ethnomusicology had assimilated
the interpretive cultural

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.770
anthropology of Clifford Gertz,
Dennis Tedlock, James Clifford,

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.450
George Marcus, and others,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.700
a far cry from the empirical
anthropology Herzog had

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.080
championed, or the
science thing about music

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.260
that Merriam had propounded.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.370
Ethnomusicology's
turn away from science

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.740
and toward the humanities
led a growing number

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.150
of North American
ethnomusicologists

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.210
to applied ethnomusicology
in one form or another,

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:41.450
advocating on behalf of
individual musicians,

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.140
musical communities, and musical
life in particular places.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.720
The new fieldwork had
become experience centered.

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.070
The 1970s ethnomusicological
monographs such as those

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.850
by Paul Berliner,
The Soul of Mbira,

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:59.250
and Charles Keil's [inaudible]
Music were in the vanguard

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.470
of the turn to reflexivity.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.630
Kenneth Gourlay's 1982
essay in the SEM Journal,

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.210
"Towards a Humanizing
Ethnomusicology,"

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.780
offered a theoretical basis
for the new direction,

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.490
along with a strongly
worded critique

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.930
of Merriam's distance
on science.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.420
In that same issue
of Ethnomusicology,

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.340
Charles Keil's essay, Applied
Ethnomusicology and a Rebirth

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.540
of Music from the
Spirit of Tragedy,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.610
charted a path towards
work that, as he said,

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:29.550
"can make a difference through
an insistence on putting music

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.880
into play wherever people are
resisting their oppression."

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.230
Keil's radical position
allied applied ethnomusicology

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.340
with decolonization,
and in retrospect,

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.600
I think it's very fortunate that
applied ethnomusicology waited

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.850
to emerge during the period
of postcolonial critique.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.850
For in so doing, it
largely avoided the stigma

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.880
of applied anthropology's
alliances

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.610
with government-supported
modernization

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.130
and development programs
in the Third World.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.910
A humanized ethnomusicology
this made it possible

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.030
for an applied ethnomusicology,
manifesting itself not only

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.360
in a new fieldwork
based in reciprocity,

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.250
leading to advocacy, but also,

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.980
through institutional
gains within SEM.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.830
The growth of applied
ethnomusicology

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.250
in the United States in the
1980s was also greatly aided

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.510
by the development
of public folklore.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.350
As administrators and
sometimes field workers,

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.950
a few dozen ethnomusicologists
were employed either full-

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.430
or part-time by the
Smithsonian Institution,

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.080
the American Folklife Center,
and the Folk Arts Division

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.680
of the National Endowment
for the Arts, whose director,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.260
Bess Hawes, held
an informal session

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.150
at the SEM conference
every year in the 1980s

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.550
to inform ethnomusicologists
of the opportunities

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.190
for submitting applied
ethnomusicology project

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:45.460
proposals to the NEA.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.130
I, myself, served as a presenter

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:50.870
at the 1976 Smithsonian
Folklife Festival,

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.640
which Hawes also directed,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.740
and on the NEA Folk Arts
Division Panel from 1989 to '83

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.830
and then again a
couple more times.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.700
I owe a lasting debt of
gratitude to Bess Hawes

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.300
and to her assistant
director at the NEA Dan Shehi,

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.510
for helping me understand
how I could function

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.060
as both a research scholar

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.860
and as an applied
ethnomusicologist while employed

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.290
in the academic world.

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:20.020
Applied ethnomusicology
went mainstream

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.070
within SEM during the 1990s.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.030
I've already discussed some
of the landmark publications

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.180
of that decade and the next.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.340
The applied ethnomusicology
section of SEM began

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:35.600
as a committee in 1998 and
became a section in 2002.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.240
In 2007, SEM itself
went on record

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.890
with a position statement
opposed

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.540
to the use of music for torture.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:48.600
You may know that
music was one of the --

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.330
detainees were tortured.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.970
They especially,
apparently, hated Eminem,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:59.040
and we convinced
the executive board,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.660
who didn't really need
convincing, to go on record

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.620
with the position statement
against the use, you know?

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.210
And so, there is a position
statement, and you can see it

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.510
on the SEM website,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.900
that condemns the use
of music for torture.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.840
It should condemn
torture, too, of course,

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.460
but music and the use.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.650
This is a political stand
taken by the organization, SEM,

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:24.580
that would've been
unthinkable in the 20th century,

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.090
just absolutely unthinkable for
the organization to do that,

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.460
and by the way, there
were objections

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.000
from some when it did that.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.310
The board said that,
go ahead, object.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.580
Anyway, I don't have time
to discuss the many projects

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.270
that applied ethnomusicologists
embarked on beginning

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:49.370
in the 1980s, but I would refer
you to the growing literature

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.020
on the subject already
published,

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.600
especially to the
forthcoming Oxford Handbook

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.900
of Applied Ethnomusicology.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.110
In fact, this talk is a
greatly, greatly condensed

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.430
and somewhat modified version
of my part of the introduction

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:06.260
to that book, the Oxford
Handbook of Applied Ethno.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.850
And finally, there are
so many folklorists here.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:13.920
I would invite you to
think of parallels between,

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.610
if you haven't already
been thinking about it,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.380
between the histories of
applied ethnomusicology

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.770
and public folklore.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.320
Did anybody say terrible
things about public folklore?

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:33.890
And maybe and why and what
happened to turn things around?

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:39.000
It would be interesting to
hear some of the answers.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.230
So I'm done, and I tried to
time this leave some time

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:46.530
for questions.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:47.830
Did I?

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.130
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Yes.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:50.430
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: Okay.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:51.730
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.530
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: All right.

-- I'm sorry, Bruno Nettl.

I'm very sorry.

&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: Yeah.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.280
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: He would've
had, in the back of his mind,

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.970
the treatment of folk
music in Czechoslovakia,

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:25.310
which has a long
and sad history.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.610
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: No doubt.

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:27.910
&gt;&gt; Audience Member:

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.840
I can understand very well why
he retreated from that position.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.920
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: No doubt,
and the way that the Soviets,

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:43.800
and the communists in general,
were using folklore was,

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:48.190
you know, part of the problems
that that generation had seen

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:54.080
up close, in his case, up close
and personal, and so, naturally,

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.350
it led to a distrust
of social engineering.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.650
Absolutely.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:10.260
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: Hi, thanks
very much for your talk.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.950
It's really wonderful to hear

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:15.710
about this history
of ethnomusicology.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:23.710
I just have a sort
of -- I don't know

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:29.920
if it's a basic question or not.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:41.900
But I'm curious about the terms
applied in ethnomusicology

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:47.810
versus public folklore
versus, say, public humanities

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:49.250
or public scholarship, and
has there been any discussion

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.550
[inaudible] SEM about that?

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:51.850
I mean, your discussion of
Nettl's characterization

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:53.150
of the roots of [inaudible]
musicology being

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.450
like anthropology makes
sense, but you seem

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:55.750
to be kind of doubting that.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.050
So I wonder just by
sort of what seems

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:58.350
to me a more descriptive
title for sort of [inaudible].

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.650
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon:
No, it's not absent.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.630
In fact, the current president

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:06.040
of SEM prefers the term
public ethnomusicology

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.060
but is not familiar
with the history

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.370
of applied ethnomusicology.

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:14.050
It just happens that applied
is the established term.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.580
In 1992, it was not.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.910
When the issue of the
SEM Journal came out,

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:26.380
there were a number of possible
terms including public, applied,

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:30.920
action, and others,
and I decided

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:36.080
that I would title the journal
Music in the Public Interest.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.170
That was the title
of the special issue.

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:42.850
When the section,
rather, when the committee

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:48.640
on applied ethnomusicology was
established by SEM in 1997,

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.150
Doris Dian [assumed
spelling] and Martha Davis,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:56.040
whose established it, chose the
term, applied ethnomusicology.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.650
ICTM, the successors

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.650
of the International
Folk Music Council,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.650
the International Council
and Traditional Music,

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:07.240
a UNESCO organization,
established a study group

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.750
on applied ethnomusicology
a year or two later,

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:12.760
I think, in 1998 or so.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.160
And so, that's the
name that's in use now.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.090
But I think it's open for
discussion, and it may be

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:28.110
that public ethnomusicology
turns out to be a better term.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.630
There are certainly
some advantages

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.370
to it emphasizes the work
in the public sphere.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:38.930
The problem I see with it is
that it also can be confused

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:45.840
as a place of employment, and I
think that it's very problematic

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.850
to dichotomize the academic.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.610
Obviously, I have a bias here.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:56.450
I think it's very problematic
to oppose the academic world

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.070
and the world outside.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:01.340
I don't think it does
good for any -- either.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.340
And so, I see that is a
problem with the word public,

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.120
but I think it certainly open,
and these things change, too,

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.160
over time, and may be
in five or 10 years,

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.670
public will become
the accepted word.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.970
I don't know.

program in Frankfurt,

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:52.650
I think you brought some
singers there, and you talked

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.400
about trust and friendship.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.700
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: Yeah.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.000
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: But I
was wondering, when you start

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.300
to bring them out about
true community context,

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.080
where you were going in, can
you tell us, maybe briefly,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.100
about how that process, when
brought, with Bess's coaxing,

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.120
how you maybe [inaudible] into
Washington, but then you started

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.490
to bring them closer to
home and tell that dynamic.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:14.770
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: Well, Elwood
has always felt, Elwood Cornett,

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.610
the head of the association,
as always felt

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:23.010
that it was important for
the Old Regular Baptists not

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:28.860
to be misunderstood by people
in universities, colleges,

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.180
general public, and
so on and so forth,

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.610
the history of misunderstanding
there.

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:37.060
And he felt that by doing
these public things,

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.020
it might actually help.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:44.760
He, for example, where
I first met him was

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.620
that Berea College in 1979.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.590
That's where I first
met Loyal Jones.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:53.490
They had a conference on what
they called rural hymnodity,

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:58.470
and Berea invited Elwood and
a group of singers to come in

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:04.170
and demonstrate their music
for this conference at Berea.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.350
And I thought it
was very important

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.940
to make the distinction between
demonstration and performance,

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:15.590
and they understood, and
in fact, endorsed the idea

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.270
that it would be a
demonstration, and so on.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:23.160
And when we brought
them to Frankfurt,

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:28.380
or when we brought them to
the Smithsonian's Festival,

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.460
I had some trepidation.

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:35.840
I, myself, if any of
you have read my blog,

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.410
you know that I have
grave misgivings

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:40.640
about creative economy
cultural tourism

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.660
and allying all this
stuff to money.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.130
I'm happier in a gift economy,

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:54.750
and I think that the Old Regular
Baptists really understand that,

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.260
as well, music is a gift.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:04.630
Of course, that's an old
Christian idea, but it's also,

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:09.210
I think, important to
understand that someone

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:15.120
like Elwood is a wise
and brilliant person.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.770
I can't tell you how,
when -- you've probably --

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:24.070
you've all met some people in
these communities who are just,

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:30.760
you know, if they were President
of the United States or Speaker

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.000
of the House or something,
right, you know,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.600
we wouldn't have these problems,
or we'd have less of them,

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.380
and Elwood was one
of these people.

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.680
He's much wiser and smarter
than I am and any of us,

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.560
and he was in favor
of doing all this,

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:48.700
and we went to the
Smithsonian, he understood

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.100
at once what the
festival was about

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.910
and their demonstrations
were just splendid.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:59:00.250
At the end, he had everybody
in the last performance,

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.450
in the big tent --
Diana Parker was there.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:11.240
You know, all the -- James
Early, and he had everybody

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.620
in the audience just, you
know, listening to every word

00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:20.730
that he was saying, how he had
appreciated what had happened.

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:22.630
How they all had
appreciated what had happened

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:29.980
at the festival, and
then, he did something

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.300
that I hadn't expected.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:35.300
He had everybody sing "Amazing
Grace" in the new melody.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.600
They have an old melody,

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.040
the different melody
for "Amazing Grace."

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.600
Everybody sang amazing Grace,
and it's their habit to go

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.460
around shaking hands and hugging
each other in their services.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.760
So they did that.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.060
Everybody did that.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.370
Diana Parker was in
tears over all of this.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:54.100
So he understood that --
he understands is better,

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.550
you know, than most people do.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.110

-- anyway, so...

Maybe one more question.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:09.840

Thanks again for a great talk.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:25.240
It's so instructive to get more
dimension about the history

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:31.550
of the disciplines
that we had here, too,

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:38.380
and understand the dynamics
of the relationships,

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:46.080
and to be able to
take the time here

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.450
with you to kind of look back.

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:56.930
One of the questions
that I have, I guess,

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:03.470
it still somewhat applies to
myself, but I also know a number

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:10.620
of people in the room that
are coming to the discipline

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:16.890
of ethnomusicology or political
or cultural anthropology.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:21.530
How much of the history of these
disciplines do they need to pick

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:27.090
up the baggage, in order to
move forward with the work

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:31.220
that they want to do, with
the communities that they want

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.560
to engage, and how flexible
are these disciplines,

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.240
in terms of the collaborative
possibilities?

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.120
They're trying to find their own
identities within the discipline

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.200
and building careers

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.360
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon: I think
it's, as you're suggesting,

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.290
I think it's very
important for everybody

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:59.730
to construct their own narrative
of themselves in working

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:03.850
in the area, wherever
they're working.

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:08.680
There's a tendency, I
think, for younger people

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.400
to be somewhat rebellious
and see themselves

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.170
as doing something original or
something different or something

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:22.780
in opposition, and so on, and
then finally, you realize that,

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.880
well, this is your family,
and, you know, you kind of need

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.300
to figure out where you stand
within this particular context.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:36.930
I think that happens when you
get older, but at any rate,

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:40.830
it does seem to me that
different generations are going

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:42.470
to write different histories.

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.730
The founding generation

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:49.640
of ethnomusicology
clearly had very little use

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.880
for applied ethnomusicology
or public ethnomusicology.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.990
The contemporary
generation needs

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.860
to write a different history,
and some of us are trying,

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.160
but you know, I'm
an old guy now.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.520
So the younger people need
to write about that, too.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.310
There needs to be more
written by younger people

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.610
about public folklore,
certainly.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:04.910
It's very important to do that
and, you know, the narrative

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.210
that I gave you was
kind of a struggle

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:07.510
and triumph narrative, right?

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:08.810
You recognize this
kind of thing.

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.110
And there are other kinds of
formulas that we could put all

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:11.410
of this into, as well, and
[inaudible] quite like that,

01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:12.710
and it's always in
process and progress.

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:14.010
But I think the important
thing is to locate oneself

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.310
in an ongoing stream eventually,

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:16.610
rather than to say
that I'm different.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:17.910
You may be, you know, if
you're really different,

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.210
you wind up like the
people on Solaris.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.510
Some of you saw that
science fiction movie,

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.810
very alone and isolated.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.110
[ Laughter ]

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:24.410
Yeah, okay.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:25.960
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Thank you so much.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.200
[ Applause ]

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.750
&gt;&gt; Jeff Todd Titon:
Thank you all.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.750
[ Applause ]

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.500
&gt;&gt; Voiceover: This has
been a presentation

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.430
of the Library of Congress.
