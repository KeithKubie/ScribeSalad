In Java you can use an interface type to describe common behavior. In our

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:11.370
example, what do cars and dogs and houses have in common, they're all drawable.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.530
They all have a draw method. In Java, we use the interface keyword instead of

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.795
the class keyword. To define interfaces. Here we say that Drawable is an

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:29.038
interface, with a draw method. We give no implementation of the draw method,

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:33.948
that's up to the individual classes, that implement this interface. Methods in

00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:37.990
an interface are automatically public. You can write the keyword public, or you

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.936
can omit it. Now an interface is different from a class, an interface only

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:47.226
specifies the behavior and you can't create objects of an interface, instead

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:51.582
you create objects of classes that implement the interface, let's look at that

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:54.360
next.
