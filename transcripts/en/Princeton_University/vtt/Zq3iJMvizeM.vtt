00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.130
LINNEA PASEIRO: Hey there.


00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.340
My name is Linnea Paseiro.


00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.590
And welcome to Princeton
University.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.560 position:97%
 


00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:20.830
[MUSIC]


00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.230
LINNEA PASEIRO: This is
Forbes College, the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.920
dorm where I live.


00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.370
I thought we'd take
a little tour.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.620
Come on in.


00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.150 position:97%
 


00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.760
So this is my dorm room.


00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.480
My roommate and I have decorated
it really well.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.370
We have pictures from
home everywhere.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.980 position:97%
 


00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.330
Here's my roommate, Pew


00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.000
She's from Thailand, and we met
last year, actually, at

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.110
the Forbes barbecue.


00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.760
We both love to cook,
and we started the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.050
Forbes cooking club.


00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.610
PUI: Linnea's the baker and
I'm the cook, so we're the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.020
best combination.


00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.890
LINNEA PASEIRO: One of the
biggest reasons why we chose

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.160
the room, actually, is the
view.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Welcome to Forbes
Sunday brunch.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.260
Lots of people from all
over campus come down

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.120
to Forbes for this.


00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.320
There's a chocolate fountain,
baked brie, and always omelets

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.070
ready to order.


00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.970
Here we are in the
lobby of Forbes.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.150
It might look a little bit out
of the ordinary for a college

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.670
dorm, but that's because this
used to be a hotel.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:33.980
[MUSIC]


00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.970
ROHAN BHARGAVA: Hey, guys.


00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.680
My name is Rohan Bhargava, and
I'm a sophomore at Princeton

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.420
University.


00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.900
Welcome to Rockefeller
College.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.370
Why don't we go inside and check
out some of the dorms.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.580
Like most of the dorms
in Rockefeller

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.310
College, it's a quad.


00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.020
This is where we hang out, where
we study together, or

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.770
just relax and enjoy a movie.


00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.370
We have two separate bedrooms,
so each of the bedrooms

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.300
function as a double.


00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.850
This is my roommate, Chris.


00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.840
CHRIS: Hey, guys.


00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.550
ROHAN BHARGAVA: We have bunk
beds over here and our two

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.340
desks, so we can actually work
out there or stay in here if

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.810
we want some more quiet.


00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.620
The best thing about having a
common room and having three

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.660
other roommates is that there's
always someone to talk

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.230
to, so you're never
really alone.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:18.180
[MUSIC]


00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.280
ROHAN BHARGAVA: This
beautiful space is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.740
Rockey-Mathey Library.


00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.930
It's really convenient because
it's located right in

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500
Rockefeller College, so during
the winters, you don't even

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.030
have to step out if you want
to come and study.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.570
This is Rocky's dining hall.


00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.530
I think it's one of the most
beautiful on campus.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.500
It actually reminds
a lot of people of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.940
Hogwarts from Harry Potter.


00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:46.760

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.720
JESSE YOUNG: Good afternoon,
and welcome to my dorm in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720
Butler College.


00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.350
My name is Jesse Young.


00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.510
I'm a freshman here at Princeton
University from

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.760
Elmsford, New York.


00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.960 position:97%
 


00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.950
This is Adam.


00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.420
This is my roommate Ariel.


00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.410
ARIEL: Hi.


00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.650
JESSE YOUNG: This dorm is full
of triples, and it's substance

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.490
free and single sex.


00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.550
All the guys here are
really close.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.500
We all hang out a lot, so it's
been a really positive

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.970
experience for me personally.


00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.350
We have our three desks.


00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.760
This is where we all study,
get work done, hang out.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.500
And if you come this way,
I can just take

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.730
you into the bedroom.


00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.710
We have a closet over here, a
nice room with a view.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.670 position:97%
 


00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.650 position:58%
So now that we've seen the dorm room.


00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.390
The next part of the tour will
be the library, where I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.120
personally spend a great
deal of my time.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.610
This way.


00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.860
Waddup, Rishi?


00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.090 position:97%
 


00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.970
This is a library, so I need to
try and be a little quiet.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.860
There are computers along the
wall, and it's open 24 hours,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.290
which is what I love.


00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.690
This is Studio 34.


00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.170
It's actually the only place
that I know of on campus

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.630
that's open until 3:30
in the morning.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.120
[KNOCKING]


00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.610
JESSE YOUNG: Are you there?


00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.610
There we go.


00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.100
DANIELA BARTALINI: Hi.


00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.600
JESSE YOUNG: Hello.


00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.090
DANIELA BARTALINI: Hi,
my name is Daniela.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.940
I am another freshman here in
Butler College, and I did the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.220
Bridge Year program in
India last year.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.190
JESSE YOUNG: Best friends,
basically.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.630
DANIELA BARTALINI: This
is Jessica and Angela.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.950
On each of the floors, we
have a study, a lounge, and a

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.290 position:73%
kitchen equipped with an oven and refrigerator.


00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.500
And my room is a quad.


00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.360
There's a double bedroom over
here, our common room over

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.060
here, and in here
is my bedroom.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.790

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.750
LINNEA PASEIRO: So I
guess that means

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.590
the end of our tour.


00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.290
We just want to say how much we
love living in Forbes and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.200
going to Princeton as well.


00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.840
So see you guys later.


00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.090
Bye!
