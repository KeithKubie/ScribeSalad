00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.559
the harvard graduate school of education

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:11.559
working at the nexus of practice, policy, and research

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.519
Being a blind teacher in a public school

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.689
I didn't, to be perfectly frank, see it is any 
big deal 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.859
I mean I knew it wasn’t all that common.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.490
I just knew we had two things in a different
way and have my classroom set up in a way that we were a

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.910
community

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.100
I actually have three degrees.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.840
The EDM in nineteen sixty nine, a CAGS in 1971 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.840
and an EDD in nineteen seventy six. The time I spent here at Harvard was wonderful.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.950
since we’re doing an all black cover with just brail, 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.650
we wanted to have the photos 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.250
match

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.450
the tone of the cover, and have, kind of, the dramatic

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.770
photo with just David

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.700
really lit

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.700
we thought that would make it dramatic and really emphasize our whole point

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.560
when you’re taking the shot and you want me to keep my head in a certain position

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.780
maybe, turn from left to right

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.930
if someone can stand out in that direction

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.940
because I can’t focus on a spot on the wall

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.940
so if I have a voice to focus on, that helps

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.940
let’s look at a couple, there might be some there where his chin is down

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.090
let me just have you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.250
with your shoulders squared

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.409
and there is something with your hands, they weren’t gripping it tightly

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.399
they were very relaxed…once I start pointing it out to people 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.700
they get all self conscious about it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.700
I’m going to have you just square your shoulders to me…perfect. Now back to position. 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:18.249
we’re all set. 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.449
brings back good memories, being in this building. It really does. It was a wonderful time.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:32.980
I had a very full and enriching experience.
