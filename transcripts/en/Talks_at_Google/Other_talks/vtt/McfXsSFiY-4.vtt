American Science Writing in 2007. He is with
us today to answer a timeless question, "How

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.510
does Santa
complete such a large project with such tight

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.420
time constriction?"
Gregory Mone.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.380
[pause]
Clap.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.340
[audience clapping.]

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.210
&gt;&gt;Gregory Mone: Thank you, everyone. Thanks,
Kate, for having me. I was told that part

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.341
of the reason
behind this authors series is to kind of bring

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.199
in creative thinkers and stuff like that to
stimulate you guys

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.411
in- to think differently about problems and
things like that.

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:53.619
Unfortunately, I have to apologize. I'm not
a creative person. I'm a reporter, and Kate

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.089
said, I've been
working for Popular Science Magazine for awhile.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.249
So, this is really, strictly a work of reporting,
and I'm just going to layout of facts for

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.360
you and kind of explained how everything works.
So, yeah, I'm going to talk about Santa Claus,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.530
and the name of the book, which is "The Truth
About

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.070
Santa: Wormholes, Robots, and What Really
Happens on Christmas Eve."

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.670
What were going to do is run through all the
details of his operation from the day after

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.490
Christmas, you
know, when he has just finished this incredible

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.990
work day straight through to the big night,
and what

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.210
happens on that night. We'll talk about wormholes,
unmanned aerial vehicles, molecular self-

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.499
assembly, terahertz radiation scanners, warp
drive, time travel, you know, Santa's many

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.860
hidden
surveillance devices and some of his innovative

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.270
new revenue streams. Because Santa does have
to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.329
make money.
Now, along the way, I hope to clear up some

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.030
of the myths about Santa. You know, for instance,
the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.670
flying reindeer. It's a ridiculous idea. Obviously,
the sleigh is powered by warp drive.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.921
And I also want to address a few new issues
that have come up in recent years. One of

00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:09.590
the big ones relates to how Santa's travel
habits affect the spread of influenza. And

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.290
then also I've started to get the feeling
that maybe he's going a little bit too far

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.870
in this whole "he knows if you've been bad
or good"

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.569
operation. I think we have a little bit of
a case of a really big, Big Brother. And finally,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.120
I'm going to
introduce a new Android App, The Santa Detector,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.840
which was developed with the help of a few
elves.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.590
It's related to the surveillance problem.
Basically, it alerts you when one of Santa's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.310
flying drones is
nearby and either listening in on your conversations

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.819
or recording them. Because, I'm also, were
giving it away free in the Android Apps Store,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.069
because we really want to empower people,
you know,

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.360
in terms of being able to control when Santa
is watching them and when he isn't.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.459
So, at the end I'll be happy to answer any
questions but I might be a little bit evasive

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.409
because as I said,
he is definitely listening and Christmas is

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.920
approaching and I want good presents. Particularly
a

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.400
Paddleboard, the stand up-, you know, surfing,
yeah. So anyway, I'll explain also how he

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.480
doesn't need
to fit down through the chimney. It's actually

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.909
very different means of assembly.
So, before getting to the 26th, and you know,

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.780
recuperation from this incredible workday,
I want to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.469
quickly address this, one of the big myths,
which is the idea of a single Santa Claus.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.360
it would be
impossible for a single guy to do all this

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.640
work. Say we assumed that, you know, it takes
him four

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.720
minutes to drop off the presents in a home
and get to the next home, you know, the standard

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.360
vision
we have. We have him landing on a roof top

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
with the reindeer drawn sleigh, and he goes
down the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.969
chimney, he sorts everything out, he's got
to get back up the chimney, get back in the

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.890
sleigh, get the
reindeer ready, and then he hops over one

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.000
house and lands again and does the whole thing
over. It-

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.400
it's silly, but it would be easier to walk,
you know? So, even if he did it this way and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.219
will it would take
about four minutes, right? Now, four minutes,

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.709
if you're thinking about, say a conservative
estimate of

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.370
200 million homes in the course of the night
is 800 million minutes or 555,000 days, 1500

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.470
years roughly.
Now if you assume he's been in business for

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:32.390
150 years, we're talking about 228,460 years.
Then he's got,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.380
and that's also accounting the rest of the
calendar year when he is just kind of hanging

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.250
out.
Now the issue here is even if he's time traveling,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.870
you know, and so only a little time is passing
for us as

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.310
we're sleeping and things like that. He still
has to live through all that time. So, I don't

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.980
care, you know,
how happy this guy is, what's going on. He

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.700
would get bored. I mean, you can't live for,
you can't work

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.140
for 220,000 plus years like that. Now as a
result, Santa does have assistants. He has

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.060
lieutenants, 2 to 300 of them. The numbers
have been growing in recent years due to population

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.580
growth, obviously. Also,
some experts have suggested that these lieutenants

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.280
of his are clones, but that is again another
ridiculous idea. Because obviously, you know,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.980
most of the year these guys are up at the
North Pole,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.540
there aren't a lot of women up there, just
Mrs. Clause. And Santa's got 200 identical

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.940
twins rolling
around, I mean, he wouldn't even want to take

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.560
a nap, you know, for fear that someone would
put on

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.560
the Bing Crosby and start romancing Mrs. Clause.
Now, these lieutenants are drawn from a variety

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.650
of sources. Obviously, department store Santa's,
retired people in Florida is another great

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.830
one. They get very bored. They're looking
for something new

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.340
to do and they generally work on a 3-year
contract, and they're very, very, very, very

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.930
well paid, because
the job is dangerous.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.900
Now, as I said, Santa himself travels via
a warp drive sleigh, which you can see detailed

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.340
right here. It
looks a little bit like a tuba, but this is

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.940
this is an exact sort of info graphic rendition
based on some

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:22.530
blueprints I got. Now, he travels via warp
drive sleigh, but his lieutenants go via wormhole.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.440
Now, I'm sure some of you guys have heard
about wormholes. They are these theoretical

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.440
tunnels
through space and time that can joint two

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.880
distant parts in the universe through a tiny
little, through a

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.620
tiny little shortcut. You know, here's a classic
illustration of them where normally he would

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.470
have to go
around the long way that with a wormhole then

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.500
just a short. Now normally it's two distant
points in

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.180
the universe, but with Santa it's just, you
know, home to home.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.790
Now the issue is that wormholes are dangerous
thank and occasionally they malfunction, and

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.170
you can
imagine if-if one of the lieutenants is coming

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.320
through here and something goes wrong, well
he doesn't

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.680
end up in a particularly friendly spot. Now,
he does have, you know, emergency-emergency

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.810
parts to
his suit where he's got accessories such as:

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.380
He's got an hour of oxygen supply, he's got
an emergency

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.910
signaling beacon that shoots out in all directions.
But, you know, unfortunately we can't totally

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.780
bend,
Santa can't bend all the laws of physics here.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.500
So that emergency signal doesn't travel any
faster than

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.860
Light Speed, so if he's really, really far
away he takes more than an hour, anymore and

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.340
then an hour for that light to travel then
he's basically done for. When this happens

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.480
his next-of-kin typically receives a seven
figure insurance package, which is basically

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.250
why these guys do
it knowing the risk.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:53.580
Now obviously the question then is why use
wormholes? Well, the advantage is that they

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.680
can c-c-cut
the commute time basically to zero or negative

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.270
time, because he can travel back in time as
he goes from

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.160
one house to the next. So, what we're looking
at really is a total of 30 seconds per home.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.630
Because
Santa goes in he delivers the gifts and then

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.990
he jumps through a wormhole and goes on to
the next

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.090
home and travels back 30 seconds at the same
time. And so, as I said before, though the

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.930
issue is he still
needs to live through all this time. So, 30

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.340
seconds works out to about 190 years total,
and divided

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:32.700
among all the lieutenants, basically each
Santa works 6 to 9 months on Christmas Eve

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.819
This is obviously difficult, right? But it
is a little bit manageable because of these

00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:41.550
implanted brain pods
they have that-that constantly release drugs

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.319
that promote wakefulness, alertness, and a
low-level

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:49.850
giddiness that people often mistaken for this
idea of Santa being a jolly ol' soul, right?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.760
That's where it
comes from, he is happy because he drugged.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.110
Now, anyway, we'll get back to 26th here.
So, he's just gotten through the longest workday

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.602
possible.
Obviously, the first thing they will want

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:05.079
to do, these Santas, is sleep. So they take
a little rest and then

00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:10.259
they'll typically go down for a week or so
vacation in the islands somewhere. Normally

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:15.290
it's a private island because they tried staying
at public resorts before, but people start

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.339
to get suspicious when 300 large
white bearded guys go up to the bar asking

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:25.199
for eggnog, right? Now after this vacation,
there is typically

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:31.389
a conference in Las Vegas where they invite
a number of business leaders. It's basically

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:36.990
like the Allen &amp;
Company retreat only sort of more star studded.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:43.560
Now, why would people pay a lot of money to
hear Santa speak? You know, he has been running

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.920
an
organization 150 years, a global organization

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.130
with thousands of employees. He hasn't missed
a delivery

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:58.509
or gotten anything wrong in 150 years and
he pays most of his workers in candy canes.

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:01.079
So obviously,
people are willing to pay a lot of money to

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:06.550
figure out how he gets this done.
Now, you know, he'll run seminars at this

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.949
Vegas conference on: Supply chain management,
logistics,

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:16.629
leadership. He hands all story ideas to Hollywood
producers on new Santa movies. He advises

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:22.310
manufacturer's on sort of the new products
that are going to be out this year, and then

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.529
you know
once this is over, everyone heads back to

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:31.149
the pole, and it's time to hibernate.
You might wonder why does Santa hibernate?

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:36.399
You know, first it's boring up at the North
Pole. Second, it's a little bit lonely. And

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:39.899
the other thing is there are tremendous health
benefits hibernation. I mean

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:46.180
that the fact is it's fun to think of Santa
as immortal, but immortality's impossible,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.910
right? Well, what he
does is he just has an incredible anti-aging

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:54.649
program. Now, one of the benefits of hibernation
and this has been proven in loads of research

00:10:54.649 --> 00:11:01.350
with different animals is that it effectively
halts aging. So, when Santa and his lieutenants

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:08.699
go down for 6 to 9 months, they don't age
for that entire period. Now, for him over

00:11:08.699 --> 00:11:13.009
the course of time, that's-that's worked out
to Santa himself, the Original Clause, or

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:20.490
O.C. saving roughly 50 years. You know, that
he would have been 50 years older today without

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.220
hibernation.
Now, you know, now that we're on the subject

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.579
of health, obviously a big question. You guys
are all

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:32.889
eating nice, healthy lunches there, right?
Well-rounded meals but Santa eats milk and

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.550
cookies, right? I
mean this one night; he is just gobbling down

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.990
loads and loads of milk and cookies. Personally,
you

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.630
know, I'm an Entenmann's fan so if we think
about, you know. If we look at Entenmann's

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.941
cookies and
we assume that every house leaves three cookies

00:11:46.941 --> 00:11:52.269
out for Santa. You know, if we look at the
nutritional

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:57.449
facts, on a box of Entenmann's cookies, which
just so happens that the serving size is three

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:01.399
cookies,
we are looking at 140 calories, right? Seven

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:05.120
grams of fat, 10 mg cholesterol. Now you multiply
that by

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.399
half a million homes, which is what the average
Santa visits in a night and you've got 70

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:16.519
million calories,
3.5 million grams of fat and 5 million milligrams

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:21.760
of cholesterol. That's roughly 50,000 times
the recommended daily allowance of some of

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.670
the stuff. Then we're looking at, you know,
the 8-ounce glass of milk which he always

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.600
throws down because he doesn't want to hurt
these little kids feelings, you know. So you're

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.449
talking about each Santa guzzling down four
million ounces of milk. Now he can't just

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:42.629
work all this off by going to the North pole
and having a personal trainer up there. Even

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:47.300
though the elves are very, very
skilled personal trainers, he needs additional

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.529
help. So he's got, you know, he's got a gene
therapy

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:58.720
program. He's got organ printers up there
so if the liver or the kidneys start to go,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.170
he can have these
new organs printed and swapped in for his

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:08.170
old ones. Obviously, the next question is
how do these, who puts these organs in there?

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:16.180
Is Mrs. Clause a surgeon? But actually, he
has robotic surgeons that perform these operations

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.819
autonomously. They're a little bit like- I
don't know if any of you saw the Revenge of

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:24.050
the Sith, where the robots repair Anakin.
They're a little bit like those, but as you

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:31.670
can see they wear silly Christmas outfits.
Now, Santa and his lieutenants are sleeping

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.750
through the spring, but the North Pole is
hardly quiet at

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:40.430
all. I mean this place is not a candy cane
workshop. It's an underground data center,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.930
millions of square
feet. As you all probably know, the problem

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.379
with data centers is that their tremendous
energy hogs;

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:53.850
huge air conditioning bills keeping the server
coo- servers cool and things like that. And

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.850
you might
have guessed this by now, but that's the whole

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.850
reason he's up at the North Pole is that it's
cold up

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.610
there, and you can just open the windows and
cool everything down when you need to. So,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.790
he saves
a tremendous amount on energy. He also has,

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.360
he uses other sources of energy. You know,
green

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:15.010
energy, generator; tur- wind turbines would
be too obvious. People would start to get

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.110
suspicious
when they see little guys with pointy ears,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.339
you know, fixing the turbines. So, he actually
uses

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:28.559
underwater turbines all around the North Pole.
Now, you might be wondering, why does he need

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:32.769
this giant data center? Well, that's because
of the

00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:39.600
surveillance drones that he has all over the
world. He's got high altitude robotic drones

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.459
sort of like the
predator flying over schoolyards, capturing

00:14:42.459 --> 00:14:47.149
video. He's got micro-aerial vehicles, you
know, peeking

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:51.860
down side streets and through kitchen windows.
And in New York, in a place like New York

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.220
City, he's
constantly tapping into security and surveillance

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.709
cameras. You know, and then all of this video
and

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:04.360
audio is constantly transmitted back to the
North Pole. You know, this is an example of

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.709
something in
the works today at a company called Air Environment

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:10.899
where it's a micro-aerial vehicle made look
like a

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:21.720
hummingbird. Santa's is actually, you know,
way, way smaller, but it is surprisingly similar.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.759
Now the, obviously the point of this is he's
sending all this up to the Pole and then having

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:31.380
it analyzed
by intelligent video analysis software to

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.480
figure out who's been naughty and who's been
nice. Most of it

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.009
is done as I said automatically, but occasionally
when there's a question about something, the

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:42.559
elves do
review it, flag it, and send it to Santa for

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:48.369
a look.
Now, handling all this data has also given

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:51.860
Santa and his, you know, Santa's operation,
they've

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.269
developed tremendous skills with handling
these loads and loads of data. So, they've

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:59.480
actually started
in terms of new revenue streams, they've started

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.429
a cloud- storage cloud computing venture,
where

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:09.999
they will, you know, they'll charge a phenomenally
low amount of money to store your data up

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:12.949
there
securely. But obviously it's covered and not

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:14.970
many people know about it. I don't even know
the name

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:23.370
of the actual company they're using. But you
know, then inside are houses he'll have, you

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.790
know, he'll
have additional surveillance equipment. Like

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.470
here's a standard treetop angel, right? We
have

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:35.259
stereoscopic cameras in the eyes, so you get
a 3D view of what is happening in the living

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:39.100
room. The
wings are actually high gain antenna that

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.860
are sending all this information back to the
North Pole.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.339
Usually if there's a home Wi-Fi network they'll
do it that way at night, so it doesn't hog

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:50.550
your bandwidth
and make anyone suspicious. But there's also

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.259
a microphone array. It's hard to see from
here, but one

00:16:56.259 --> 00:17:02.519
of these little beads here is forward a little
bit, so you have kind of a 3-3D setup. So,

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:04.620
they
can really triangulate the position of what

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.080
they're hearing and figure out where it's
happening in the

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.490
house.
There is also a lidar scanner. You know, the

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.721
laser range finder to figure out the distances
and see

00:17:12.721 --> 00:17:16.650
where everyone, where everyone is exactly.
And then there's a frilly dress to throw you

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.700
off so you
don't notice all the technology.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.440
Now, I -you know, given this incredible increase
in surveillance and all this technology and

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.770
how Santa's
watching us. I've been working with a few

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.590
other people on, you know, a Santa detector
that is going

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.010
to empower people and let them know that Santa's
watching them.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.580
Oh, this is another big concern, right? Forgot
about this one. This Barbie Doll has a hidden

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.500
video camera.
I mean this is just another sign that he's

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.000
gone too far. Right? He's just always trying
to watch us in new

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.880
ways.
Now, this is, you know, an early design for

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.761
a cl- Santa detector that I found on the web
or it's actually

00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:07.830
just a standard stocking with, you know, a
little device here and a ribbon goes across

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.910
the chimney and
when Santa pops out, releases this, the lights

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.031
go off, and you know that Santa is in the
neighborhood.

00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:20.370
The Santa detector on Android, which is available
if you guys want to look for it, is as you

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.210
can see of
simple, simple negative energy meter. So,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.880
one of the things that does is it picks up
the negative energy

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.600
that Santa uses to travel via a wormhole,
and it's going to alert you when Santa has

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.120
been in the area by
picking up whether there's more negative energy

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:48.770
than usual. But it also works by, we basically
track all of Santa's UAVs and then whenever

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.950
one of them gets within 10 meters or so of
your Smart Phone your detector will also go

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.790
off and let you know that Santa is watching.
So you can sort of adjust your behavior or

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.430
ma be if you see a little bird, hit it with
a slingshot or something like that. But be

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.030
careful and make sure it's actually a robot
and not a real bird; that would be terrible.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:16.310
Now, as you can see there is an option here
for parents because I do know that some, you

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.760
know, I-I-
I'm a parent myself. I have a few little kids

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.950
and I know that parents sometimes use and
to try and

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:29.780
encourage her kids to behave better. So there
is a way that you can set the Santa detector

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.421
off
manually, where you basically can say: Santa's

00:19:34.421 --> 00:19:38.150
drones are watching; Santa has recently visited;
Santa is

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.040
on his way; Santa is here but he is invisible.
Right? That is obviously the most powerful

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.231
one. You know
if your kid's being really bad I would suggest

00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:47.910
that setting, where the meter is all the way
over to the

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:53.730
right. And, you know, there is an invisible
Santa roaming around your house, and so it

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.920
is a good idea to
behave. I haven't tested this with my own

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:03.620
kids yet but I hope to soon.
Now, jumping forward to Christmas Eve. So,

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.270
we've got surveillance all worked out. Typically
Christmas

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.860
Eve starts with you know, as most Christmas
Eves do with a big meal, you know, a little

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.380
bit of eggnog,
and then typically, you know, a whole lot

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.860
of coffee because he doesn't want his lieutenants
going off

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:27.440
into people's houses on too much eggnog. So,
when this is all over, each lieutenant has

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.040
an elf handler
who kind of, who tracks him as he goes on

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.920
his mission. But the first thing they do is
a jump through the

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:41.590
entrance to, you know, the first wormhole.
And in basically zero time they get inside

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.070
the next hou-
they get inside the first house. Now, Santa

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.210
doesn't go in there with a big, giant bag
full of presents. He

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:55.071
actually, this wouldn't work. What he does
is he goes and he scans the present that are

00:20:55.071 --> 00:20:57.520
there under
the tree because as we all know our parents

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.260
do leave us some presents. It's not all from
Santa. So Santa, in the days leading up to

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.040
Christmas, they do track parents credit card
receipts and they watch what

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:15.020
parents are buying and then they cross-referenced
that with the kids' Christmas lists and they

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:21.590
can figure out okay what did the parents leave
off? But obviously some parents forget certain

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.790
presents. They forgot
about the bag they hid in the closets or above

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.180
the garage or something like that. So, there
are

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:34.030
forgotten presents. Really the best way for
Santa to guarantee that he is going to deliver

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.080
the right gifts
is to go in there and see what's under the

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.450
tree.
So, he's got a terahertz radiation scanner,

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.300
hand-held obviously, and he looks through
everything, and

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.760
basically that information all gets uploaded.
He sees what presents there are, cross-references

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.100
that
with his list of desired presents and then

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.920
he knows what to leave.
Now, obviously one way to do this is to sort

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.950
of show up at the house with all 10 presents
and, you

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:05.600
know, if there is a list of 10 and just pull
out the one that the kid wanted. But Santa

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.610
has a much simpler,
much better routine, which is he has a self

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:15.820
assembly device that actually its a-it's a
little apparatus that

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.550
allows the, he-he basically plugs in the product
code that he wants of the whatever the gift

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:27.800
is, and the toy self assembles from some molecular
components within this box. Santa doesn't

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.370
even have to wait. He just leaves it there
and he goes.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.930
That might sound a little bit outlandish but
in fact, self-assembly's a very real field

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.180
right now. Scientists
are working on, you know, some incredible

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.490
stuff at the nanoscale. But I've also had
experts tell me that

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:49.730
the idea of a Smart Phone being self-assembled
at some point in the future is totally feasible

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.810
and is
something that these guys are really actually

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.250
thinking about. And obviously it happens in
nature all the

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.740
time, right? We have we have trees self-assemble,
galaxies, planets, everything.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:08.990
Now, so he-he figures out what to leave, he
leaves the present, then he drinks his, you

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.650
know, eats his
cookies, drinks his milk, and jumps through

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:21.020
the entrance to another wormhole. Now these-these
wormhole entrances can be, typically he goes

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.070
through the chimney because, you know, if
he were to go

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:31.210
through a window and pick the wrong window,
you might have a situation where there's a

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.281
broken
glass, and maybe Santa gets knocked out and

00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:36.210
the child comes out in the morning and there's
Santa

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:42.280
lying on the floor with shards of glass. It's
just a terrible way to start Christmas morning.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:49.630
Now the, but as I said wormholes are fantastic
and one of the problems with them are though,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.970
is that
they are tremendous energy hogs. You know,

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.210
some scientist have estimated that you need
the

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:02.860
negative energy equivalent of 318 Earth masses
I think it is just open a worm hole 1 meter

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:09.321
in diameter. So what Santa, you know, one
of the reasons Santa has asked his lieutenants

00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:14.840
to slim down and had trimmer waistlines, is
not just present a more positive public image,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.720
and fight the obesity epidemic, but also because,
you know, the thinner they are the less, you

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.331
know, the worm hole tunnel the thinner the
wormhole tunnel can be, and you can save more

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:31.740
energy; always trying to be more energy efficient.
Now, the wormhole travel method also brings

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.730
up my next big issue, which is the flu, right?
So,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:40.250
I know I mentioned earlier a lot of how, you
know, how the flu spreads and how Santa has

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:47.120
affected this whole thing. Now, today we talk
about, you know, how flu spreads and how it's

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.240
affected by modern travel such as airplane
and things like that and how a virus can jump

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.820
from one
place to another so much more easily than

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.560
in the past. But still, you know, our best
model don't

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.280
accurately predict the rate and flow of these,
of these viruses a lot at the time. Now, I

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.190
think one of the
reasons is that we haven't factored in Santa.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:12.400
Now, if you think, you know, you got a little
kid who's

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.740
coming out and setting up the Christmas tree
and things like that and laying out the cookies

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.510
the night
before Christmas, right? Now imagines this

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:22.980
kid has a cold, she sneezes on the cookies.
Mom and dad

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.030
doesn't notice, right? Leaves the cookies
there. Kids do it all the time. You know,

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.990
they always forget to
cover.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:35.890
Now, hours later Santa comes in he eats the
cookies and he ingests the virus particles,

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.120
right? Now, I know what you're thinking, he's,
Christmas it is just one night it's not long

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.080
enough for him to become virulent and contagious.
But in fact, if we remember he's time traveling

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.420
and for him Christmas Eve is 6 to 9 months
long. So, he, you know, definitely has time

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.500
to become contagious over the course of this
night.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:03.140
Now let's imagine that he stays, you know,
contagious for a week or so, right? Now over

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.550
the course of
that week he is depositing all those virus

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:14.810
particles on those plates, mantle piece, ornaments.
Also don't

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:20.490
think for a second that Santa doesn't use
our bathrooms, right? He drinks 4 million

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.690
gallons of milk; he's gonna use your bathroom,
right? He may use a lot of our bathrooms.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.650
So if you think about it this way, if he is
really leaving his just everywhere. I mean,

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:35.900
the guy visits two houses a one minutes, 120
houses an hour, 2,760 in one of his days because

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:41.270
he actually gets an hour to nap every 24 hours.
So in that one

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:48.150
week that he's contagious, he could potentially
spread the flu to 19,000 homes. That I think

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:53.330
is why this
is flu season. It's really because of Santa

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.960
Claus. And I think we all need to address
this.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:01.870
I think one way to do it is to sort of adjust
the standard stuff we leave out for Santa.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.540
Right, instead
of just the milk and cookies, maybe a little

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.100
thing of hand sanitizer, right, some wipes.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.670
[audience laughs]

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.470
Maybe in the bathroom we leave a note that
says, you know, don't forget to wash and we

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:16.940
mean you Santa. You know, don't forget to
wash your hands because the North Pole is

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.050
effectively
a clean room. I mean, they don't know about

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.310
proper sanitation up there because they've
got robotics surgeons monitoring everything,

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.900
taking care of them. They're like little babies.
So anyway, that's one big issue.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:39.090
Now the other, you know, the other problem,
the other problem with wormholes is, that

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:43.150
there is, and traveling through time over
the course of this night is that there is

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:49.120
a good chance that Santa is going to run into
himself at some point. So plotting the route

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.840
is very, very critical. So that he doesn't
run into himself. Because he could be thousand

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:03.230
places at one time. You know, from our standpoint.
But the problem with this and I talked to

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:08.400
an expert at the University of California
at Berkley about Santa and the time travel

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.762
problem and he was explaining that causality
can throw a huge, this idea of causality can

00:28:13.762 --> 00:28:19.830
throw a huge wrench in the whole operation
where basically we don't know what would happen

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:27.890
if Santa runs into himself or if during the
time travel an event that has happened has

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:36.060
already, basically changes. We could end up,
these wormhole links could be broken, Santa

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.960
could get dropped off in one of these alternate
universes and stranded. So, it's another danger,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.700
but if the risk he's willing to take because
obviously there are so many advantages to

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.000
using these wormholes.
So, you know, that we been talking about the

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.490
lieutenants, but as I said earlier Santa himself,
the

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.300
lieutenants are the ones that do most of the
work but Santa himself still likes to get

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.130
up there and see
the kids and ride around in this sleigh every

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.510
once in a while.
You know, he does have-he does have reindeer

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.800
in front of the sleigh, but as I said the
reindeer don't

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.900
actually fly. As one expert explained it to
me, what we think of as reindeer flying is

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.790
actually just an
illusion, the illusion of, basically what

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:23.660
we're seeing is when Santa takes off from
a roof and creates a warp bubble out in front

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.450
of his ship reindeer disappeared through that
warp bubble and the sleigh disappears with

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:37.220
them and we think of that as flying reindeer
but really they're just really good leapers.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:51.980
Now the warp drive sleigh has the advantage
of, you know, basically instead of, you know

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.620
instead of
going from point A to point B and having to

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.580
travel through all of the space between, a
warp drive

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.890
sleigh will basically pull point B closer
to point A so it shortens travel time. He

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:09.280
has to be very careful
because if he wants to, say from somewhere

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.940
above New York to somewhere above Mountain
View, he's got to make sure that there is

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.660
nothing in his path. You know, no airliners,
no nothing,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:22.050
because space gets short immediately. So if
you have a jetliner in that spot it would

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.480
be crushed to the
size of a pea and everyone and it would be

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.900
gone and Again, not a very nice Christmas
for them.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:37.270
Now, the other part of Santa's mission that's
a little bit dangerous is the- the idea that

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.580
he is in all of
these homes. Some parent somewhere is going

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.240
to hear and get a little bit worried and its
care for the

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.680
kids and possibly come downstairs maybe with
a shotgun and find out who's poking around

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.820
in their
living room. Santa is a nonviolent guy, but

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.051
a lot at times he's busy with his self assembly
and his

00:30:57.051 --> 00:31:02.210
scanning and things like this. So he doesn't
have time a lot of times he doesn't react

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.600
in time to be able
to get away and jump through the wormhole

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.031
tunnel and escape. So, luckily what he does
have is he

00:31:08.031 --> 00:31:16.770
has his old classic red suit is actually woven
with meta materials that bend the light around

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.500
him. So,
when he activates the meta materials in his

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.890
suit he effectively becomes invisible. Now,
this is a nice

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:30.251
little New York Times graphic on how it works.
Where you can see light waves coming in and

00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:34.270
getting
bent around. Now, in the real world scientist,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.850
the real world, I misspoke. I mean in our
world,

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:43.840
obviously Santa's world is real. It's just
not like ours. In our world scientists have

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.580
been able to do this with microwave radiation.
They hadn't gotten to the broad range of visible

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.700
light yet.
I had actually, you know, knowing that longer

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.670
wave length light is apparently easier to
bend I was

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.680
hoping that this was a good explanation for
why Santa's suit is red. Because red is the,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:09.210
you know, a longer wave length of the visible
light. I proposed that to a Duke expert, a

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:16.310
Duke University expert on this subject and
he told me I was crazy.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:22.940
Now, the meta materials though are also a
huge advantage in, you know, villages and

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.530
places like that where Santa doesn't need
to jump through the wormholes because it isn't

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.290
always chimneys. It might be from hut to hut
and you don't need to go through a wormhole

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:37.360
if you want to do that; it's quick enough.
But there also, everyone might be sleeping

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:43.920
in one room, so it's just a great time to
be invisible. Now this is a, these are just

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.750
a few of the technologies that he uses. I,
you know, there are quite a lot more. But

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:56.780
one of the questions that might be on your
mind is where does all this stuff come from

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:03.280
and the answer is, should be fairly obvious.
Aliens, Christmas aliens.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.590
[laughter]

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:11.830
And that's it. As I said if you have any questions
I be happy to answer them. I might be a little

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.660
bit evasive or intentionally confusing but
go ahead. Thank you for having me. I hope

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.830
it was a good lunch hour. And
that's it.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.830
[Audience claps]

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:34.730
&gt;&gt;Female #1: The main question I have is regarding
the NASA announcement yesterday; arsenic based

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:35.730
life forms—

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:36.730
&gt;&gt;Mone: Yeah, they all—

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:37.730
&gt;&gt;Female #1: and how does that impacts Santa?

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:42.550
&gt;&gt;Mone: Wow it's just. It's actually it could
be very helpful to Santa because if we do

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:48.360
manage to find alien life forms he, his technology
does suffer through glitches now and then.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.840
And yet he's not in touch with these aliens
on a regular basis, so there are a few things

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.150
he would like to, if we could get in touch
with them and he could talk to them and maybe

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:01.453
have them fix some of the underwater turbines
up at the pole. Some of them are beginning

00:34:01.453 --> 00:34:06.450
to break down over time. It's been 150 years.
So, yeah. so basically,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.839
hopefully it will make his in the long run
it can make his organization even more efficient.

00:34:10.839 --> 00:34:11.919
But seems
impossible I know, but yeah.

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:21.230
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Well, I had a
question. I saw an ABC documentary last year;

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:25.669
it was back this year called Prep
and Landing, the details a lot of the activities

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:28.840
that elves do to apparently make things good
for the

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.859
legions of Santas. I was wondering if you
could speak a little bit more about career

00:34:32.859 --> 00:34:37.480
progression and job
opportunities in the elf world. Like how is

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.460
their organizational structure built up?

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:45.710
&gt;&gt;Mone: Yeah, that's really good question.
One of the things people like to ask Santa

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.440
when he goes to
Vegas is how do you keep these guys happy?

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:57.809
Because, I mean basically, there-there isn't
a fantastic career path. They're effectively

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:03.279
data, you know, software, they're-they're
video analysts. They're working with the different

00:35:03.279 --> 00:35:07.299
audio stuff that comes in. They're kind of
changed to their cubicles and their computers

00:35:07.299 --> 00:35:12.420
all day. Occasionally he does, a few very
talented elves, he will let them work with

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.369
the technology and try to make improvements.
But as I said it is advanced and technology

00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:23.029
so it does take them a while to get up to
speed. So, yeah it's a big question. I-I've

00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:28.240
got to believe that maybe these drug pods
that Santas use are also implanted in the

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.950
elves' brains and just sort of keeping them
giddy. It sort of, again it makes me wonder

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.450
why we are supporting this guy when he is
doing things like this. You know, like keeping

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:43.431
these elves chained to one position for 150
years, not giving him any opportunity for

00:35:43.431 --> 00:35:47.700
advancement, and watching us constantly, you
know? Yeah.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:58.150
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I know that Santa is a real guy
and has to rely on organ printers. And I was

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:05.039
just wondering if you can talk about maybe
who he is, kind of where he came from, when

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:07.049
he met with the aliens, all that kind of background.

00:36:07.049 --> 00:36:12.049
&gt;&gt;Mone: Right. Yeah, you know a lot of people
don't know this but that he is from Greenpoint

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:13.049
in Brooklyn.

00:36:13.049 --> 00:36:14.500
[laughter]

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:20.000
Now he's not, he's not really the originator
of the Santa idea. You know this Santa, this

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.470
idea of Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus has been
around for hundreds of years. He was an early

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:33.759
imitator and he was going around Brooklyn,
19th century Brooklyn delivering hand carved

00:36:33.759 --> 00:36:39.660
wooden toys and things of that nature. And
at some point the aliens were looking for

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.569
someone to fulfill this role of this all powerful
Santa Claus. They looked around the different

00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:48.940
ones that were operating on earth at this
time: a couple of Germans, a few Norwegian,

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.340
a few Turkish guys as well because Saint Nicholas
does have some origins

00:36:53.340 --> 00:37:00.019
in Turkey. But he decided that this guy, Jebediah
Mezsural from Greenpoint, Brooklyn was really

00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:04.420
the
one to do it. And so Jeb is now the "OC."

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.599
Yeah, very good question.

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.599
[pause]

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.599
[cough]

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:15.859
&gt;&gt;Female #2: One final question. The biggest
question I've had to answer about Santa is

00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:23.730
the song "I saw mommy kissing Santa Clause."
Not personal, but can you speak to that topic

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:29.140
because that has been very charged song in
our household.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.390
&gt;&gt;Mone: Absolutely. I mean, and that lieutenant
was fired.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.700
[audience laughter]

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:40.249
and he was not paid; he was not given 7 figure
severance, nothing. I mean, he was retired,

00:37:40.249 --> 00:37:43.380
sent back
to Florida, his country club membership was

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:49.720
canceled so he couldn't even play golf. I
mean, nobody does that anymore because they've

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.710
learned that if you do that you risk everything.
It's almost worse than getting lost in an

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.730
alternative universe, you know? But, yeah,
I'm glad you asked that.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.859
&gt;&gt;Female narrator: Well thank you for coming
to Google today. We really appreciate it and

00:38:01.859 --> 00:38:03.420
good
luck with Christmas this year.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.579
