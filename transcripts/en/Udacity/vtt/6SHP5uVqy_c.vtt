Hey Magnus, I was looking for you.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.760
&gt;&gt; Hi Jocelyn,
how's your app coming along?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.980
&gt;&gt; It's doing okay but

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.330
I want to run adds in it and
I don't know how to do that.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.570
&gt;&gt; Have you come to the right person.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.120
I just finished a course on ad mob.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.050
&gt;&gt; Cool and how's your app doing?

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.170
It's been out in the play store for
a while now hasn't it?

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.250
&gt;&gt; It's doing great,
tons of people have downloaded it.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.138
&gt;&gt; And what parts of your
app do they use the most?

00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:25.930
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.480
&gt;&gt; Do they use it more on phones or
tablet's, Android TV?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.070
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.490
&gt;&gt; Do they use it more in Africa,
America, Iceland, Australia-

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.450
&gt;&gt; Stop, stop, stop.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.690
How am I supposed to know
the answer to all these questions?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.500
&gt;&gt; You could use Google Analytics.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.840
&gt;&gt; Google what?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.340
I don't how to use that.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.620
&gt;&gt; Have I got a deal for you.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.630
I'll teach you how to
use Google Analytics

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.840
if you'll teach me how
to run ads in my app.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.730
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a great idea.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.840
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.
