00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.850
In a fair democracy everyone's vote should
count equally, but the method that the United

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.849
States uses to elect its president, called
the electoral college, violates this principle

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.290
by making sure that some people's votes are
more equal than others.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.370
The Electoral College is, essentially, the
538 votes that determine who wins the presidency.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.640
If these votes were split evenly across the
population every 574,000 people would be represented

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.910
by one vote.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.900
But that's not what happens because the Electoral
College doesn't give votes to people, only

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.900
states.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.570
Which has some unfair consequences.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
For example there are 11,500,000 people in
Ohio so, to fairly represent them, it should

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620
get 20 electoral votes.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.220
But the Electoral college doesn't give Ohio
20 votes, it only gets 18 -- two less than

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.329
it should.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.510
Where'd those other votes go?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.990
To states like Rhode Island.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.829
Plucky Rhode Island has 1.1 million people
in it, so it should have about two votes,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.329
but instead it gets four!

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.940
Those extra two votes that should be representing
Ohioans go to representing Rhode Islanders

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.940
instead?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.940
Why?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.120
Because, according to the rules of the electoral
college, every state, no matter how few people

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.489
live there, gets three votes to start with
before the rest are distributed according

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.960
to population.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
Because of this rule there are a lot of states
with a few people that should only have one

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.190
or two votes for president but instead get
three or four.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.150
So Georgians, Virginians, Michiganders &amp; Jerseyites
are each missing one vote,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.930
Pennsylvanians, North Carolinians, Ohioans
&amp; Hoosiers are missing two, Floridians are

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.880
missing 4, New Yorkers, 5, Texans 6, and Californians
are 10 short of what they should get.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.480
Because of this vote redistribution, the Electoral
College essentially pretends that fewer people

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.330
live where they do and more people live where
they don't.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.750
An American who lives in one of these states,
has their vote for president count for less

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.119
than an American who lives in one of these
states.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.409
In some cases the Electoral College bends
the results just a little, but if you live

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.700
in a particularly large or small state, it
bends them a lot.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.670
One Vermonter's vote, according to the Electoral
College is worth three Texans' votes.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.430
And one Wyomingite's vote is worth four Californians'.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.510
Now, hold on there son, you might be saying
to yourself right now: you're missing the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.310
whole point of the electoral college.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.050
It's to protect the small states from the
big states.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.130
Give the small states more voting power and
the presidential candidates will have to pay

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.180
them more attention in an election.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.619
If that's the goal of the electoral college,
it's failing spectacularly.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.700
Here's a graph showing the number of visits
the presidential Candidates paid to each of

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180
the states in the last two months of the previous
election.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.989
If it looks like there are a few states missing,
you're right.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.769
Only 18 of the 50 states received even a single
visit from a candidate.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.279
And just two of those states, Mane and New
Hampshire have very small populations.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.250
The area of the country with the most small
states is conspicuously missing.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.730
The Electoral College doesn't make candidates
care about small states.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.319
But, interestingly the biggest states, California,
Texas and New York are missing as well so

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.569
what's going on?

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.489
Looking closer, just four states, Ohio, Florida,
Pennsylvania and Virginia received a majority

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.999
of the candidates' attention during the election.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.510
And if you follow the money, it's the same
story.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.180
Why do candidates spend so much money and
time in so few states?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.230
Because the way the electoral college works
forces them to do so.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.969
The elections are winner-take-all.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.969
As long as a candidate gets just over 50%
of the popular vote in a state he wins 100%

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.989
of that state's electoral votes.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.559
That means winning by millions of citizens'
votes is no better than winning by a single

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.559
vote.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.239
So candidates are safe to ignore states where
they poll with big margins.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.090
Instead, the electoral college makes candidates
intensely interested in the needs of just

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.999
a few states with close races, to the detriment
of of almost all Americans, which is why it

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.340
should be abolished.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.340
But wait!

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.120
You might say, won't abolishing the electoral
college and voting directly for president

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.879
cause candidates to spend all their time in
big cities?

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.059
That wouldn't fair to most Americans either.

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:31.620
This sounds like a reasonable fear, but ignores
the mathematical reality of population distribution.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.099
There are 309 million people in the United
States, only 8 million of which live in New

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.199
York, the largest city by far.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.819
That's 2.6% of the total population.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.159
But after New York, the size of cities drops
fast.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.389
LA has 3.8 million and Chicago has 2.7 but
you can't even make it to the tenth biggest

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.299
city, San Jose before you're under a million
people.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.269
These top ten cities added together are only
7.9% of the popular vote hardly enough to

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.479
win an election.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.469
And even winning the next 90 biggest cities
in the United States all the way down to Spokane

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.650
is still not yet 20% of the total population.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.959
So unless there's a city with a few hundred
million people hiding somewhere in America

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.439
that's been left out of the census, the idea,
that a candidate can just spend their campaign

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.979
Jetting between New York, LA and Chicago while
ignoring everyone else and still become president

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.019
is mathematically ludicrous.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.420
Want to see the real way to unfairly win?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.590
How YOU can become President with only 22%
of the popular vote by taking advantage of

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.419
the Electoral College today!

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.590
Don't believe that's possible in a democracy?

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.590
Just watch:

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.259
Here's the action plan: win the votes of the
people who count the most and ignore the people

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.620
who count the least.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.610
Start with Wyoming, the state where 0.18%
of Americans live but who get 0.56% of the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.099
electoral college votes for president.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.009
And, because it's a winner take all system,
you don't need all of them to vote for you,

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.430
just half plus one or 0.09%.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.190
Next up is the District of Columbia where
winning 0.1% of the population also gets you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.050
an additional 0.56% of the electoral college.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.990
Then add in wins in Vermont, and North Dakota,
and Alaska.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.310
Notice how the votes your getting to win the
presidency go up much faster than the percent

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.689
of the population who voted for you because
of the Electoral College's rules.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.710
Next is South Dakota, then Delaware, Montana,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.169
Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi,

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.300
Iowa, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky,
Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Colorado,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.020
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Maryland, Missouri,
Tennessee, Arizona, Indiana, Massachusetts,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.259
Virginia, and New Jersey.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.759
Congratulations, by taking advantage of unfair
rules and winning states, not people, you've

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.169
won a majority in the Electoral College even
though 78% of the population voted against

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.169
you.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.379
This is not Democracy, this is indefensible.

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.039
While this particular scenario is unlikely,
if you have a voting system that allows losers

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.520
to win, you shouldn't be surprised when they
do.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.080
Not once, not twice, but thrice in American
history the candidate with the most votes

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.819
from the people actually lost because of the
electoral college.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.550
Three errors in 55+ elections is a failure
rate of 5%.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.039
Would anyone tolerate a sport where, by a
quirk of the rules, there was a 5% chance

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.639
that the loser would win?

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.729
Not likely.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.501
Given how much more important electing the
president of the United States is, that's

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.110
a rather dangerously high percentage of the
time to get it wrong.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.069
If we abolish the Electoral College and simply
let citizens vote for the president directly,

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.550
all of these problems will go away and everyone's
vote will be equal.
