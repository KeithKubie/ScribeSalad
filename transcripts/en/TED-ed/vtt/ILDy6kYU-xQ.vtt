00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.139
Look at your hand.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.380
How do you know it's really yours?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.880
It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.231
In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.401
and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen.

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.151
Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush.

00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:31.879
No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours,

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.821
you eventually start to feel like it is,

00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:39.181
and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife.

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.782
That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth:

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:47.211
our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us,

00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.822
and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects,

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:55.071
have a complicated, tangled relationship.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:59.951
Which one primarily defines you
or your self?

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:03.312
Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions

00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:06.943
as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain?

00:01:06.943 --> 00:01:09.083
That would be a body with a mind.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:12.393
Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:15.072
but could live outside 
of your biological body?

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:17.562
That would be a mind with a body.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.234
That takes us to an old question

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:23.113
of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things.

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.283
In a famous thought experiment,

00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.983
16th-century philosopher 
RenÃ© Descartes pointed out

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.304
that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream,

00:01:32.304 --> 00:01:35.353
our mind and thoughts 
would still be there.

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:39.094
That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence.

00:01:39.094 --> 00:01:40.694
And it led him to conclude that

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:44.014
the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:47.364
that forms the core of our identity.

00:01:47.364 --> 00:01:49.785
The notion of a non-physical consciousness

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:53.464
echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul

00:01:53.464 --> 00:01:57.124
for which the body is only 
a temporary shell.

00:01:57.124 --> 00:02:00.685
If we accept this, 
another problem emerges.

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:05.922
How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body?

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:08.755
If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion,

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:11.686
how can it move your muscles?

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:17.595
Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others?

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.984
Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma.

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:26.766
For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:30.026
claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork,

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:33.407
it's actually god who moves our hand.

00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:35.986
Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:39.410
concluded that the material world
is an illusion,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.567
existing only as mental perceptions.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:47.216
This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers.

00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:50.436
With the development of psychology
and neuroscience,

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:54.036
scientists have weighed in, as well.

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:56.796
Many modern scientists reject the idea

00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:00.257
that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body.

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:04.307
Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses,

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:07.216
are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:10.318
to form what we call consciousness.

00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:11.647
From the day we're born,

00:03:11.647 --> 00:03:15.078
our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:16.978
with the external world.

00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:22.208
Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:27.618
that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self.

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:30.639
And we have other senses,
besides the typical five,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.680
such as the sense of balance

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.689
and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.138
The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments,

00:03:40.138 --> 00:03:45.778
show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self.

00:03:45.778 --> 00:03:48.690
They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.290
are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.929
If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start.

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.240
After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.340
the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.640
This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.861
at a time when we're considering
future technologies,

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:18.171
such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots

00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:21.522
that could become extended parts
of our bodies.

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:25.331
Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading,

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:29.111
which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body

00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:33.982
by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.664
If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain,

00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:40.363
then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices,

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.872
our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:47.475
with new sensory representations.

00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:52.403
Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible

00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:59.672
unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations.

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:03.313
The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:05.262
also isn't new.

00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:07.522
It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought,

00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:12.504
as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle.

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:15.153
But for now, we're still left
with the open question

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:20.162
of what exactly our self is.

00:05:20.162 --> 00:05:24.484
Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested?

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:27.965
Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:29.985
over millions of years of evolution

00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:35.144
thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors?

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:39.084
Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?
