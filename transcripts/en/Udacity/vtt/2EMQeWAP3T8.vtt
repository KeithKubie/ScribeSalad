00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.460
Months before the launch of Tales from the Genome, during the planning

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.119
and preparation phases. I actually created a mini-lesson to see what it would

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.150
be like to try to teach genetics to the world. Now I

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.110
shared this mini-lesson with my colleagues here at Udacity. And they liked it

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.379
so much that they thought we should share it with all of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.540
you. Now although the style's a bit different from what you're used to

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.650
in other Udacity courses because I've pretty much created the whole thing

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.910
using just my iPad, I still think you're really going to enjoy it.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.790
So have fun learning how to extract

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.300
DNA from strawberries in your very own kitchen.
