00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.140
Few feats of engineering are as impressive
as a military-grade helicopter.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.860
Today worth millions of dollars each, these
high-tech birds are a formidable military

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.101
asset, including, among many other uses, for
rescue operations- all a fact US military

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:35.580
personnel helpfully chose to ignore during
Operation Frequent Wind when they pushed several

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.220
dozen of them into the sea, in one case for
no other reason than to save a mother, a father,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.220
and their five children.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.510
For anyone unfamiliar with it, Operation Frequent
Wind was the name give to the final phase

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.250
of evacuations during the Fall of Saigon-
effectively the final days of the Vietnam

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.250
War.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.229
Noted as being one of the largest military
evacuations in history and the largest involving

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.780
helicopters as the primary means of evacuation,
Operation Frequent Wind is celebrated as a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.920
logistical success for the US due to the fact
that a few dozen helicopter pilots were somehow

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.940
able to evacuate over 7,000 people in around
18 hours.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.890
This is made all the more impressive when
you realise that the mass evacuation was never

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.350
supposed to involve helicopters much at all.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.390
You see, while Operation Frequent Wind is
now famous for being the most successful mass

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.329
helicopter evacuation ever organised, using
helicopters as the primary means of evacuation

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.409
was never the original plan- it wasn’t even
the backup plan.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.860
It turns out that it was the backup to the
backup to the backup plan.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.200
Known initially as Operation Talon Vise until
North Vietnamese spies heard whispers of it,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.149
the plans for a mass evacuation of Vietnam
had been in place for several years and were

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.320
originally supposed to involve the primary
use of both commercial and military aircraft

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.859
which would evacuate at-risk citizens and
military personnel, with the total slated

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.270
to be evacuated estimated to be about 2 million
people.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.810
Failing or in addition to this, the idea was
to dock ships at Saigon port and load them

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.499
with as many people as possible.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.680
In the event none of these options were possible,
the final, Hail Mary plan was to instead use

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.510
military helicopters to transport people to
ships off shore.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.700
Of course, evacuating the original estimate
of 2 million people was never an option for

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.510
the helicopter plan alone, nor even the extremely
whittled down number of about 100,000-200,000

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.780
that military brass eventually reduced that
figure to.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.870
Instead, at this point it was just as many
people as they could as fast as they could.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.069
So why did the US have to fall back to literally
their least effective option if they’d been

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.150
planning the evacuation for years?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.400
Well, much of the blame falls somewhat unbelievably
to the actions of a single man- Graham Anderson

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.290
Martin, the American ambassador to South Vietnam
at the time who steadfastly refused to agree

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.420
to start an evacuation for fear of mass panic
and given his unshakable faith in the notion

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.909
that the threat of the “superior American
firepower” would keep the enemy at bay.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.780
Despite this, recommendations did go out in
advance of Operation Frequent Wind that at

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.550
risk people should leave the country, resulting
in a total of around 50,000 people, including

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.470
a few thousand orphans, leaving via various
planes in the months leading up to an actual

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.480
evacuation being started.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.579
This was mostly done via supply aircraft who
would bring supplies in, and then load up

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.740
as many people as they could for the trip
home.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.489
Yet an official full scale evacuation, which
would have seen these efforts massively ramped

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.989
up, was continually stalled by Martin.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.519
Military brass tried and failed to persuade
Martin to change his mind, with Brigadier

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.330
General Richard E. Carey going as far as to
travel to Saigon to plead personally with

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.549
with the ambassador.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.599
This was a meeting Carey would later diplomatically
call “cold and non productive” and should

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.750
be noted took place on April 13th, 2 weeks
after preparations were already supposed to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.019
have begun for the mass evacuation.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.040
This back and forth continued until April
28th when North Vietnamese forces bombed the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.780
Tan Son Nhut Air Base, effectively eliminating
any possibility of getting people out via

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.629
large aircraft capable of mass evacuation.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.709
When this was pointed out to the Martin, he
still refused to call for the evacuation,

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.840
deciding to wait until the next day so he
could drive out to the base and confirm the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.310
damage for himself.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.989
Upon confirming that North Vietnamese forces
had indeed destroyed the air base and the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.280
best option for a mass evacuation, he finally
relented.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.440
This was an order that was relayed to soldiers
on the ground via the official Armed Forces

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.350
Radio station by the words “The temperature
in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising,” followed

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.690
by the playing the song I’m Dreaming of
a White Christmas by Bing Crosby.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.290
As a direct result of Martin’s stubbornness,
the military had no choice but to rely on

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.540
the least effective means of mass evacuation-
via helicopter, with the operation officially

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.360
commencing later that afternoon at 14:00.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.410
Even as the operation began, Martin’s bullheaded
refusal to prepare in anyway for an evacuation

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.130
caused problems for certain helicopter pilots,
most notably the ones trying to evacuate him

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.630
and his staff.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.630
How?

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.210
Well there was a large tree in the embassy
courtyard that military brass had “strongly

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.310
advised” Martin cut down so as to better
allow helicopters to land there should the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.310
worst happen.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.890
Martin, believing that doing so would be as
good as admitting the war had already been

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.420
lost, absolutely refused to do this.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.800
As Henry Kissinger would later note, “Faced
with imminent disaster, Martin decided to

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.190
go down with the ship.”

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.290
On that note, to his credit, Martin refused
to leave once the evacuation had begun, though

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.700
this was much to the annoyance of the pilot,
Colonel Gerry Berry, sent to fetch him.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.720
Instead, Martin continually had refugees boarded
while he simply waited with his staff in his

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.780
office, knowing that as long as he was there,
the helicopter would keep coming back allowing

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.420
more lives to be saved.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.830
It wasn’t until the 14th trip that an exhausted
Berry finally reached his wits’ end.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.640
Said Berry, “I called the sergeant over.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.230
And he got up in the cockpit.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.010
And I said, ‘This is it.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.620
Get all these people off.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.170
This helicopter’s not leaving the roof until
the ambassador’s on board.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.090
The President sends.'”

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.220
With an order supposedly from the President
himself, though not actually in reality, Martin

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.900
finally relented and allowed Berry to complete
his mission by transporting Martin and his

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.900
entourage.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.240
Of course, what the military brass had failed
to remember after this supposed last flight

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.530
was that they’d accidentally left almost
a dozen soldiers behind at the compound…

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.160
This wouldn’t be realized for many hours,
but all 11 Marines were rescued after being

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160
forced to barricade themselves on the rooftop
for the night in case of an attack.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.590
Leaving the evacuations as late as Martin
did understandably resulted in mass panic

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.040
across Saigon with many thousands of South
Vietnamese citizens fleeing in everything

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.110
from cars to stolen planes and helicopters.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.660
In addition, lack of time meant that helicopter
pilots had a laughable number of people to

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.130
rescue, resulting in many ignoring the “recommended”
weight limit of their craft and massively

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.690
overloading them to the very extremes of what
they could handle given the pilot’s assessments

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:54.990
and weather conditions.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.950
In one case, one pilot noted he was overweight
to the point that he could only hover inches

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.800
off the ground, but no one was willing to
get off as for many it would mean their life

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.440
if they could not get out of the country.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.920
He then stated he thought if he could get
some forward speed he could get the additional

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.950
lift needed, so simply pitched the craft forward
and took a dive off the rooftop he was on,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.220
barely recovering before hitting the rooftops
below and then managing to very slowly climb

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.240
from there.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.930
As for these pilots, they were instructed
to ferry evacuees to waiting ships in the

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.560
South China Sea, many of which quickly began
to run out of space resulting in people sleeping

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.600
double in the small bunks, as well as just
anywhere on the ships there was available

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.260
space for someone to sit or lie down on.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.250
On top of that, any South Vietnamese pilots
that could manage to get a hold of their own

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.040
helicopters and flee to sea were also crowding
the decks as they arrived.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.600
This resulted in the order to push some of
these South Vietnamese helicopters overboard

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.070
to make more space, or orders for some pilots
to simply crash their helicopters into the

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.170
ocean and await rescue after they’d dropped
off any passengers.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.720
This all brings us around to the incredible
story of Major Buang Lee.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.940
Knowing he and his family- a wife and five
children- would in all likelihood be executed

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.850
if they couldn’t find a way out of the country
immediately, the Major managed to commandeer

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.530
a small Cessna O-1 spotter plane.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.430
Under heavy fire, he managed to take off and
flee the country with two adults and five

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.560
children jam packed aboard the tiny, slow
moving aircraft.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.850
He then headed out to sea in search of a ship
to land on or ditch the plane next to.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.270
About an hour and a half off the coast and
with only about an hour of fuel left, he finally

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.840
found one in the USS Midway.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.950
The issue now was there was not sufficient
room to land on the ship, owing to the number

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.300
of helicopters on the deck.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.599
Unable to find the right frequency on the
radio to talk to those on the Midway, Buang

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.330
resorted to dropping notes.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.230
The first two notes, unfortunately blew away
before anyone aboard could grab them.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.680
Buang tied the third to his gun and dropped
it.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.010
When the crew aboard retrieved it, they saw
it read: “Can you move the helicopters to

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.950
the other side, I can land on your runway,
I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.950
to move.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.950
Please rescue me.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.420
-Major Buang, Wife and 5 child.”

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.600
The captain of the vessel, one Lawrence Chambers
then had a decision to make.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.129
While it was possible to move some of the
helicopters out of the way, there was no room

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.129
to move them all.

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:10.839
The young captain, only appointed to that
post some five weeks before, decided that

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:14.160
there was little chance the family would all
survive if they tried to ditch in the sea

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.680
next to the Midway and be rescued that way.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.470
Said Lawrence of the event, “When a man
has the courage to put his family in a plane

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.860
and make a daring escape like that, you have
to have the heart to let him in.”

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.319
So, thinking he’d likely be court-martialed
for it, he made the call to move what helicopters

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:31.810
could be moved and dump the rest in the ocean
after stripping them of any valuable gear

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.060
that could be removed quickly.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.910
In total, some $10 million (about $65 million
today) worth of helicopters were ditched in

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.060
this way.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.420
There was another problem, however.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.759
The plane in question typically needs a minimum
of a little over 600 feet of runway to land

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:47.000
and come to a full stop.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.259
The Midway itself in total was about 1,000
feet long, but the runway deck was only about

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:54.120
2/3 of that, meaning there was zero margin
for error here.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.120
Thus, in order to land such a craft on the
deck with enough margin of safety, the ship

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.310
really needed to be moving as fast as possible
to make the plane’s relative speed slow

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.709
enough that it could stop in time before falling
off the end.

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:10.680
Using the cable system to stop the craft faster
wasn’t deemed a good option as in all likelihood

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.449
it would have just resulted in the landing
gear ripping off and/or the plane flipping

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:16.790
over in a spectacular crash.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.470
Unfortunately, Chambers had previously granted
the ship’s engineers permission to take

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.660
the Midway’s engines partially offline for
routine maintenance.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.860
After all, helicopters did not need nor want
that relative wind, especially when landing

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.110
on such a crowded deck.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.220
Said Chambers, “When I told the chief engineer
that I needed 25 knots, he informed me that

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.510
we didn’t have enough steam.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.310
I ordered him to shift the hotel load to the
emergency diesels.”

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.399
With this, the ship was able to achieve the
requested speed and Buang’s landing was

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:47.260
also helped by another 15 knots of headwind,
further reducing his needed stopping distance.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.949
With that done and deck cleared as it could
be, Buang was given the greenlight to land,

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:55.250
ultimately doing so with textbook precision
and with plenty of deck to spare, becoming

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.180
a rare individual in relatively modern times
to land such an aircraft aboard a military

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180
carrier.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.709
And, thankfully for Captain Lawrence, he was
not court-martialed for ditching rather valuable

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:08.839
military hardware to save Major Buang and
his family, and instead enjoyed a continuance

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:12.379
of his successful career, eventually retiring
as a Rear Admiral.

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:16.540
In the aftermath of Operation Frequent Wind,
the U.S. ships continued to hang around for

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.970
a few days off the coast, trying to pick up
as many refugees from the water as they could.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.149
Finally, the order was given to head home,
forcing the commanders to leave many thousands

00:11:25.149 --> 00:12:18.440
of people that had been promised evacuation
behind.
