00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:03.095
- What is the length of arc ABC?

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:07.435
So arc ABC is this arc right over here,

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:08.715
and the reason why they have to give us

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:09.934
three points because if they just said

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.486
arc AC, it would still be ambiguous

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:14.855
because there's two arc AC's.

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:16.623
It could be this arc right over here

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:19.230
or it could be this arc over here.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.849
So when they tell us B we know

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.251
that we're going from A to C

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.303
through B, so that's why

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:27.350
this kind of giving us that third letter

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.341
resolves the ambiguity on which

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:30.491
arc we're talking about.

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:32.082
So what is the length of that arc?

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:33.803
Well the first thing we could do is,

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:35.550
let's just think about the entire,

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.604
what's the circumference of this circle?

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:40.447
And then we can say what fraction

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:43.994
of the entire circumference is this arc?

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.843
And a big hint here is if we were

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:47.794
to go all the way around the circle

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:49.663
that would be 360 degrees,

00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:54.118
but we're only going 135
of those 360 degrees.

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:56.408
Let's think first think
about the circumference.

00:00:57.358 --> 00:01:00.057
So, the circumference
of a circle is equal to

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:04.194
two pi times the radius of the circle,

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:06.455
and they give us the
radius as three inches.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.070
So the circumference is going to be

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.232
two pi times three inches,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:15.442
so times three inches,

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:19.201
or two times three is six times pi.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.036
So it's going to be six pi, six pi inches.

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:27.002
Now, and actually if you look at the....

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.599
If you look at the choices over here

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:34.235
the entire circumference of
the circle is six pi inches.

00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:38.110
Remember pi is 3.14159,
so this is going to be

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.721
something in the...

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:43.472
It's going to be a little
bit over 18 or 19 inches.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.402
So you could immediately...

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:46.915
If the entire circumference
is a little over

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:49.678
18 or 19 inches, this is only a fraction

00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:51.274
of that entire circumference.

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.554
So actually if you were even looking

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:54.057
at the choices you'd
say, "Well hey, these are

00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:56.258
way too large."

00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:57.918
But I still see if we could get to

00:01:57.918 --> 00:01:59.677
the exact right answer.

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:02.101
So the entire circumference
is six pi inches

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.067
but this arc length isn't
the entire circumference.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.293
It only goes 135 degrees
out of 360 degrees.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.325
So we could say...

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:15.235
So it is 135 360th

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:17.515
of the entire circumference.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.797
Remember, if we were to
go all the way around

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:23.373
that's 360 degrees, while
this angle right over here

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:28.813
is 135 degrees, the angle
that is subtended by this arc.

00:02:29.806 --> 00:02:33.139
So this arc length is
going to be 135 out of...

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.558
135 360th of the entire circumference.

00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:40.127
So times, times six pi,

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:43.039
six pi inches.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.891
Let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:48.856
Let's see...

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:49.944
We could divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:52.921
by six, six divided by six is 130...

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.812
360 divided by six is 60,

00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.022
and let's see, if we divide

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:03.888
135 by five, that is going to be

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.479
27, yeah.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.369
100 divided by five is 20,

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.388
and then 35 divided by five is seven

00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:12.262
so this is going to be 27,

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:14.220
and then this would be 12.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.933
We divide 60 by five.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:18.990
Let's see, we can then
divide the numerator

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.641
and the denominator by three.

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:23.791
27 divided by three is nine,

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:26.554
and 12 divided by three is four.

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:29.967
So we're left with nine
fourths times pi inches.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.599
So nine fourths times pi inches.

00:03:35.242 --> 00:03:37.287
or we can multiply the
numerator times the pi.

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:41.661
We could say nine pi over four inches.

00:03:42.406 --> 00:03:44.119
When you look at the choices

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.273
that is this one.

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:50.028
That is this one right over there.
