00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.100
TODD KERPEMAN: I am here at
the gaming garage with Darren

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.370
Hilton, checking out what is
sure to be the next great head

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.570
game MechaHamster.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.220
Hi, Darren.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.210
DARREN HILTON: Hi Todd,
how are you doing?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.043
TODD KERPEMAN: Good.

00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:22.620
Now the last time
I saw MechaHamster,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.050
it did not have this
multiplayer component

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.700
that I'm seeing
going on behind me.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.042
What's going on here?

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.500
DARREN HILTON: So this is a
project that we did with Cloud.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.240
And so we decided to incorporate
the Agones Open Match

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.865
open source projects
into MechaHamster.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:36.115
TODD KERPEMAN: What are those?

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.290
Start with Open Match.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.707
DARREN HILTON: So Open Match
is a framework for connecting

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:41.713
clients to our game servers.

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:42.630
TODD KERPEMAN: Gotcha.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.720
Meaning that if you've got
a bunch of players that

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.580
want to play a
multiplayer game together,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.920
I would use Open Match to
help connect them based

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.165
on what kind of criteria--

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:52.980
DARREN HILTON: Based on the
criteria that you lay out,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.563
their skill level,
that kind of thing.

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:56.896
You can go in and kind of dig
in and give that criteria.

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:58.396
TODD KERPEMAN: So
that kind of helps

00:00:58.396 --> 00:00:59.880
solve the problem
of finding people

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.840
that actually want to play--

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.310
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.060
TODD KERPEMAN: --with
maybe the same skill

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.280
level or are in the
same general area,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.597
have good network latency.

00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:07.930
DARREN HILTON: Exactly, exactly.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.550
TODD KERPEMAN: Excellent.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.720
DARREN HILTON: You don't want
to have that experience where

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.240
you have low level players
being connected with high level

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.838
players and then getting
a bad game experience.

00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:17.130
TODD KERPEMAN: And then Agones.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.180
What is that?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.920
DARREN HILTON: So Agones is
a multiplayer gaming server

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.960
application that's
built on Kubernetes.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.710
TODD KERPEMAN: OK.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.180
And so I know there's a lot
of multiplayer game servers

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.680
out there.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.380
What makes Agones special?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.750
DARREN HILTON: So Agones is
special in that it can scale

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.090
to the needs of your game.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.820
So if you wanted to add
thousands of servers--

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.320
TODD KERPEMAN: You mean when
MechaHamster becomes a megahit?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.695
DARREN HILTON: When it becomes--

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:41.880
TODD KERPEMAN: We've got
millions and millions

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.560
of people playing?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.710
DARREN HILTON: And we totally
expect that to happen.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.170
TODD KERPEMAN: Of course.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.670
DARREN HILTON: It's
going to happen.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.733
The other thing too is
that it's cloud agnostic.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.900
It's an open source project.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.830
You can run it on any
cloud service you want.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.810
You can run it locally.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.070
You could run it in your own
on frame in your own service.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.430
TODD KERPEMAN: On-prem?

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.000
DARREN HILTON: Yes, on-prem.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.550
TODD KERPEMAN: And so, because
it's based on Kubernetes,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.020
it can scale to sort of--

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.530
DARREN HILTON: It can scale.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.430
TODD KERPEMAN:
Basically, until I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.028
run out of servers or until
Google runs out of servers,

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:06.320
which is going to take a while.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.620
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.460
And everything you
need for that server

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.193
is contained in that
Kubernetes container.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:12.110
TODD KERPEMAN: Gotcha.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.580
And so now with a dedicated
game server like Agones,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.430
I know sometimes in multiplayer
games, particularly mobile

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.740
ones, you'll have the
clients talking to each other

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.600
directly in like a
peer to peer network.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.687
What makes a dedicated
game server better?

00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.395
DARREN HILTON: So a
dedicated game server

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.300
gives you the added
level of security,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.960
in that that's a sort of truth.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.240
And the scalability
is another thing.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.600
So you can scale to however
you want it to scale,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.670
to the needs of your game.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.000
And a peer to peer network is
relatively limited in that--

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150
generally limited to a
smaller amount of clients.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.860
TODD KERPEMAN: You can't
have 100 clients all talking.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.350
DARREN HILTON: Can't
have 100 clients.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.240
TODD KERPEMAN: That would just--

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.830
That poor one client that's
acting as your, like, server

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.569
for that episode.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.527
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:52.777
Somebody could mess with that.

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:54.442
It could lose its game state.

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:56.400
There's a lot of things
can go wrong with that.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.090
TODD KERPEMAN: Gotcha.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.760
I'm guessing latency is probably
more likely to be consistent,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.460
because you're not
relying on that one client

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.500
to be the server
for the entire game.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.533
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:06.450
TODD KERPEMAN: Gotcha.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.152
All right.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.610
And then I couldn't
help but notice

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.430
you were wearing a very
stylish Firebase t-shirt.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.012
So Firebase is integrated
in this game as well?

00:03:14.012 --> 00:03:14.970
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.803
So we're using a bunch
of Firebase products.

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:20.630
We're using Authentication,
Cloud Messaging, Remote Config,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.578
Realtime Database
and Crashlytics.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.870
TODD KERPEMAN: Oh, Crashlytics.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.580
That's new, right?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.880
DARREN HILTON: New
as of GDC, yes.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.922
TODD KERPEMAN: All right.

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:29.200
And is this running on Unity?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.300
DARREN HILTON:
It's run on Unity.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.842
TODD KERPEMAN: And
so now Crashlytics

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:34.080
for Unity will actually
let me, as a developer,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.910
find out if there are
crashes in my game

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.420
and where they're happening.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.930
DARREN HILTON: Exactly.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.240
So you can go through,
find your stack trace,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.893
and then narrow in on the bugs
that are affecting your game.

00:03:41.893 --> 00:03:42.810
TODD KERPEMAN: Gotcha.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.192
And have you found lots of
crashes in and MechaHamster?

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.400
DARREN HILTON: Of course not.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.730
TODD KERPEMAN: Well, of course,
because it is solid code.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.813
DARREN HILTON: Rock solid.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.980
TODD KERPEMAN: Rock solid
code that never crashes.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.615
And with Remote Config, I know
one of the fun things of Remote

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:57.240
Config, especially
as a game developer,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.400
is like you find some
level is too hard

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.300
or some setting
is too difficult,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.850
you can basically
kind of tweak that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.160
and all your clients
get updated on the fly.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.060
DARREN HILTON: You
can turn, that yes.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.768
And you can roll out
to all your clients,

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.167
but you can roll out to a
segment of players as well.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.000
TODD KERPEMAN: Like for
running an A/B test?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.890
DARREN HILTON: Yes, exactly.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.540
You can test that.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.450
And if it's stable, then you
can roll out a different one

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.112
as well.

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:18.570
TODD KERPEMAN: If I wanted to
try out MechaHamster at home,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.980
how would I be able to do that?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.230
DARREN HILTON: You can
download the single player game

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.210
from the Play Store
or from the App Store.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.252
TODD KERPEMAN: All right.

00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:27.240
And last question,
were any hamsters

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.992
harmed in the making
of MechaHamster?

00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:31.200
DARREN HILTON: I believe not.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.800
TODD KERPEMAN: All right.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.330
That's always good to hear.
