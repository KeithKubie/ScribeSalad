so there's been this evolution of
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029
so there's been this evolution of
knowledge and sophistication and it's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
knowledge and sophistication and it's
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.990
knowledge and sophistication and it's
all kind of come back down into where

food that is as nutrient rich as
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.050

important points and hopefully the food
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.590
important points and hopefully the food
is organic hopefully it's been harvested

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
is organic hopefully it's been harvested
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.620
is organic hopefully it's been harvested
or processed in a really healthy green

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
or processed in a really healthy green
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.140
or processed in a really healthy green
way you are really thinking globally and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
way you are really thinking globally and
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240
way you are really thinking globally and
acting locally I mean it really is kind

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
acting locally I mean it really is kind
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760
acting locally I mean it really is kind
of the fruition of that concept which

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
of the fruition of that concept which
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.539
of the fruition of that concept which
was you know the in the last 10 years so

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
was you know the in the last 10 years so
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910
was you know the in the last 10 years so
that you're really helping sustain your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
that you're really helping sustain your
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980
that you're really helping sustain your
area and the people that live within

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
area and the people that live within
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.530
area and the people that live within
your radius so to me it makes a lot of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
your radius so to me it makes a lot of
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.310
your radius so to me it makes a lot of
sense and it's the way that we lived all

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
sense and it's the way that we lived all
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980
sense and it's the way that we lived all
those years ago and it in terms of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
those years ago and it in terms of
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990
those years ago and it in terms of
health it makes the most sense for sure

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
health it makes the most sense for sure
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.059
health it makes the most sense for sure
because what it does is it forces you to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
because what it does is it forces you to
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.270
because what it does is it forces you to
eat in a much more healthy manner
