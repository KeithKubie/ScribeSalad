00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.150
It’s 1961.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.170
You’re wandering around Stanford University,
looking for a sandwich or something when you

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.429
happen to walk by a particular room in a particular
lab, and see something a little unnerving.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.140
Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable
clown named Bobo in the neck.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.339
Over and over in its neck.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.429
This was the lab of legendary psychologist
Albert Bandura, and in 1961 he was studying

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.529
one of the most important phenomena in psychology.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.410
See, while the woman was throttling that big
inflatable clown, there was a child watching

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
her.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.610
And after about ten minutes of observing this
clown-beating display, the kid was taken to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.170
a room full of fun toys, which were soon taken
away, and then the frustrated kid was left

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.290
alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched what
happened.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.980
And yeah, what happened was kind of scary.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.620
Kids who watched the woman beating the clown
were much more likely to mimic her aggression

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.140
-- kicking, punching, throwing, even attempting
to maul Bobo with a hammer.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.170
But other children who saw an adult playing
nicely with the doll, or just ignoring it,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.460
didn’t respond the same way in their frustration.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.580
Bandura’s results may seem predictable now,
but in those days, they challenged the dominant

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.760
behaviorist views that we talked about last
week -- the views that learning is solely

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.440
about conditioning and association, rewards
and punishments.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.470
Bandura’s research focused on how learning
can occur through observing and imitating

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.470
someone else’s behavior.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.750
And if that seems obvious to you, you have
Bandura to thank for that.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.310
His research hastened the evolution of 20th
century experimental psychology from pure

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.210
behaviorism into what we now know as social-cognitive
learning.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.560
While it was closely related to behaviorism,
the social-cognitive models added profoundly

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.810
new dimensions to what Skinner and Watson
and Pavlov had observed in our feathered and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.810
furry friends.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.440
In other words, it showed us that -- just
as there’s more than one way to beat up

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.920
a clown -- there’s way more than one way
to learn.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.390
[INTRO]

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.140
Last week we talked about the differences
between classical and operant conditioning

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.050
in associative learning -- the kind of learning
that comes from connecting different events

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.050
and stimuli.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.859
In classical conditioning, this means associating
a stimulus with some kind of involuntary response

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.519
-- the whole dog slobbering at the sound of
a bell phenomenon -- whereas operant conditioning

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.310
makes associations between stimulus and a
voluntary behavior -- like the rat pressing

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.150
a lever to get delicious snacks, or jumping
out of a cage to escape an electrical shock.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.909
And that’s all well and good, but if learning
is the process of acquiring and retaining

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.790
new behavior and information, then Bandura’s
experiments showed us that conditioning with

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.950
external rewards, punishments, or other stimuli
isn’t the only way to do it.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.019
It’s hard to deny that pretty much all animals
are capable of learning certain things by

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.870
association, but critics of behaviorists like
Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner had a problem

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.790
with their assertions that, when it came to
learning, it didn’t matter much whether

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.439
you’re training rats, pigeons, or people--it’s
all the same.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.519
Because, lots of research has demonstrated
that an animal’s capacity for conditioning

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.689
is actually limited by its biology.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.749
Consider this scenario: Say I get a raging
case of food poisoning after eating my head-weight

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.099
in raw oysters with my friend Bernice.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.670
I’m probably not going to want to touch
oysters again for a long, long time, because

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.650
I associate their smell and taste with the
smell and taste they made when I was — when

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.930
they were coming back out, is what I’m trying
to say.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.989
But, that doesn’t mean that the sight of
Bernice, or the sound of the sea shanties

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.640
they were playing at the restaurant would
make me barf, because humans are, by our very

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.870
nature, more taste averse than we are sight
or sound averse.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.249
On the other hand, sight-oriented animals,
like birds, may be biologically predisposed

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.900
to avoid tainted food by sight, since that’s
how they hunt and forage.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.559
And presumably they go to restaurants that
play better music.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:42.189
Anyway, all of this tells us that species
can more easily learn associations that help

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.930
them thrive or survive, and that not all associations
are learned equally.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.309
It’s a lot easier to teach a pigeon to peck
an X on the ground to obtain a food reward

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.859
than it is get it to flap its wings to get
that same reward, because pecking is a natural

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.389
foraging behavior for a pigeon.

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.139
In the same way, it would be much harder for
the bird to learn to peck that X to avoid

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.019
a shock, rather than to flap its wings to
avoid the shock, because flying away from

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.339
danger is what pigeons naturally do.

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:10.480
Learned associations are even more complicated
in humans of course, because what we learn

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.059
doesn’t only influence our behavior, it
also shapes our attitudes.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:18.970
Our cognition -- that is, our thoughts, perspectives,
and expectations -- is important for learning,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.250
as is our social context, as Bandura figured
out.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.770
So, Pavlov-style conditioning experiments
that ignore those social-cognitive elements

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.229
can really run into trouble.

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.940
For example, someone under treatment for an
alcohol addiction may be given booze laced

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.539
with a nauseating drug.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.639
According to the pure classical conditioning
model, that person would then equate booze

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.900
with feeling nasty.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.120
But the brain can override this association
if it’s aware that it’s the added drug,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.080
and not the alcohol, is the thing that’s
causing the illness.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.180
Sometimes we can think our way out of intended
associations.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.759
And by the same token, a person’s social
context - like, their friends, family traditions,

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.500
or life stressors - can reinforce something
like alcohol consumption more than the nauseating

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.860
pill could ever punish it.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.479
Plus, we also do a lot of latent learning,
like without even knowing it.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.240
Have you ever been walking around a new city,
someone stops you to ask directions, and you

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.560
surprise yourself by actually being able to
tell that tourist how to get to the park?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.509
That’s because we’re constantly developing
cognitive maps, or mental representations

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.480
of our surroundings, without explicitly telling
ourselves to do it.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.260
We’ve all seen the experiments with in mazes:
Well, those show us that even rats develop

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.020
these cognitive maps, figuring out how to
get around, even if there’s no reward at

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.020
the end.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.020
And days later, when they finally do get food
at the end of the maze, they quickly demonstrate

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.259
all that earlier latent learning by scuttling
through the maze as fast, or faster, than

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.730
rats that had been rewarded all along.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.590
So, learning isn’t just about associating
a response with a consequence.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.270
There’s thinking happening, too.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.220
And this kind of thinking is also a big part
of observational learning, which is basically

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.540
learning by watching other people, or being
influenced by them in other ways.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.080
Because, you don’t need direct experience
to learn.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.810
You can just pick up stuff up through modeling
-- not like modeling on the catwalk, I just

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.810
mean observing and imitating specific behaviors.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
Rats, crows, pigeons, primates, and other
animals learn through imitation.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.580
Chimps learn how to use sticks to fish ants
out of a nest this way.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.349
One study found rhesus macaques were usually
slow to make up after a fight unless they

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.909
grew up watching more forgiving older macaques,
in which case they tended to make up more

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:16.909
quickly.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.820
Of course we humans learn A LOT from modeling
-- I mean, most of our popular culture is

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.229
based on it: new slang, skinny jeans, foodie
trends, pixie cuts -- they’re all racing

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.469
around the globe through observation and imitation.

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.919
So it makes a lot of sense that social observation
shapes behavior, especially in children.

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.509
Which brings us back to Bobo.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.439
Again, the fact that we learn by imitating,
even when we don’t mean to, seems pretty

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.849
intuitive, but until Bandura’s famous experiment,
it hadn’t been studied in a scientific way.

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.639
I mean, these kids started abusing Bobo not
just with little toddler punches, but with

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.880
hostile language and even using things, like
toy guns, that they previously had no interest

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.820
in -- and all because they saw aggressive
modeling in action.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.680
And since Bandura’s time, technology has
allowed us to peer even deeper into this dynamic.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.280
Neuroimaging in humans, for instance, has
shown that when an individual watches someone

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.340
else, especially someone whom they relate
to, receive an award or score a goal or something,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.860
their own brain’s reward systems light up
vicariously.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.590
Italian researchers found this out pretty
much by accident in the early 1990s: They

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.949
were studying signals from key regions in
a lab monkey’s brain that were associated

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.259
with planning and doing.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.810
Their brain-monitoring device buzzed softly
when the monkey did something like pick up

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.469
a piece of fruit and eat it.

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:30.919
But one hot day, a researcher came back from
lunch licking an ice cream cone, and suddenly

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:36.060
heard the animal’s brain monitor buzz -- the
monkey was watching him, and his brain worked

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.539
as if it was actually doing the licking.

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.229
Many scientists suspect that this is the work
of a previously unknown type of brain cell

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:47.210
called mirror neurons, which fire when a subject
both performs an action, and when they observe

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.300
someone else doing it.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.699
Mirror neuron research is still relatively
new, and we’re still figuring them out,

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:55.969
but combined with Bandura’s earlier work,
it’s revealing a strong connection between

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:58.189
observation, imitation, and learning.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.240
So the takeaway here is: Models are important!

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.319
And not just Gisele and Antonio Sabato Junior.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.960
You can, if you want, observe and imitate
them; I’m just saying that observational,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.639
social learning starts really early, and parental
figures are powerful role models.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:18.070
Positive, supportive, and loving models usually
prompt similar behavior in others, just as

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.879
negative, aggressive modeling can spark antisocial
effects.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:25.180
And, as we’ll talk about later, what we
see and feel and learn as children is not

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.320
easily displaced when we’re adults.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.620
Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote,
“Imitation is not just the sincerest form

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.620
of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.”

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.470
And British statesman Lord Chesterfield once
said, “We are, in truth, more than half

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.850
what we are by imitation.”

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.700
Even if these ideas were only half-true, they’d
still be a powerful lesson on who you choose

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.450
to spend your time with, and how you choose
to act.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.470
If you learned anything by watching me today,
hopefully it involved the limitations of classical

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.590
and operant conditioning, the basics of cognitive,
observational, and social learning, a look

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.610
at mirror neurons, and how to beat up a Bobo
doll.
