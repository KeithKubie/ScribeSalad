00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.030
When you buy a ticket to a movie, what you’re
really purchasing is an admission into someone

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.030
else’s mind.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.170
And things don’t always go the way you think
they might.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.840
Wether it’s because of fear, sickness, or
outrage, these are Screen Rant’s 10 Shocking

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.180
Movies That Made People Leave The Theatre.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.380
The Lion King
Lots of kids worldwide have been traumatized

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.930
by at least one Disney movie.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.899
They follow a familiar formula, and someone
always dies.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.579
Usually within the first five minutes, the
protagonist loses a parent in some traumatic

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.579
fashion.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.890
And even though there’s always a happy ending,
it’s never happy enough to take the sting

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.940
out of what you saw earlier.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.210
One of the most tragic events happens in 1994’s
The Lion King.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.650
Apparently the stampede scene was so harrowing,
that groups of youngsters had to be removed

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.760
from the theatre and calmed down in the lobby.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760
We don’t blame them.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.430
In fact, just thinking about it is enough
to bring tears to our eyes.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.400
127 Hours
Based on the true story of an adventure gone

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.040
wrong, 127 Hours gets its name from the amount
of time Aron Ralston spent with his arm pinned

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040
under a boulder.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.360
While exploring solo, Ralston, played by James
Franco, gets trapped in a remote part of the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.409
canyon he was exploring.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.740
Not an easy place to be seen.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.259
The film has a lot of unsettling moments,
and it’s not easy to watch as Ralston begins

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.200
to slowly waste away in front of your eyes.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.829
But the big shock comes when he realizes that
the only thing between him and freedom, is

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.130
the lower half of his arm.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.600
The escape is brutal to both see and hear.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.350
Thankfully, Aron Ralston survived, and his
story serves as an ode to human determination.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.049
The Exorcist
It’s hard to say if more people left showings

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.189
of 1973’s The Exorcist because they were
scared, or because they were offended.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.340
Upon it’s initial release, there were reports
of theatre patrons fainting, and going into

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.340
shock.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.229
Nobody had ever seen anything quite like it
at the time, and some argue that we haven’t

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.710
seen anything like it since.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.969
Audiences were horrified at the thought of
demonic possession, but the fact that it was

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.950
happening to a child was unbelievable.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.069
Some religious groups didn’t approve of
the way the subject matter was handled on

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.680
screen, and launched protests against it.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.200
The filming itself was very forward-thinking,
and Hollywood learned some valuable techniques

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
in the process.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.990
Including how to scare the ever-living crap
out of moviegoers.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.829
The Blair Witch Project
Everyone knows The Blair Witch Project was

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.499
filmed on a shoestring budget.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.849
Having minimal cast and crew was a great way
to cut costs, but at what price?

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.069
The movie has made almost $250 million worldwide,
even though a good portion of the audience

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.950
can’t watch it without getting motion sickness.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.709
During it’s theatrical run, the film made
headlines for a few reasons, but the constant

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
bouts of nausea that plagued some viewers
was chief among them.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430
Despite every indication that The Blair Witch
was clearly going to be a found-footage movie,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.650
some tender-tummied folks tried to brave it
anyway.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.069
But were disappointed when the filming style
proved to be a little too much.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.209
Avatar
Audiences have come to expect a lot from James

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.209
Cameron.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.080
And every movie he makes takes us somewhere
new.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.439
Wether fighting The Terminator, escaping from
a sinking Titanic, or exploring The Abyss,

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.090
the director has a style all his own.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.019
And in 2009, his film Avatar exploded at the
box office.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.469
But not everyone watching enjoyed the journey
to Pandora.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.629
After one man suffered a heart attack around
the same time he saw the movie, some people

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.090
began to speculate that the stunning CGI visuals
of Avatar were to blame.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.790
We’re not cardiologists, so we’re not
entirely sure of the science, but we do agree

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.799
that the environments were pretty spectacular.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.469
Tree Of Life
Most of the time, if you go to see a movie

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.250
and end up not liking it, you’ll probably
forget about it and move on.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.579
And the beauty of film lies in its diversity;
there’s something for everyone.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.590
When 2011’s Tree of Life brought two radically
different groups of people together, and forced

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.870
them all to sit in the same room, things got
ugly.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.459
Writer and director Terrence Malick merged
science and religion in exploring one man’s

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.470
relationship with the idea of faith, and turned
both into one big conversation.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.549
Some audience members were so upset, that
they wanted their money back after seeing

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.549
it.

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.269
This happened so frequently that theaters
across North America started to post disclaimers

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.709
about their refund policy, making sure the
patrons fully understood what they were getting

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.859
themselves into.

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.580
Hostel
Say what you will about it’s content (or

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.799
lack thereof), 2005’s Hostel has some very
convincing special-effects makeup.

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.220
The movie is the twisted brainchild of Hollywood
gore-fan Eli Roth.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.189
A man who loves horror so much, that he even
ran a Goretoreum in Las Vegas.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.390
One of the scariest haunted houses of all
time… until it closed down.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.890
Roth doesn’t hold back when it comes to
his big screen work either, and hired legendary

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.400
special effects makeup designer Greg Nicotero
to take the visuals to the next level.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.310
Audiences had hard time sitting through the
film, and paramedics had to be called on more

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.859
than once to help people who were vomiting,
fainting, or having heart attacks because

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:10.920
of it.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.709
Fantastic Four
Marvel’s characters have found major success

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.019
on the big screen, and had some of the craziest
opening weekends of all time.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.340
But it seems that they’re having a hard
time convincing audiences to care about one

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.240
group: the Fantastic Four.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.720
The 2015 adaptation was ill-fated from the
get go, so a box office flop seems like a

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720
fitting end.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.060
Reshoots after the fact and changes made in
post-production are most commonly cited as

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.970
being the reason for it’s overall failure.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.380
Even the actors are embarrassed of their involvement.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.760
Audiences seemingly went in expecting the
movie to be bad, and were still shocked by

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.760
it.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.980
The studio got the hint, and canceled the
sequel it was planning.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.690
Reservoir Dogs
Okay, so we’ve determined that it’s hard

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.850
to watch a fellow human being lose an appendage.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.170
But for the most part, we assume that people
behind the camera develop a thick skin and

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.730
become desensitized to the blood and guts
of it.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.280
Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to work.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.260
But for horror icon Wes Craven, one scene
in Reservoir Dogs was apparently so disturbing,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.000
he had to leave a screening of it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.390
Fans of the movie will remember a sequence
where Michael Madsen’s character, Mr. Blonde,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.650
slices off a police officer’s ear to the
tune of “Stuck In The Middle With You.”

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.350
You’d think that the man behind some of
the sickest cinema of all time would be able

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.610
to handle a little ear amputation.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.570
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
If you’ve opened your eyes in the last 6

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.940
months, you probably know that Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice is a movie that exists.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.690
Everyone agrees that it’s made millions
of dollars worldwide, but that’s where the

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.700
consensus ends.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.310
While some fans really enjoyed watching Batfleck
flail around in his fancy iron lung, the others

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.880
were outraged -arguing that director Zack
Snyder missed the mark entirely.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.400
It’s nothing new to hear that fans are divided
over an adaptation of a comic book character.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.960
But what is surprising, is how many people
were offended enough to actually leave their

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960
seats.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.620
Feeling like both Batman and Superman were
being portrayed in ways that fundamentally

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.890
contradict their characters, ticket-holders
left in droves.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.350
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.880
Did we miss any shocking movies that made
you leave the theatre?
