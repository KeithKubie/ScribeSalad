00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
It's fan appreciation month at Screen Junkies

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.580
and to reward our awesome fans

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.960
we're making the honest trailers that you voted for.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.080
Here's the honest trailer you voted number one

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080
for some reason.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.080
 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.740
From the studio that brought you the Dreamworks face

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.800
comes the animated feature that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.890
revolutionized kids movies "Better out than

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.260
in I always say" by adding 90 minutes of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.439
non-stop in jokes "Do you know the muffin man?

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.830
The muffin man? The muffin man." Shrek

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.670
Meet Shrek; an ogre who used to sound just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.460
like Chris Farly. "Help! A big,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.760
stupid, stinky, smelly, ugly ogre!." But when Chris

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.010
passed away he transformed into an ogre

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.690
who sounds just like that one voice

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.500
Mike Myers does

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160
"Aargh, help, run" "Shut it!"

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.980
"I got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey." When his gas

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.320
base way of life is threatened, he'll set off on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
a quest with: Donkey, a character who  is sadly

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
more famous and Eddie Murphy these days "I'm making waffles"

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.129
Fiona, a princess struggling with Bi-Ogre Disorder

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.869
and an entire kingdom's worth of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.610
fairy tale characters that Disney had yet to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
snatch up. "Eat me!" Together they'll prove that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.520
nothing can overcome the power of true

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.860
love. Or more specifically the power of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.570
having a dragon murder your enemies.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.520
Wow they really just straight-up killed

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.350
him at the end. Wait, so who's running the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.000
government now? You just started to coup.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.280
Why are you dancing the swamp? Enjoy

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.320
early computer animation that looks just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.240
as good as modern computer animation

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.100
that hasn't finished rendering. For a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.140
story that parodies all the overused Disney tropes,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.020
full of overused Disney tropes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.509
like: The reluctant ugly hero who thinks

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.890
no one can love them,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.409
the no-nonsense princess, the creepy

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.939
horny government official who wants to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.890
be king and the lovable animal

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.750
sidekick. Hey if you can't beat them, join

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.850
them; while at the same time mercilessly

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.540
mocking them? *Donkey and Shrek laughing*

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.760
Settle in for a story with an important

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.670
lesson. Only ugly people can be together.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.380
Wait, that can't be right. True love will

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.730
turn you into monster.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.950
No that's not it either. Stick to your own kind?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
Oo, no. Short people deserve ridicule? "Men of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.950
Farquaad's stature are in short supply"

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.950
Uh, hey look guys are doing the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.340
Macarena! Ha, references! So, come along for

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.840
the blockbuster hit that appealed to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.480
adults and kids alike and won the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.460
first academy award for best animated

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.630
feel all making fun of Disney's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.860
obsession with franchising and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.110
merchandising that spawn one great

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.680
sequel, too bad sequels, a spin off,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.590
a Broadway musical, a ton of unfortunate

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.870
green merchandise, and that Smash Mouth

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.300
song has been stuck in your head since 2001

00:02:40.300 --> 00:03:37.000

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.500
"I'm a delivery boy"

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.400
"swamp thing" what's up with all the shrek memes
