00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.510
A more sort of traditional or
i say fundamental computer vision method

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.110
of doing active sensing is what's
referred to as structured light.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.350
So here's this stereo figure that you
might remember that we used before.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.760
The idea was we had two cameras, right.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.990
And there was some point out here and
that point would project, oops,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.610
missed the line there,
okay that's better.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.130
It would project to this point here,
it would project to that point there.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.160
And because i knew which
two points they were,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.250
i could figure out the triangulation,
alright.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.650
Well, structured light says,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.250
instead of having a camera over here,
I'm going to put a projector.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.640
And what this projector is going to do
is, instead of having a sensor here that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.790
notices where a point is, and remember
we had to go look for the point.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.800
What we're going to do is we're going to
send the things out this way, right.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.600
So we're going to send some particular,
think of just one point for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.830
a minute, right.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.000
And then in this camera over here,
we're going to see where does that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.640
point show up on the image plane, and
then we can do the triangulation.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.060
But instead of doing points,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.800
what we actually do is we
project stripes of some sort.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.770
In fact, sometimes this is
called a light striping, right.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.220
And here it's shown with colors
that makes it real easy.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.380
And the system of course, knows where
each of the colors lies on it's plane.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.180
So then in the right image.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.420
In the right camera, the only camera,
we see a picture that looks like this.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.980
So, what you can see here is like when
these things are bent like this, okay.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.369
As it comes closer to you, right.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.990
So it comes over here,
it moves to the left and so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.710
the line moves to the left there.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.500
In fact, you can see that a little more
clearly in this image here, all right?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.780
So we have a set of hands and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.290
these are the light stripes
that are projected on them.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.960
And actually this is observed
in just the right-hand camera.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.260
And here what you're seeing
is a 3D reconstruction

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.820
of this surface based
upon that light strike.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.170
So basically, by doing this light
striping, by projecting these

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.920
stripes out and then seeing them over
here, i can recover a full 3D model.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.600
All right.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.110
So that's one form of
projecting something out.
