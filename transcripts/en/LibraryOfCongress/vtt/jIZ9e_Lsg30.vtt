00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.690
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: It's a
great honor this afternoon

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.690
to have Laila Lalami here with us,
the author of The Moor's Account,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.390
but more importantly, you
know, she has many other things

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.960
that she does including she's a
nonfiction essayist who writes

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.370
as a critic at large for the Los
Angeles Times and as a columnist

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.940
for The Nation, so she both is
an incredible imaginative writer

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.860
but also engaged with what's
happening in our world now,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.750
so welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.050
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I just want to
say a little bit more about you.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.830
You were born in Rabat, educated in
Morocco, Great Britain and the US.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.920
You have recently received
the Guggenheim Fellowship,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.220
is that right?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.520 position:56%
And you're working on your new book.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.340
But the Moor's Account which was
your last novel not only was it

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.640
listed for the Booker Prize

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.180
but it was a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330
It's been an incredibly
well-received book.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.940
And I wondered if you
could tell us a little bit

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.410
about the history behind the actual
history that inspired this book.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.020
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So, some years
ago, I was just reading a book

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.920
about Moorish Spain and
I came across a mention

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.980
of a man named Estebanico
who was said

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.910
to be the first black
explorer of America.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.160
And I though to myself, "What
do you mean first black explorer

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.460
of American?"

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.760
That it seems like
a fascinating story,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.060
I need to find out more about it.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.090
And it turns out, he was part
of the Narvaez expedition

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.220
and had been written about by
a man named Cabeza de Vaca.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.160
And I had heard about Cabeza de
Vaca of course, but I hadn't heard

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.930
about this fellow Estebanico.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.720
And so, that's really
what drew me in.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.670
I was curious to know
more about him.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.850
And it's really an
absolutely fascinating story.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.550
So the Narvaez expedition left
Spain in the spring of 1527.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.610
And after a number of adventures
eventually landed near what is now

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.940
Tampa Bay in Florida
in the spring of 1528.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.680
And a group of men was sent ashore
to sort of reconnoiter the area,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.010
they had spied an indigenous
village from their ships and so,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.320
they decided to disembark there
and they were sent to the village

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.520
to reconnoiter, and they
found a little nugget of gold.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.330
And then Cabeza de Vaca's
relation of the Narvaez expedition,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.770
that nugget of gold is
described as being small enough

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.950
that it could fit in
a child's rattle.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.490
And so, because of that, Narvaez
gave the order to disembark

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.950
which is this long process that
involved moving the horses ashore,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.240
moving all of the supplies
and the 600 people

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.010
that were part of that expedition.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.630 position:56%
And so they spent a few days in that
indigenous village which by the way

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.850
at this point had been
emptied of its inhabitants

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.620
because the people had
spied the ships in their bay

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.740
and they decided very wisely
to flee the village and wait

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.810
and see what these invaders wanted.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.160
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And
this is Florida, right?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.470
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Mm-hmm.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.600
And so they found a few more
traces of gold and at that point,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.670
Narvaez made a very faithful
decision which is that he decided

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910
to split the expedition into two.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.680
And he decided to send a land
contingent inland to go look

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.790
for more gold and to
send the other half

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.020
of the expedition back home
the ships and to go meet them

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.810 position:56%
at the nearest Spanish port which he
believed was only 20 leagues away,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.940
in fact it was more
than 1000 leagues away

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.700
so there was this big
mistake in navigation.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.020
The navigation was not yet
an exact science at the time.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.700
And so, these men, they all decide
to go inland to look for gold

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.210
and it seems kind of crazy when
we think about it today like,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.510
"Wait, what are you doing?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.140
Why are you all going
to look for gold based

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.430
on these tiny little nuggets?"

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.660
Until you realize that this
is really all tied to the sort

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.400
of personal history of Narvaez
himself who was a contemporary

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.710
and in some sense is a
rival of Hernan Cortes.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.410
Hernan Cortes, the man who
conquered Mexico had departed Cuba

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
without actually securing
any of the proper paperwork

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.580
and so Narvaez was sent in pursuit
of Cortes to try and stop him

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.570 position:56%
and to convey to the Mexican emperor

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.360
that Narvaez was actually
the rightful messenger

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.100
from the king of Spain.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.590
And so, when he actually
landed in Mexico and try

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.160 position:56%
to stop Cortes, Cortes defeated him.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.810
And not only did Narvaez's
men desert him and join Cortes

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.280 position:56%
but Narvaez lost his right eye in
the confrontation and thereafter had

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.480
to wear a black eyepatch.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.760
So imagine what it must
have been like for Narvaez

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.800
to have been the man who was
sort of left out of that big,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.810
big prize that Mexico was and so
then when he landed in Florida,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.810
he was in no mood to wait
or to make these decisions.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.420
So as soon as he found gold, he
decided to send all the men inland

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.980
to look for it and of course
there is no gold in Florida.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.450
And within a year, there are only
four survivors for this expedition.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.570
And the reason that we know
about this expedition at all is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.360
because it was written about some
years later, many, many years later

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.710
by Cabeza de Vaca who was the
treasurer of the expedition.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.510
And it really is the only--

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.680
or the first narrative we
have of Spanish exploration

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.910
of North America, so it's a
very, very valuable document.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.300
And it contains a lot
of ethnological detail

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.940
about some tribes that
are now extinct.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.310
And as I was reading this
document, I was just really,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.940
really struck by all
of the silences in it.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.940 position:56%
So for example, there are no mention

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.490
of any women even though
these men end up--

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.250
the four survivors end up
spending merely a decade among

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.060
indigenous people.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.800 position:56%
And I was struck by that but also by
the fact that even indigenous men,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.560
there's only one of them
that's mentioned by name.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.750
The rest are known only as tribes
as groups, not as individuals.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.420
And even this man who I was
really interested in, Estebanico,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.390
he is named-- he is
mentioned about half a--

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.340
I mean, about a dozen times in
the book, half a dozen by his name

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.860
or the name that the Spaniards
give him which is Estebanico.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.660
And the other half by-- he's just
called the slave or the black man.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.070
And I was just really interested in
sort of that silencing in history

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.810
and how it promoted certain
myths about Spanish exploration

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.990
that it was the province
of white men

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.190
that native peoples
were silent in it.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.270
And that even the people of
color who were involved were sort

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.950
of cast aside even though this
guy played a really important part

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.850 position:56%
in that expedition in the sense
that he learned indigenous languages

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.010
and sort of became a de facto
translator for the others.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.860
And so I was really just
intrigued and I thought

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.840
to myself wouldn't it be
interesting to retell that story

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.360
but from the point of
view of this one member

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.260
of the expedition whose
testimony was never collected.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.510
The other three survivors actually
had their testimonies collected

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.720
in front of an official body.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.150
But because he was a slave,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.050
Estebanico's testimony
was never recorded.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.260 position:56%
And I actually thought that that
perspective was the most interesting

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.520
one because he was neither
a conqueror nor a conquered.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.940
He was sort of an interloper.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.730
He was someone halfway
in between and I thought

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.810
that that particular position made
him interesting to me and I wanted

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.170
to write a book from his
perspective about this--

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.470
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.170
And what you've done is not only
imagine the arrival in America

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.130
but also his entire back story in
Morocco and leaving his family.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.680 position:56%
And you've completely fictionalized
the story of what must have happened

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.530
as he boarded the ships
and why he ended up there

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.850
and the life that he's missing.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.850
So it's kind of an interlace
narrative between both arriving

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.150
and remembering the past.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.450
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.280
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: So it's a fully
sort of fleshed out vantage point.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.580
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.880
Yeah, I mean, I wanted--
I thought, you know,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.450
if I'm going to create
this character, there is--

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.180
he has his own life, his
own agendas if you will,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.980
his own desires, his own ambitions.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.340
The expedition is part
of that and it's--

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.960 position:56%
the expedition is something that he
swept up in but it's not necessarily

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.830
at the center of his life.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.120
So in a way, it's basically
moving the center away

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.990
from what the other book was doing
and then kind of saying, wait, no,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.880
here is the story and
here is one way to look

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.800
at it that's completely different.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.000
And the center of that story is
him, he's the hero, so it's really

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.730
about him and how he grew up
and how he came to be a part

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.020
of this expedition and what
happened to him afterward,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.940
so it's kind of a decent train.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.620
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Well, it's
interesting too because I feel

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.470
like you must have
also thought so much,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.580
you're also a contemporary
columnist and you write a lot

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.950
about what's happening in our
society now but I wondered

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.930
if you also felt that the idea of
returning the sort of vantage point

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.130
and returning the narrative
power to someone

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.680 position:56%
like him was also a political act
in a way because in a sense, I mean,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.520
this book comes at a time
when we're talking a lot

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.780 position:56%
about who tells a story, why they
tell it and what we don't understand

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.880
when we don't hear it
from this perspective.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.180
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.480
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I just wondered
if that was informing you to think

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.610
about writing it now in
2014 or '15 when many

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.910
of us encountered the book.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.210
&gt;&gt;

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.510
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right,
I mean, I think that--

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.160
yes, the story takes place in the
16th century but I was writing it,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.980
I started writing it in 2009 and
it would be foolish of me to claim

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.280
that I wrote it only
with the knowledge

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.310
of what happened in
the 16th century.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.440
As the author, I knew so much
more about the story and so,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.680
even though I am limited in
sort of telling the story

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.860
from that character's perspective,
of course the whole idea

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.810
of telling it from
his perspective is

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.980
in a sense creating an
argument with history.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.170
And I think that-- In general,
I think history is an argument

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.590
so it's basically saying like who
gets to tell the story in what way.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.200
The facts in the book
are exactly the same

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.600
as in Cabeza de Vaca's history
of the Narvaez expedition.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.440
What's different is the story
built around those facts,

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.490
the things that what glues these
facts together is what's different.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.610
And I think that that
holds true today too.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.380
So, whenever we tell these stories,
we're not just talking about facts

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.190
but we're looking at a
perspective on these facts.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.540
So yes, it's absolutely true

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.310
that that was something
in the back of my mind.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.990
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: You kept
a pretty interesting blog

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.730
and you keep it still on your
website and it was interesting

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.680
when you've documented the
story of researching this book.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.450
You went to many of these places
and you photographed yourself there

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.990
and sort of what you were doing
and what you were discovering

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.500
as an explorer almost yourself.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.800
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.100
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Tell me
about the journey of kind

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.860
of not only visiting the City
of Morocco where he comes from

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.650
but then also the places in the
Americas that he have landed

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.290
and explored which probably look
quite different as in Florida.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.590
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.890
I mean, and this is the thing.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.450 position:56%
When I came across the story, I had
the sort of light bulb moment I have

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.980
to write this novel, right?

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.380
And so, it was wonderful,
great, now you know.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.600
But then, there's another thought
that immediately comes trailing

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.350
after that one which is, oh
my God, there's going to be

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.450
so much research involved in
this, I can't do it, right?

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.940
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Special
events, yeah.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.240
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.020
But, you know, the most
difficult part about all

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.320
of this is the first step.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.810
Once you're engaged in the process
then it's just and everyday,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.310
you make a little bit
of work towards--

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.610
&gt;&gt;

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.910
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Were there
doubts at all at that moment

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.040 position:56%
that you could imagine that is a
full flesh, fully fleshed out novel?

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.340
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: All the time.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.640
All the time.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.940
All the time.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.330
I really don't think that there is
any work worth engaging with that

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.630
that doesn't involve doubt.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.060
I think it's actually
quite dangerous if I were

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.890
to approach all of
this with certainty.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.880
The only certainty I had was
that I had to tell the story.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.810
Everything else was
filled with doubt.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.660
So, I obviously, was very fortunate
because I had a primary source

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.420
which is that we have this
document from somebody

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.600
who was part of that expedition.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.280
But I also had a huge amount of
research that was done by academics

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.260
who were interested in the Narvaez
expedition and had drawn maps

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.550
so like I didn't have to go
and figure out what parts

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.910
of the United States
they probably traversed.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.530
I could rely on maps that other
academics had already drawn.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.850
And so, a lot of that was already--

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.020
a lot of that research
had already been done,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.190
all I had to do was read it.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.050
And so, I did read all of that
and then I travel to these places

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.800
to kind of get a sense of
what these places looked

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.560 position:56%
like even though the truth is that
of course a particular place in 15--

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.510
say for example 1532 is
not going to look the same

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.820
as when you visited in 2012.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.130
So of course the City
of Azemmour where he's

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.990
from is completely different
today but I can still gaze

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.920
at the fortress walls
that were built in 1513.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.090
And I can still see what height--

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.380
I can measure my own height against
their height and that gives you--

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.040
that gives me a sense of what it
must have been like to stand there

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.910
in 1520 and to be transported in
one of those ships to go to Spain

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.210
as a slave and all of that.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.170
So it was important to me to
be physically in these spaces,

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:03.140 position:56%
but I think I also had to rely on a
huge number of contemporary sources,

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.350
sources from the 16th century.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.900
And also just basic things like
figuring out the landscape,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.130
I had to look up things
like plants of native--

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.330
I mean, native plant databases.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.120
If you want to write
a scene in Florida,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.610 position:56%
you can't just put an orange tree
even though that's what we all think

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.910
of when we think of Florida

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.590
because there were no oranges
before the Spaniard showed up.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.650
So, you know, it did involve
a huge amount of research.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.710
And oftentimes, that research was
not a research I even knew I had

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.250
to do until I got to that point.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.720
But if I can just tell you--

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.020
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Please, yeah.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.320
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: -- a
particular sort of anecdote,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.530
there were many moments during
the course of doing the research

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.150
into the story where
my jaw would just drop

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.070
because I would discover some
incredible historical detail

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.670
and I would think, oh my
God, I have to include this.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:01.310
But this is where writing fiction
is different from doing nonfiction

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.760
where you-- in fiction,
you have to be so choosy,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.670
you have to really stay within
the perspective of your character,

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.510
what your character knew or could
have known, and it's just sort

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.000
of limit yourself through that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.020
So, it's just really
a lot of choices

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.530
at every step of the process.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.830
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: The
other thing that I think--

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.710
well, one of the reasons I
noticed so many of the details

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.150
of the landscape and all of
the nature that you described

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.310
as they are doing this exploration
is the language that you've used

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.360
in the novel because it
actually does kind of read

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.560
like having discovered a
16th century travelogue.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.860
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.160
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Of course, and
it's almost like parched paper

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.460
and a feeling this is faded.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.410
It's also in the writing, but
yet it also is very contemporary

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.530
and feels very modern,
it has a great sense

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.910
of storytelling energy to it.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.100
So I wondered how you also
calibrate sort of the langue for it

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.400
where it would both sound

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.550
like we really had rediscovered the
Moor's Account and yet also felt

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.690
like a novel that was
written for us.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.990
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.820
So a lot of that had to do with
sort of very deliberate choices

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.640
at the lexical level, so
choosing words that are still

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.150
in common usage today
but whose etymology is

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.220
at least dates back
to the 16th Century.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.520
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Some
examples of that would be?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So for example, an
example might be I can say commence,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.180
right, that's something
that most people still use

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.900
or I could say start, right?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.070
That's something that we use
today but in the 16th century,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.410 position:56%
you probably would go with commence.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.190
Or, what I could not do,
I'll give you an example

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.400
of something I cannot do, is if I
say a troupe of musicians, well,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.580 position:56%
troupe with the T-R-O-U-P-E was
something that would have been later

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.360
and so I couldn't-- it would not
have been used in the 16th century,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.390
or at least in that
decade of the 16th century.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:48.250
So I know it sounds like,
"Wait, that's a lot of work."

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.890
But it's not in one step.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.490 position:56%
So you're writing a draft and you're
kind of trying to find this voice

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:59.040
and I was very much
inspired by several--

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.870
in terms of the voice
by several documents.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:07.510
One travelogue is from the
16thcentury by Arab writers

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.520
for example, Ibn Battuta who
journeyed all the way from Tangier

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.600
which is his hometown all
the way to Asia and back

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.120
and among many, many other places.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.610
And so, I kind of knew what a man

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.990
of that generation
might have sounded like,

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.450
and the kinds of things that might
have shocked or surprised him.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:29.710 position:56%
The "One Thousand and One Nights"
is a huge influence because I wanted

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.040
to have this-- the sense

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.450
of all these multiple stories
as opposed to chapters.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.140
And also in terms of the style or
the sort of book hence to the book,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.090
it begins like any other book of
the era with the Basmala which is

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.400
in the name of God, Most
Compassionate, Most Merciful,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.810
that's how every manuscript began.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.900
And so, that's what I
used as well and used

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.550
that in creating the
style of the book.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.200
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And for a novel
that, you know, again is a finalist

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.410
for the Pulitzer Prize, this is a
considered a great Moroccan novel

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.710
for the last few years.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.920
I mean, you have put a character
of Muslim background in the sort

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.090
of center of your book, it is of
Muslim's subjectivity in the sense

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.450
that he is, you know, returning
in memory back to the faith

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.750
that he had to leave behind.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.330
He still, while he's on this sort
of very Catholic Spanish mission

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.860
of exploration of conversion,
he's still remembering

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.610
that as a a part of who he was.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.180
In your nonfiction work, you
do write a lot about the idea

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.340
of Muslim identity and you
had a recent long piece

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.750 position:56%
in The New York Times magazine about
being a Muslim and the gray zone

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.210
and what that means
in our current times.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.450
Tell me a little bit about
that as a part of your project

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.480
of you ever created project
and whether that was something

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.820
that you don't, maybe, like
talking about or you're just

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.120
like the subtlety living in,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.260
or do you feel it was actually a
very powerful element in this book

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.000
that you wanted to build on.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.750
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I mean,
it's an interesting question.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.240
I think that question came
up a lot because of the fact

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.050
that as the book came out,
obviously the character is Muslim.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.120
And there's this whole sort
of a conversation right now

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.300
around the fact that Muslims
are sort of in America anyway

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.070
that they're sort of
outsiders, right?

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:15.880 position:56%
So, that's how you can get away with
saying a Muslim ban and all of that.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.930
And, of course, the reality
is that Islam has been a part

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.890
of the American history since
before there was a United States.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.010 position:56%
I mean, this guy was around in 1528.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.760
And so, the idea that
Muslims are somehow foreign

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.520
to this country is
really one that the book

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.200
in some sense addressing
even though I never intended

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.610 position:56%
to address it when I wrote the book.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.960
The only reason I wrote the book
was because it was a good story

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.140
and I thought, wow, it's such a
great story, it's got adventure,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.740
it's got transformation because you
have somebody who comes and he sort

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740
of an interloper, he's not
a conqueror or a conquered.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.800
And he has to kind of
completely reinvent himself

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.660
in order to survive in America.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.930
They, basically all these four
survivors transform themselves,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.770
into faith healers and I
was interested in that,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:12.140
how identities sort of not
conditioned but influenced

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.700 position:56%
by your landscape and where you are.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.810 position:56%
And I was really interested in that.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.840
And it's a story of
survival so it's just--

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.540
it was a good story that was
why I wanted to write it.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.610
But, of course, as
result of writing it,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.680
this question of politics
comes about,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.000
this question of Muslim
representation comes about,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.040
this question was, well,
you must have had an agenda

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.190
of putting the Muslim in the
16th century to prove this thing.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.300
And it's like, well, no,
I mean, if it proves it,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.830
that was a byproduct to what I did.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.130
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.730
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: It was not
necessarily an intent of the book.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.240
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: But you
do have to have an agenda

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.750
when you write nonfiction
columns and essays, right?

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.050
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.460
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And I wonder for
you how does that toggling work,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.240
how do you-- Do you take off and
sort of certain had them and have

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.520
to decide that now, I'm
going to take a much more--

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.180
yeah, a much more, a
stronger position on something

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.170
and make an argument for something,

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.040
and have your novels essentially
remain open for interpretation?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.340
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I mean, yeah.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.740 position:56%
I mean in that sense for me, fiction
is primarily driven by the urge

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.400
to tell a good story and by sort
of being completely hands off.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.490
And if I've done my job right then
you won't know what I'm trying

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.870
like you won't know who I'm siding
within a particular story, right,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.640 position:56%
because I'm interested in delivering
as complex of the story as possible.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.610
In the kind of nonfiction
that I write

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.380
and I'm not saying this is true
of all nonfiction but in kind

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.260 position:56%
of like the kind of nonfiction that
I write which involves a lot of sort

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.920
of cultural criticism and
commentary, there, of course,

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.640
is more of a sense of me trying to
make sense of the world around us

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.920
and sort of telling you
what it is that I think

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.220
about and how I feel with.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.050
So, in that sense, it's very
different like my agenda

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.780
if I have one is apparent and it--

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.080
because the columns

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.650
or the commentaries are
already telling you what it is

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.360
that I'm trying to say which
isn't the same thing with fiction.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.290
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And you tweet
a lot which is really kind

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.590
of fun to follow as well.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.460 position:56%
And you keep a pretty active profile
in social media and yet, you have--

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.160
you're a novelist and I also
wondered for you, how do you feel

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.430
about shutting out all of that
social media noise when you need

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.620
to write, because you're seemed
to participate in it as well so--

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.920
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I know.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.220
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: -- some
writers can detect this kind of--

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.520
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I know.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.820
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: --
I've said it all of

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.120
and I had to work on my book and--

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.200
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Well, I wake up
in the morning, I drink a big pot

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.140
of coffee and I shut off the
world and I just go off in my room

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.550
and I just write my novel,
wouldn't that be lovely?

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.850
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Isn't
that what you do?

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.800
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I would love
to do that, unfortunately,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.920
I feel like it's a luxury.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.180
It's a luxury I don't have.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.550
I mean, I feel just so
interested in the world

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.740
around me, so engaged in it.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.720
I'm trying to understand it and
I find that the process of sort

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.460
of being in conversation
with it helps me think

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.650
through all a lot of these issues.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.810
Having said that, I do find that
one when the time comes to work,

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.680
when the time comes to write
then I have to shut it off.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.770
So, usually, I spend a couple
of hours in the morning sort

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.310
of reading the news,
like doing email,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.520
all of that social
media, all of that stuff.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.630
And then after that, I have
this program called Freedom

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.520
which I'll highly recommend.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.800
So, it blocks the internet on
your computer and you can tell it,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.960
if you want it to block it for
eight hours everyday 9 to 5,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.260
whatever, you can program it.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.930
So, I program it and that's
how all of my work gets done.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.700
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Well, you wrote
a really funny piece just kind

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.970
of describing how much you
struggle with procrastination--

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.270
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I do.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.570
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: -- and at first,
you felt super guilty for it

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.310
but now, you've embraced
it as part of your process.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.610
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: It's just this.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.930
I prefer to think of
it as my process

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.230
so I don't have to feel guilty--

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.530
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: So, it's not--

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.360
[ Inaudible Remark and Laughter ]

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.660
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.960
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And
you teach writing as well

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.460
so can you talk a little bit
about working with students

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.050
on their creative writing at
University of California Riverside.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.350
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Riverside.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.650
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Riverside,
right, exactly.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.950
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.250
I do-- I teach creative writing.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.550
I mean, I enjoy teaching.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:03.460
I find that as one character
and I think it was Disgrace

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.020
by J.M. Coetzee who puts it,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.300
"He who comes to teach learns
the keenest of lessons."

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.600
So, I find that just the process
of teaching helps me kind of sort

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.060
out how I think through
pieces of fiction

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.480
or nonfiction because I teach both.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.540 position:56%
And I just-- I try to help my
students reach their full potential.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.270
Not every student who takes a
creative writing class is going

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.430
to end up becoming a novelists
or a nonfiction writer,

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.390
but every student is going to
want to learn how to tell a story.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.690
It's an extremely important skill.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.460
I always tell them, look who is
the president of this country,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.630
it's a pretty good story teller.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.440
So, you need to learn how to tell
a story if you-- I mean, I just--

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.590
it's just an important-- I just
think it's an important skill.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:57.490
So, I-- yeah, I-- we read where I
teach them to read like writers.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.960
We discuss.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.950
They bring in their work and
they-- we workshop it so it's fun.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.130
I get to-- I get paid to
hang out with smart kids

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.410
for several hours a day so--

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.290
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: And I think
with the new generation of writers

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.590
that we now have emerging to--

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.980
there's an interesting
conversation I'd love

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.790
to hear what you think about,
which is also tied to the politics

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.730
of representation in your
book, who tells the story,

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.880
why do they tell it, and who
have we not heard in the past.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.920
I feel like we're having a lot of
conversations around this issue

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.330
in the last couple of years
and even now especially.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.630
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.930
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: What do you think

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.790
about these conversations
especially part of it is policing,

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.370
somebody shouldn't write
somebody else's story.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.220
You've put yourself fully
in the mind and body of man

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.660
from the 16th century who's
exploring America, you know, you--

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.490
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So, what do you
think my answers to that will be?

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.790
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.090
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right?

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.390
It's like, of course.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:50.690
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: We we're
having this debate, right?

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.990
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Right.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.290
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: That the
writers who have not been able

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.590
to tell their story, it's--

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.890
they're they only ones
that can tell that story.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.190
I'm just curious about--

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.100
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Listen, I mean,
my view about this whole thing is

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:04.680
that whoever wants to tell a
story should absolutely feel free

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.980
to tell it.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:12.860
You want to write about a 16th
century Swedish nun who goes

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:20.160 position:56%
to China looking for silk, I don't
know, go ahead, by all means, do it.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.910
The only question is,
how are you doing it?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:30.450
If your method of doing it
involves something no more complex

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.690
than putting on a sombrero
and claiming

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.630
that you've created a
Mexican character then,

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.430
that's just not good enough.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.450
And believe me, people
will tell you if they feel

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:46.290
that your work is delivering
caricatures and not characters.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.420
And I think that the idea that
if somebody is telling you, wait,

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.340 position:56%
I think that this is more caricature

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.500
than character is somehow
stopping you from writing

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.490
about that particular perspective,
that's just very misguided.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.650 position:56%
The whole point of freedom of speech
is that you get to say something

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.950
and the other person
gets to say something.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.530
And so, therefore, yes,
everyone has the right

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.870
to tell whatever story they want
but then they have to be prepared

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.540
to hear whatever feedback
they're going to get

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.110
about that particular story.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.410
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Did you have to--

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.070
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So, I
don't so much think about it

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.000
as somebody owning a
story, I think about it

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.140
as like how good is the story
that this person is delivering.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.860
And the other aspect of
that is just because you--

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:35.000
and you have a particular ethnicity
or race or gender in common

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.570
with this character that you're
creating is by no means a guarantee

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.090
that what you're delivering is a
character and not a caricature.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.720
It goes both ways, you see.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.490
The proof is in the book
that you've delivered.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.600
If the book that you've delivered
contains some sort of new way

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.640
of looking at the world,
new characters,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.720
something really interesting
and rich and complex

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.340
that people find fulfillment

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.940
in then that's a successful,
you know, story.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:07.430
But if you are delivering something
that's a cliche, you know, then,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.190
of course, people are not
going to be pleased with it

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.270
and they're going to tell you so.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.570
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I should
have mentioned this by the way

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.870
but after this last question,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.490
we're going to open this
up to questions to you.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:20.760 position:56%
I wanted to just ask you about being
in the international stage, I mean,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.220
you're not only American
writer but you're also--

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.520
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.820
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: -- you
know, Moroccan-American--

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.120
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I know.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.420
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: -- and
hyphenated and all kinds of things

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.720
and you write in French and you--

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.020 position:56%
so tell us about the notion of being
an international American writer.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.960
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: I know, isn't
that-- I confuse a lot of people.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.260
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.560
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So, I was born
in Morocco but I've lived now half

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.580
of my life in the United States
and I'm American citizen.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.740
And yet, every time I do these
big festivals, I get put on--

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.150
No, no, I'm serious, I
get put on these panels,

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.380
they're all about writing
the other, you know,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.480
or something like something
to indicate

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.030
that I'm not really
in the, you know--

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.330
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yeah.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.130
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: -- sort
of middle of the road.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:09.940
And I remember when The Man
Booker Prize's long list came out

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.210
and The New York Time said, five
American writers are on the list.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.810
And that was the first
time that in print,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.350
somebody had called
me an American writer

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.710
without saying a hyphen
of some sort.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.010
That was the first time.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.290
And the only time that it happened
was because it was British Prize

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.160
so it was necessary to distinguish
the Americans and to say,

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.510
those are our guys that
are dominating that list.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.980
So, I though it was really amusing.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:40.190
So, yeah., so, I don't
have a huge problem with it

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.920
as long as it is not limiting.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.280
I think the problem in sort

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.480
of calling people a particular this
hyphen, not is that it can tend

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.940
to say that these writers are
different from these other writers.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.170
So, here I am, you know, I
just told you this and now,

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.710
I'm on the international stage.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.310
So, now, I'm apparently an
international Moroccan-American--

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.610
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Right.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.910
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: -- something.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.210
She's different.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.510
[ Laughter ]

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.810
And I think that's what
it's meant to suggest.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.370
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: I don't think
this is the et cetera stage--

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:09.670
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.970
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: --
but it's not exactly.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.240 position:56%
We want to open this up to questions
so please, come to the microphones

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.490
that we have here or we have
to pass them around as well or?

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.140
Sorry, OK.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.620
You have to stand in the aisle,
there's a microphone there, sorry.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.920
&gt;&gt; You ready?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.220
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Yes.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.520
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Hm-mmm.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.820
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.670
And thank you for taking us on this
wonderful journey with Mustafa.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.680
My question deals with the
resolution at the end of the book.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.690
And the reason why I'm asking that
is that there is much richness

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:46.800
as you go on this journey and
you introduced so many people

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.770
that I literally got up to the last
maybe within 10 pages of the book.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.450
And I begin to wonder, how
is this book can be resolved?

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.880
Because I almost begin to
speculate is there a sequel

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.360
because there's much detail.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.090
And when you then get to
the end, you realized--

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.390
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Which
we're not going to reveal.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.790
&gt;&gt; We're not going to
say anything about it.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.350
It's more question of process.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.650
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Let's
cover our ears.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.960
&gt;&gt; But it's a question of process.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.260
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yes.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.310
&gt;&gt; Did the book lead you to
this resolution that happens

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.420
within this very brief
period of time at the end?

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.570
Or did you actually have something
structured in your mind in terms

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.560
of how you would bring
it to conclusion?

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.990
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Remember that
this is based on history so I kind

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.910
of knew where everything
was going to end.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.540
And I knew from the beginning how I
wanted it to end, which believe me,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.540
was a relief compared
with other books.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.650 position:56%
I knew how I wanted this one to end.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:45.390
And so the answer is yes, I did
know where I was going with that.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.060
Part of the reason you
might feel this way is

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.230
that it was very much a conscious
choice for me to keep the focus

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.940
on Mustafa and on what
happen to him.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.500
The other characters in some sense
are not at the center of that story

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.460
and we find out through Cabeza
de Vaca what happened to them.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:07.130 position:56%
So, I wasn't so curious about what
happened to them after they all meet

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:12.190
and so, it was-- he was
my focus at all times.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.490
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you for coming.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.480
I have not yet read your book

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.340
but I had a question
from the introduction.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.080
You said that the character
had learned native languages

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.380
and served as a translator.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.610
Did you address that
in the book as to how

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.760
that would happen and
then what detail?

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.670
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: So, one of
the things that was fantastic

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:39.970 position:56%
about this character is that-- so,
I mentioned that he is from the city

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.160
of Azemmour which is
about 60 miles south

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.920 position:56%
of Casablanca on the Atlantic Coast.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.060
And what's interesting about
that city is that it's sort

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:54.640
of the indigenous people speak
a language called Tamazight.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.910
And we also know that from
Cabeza de Vaca's relation

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.840
that this man spoke Arabic.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.810
So, he speaks Tamazight, he
speaks Arabic, he's the slave

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:08.830
of a Spanish master which
means he spoke Spanish.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.350
And Azemmour was a Portuguese
trading post which means

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.900
that Portuguese was sort
of the language of trade.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.710
And it was Portuguese slavers that
ended up selling him into slavery.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.980
So, he probably spoke his
books smattering of Portuguese.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.530
So, before he landed in Florida,
he was already a multilingual,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.910
multicultural character having
also lived in Spain briefly.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.570
And so in a sense, it kind of
made sense that he was the one

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:36.190
that picked up on some of
these indigenous languages.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.080
When I say that he spoke
them, I'm basing this

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.760
on what Cabeza de Vaca has
told us also about him.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.010
And being able to communicate
in a language doesn't mean

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:49.890
that you need a vocabulary
of 50,000 words.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.060
You can carry on a conversation
in English with about 800 words.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.310
That's about how much you need to
carry on a regular conversation.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:03.110
So, because he lived
with different tribes

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.590
and spent a significant
amount of time in it--

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.730
with each of these tribes, he was
able to communicate with them.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:13.710
And Cabeza de Vaca tells us
that part of the reason why they

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.300
like having Mustafa be the
translator is they felt

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:23.910
that it gave them more authority
to have somebody be a go-between

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.190
like somebody that the
indigenous people had to come

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.940
through before they got to them.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.660
But to me, that's the
opposite, it's upside down.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.000
Of course, the translator is
the person with the most power

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.560
because the translator actually
knows what each side is saying

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.860
to the other.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.070
So, it really was interesting to
me that Cabeza de Vaca dressed it

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.120
as sort of motive authority
whereas for me,

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.940
it seemed like he was the
one with the authority so.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.920
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: You're welcome.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.110
&gt;&gt; I read The Moor's
Account about a decade

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.600
after reading Cavesa de Vaca's

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.930
and really enjoyed how
much it followed things

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:05.190
like the near starvation, the
constant charity squash diet.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.690
I should talk about your research.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:11.660
How much were you able to find
in 16th century documents,

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.270
even court documents or
records of bills of sale

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.870
about how Mustafa would
have come to be--

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: In that expedition.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.330
&gt;&gt; -- of that expedition
departing from Spain.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.720
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Well, I wish
that there had been a bill of sale

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.440
because then, we would
have been able to at least

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.940
to have a precise description
or age.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.040
So, I had to do, in fact with his
character, a lot of deduction.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.820
So, we know that he lands
in Spain in the 1527.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:48.160
And I figure that no person who
is seriously engaged in conquest

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.830
and exploration is going to
bring a slave that's 75 years old

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.130
to wait on them.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.360
So, obviously, it's a
young person's game.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.800
So, I-- And even the durantes,
his owner was also in his 30s

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.200
so I figured, he had
to be about that age.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.880
And so then, once I started going
back and thinking what was going

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.650
on in that city around that time
and suddenly, all these sort

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.790
of historical events
sort of fell into place.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.770
There was the arrival
of the Portuguese,

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.560
the building of the
fortress walls in the 1513.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:26.120
Then there was-- In 1520, there
was this huge drought which meant

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.950
that by then, there
was a huge abundance--

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.950
I don't know if that's
the right word--

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.670
availability of slaves because
of the drought and the famine

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.440
as a consequence of that drought.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.760
In addition to which, there
was also an earthquake in Fez

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.200
which destroyed the City of Fez

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.520
and so there were refugees
that came from Fez.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.700 position:56%
And so, it's just like there was all
these turmoil going on in Morocco

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.120
that would have created
the conditions

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.470
for this particular person to
be enslaved and end up on one

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:59.060
of these Portuguese ships.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.700
So, my research was mostly about
sort of Portuguese enslavement

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.370
of Moroccans during those decades
and what happened to the slaves.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.240
And it was really incredible some
of the things that I discovered.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.390
So for example, one year
because of the drought,

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:19.710
as many as 60,000 Moroccan women
were sold into slavery and brought

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.590
to Portugal to serve as slaves
and concubines to the Portuguese.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:29.650
And so, it was just this really
like when you look at this

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.750
from the perspective
of 500 years later,

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.580
you see all these forces
working together that combined

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.600
to have created sort of this
critical mass for this expedition

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.260
for this man to be at
the place where he was.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.560
Yeah.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.860
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Some
question here.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes. Early on and you've talked--

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.320
you mentioned large
silence is in the journal,

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.970
I think you mentioned
women is one example.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.320
I just thought you might

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.250
like to elaborate a little
more what the silences were--

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.550
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Of course.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.850
&gt;&gt; -- and the significance.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.150
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Of course.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.900
So, the book tells us
about the Narvaez--

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.000
Cabeza de Vaca's book tells us
about the Narvaez expedition

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.090
and what happened to the
survivors over the course

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.950
of the better part of a decade.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.140
And yet, not a single woman is
mentioned nowhere in the book.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.160
And I thought, wait, that
makes absolutely no sense,

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.950
these people interacted

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.910
with indigenous people
including women especially

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:32.080
if they lived among them as
faith healers and all of that.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.970
And so, once I start
thinking through this,

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:39.940
I realized that Cabeza de
Vaca's relation was published

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.930
in Spain in 1542.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:47.400
And this was still when the
inquisition was going on.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.480
And Cabeza de Vaca was a married
man who had left behind his wife

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.310
in Spain to wait for him.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.010
And so that gives you an idea
of why the women are just left

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.360
out of the story because when, of
course, you bring in the women,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.770
it will bring in questions.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.750
So, he basically left the women
completely out of the story.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.270
And so, that's why that
was something I wanted

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.100
to play with in my novel.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.910
I thought my guy is not
under the inquisition

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:16.460
so he can talk about the women.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:22.400
And so, that's why I endeavored in
every stage of his life to have--

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.110
so his mother plays a big role
in the book because she's the one

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.810
that basically teaches
him to be a storyteller.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.330
And then when he is in Spain,
he develops a sort of friendship

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.840
with another slave who was a woman.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.060
And then one state,
he arrives in America,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.900
there's also other indigenous women
that get mentioned than named.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:48.020
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is about your
writing, your choice of language

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.930
to write and I know that you
grow up in Morocco as you said

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:57.320
where you learned Arabic and
French then subsequently English.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.810
And I'm just wondering,
do you do any writing

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.870
in Arabic and French now?

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.810
And if not, why did
you choose English

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.870 position:56%
as a language to write your fiction?

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.170
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Sure.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:16.060
So, yes, as you said, I'm
a native speaker of Arabic.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:21.490
And I learned French and standard
Arabic at the same time at school.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.190
And I learned the English
in high school.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:28.140
I started learning English when
I was 15 and so it's kind of odd

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.130
that I'm writing, right,
in my third language.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.720
So this is a question that
I get asked all the time.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:40.080
And I think the answer is a
combination of it's just based

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.920
on like the way in which my life
has the turns that it's taken.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.270
So, I remember, I was writing
in French when I was little.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.930
I started writing when I
was about nine years old.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.850
And that may seem a little
surprising until you realize

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.460
that a huge portion of
Moroccan literature is in French

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.770
because of the sort of
colonial history behind that.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:06.160 position:56%
Also because, I was sent to a French
school and so my earliest exposure

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.870
to literature was not in my native
language but in the language of--

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.740
in sort of the colonial language.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:18.220
So, when we talk about who has
a right to tell a story, when--

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.930
imagine being a child and your--

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.690
the earliest books that you
see are things like "Tintin,"

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.830
right, or "Asterix," right?

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.260
And so, it creates a disconnect
in the mind of the child

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.160 position:56%
in which the only people who inhabit
this fictional world are people

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.630
who are different than you.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.010
They are not people with
whom you have any kind

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:45.160
of a cultural commonness
or linguistic commonness

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.000
or racial commonness or any kinds
of commonness, they're foreigners,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.300
right, and that is what I saw.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.580
So, in the world of the
imagination of the writer,

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.930
that was what was happening to me.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.260
And so, when I started writing,
I started writing in French

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.150
and these are not things that
you realize when you're 9 or 10.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.550
You're just wanting to write
about, you know, I don't know,

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.060
adventure stories or whatever

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.950
but you're not really thinking
about what's happening.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.900
So, it wasn't until I was a
student in London some years later

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.300
that I started to think back
about all of these and to sort

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.240
of question the choice
of writing in French.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.640
And by then, of course, as
I mentioned, I was not--

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.670
I hadn't been sent
to an Arabic school.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:28.650
So, my literary Arabic
was not great.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.990
I could read it just fine, I just--

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.070
composing in it did
not feel comfortable.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.980
It did not feel-- I did
not feel fluent in it.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.690
At the same time, I was also doing
a graduate degree in linguistics

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.280
and I will have to write all of
these research papers in English

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.020
so I have to do it anyway.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.600
And so because of that, I thought,
well, I could try writing my hand--

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.560 position:56%
throw my hand at writing in English.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.230
And so now here we
are 20 years later so.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.830
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi: Unfortunately,
less than a minute left

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.130
but if you want to ask
your brief question--

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.730
&gt;&gt; Bilal Qureshi:--
we'll be able take it.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.030
Yeah.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.330
&gt;&gt; I just want to say, our--

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.630
my book club actually read
your book this month and so,

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.930
it's such a pleasure to
get to hear you today.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:10.230
I'm wondering if you could
spend just a minute talking

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.490 position:56%
about the indigenous groups that are
featured in the book and what kind

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:15.290
of research you are able to find
on those groups in the Americas

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.370 position:56%
at that time, and how that
influenced your decisions around who

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.770 position:56%
to feature and how to describe them.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:22.070
&gt;&gt; Laila Lalami: Yeah.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.610
And it's really-- Believe me
that that was of the things

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:28.300
that gave me pause about writing
this book is how do you even begin

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.490
to write about indigenous
people, right?

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.600
The first challenge is
that a couple of the tribes

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.600
that Cabeza de Vaca
mentions are now extinct,

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.660
which means that the only details
we have, the only details we have

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.920
about what they looked like and
where they found their livelihoods

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.170
and their ways of life come
to us from this outsider

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.430
who maybe understood certain things

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.500
but maybe also misunderstood
a lot of things.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.980
And that is all we
have about this tribe.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.040
So, those are the ones that
we're on Galveston Island.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.890
So, it was just very difficult.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.750
For those particular tribes,
I had no choice but to rely

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.020 position:56%
on what he told us and I tried to be
as conservative as possible in terms

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.870
of how much of his-- the
details he gave us to use.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:21.250
With other tribes, I was a little
bit more fortunate for example,

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:26.300
the ones in Florida had
survived until today so I had,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.320
you know, materials about them.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:35.390
And then, the other ones that were
in Texas, many of them are extinct

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:39.990
but I managed to find some sources.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:45.880
And also, in one particular case
I managed to find like a glossary

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:52.120
that the last known speaker of
that language had left behind.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:58.030
So, she-- one of the friars in that
particular mission had sat her down

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.580
and made her say what is
this word, what is that word

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.660
and written down what she had said.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.630
So I had sense of what
the language sounded like.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.410
Now, in terms of actually
writing the book, you have to--

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:13.630
I did not want to write a guy
who was a 21st century guy

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:18.400
who says all the right things
about sort of the outsider.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.390
And so, when he lands, he
very much views himself

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.160
as a person of the Old World.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.800
Even though he is Muslim and
the conquerors are Christians,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.390
what they have in common is
that they both come from sort

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:33.600
of the same neighborhood
if you will.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.660
And so for them, these
indigenous people are different.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:42.070
And so when he arrives, his
descriptions are very superficial.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.270
They have to do with what the
Indians look like and, you know,

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.380
where they fish and
things like that.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.900
It's only as he lives with
them longer that he's--

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.890
that suddenly we're getting names,

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.630
suddenly we're getting
a little bit more

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.200 position:56%
of life stories about these Indians.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.130
And so, the thing that was great
about doing it this way is that I

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.580
in fact had a lot of materials
about the later tribes

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.000
than I did about the earlier ones.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.300
So, it worked out that way.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.240
But, yes, I did, of course, do
