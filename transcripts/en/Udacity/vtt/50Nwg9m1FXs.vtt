00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.740
There are four kinds of query standards,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.730
each of which specifies a different
key element of distributed query.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.270
Envelope standards define the package
for sending and receiving the queries.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.300
Format standards provide a declarative
specification of the query.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.130
We'll explain what that
means in the next exercise.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.500
Results standards such as QRDA
we discussed in the last lesson

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.910
specified the format and
packaging of query results.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.570
Data model standards such as CEDD,
Common Data Element Definitions

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.580
specified the data model that will link
data from the contributing systems.
