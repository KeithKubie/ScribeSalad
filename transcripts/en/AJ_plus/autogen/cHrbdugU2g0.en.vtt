we'll be making our own custom gun but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
we'll be making our own custom gun but
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.140
we'll be making our own custom gun but
for right now we're just modifying

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
for right now we're just modifying
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420

normal firearms and basically the way

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
normal firearms and basically the way
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010
normal firearms and basically the way
this works is this little thing inset

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
this works is this little thing inset
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.950
this works is this little thing inset
into the grip here I've actually got one

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960
into the grip here I've actually got one
 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550
into the grip here I've actually got one
is a fingerprint sensor so that's the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
is a fingerprint sensor so that's the
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410
is a fingerprint sensor so that's the
same thing that's right there just here

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
same thing that's right there just here
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530
same thing that's right there just here
and this fingerprint sensor basically

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and this fingerprint sensor basically
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.870
and this fingerprint sensor basically
goes under your middle finger when you

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
goes under your middle finger when you
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.550
goes under your middle finger when you
pick up a firearm so your hand sort of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
pick up a firearm so your hand sort of
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.010
pick up a firearm so your hand sort of
would curl around it like this and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020
would curl around it like this and
 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.969
would curl around it like this and
naturally that middle finger would land

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
naturally that middle finger would land
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190
naturally that middle finger would land
right on the sensor here so in a sense

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
right on the sensor here so in a sense
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899
right on the sensor here so in a sense

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
tick the safety off him
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.159
tick the safety off him
and went to go fire nothing nothing yep

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169
and went to go fire nothing nothing yep
 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.500
and went to go fire nothing nothing yep
I'll put the safety on just we're

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510
I'll put the safety on just we're
