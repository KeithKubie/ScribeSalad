00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History, and today we're going to talk about civilization.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.013
Oh, Mr. Green, Mr. Green I have that video game. I like to play as the Assyrians!

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah, Me From The Past. It was a video game. In fact, it still is a video game; they've continued to update it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But, you know, like actual civilization, its best days are probably behind it.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.340
So those of you who watched our first series will remember that civilization is

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.000
a complicated and controversial concept. Like to describe an individual or a group as civilized

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.380
is to give them a privileged status that they maybe haven't earned while to call someone uncivilized

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.560
is an insult, right? And according to the usual mythology about civilizations, there are these

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.840
uncivilized barbarians often from the hills or the forest or the steppe and they realize the benefits

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.080
of settled agriculture and give up their barbaric ways to settle in the valleys, eventually assimilating

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.320
into civilized society. That's a really neatly packaged story, right? People all around the world come to the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.140
same realization and they all make progress and become civilized, but what if it's not actually true?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.600
So today a little something for the anarchist historians among you. We're going to look at

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.020
The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia by James Scott.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.120
Scott argues that our view of hill people as primitive, tribal barbarians has it all wrong,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.600
and he calls into question much of what we assume about civilization.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.280
So as you know, here at Crash Course History we like to approach history from many different perspectives

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.080
because history isn't just about what happened, it's also about how we think about what happened.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.700
So here you go anarchists, we are finally going to address your burning suspicion that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.840
civilization does not actually require a state. So long time Crash Course viewers will remember that many of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.240
the early civilizations were founded in river valleys, probably because the rivers brought water and made

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.300
agriculture easier and more predictable. You know, you got the big 3: ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.280
and the Indus Valley civilization- all near river valleys.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.540
In fact, one of them is named after the Indus River, and because the land was so fertile for agriculture,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.120
you could finally have large, concentrated populations because there was a food surplus.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.580
Everything that we associate with civilization -- from the idea that different people can have different jobs

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.540
to this video camera -- all a result of food surplus. Because if some people couldn't create enough food for

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.720
all people, then, like, all people would be very focused on getting food. Having a food surplus was a huge change

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.360
compared to like the first 100,000 years of humanity when everyone was a hunter-gatherer. Food surplus led to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.100
population growth and population concentration which led to states and what we tend to call civilizations

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.480
which are characterized by good things like writing and arts and grocery stores, so that's the traditional narrative,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.560
but I'm not sure that it's the whole story. Let's go the Thought Bubble.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.800
Now we might equate civilization with high culture, but historically it's probably more accurate to equate it

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.980
with state control. The Han Chinese who were a pretty successful civilizing empire back in the day, wrote of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.360
barbarians as people who were beyond state control. Some of these so-called barbarians were

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.880
pastoral nomads whose raiding posed a genuine threat to the Chinese, but others were people who lived

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.400
in the hills. So the opposition of civilized agricultural societies living in the valleys and barbarian hill people is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.700
as old as, you know, like, the hills. And one of the earliest and most famous examples of the town vs. country debate is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.900
the Epic of Gilgamesh where Enkidu, the wild man from the hills, goes to town, spends seven days with

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.620
a prostitute, joins civilization and becomes Gilgamesh's best friend.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.860
In Southeast Asia, the story that hill people were dazzled by civilization and joined up circulated as well.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.420
Here, though, the civilizing force was the reading of religious or philosophical texts. But more important

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.500
than either access to Classical age texts, or civilizing experiences in the city, was that civilizations were

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.660
based on settled agriculture and were associated with states. In a way, it can be argued that without a state,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.740
there's no such thing as a barbarian. But because we live in states, we tend to think that they are A) Necessary

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.100
B) Timeless, and C) overall a pretty good thing, and almost all civilizations are associated with states,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.320
like ancient Egypt, or China in the remote past or France if you're into Western civilization.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.360
Thanks Thought Bubble. I mean it's telling that the Mongols were arguably the greatest conquerors of

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.380
the premodern world, but we usually don't call them a civilization. They weren't just agriculture-y and

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.280
state-like enough. Although of course the Mongols being the Mongols, there is an exception to the rule:

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.160
the Mongols DID settle in a recognizable state in Yuan China. Ughhh, history, even your exceptions have

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.200
exceptions. So when we talk about states, we need to remember that it's pretty common for the creation

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.660
of states to involve some form of coercion like in ancient, and sometimes, not ancient societies, the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.200
power of the state rested primarily on two things - the army and taxes. And if you want to create an army

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.300
or raise taxes, or both, it's helpful to have a sedentary population that spends most of its time

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.820
producing food because food is very valuable to a state. I mean, while gold and palaces are beautiful, you can't

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.920
feed them to your army. Anyway, agricultural production and the creation of states are deeply intertwined.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.360
Agricultural surplus and control over it leads to other aspects of civilization like property rights and patriarchy.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.580
Well, I guess it doesn't have to lead to patriarchy, but it usually has. So while states rely on the exploitation

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.240
of agricultural labour and the subjugation of their citizens, then the civilization narratives that barabarians

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.980
were drawn to civilizations by their obvious superiority is kind of problematic. Because there's a big downside to all

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.280
that state control and taxes and conscription and servitude. And this leads us to James Scott's big idea

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.340
that rather than primitive hill tribes being attracted to the glamour and stability of valley settlements, hill cultures

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.020
are formed by people running away from civilization; basically, Scott argues that people flee to the hills

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.800
because it makes it hard for states to find and conquer them. The Arab historian, Ibn Khaldun remarked that

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.820
Arabs can gain control over flat territory and do not pursue tribes that hide in the mountains. Then you have

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.660
the Franco-Hungarian military officer, Baron de Tott, poetically exclaiming that "The steepest places have

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.000
always been the asylum of liberty", but the great French Historian Fernand Braudel probably summed it up best

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.220
when he wrote, "The mountains as a rule are a world apart from civilizations which are an urban and lowland

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.740
achievement. Their history is to have none, to remain always on the fringes of the great waves of civilization..."

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.860
And you may have noticed from the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan to people in Colorado with their

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.920
legal marijuana, it's still kind of difficult for states to control hill people. This idea turns the civilization narrative

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.540
on its head. Hill people are not barbarians waiting to become civilized. They're refugees from civilization itself.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.480
And this brings up the possibility that life in the hills is actually better than settled agricultural states with their

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.340
wars and taxes and forced labor. Furthermore, cities and settlements breed epidemic diseases and when

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:12.660
the next Spanish flu comes for all of us, it's going to be good to be in the mountains. That said, I'm not a 100% sold on

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.940
the argument, which is why I'm living in very flat, very civilized Indianapolis. I mean, as I said earlier,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.500
without agricultural surpluses, we wouldn't have the Internet, which I'm fond of, also I have tried

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.140
the hunter-gather paleo diet and it did not suit me. I like Doritos. Stan just told me that the paleo diet is not

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.020
in fact, the diet the people of the hills have, apparently the kind of agriculture they used was called swiddening?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.600
It means shifting cultivation, and apparently it's great because it provides a more varied diet with less effort.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.640
Score another one for the hill people. Maybe I'll try to popularize the swidden diet. Ohhh! Time for the Open Letter!

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.620
Oh my God, the new globe opens and food comes out of it!! Is it my birthday? Man, I love our new globe!

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:57.040
Anyway, an open letter to fad diets. Dear fad diets, you know what doesn't work? Eating unheathily.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.320
You know what does work? Eating healthily. Your noble prehistoric heritage as a scavenger has prepared you

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:10.300
to eat anything. Anything that is food. So the idea of eating only one kind of food is just sort of inherently ludicrous.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.700
I mean the average freegan is literally healthier than I am, and they just eat whatever is in the dumpster.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.600
In short, fad diets, eating discarded food is much more in line with most of human history than the paleo diet.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.640
Best wishes, John Green.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.720
All right, so far, much of what I've said can be applied to hill people from all over the world at various times, but

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.120
the focus of Scott's book is the region of upland Southeast Asia and southern China that he calls

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:39.900
"Zomia." Zomia is mountainous and jungle-y and home to between 80 and 100 million people. It'a a little hard

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.260
to conceptualize because we're so used to thinking of history in terms of states, and this region is, to quote him,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.800
"relatively stateless." Zomia was at least partially created by slavery actually because flight from slavery is

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.880
one of the main reasons that people head for the hills. According to Scott, "Southeast Asian states were

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.000
slaving states, without exception, some of them until well into the twentieth century. Wars in pre-colonial

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.100
Southeast Asia were less about territory than about the seizure of as many captives as possible

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.360
who were then resettled at the core of the winner's territory." I can just hear all you Crash Course viewers saying,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:19.220
"Wait, is there any evidence that any of that is true?" Kinda... But like if one of the main reasons people create

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.240
hill cultures like Zomia is to avoid civilizations and one of the hallmarks of civilization is writing? Then, it stands to

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.840
reason that there won't be much written evidence from Zomia, as writing is kind of like the bread and butter of

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.440
traditional history. Off-topic, but bread and butter is really no longer the staple of any diet. We should really change

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.100
that to phrase like the Doritos Locos Tacos and Chipotle burritos of traditional history.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.660
So the evidence that we can look at is flawed because it's mainly what other people have written about

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:52.060
Zomians and their hill-dwelling brethren. Like this Portuguese friar Father Sangermano wrote around 1800 that the people of

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:58.300
the area, quote, "Unable any longer to bear witness to the heavy oppressions and continual levies of men

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.620
and money made upon them have withdrawn themselves from their native soil, with all their families..."

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.940
So basically, he thought, at least, that they were leaving because of conscription and taxes

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.640
you know, hallmarks of civilization. And then there are also later colonialists like Sir Stamford Raffles who,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.960
despite his name, was not a clown. He was the founder of British Singapore. Here's what he said about

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.120
colonial rule in Indonesia: "Here I am the advocate of despotism. The strong arm of power is necessary to

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.460
bring men together and to concentrate them into societies... Sumatra is, in great measure, peopled by

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.280
innumerable petty tribes subject to no central government..."

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:40.720
"At present, people are as wandering in their habits as birds of the air, and until they are congregated

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.740
and organized under something like authority, nothing can be done with them." Raffles there makes

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.580
an accidental but pretty damning indictment of civilization to say that the reason that people exist is so

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.040
that something can be done with them. Now admittedly this isn't particularly strong evidence,

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.800
and it doesn't touch on pre-modern history or the state formation activities of Southeast Asian rulers. But if

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.380
Europeans'  attitudes and activities drove some people to the mountains, it's possible that earlier rulers,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.680
especially if they founded their states on war and slavery, and we know in many cases that they did, that

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.640
they may have had a similar effect. So can we finally conclude that hill people as well as nomads and other

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.460
cultures that attempt to live outside the state structure are not primitive people left behind by civilization,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:29.340
but those who have made a conscious choice to avoid it? Well, in the absence of extensive written records, we

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.700
call history "anthropology." That's a joke for all the anthropology majors out there. And

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.040
a number of anthropologists have suggested that people who live separate from our ideas of civilization

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.820
did indeed make that choice consciously in a wide variety of situations. Like in his book

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:48.020
Society Against the State, Pierre Clastres argues that the so-called primitive Amerindian societies of

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.960
South America were not in fact ancient societies that had failed to invent settled agriculture or state forms,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.560
but previously sedentary cultivators who abandoned agriculture and fixed villages in response to the effects of

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.380
conquest. So are all these stateless, social orders finally a response to civilization or just people

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.340
who haven't realized the bounty of civilization yet?

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.580
I don't know, and studying history isn't really about providing answers. It's about providing context.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.220
The question of what's the best and most just way to organize our social orders is a big question

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.220
and a very old one. But it's something we still need to be asking because we're all still making choices

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.800
about how we're going to organize ourselves into communities. Scott's idea of Zomia introduces us to

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.160
a different way of thinking about things, and equating civilization with coercive state control

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.300
calls into question the idea of what it even means to be civilized. But I'm not enough of an anarchist

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:43.020
to let this episode go without acknowledging the extraordinary accomplishments of civilization, not just

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:49.140
agriculture but every thing from antibiotics to the ability to be connected to people who live half a world away

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.800
from you. The deep and growing interconnectedness among humans has its risks for sure,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.320
but it also provides tremendous opportunities. We can collaborate, we can play each other in FIFA,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.280
and we can also do THIS together. But then again, there's an extraordinary freedom to Zomian-style social orders,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.720
and vitally, their way of life is far more sustainable than ours.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.920
