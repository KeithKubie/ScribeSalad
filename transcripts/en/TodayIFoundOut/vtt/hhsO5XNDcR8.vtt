00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
The Man Who Personally Executed Over 7000
People in 28 Days

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.930
The most prolific executioner of all time
is a man by the name of Vasili Blokhin.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.219
Born to a Russian peasant family in 1895,
as a young man he quickly earned a reputation

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.389
for “chernaya rabota”, or “black work”,
while serving in the Tsarist army during World

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.110
War I- gaining recognition from Stalin himself
for his covert assassinations, torture, and

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.110
executions.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.640
Blokhin quickly rose through the ranks of
Russia’s secret police at the time—the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.880
NKVD—eventually becoming the head of the
Kommandatura department.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.370
The members of the department were approved
by Stalin and took orders directly from him.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.019
Under the guise of other positions, Vasili
Blokhin was officially a commandant of a prison-

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.960
the department carried out black work missions
specific to furthering Stalin’s cause.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.309
Blokhin oversaw many mass executions and executed
several high-profile individuals himself,

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.850
including Mikhail Tukachevsky, Marshal of
the Soviet Union, and two of the former NKVD

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.359
chiefs under whom he had previously served.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.199
But Blokhin’s most infamous deed was performed
at the bloody Katyn Massacre.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.390
In 1939, just over two weeks after Germany
invaded Poland, Soviet forces entered the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.230
eastern side of Poland.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.380
Though they didn’t officially declare war,
they captured over 20,000 Polish officers

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.370
and detained them in Soviet prison camps.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.950
On March 5, 1940, Stalin himself ordered the
executions of all Polish officers, who would

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.610
then be dumped in mass graves.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.490
Over a twenty-eight day period, Vasili Blokhin
personally performed over 7000 of these Polish

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.270
executions at Katyn.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.900
Usually, the executions would take place from
dusk til dawn, with Blokhin preferring to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.470
work at night for these types of tasks.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
Blokhin would work nearly uninterrupted each
night, reportedly killing a prisoner about

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
every two or three minutes, averaging around
300 executions per night.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.870
The executions would go like this: after signing
identification papers, officers were led with

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.870
their arms bound into a small room that was
equipped with soundproofed walls, a drain,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.970
a hose, and a door or hatch- it was a room
designed for executions.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.170
Forced to their knees, a member of the Kommandatura
would deliver a single shot to the back of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.010
the prisoners’ heads, killing them instantly.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.260
Their bodies would be dragged through the
second door, the room would be hosed down,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.390
and the next prisoner would be brought in.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.770
Blokhin favoured the 7.65 mm Walther PPK pistol
for these types of executions.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.780
It didn’t have as much of a kickback as
other guns, which meant less pain in his wrist

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.950
after performing hundreds of executions every
day.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.530
The pistols also rarely misfired, which meant
the victims could be killed with one shot

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.860
nearly every time someone pulled the trigger.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.510
For the Soviet government, the pistols were
favoured because they were the make carried

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.950
by German officers.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.470
In the event that the mass graves were discovered,
the bodies would contain bullets from a German-style

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.810
pistol and the Soviets could deny responsibility
for the deaths.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.500
On April 27, 1940, Blokhin was rewarded with
the Order of the Red Banner for carrying out

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.770
this amazingly bloody organized mass killing.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.580
The Order was traditionally given to military
personnel who displayed “exceptional courage,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.370
self-denial, and valour during combat”.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.040
He was given the order secretly in order to
protect the secret nature of the killings.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.540
In 1941, Stalin found himself in an alliance
with the Polish government after the Germans

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.940
invaded Russia.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.040
He released hundreds of thousands of Poles
from prison camps, and was pressed on several

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.120
occasions to account for the missing POWs.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.380
Stalin pled ignorance, but in 1943 the truth
began to emerge with the discovery of the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.260
mass graves at Katyn.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.230
The Soviet government denied all responsibility
and blamed the Germans.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.570
It wasn’t until 1990 and Mikhail Gorbachev’s
institution of openness that the truth was

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.810
revealed through a series of documents highlighting
the country’s role in the massacre.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.640
Blokhin didn’t live to see his deeds publically
recognized.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.530
Following Stalin’s death in 1953, he was
forced to retire.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
During the deStalinization campaign that followed,
Blokhin was stripped of his rank and turned

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.790
to alcoholism.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.950
A combination of drink and insanity reportedly
led to his death in 1955, the cause of which

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.320
is officially listed as suicide.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.640
The legacy of his heinous acts lives on.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.910
Along with the 7000 prisoners of war Blokhin
personally executed at Katyn, he is reportedly

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.090
directly responsible for the deaths of many
thousands of other people in prison camps

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.320
during the Second World War, aptly earning
him that title of “Most Prolific Executioner”

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:38.270
according to the Guinness World Records.
