00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900
second part a few questions what will
 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.720
second part a few questions what will
happen to static objects reference

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730
happen to static objects reference
 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.200
happen to static objects reference
reference inside the service class any

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210

so of course the static objects will be

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020
so of course the static objects will be
 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.260
so of course the static objects will be

object that keeps the reference on a
 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.240
object that keeps the reference on a
service you will actually leak that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250
service you will actually leak that
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.460
service you will actually leak that
service minutes restarted so you have to

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470
service minutes restarted so you have to
 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.630
service minutes restarted so you have to
be very careful there because it's some

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640
be very careful there because it's some
 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.060
be very careful there because it's some
sometimes it's easy to create a memory

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070
sometimes it's easy to create a memory
 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.250
sometimes it's easy to create a memory
leak if you're using a static object so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260
leak if you're using a static object so
 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.730
leak if you're using a static object so
you can do it but be very careful okay I

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740
you can do it but be very careful okay I
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.770
you can do it but be very careful okay I
can ask a question yeah I played with

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780
can ask a question yeah I played with
 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.550
can ask a question yeah I played with
the billing service of version 3 and

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560
the billing service of version 3 and
 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.630
the billing service of version 3 and

hours and they can maybe make an example

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349
hours and they can maybe make an example
 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:23.719
hours and they can maybe make an example
in the code that you said and maybe for

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:23.729
in the code that you said and maybe for
 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.100
in the code that you said and maybe for
a checking the items for that anyway

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110
a checking the items for that anyway
 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.650
a checking the items for that anyway
because there's examples that going with

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660
because there's examples that going with
 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:37.490
because there's examples that going with
the code and is only for buy buy items

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500
the code and is only for buy buy items
 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.040
the code and is only for buy buy items
and not for chicken to checking

and not for chicken to checking
 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.570
and not for chicken to checking
okay yeah I thought we did have sample

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580
okay yeah I thought we did have sample
 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.790
okay yeah I thought we did have sample
code for that in me we have a full

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800
code for that in me we have a full
 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.080
code for that in me we have a full
sample application that goes along with

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.090
sample application that goes along with
 

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.550
sample application that goes along with
it as opposed to just the sample code on

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560
it as opposed to just the sample code on
 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.500
it as opposed to just the sample code on
the on the in-app billing site and make

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510
the on the in-app billing site and make
 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.580
the on the in-app billing site and make
the application should have all the

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:52.590
the application should have all the
 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.439
the application should have all the
sample code inside it there's also a

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.449
sample code inside it there's also a
 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.540
sample code inside it there's also a
demo excuse that you can check so you

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550
demo excuse that you can check so you
 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.920
demo excuse that you can check so you
can change your Merchant ID and you'll

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930
can change your Merchant ID and you'll
 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.810
can change your Merchant ID and you'll
get all the demo ones so that's that's

00:07:59.810 --> 00:07:59.820
get all the demo ones so that's that's
 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.100
get all the demo ones so that's that's
how you test if it works and then

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.110
how you test if it works and then
 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.140
how you test if it works and then
obviously even then shift over to your

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.150
obviously even then shift over to your
 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.149
obviously even then shift over to your
specific SKUs and test your actual items

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159
specific SKUs and test your actual items
 

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:09.040

should you don't reduce any of these

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:12.510
should you don't reduce any of these
 

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.780
should you don't reduce any of these
classes anymore you should rely on

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:14.790
classes anymore you should rely on
 

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.079
classes anymore you should rely on
loader manager and cursor loader so take

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:18.089
loader manager and cursor loader so take
 

00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:19.040
loader manager and cursor loader so take
a look at them

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.050
a look at them
 

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.490
a look at them
and they should help you out and they

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500
and they should help you out and they
 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.440
and they should help you out and they
also take care of all the life cycle

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.450
also take care of all the life cycle

do you they didn't sell size on

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.170
do you they didn't sell size on
 

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.960
do you they didn't sell size on

so yeah it totally depends on what your

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519
so yeah it totally depends on what your
 

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:40.019
so yeah it totally depends on what your
data source is previously if it's on the

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:40.029
data source is previously if it's on the
 

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:41.819
data source is previously if it's on the
database it's probably easy to use a

00:16:41.819 --> 00:16:41.829
database it's probably easy to use a
 

00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:43.439
database it's probably easy to use a
cursor adapter with a cursor loader and

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:43.449

then you'll get all the freeness or the

up with a strategy and how you cache

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:51.330
up with a strategy and how you cache

all these kind of things so what you can
 

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:59.060
all these kind of things so what you can
do in your case may be if you have a

algorithm and pull the data mmm yeah I
 

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:11.419
algorithm and pull the data mmm yeah I
think you

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:11.429

I don't know how often you have you to
 

00:28:13.469 --> 00:28:15.499
I don't know how often you have you to
refresh your data but you can use a

00:28:15.499 --> 00:28:15.509
refresh your data but you can use a
 

00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:17.779
refresh your data but you can use a
service and a background and pull data

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:17.789
service and a background and pull data
 

00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:26.719
service and a background and pull data
from time to time but in general you

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:26.729
from time to time but in general you
 

00:28:26.729 --> 00:28:28.249
from time to time but in general you
have to look at your requirements and

00:28:28.249 --> 00:28:28.259
have to look at your requirements and
 

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:29.419
have to look at your requirements and
then then from there
