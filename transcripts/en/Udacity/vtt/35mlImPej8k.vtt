00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.360
So to find out what happens when we run this

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.910
line of code, we will go back in time and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.180
look at a video from a previous lesson when we

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.570
were drawing shapes. For now, you can think of a class

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.940
as a neatly packaged box that puts things together really

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.602
well. And it allows us to write code like turtle.turtle

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:21.860
with these strange-looking brackets as if we were calling a

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.870
function. In fact, when we do run this piece of code,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.210
we are, in fact, calling a function, a function

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.590
called init, which is defined inside the class Turtle. Init

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.530
stands for initialize. And what it does is it

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.480
creates space in memory for a new instance or a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.470
new object of the class Turtle. This instance, we

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.010
called Brad. Okay, so we are back to the present

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.310
time. Now, we started out by defining a file

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.800
called media.py. Let me place it up on the board.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.540
Notice that I place this file outside the Python standard

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.920
library. Inside that file, we then defined a class called Movie.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.360
After that, we wrote a line of code

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.610
that said media.movie. And what that did, was that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.380
it called the init function Define inside class

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.590
Movie. And that created a new instance. That instance

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.820
we called Toy Story. So to summarize, this

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.530
function init initializes or creates space and memory for

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.150
the new instance Toy Story. By the way,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.330
this new function init, is also called a constructor

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810
because it constructs space and memory for the new

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.630
instance, which in this case happens to be Toy Story.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.510
So thus far, we've encountered two new words that we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.710
can add to our new word list. The first one

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.470
is instance, which in this case, happens to be Toy

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.650
Story. And the second one is a constructor, which in

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.560
this case, is the function init. Now, we will

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.215
revisit these words soon. But for now, let's define init.
