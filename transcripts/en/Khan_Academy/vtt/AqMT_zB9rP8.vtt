00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.080
We've got 4x squared
y minus 3xy plus 25

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.470
minus the entire expression 9y
squared x plus 7xy minus 20.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.910
So when we're subtracting
this entire expression,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.502
that's equivalent to
subtracting each of these terms

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.460
individually if we didn't
have the parentheses.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.250
Or another way of
thinking about it--

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.240
we could distribute
this negative sign.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.460
Or you could view this
as a negative 1 times

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.660
this entire expression.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.770
And we can distribute it.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.760
So let's do that.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.620
So let me write this
first expression here.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.020
I'm going to write it unchanged.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.310
So it is 4x squared
y minus 3xy plus 25.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.190
And now let me distribute
the negative 1,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.120
or the negative sign
times all of this stuff.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.460
So negative 1 times 9y squared
x is negative 9y squared x.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.720
Negative 1 times
7xy is negative 7xy.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.220
And then negative 1
times 20 is positive 20.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.110
And now we just have
to add these terms.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.120
And we just want to
group like terms.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.840
So let's see, is there another
x squared y term anywhere?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.240
No, I don't see one.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.270
So I'll just rewrite this.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.580
So we have 4x squared y.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.370
Now, is there another xy term?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.260
Yeah, there is.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.720
So we can group negative
3xy and negative 7xy.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.230
Negative 3 of something minus
another 7 of that something

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.170
is going to be negative
10 of that something.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.730
So it's negative 10xy.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.020
And then we have a 25, which
is just a constant term.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.430
Or an x to the 0 term.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.306
It's 25x to the 0.

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:42.430
You could view it that way.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.513
And there's another constant
term right over here.

00:01:44.513 --> 00:01:47.170
We can always add 25 to 20.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.540
That gives us 45.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.519
And then we have this
term right over here,

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.560
which clearly can't be
merged with anything else.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.050
So minus 9y squared.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.780
Let me do that in
that original color.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.540
Minus 9-- I'm having
trouble shifting

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.210
colors-- minus 9y squared x.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.510
And we are done.
