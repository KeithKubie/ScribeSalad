00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.210
Welcome to the Environment
Forum of the Mahindra Humanities

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.470
Center.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.030
My name is Robin Kelsey.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm Dean of Arts and
Humanities and Burden Professor

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.360
of Photography.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.570
And with Ian Miller,
Professor of History here

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.510
in the front row, we convene
the Environment Forum

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.130
at the Mahindra.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.700
And we do so under the
beneficent graces of Homi

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.450
Bhabha, the center's director--
who could not be here with us

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.170
today, but we will
be thinking of him--

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.480
and with the extraordinary
support of Steve Biel and Sarah

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.920
Razor, who are unfailingly
energetic and dedicated

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
to ensuring that
this forum operate

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.519
at its maximum capacity.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.040
When Ian and I
first met with Homi

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
to discuss the possibility
of launching the Environment

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.000
Forum, the idea for us was
not to bring the environment

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.660
into the humanities as
one more topic or theme,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.250
but rather to think about what
the humanities would become

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.160
if we took our relationship
to the natural environment

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.120
seriously.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.400
And it has been
inspiring to pursue

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
that question from one meeting
of the forum to the next.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
We have a great treat in
store for us this evening.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.900
Our special guest
is Michael Pollan,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.560
who last year joined the
English Department as Professor

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.440
of the Practice of Creative
Writing and Lewis K. Chan Arts

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.730
Lecturer.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.570
And we are deeply
grateful for that.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.770
Michael, as everyone this
side of the moon knows,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.150
is one of the best writers
of nonfiction in English.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.450
He is the author of several
bestselling and critically

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.380
acclaimed books such as Botany
of Desire, The Omnivore's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.460
Dilemma, and his most recent
book, How to Change Your Mind.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.240
Michael, through these works,
has probed our exchanges

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.890
with the natural world,
particularly the exchanges

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.130
entailed by our ways
of ingesting it.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.810
He and his books
have been festooned

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.730
with so many prizes
that to list them

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.730
all would take up
much of the evening,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.000
so please consult his
website if you need any more

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.190
information along those lines.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.850
To converse with
Michael, we are very

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.090
fortunate to have Elaine
Scarry, The Walter M. Cabot

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.080
Professor of Aesthetics and
the General Theory of Value,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.210
which is my favorite
professorial title at Harvard,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.420
and Michael's colleague
in the English department.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.430
Elaine is one of our most
accomplished humanists,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.060
having written, among many
other things, The Body in Pain,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.560
Dreaming by the Book, and
that compact little volume

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.320
from her Tanner Lecture at
Yale, On Beauty and Being Just.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.490
Our topic this evening
is Writing the Ineffable.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.480
Harvard, generally
speaking, is deeply effable,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.090
and one of the delights
about this event

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.280
is the chance to
use the Environment

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.320
Forum to press against the
confident articulations

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320
of this institution.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.260
And we're going to talk
amongst ourselves for awhile,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.890
and then we're going to open
things up for questions.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.240
There are going to
be two microphone

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.120
stands available in the
aisles, but there's also

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.860
one roving one for
people who would

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.710
find it uncomfortable to get to
one of the mics in the aisles.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.550
So be thinking about your
questions as we proceed.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.620
So by agreement, I am
going to kick things off.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.290
And I'm going to
ask Michael about--

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.050
here's the book, How to Change
Your Mind, for those who have

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.160
not yet gotten it and read it.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.590
In addition to giving us
a very clear exposition

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.950
of the new science of
psychedelics in this book,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.790
you describe your own
experience with them.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.290
And I wanted to ask
you about that decision

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.340
and what challenges
that decision

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.780
presented to you as a writer.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.070
Good question.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.420
Well, thank you all for coming.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.750
And Elaine, what an
honor to share this table

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.610
with you and Robin.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.870
Thanks for the invitation.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.960
You know, as soon
as I decided I was

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.480
going to be writing a
book on psychedelics,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.180
obviously the question is then
planted right in front of you.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.340
Are you going to have
these experiences

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.520
that you're describing?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.820
I had written a long
piece for The New Yorker

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.340
before I embarked on this book
in which I didn't do anything.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.750
I was very much the
omniscient journalist

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.270
with no skin in the game.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.250
But there were a
couple reasons that

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.100
made me decide that
I needed to do this.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.200
And I have to say it was
with some reluctance,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.770
because I had had very limited
experience of psychedelics

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.580
at the age-appropriate
moment in life.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.740
I happened to be
at a college where

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.060
there were no psychedelics.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.000
And I chose poorly, I guess.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.580
But I was I was also
not ready for them.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.140
I was terrified of them.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.140
And I believed a lot of the
scare stories that were around

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.990
and the real stories
that were around.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.970
I came of age just
a little too late,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.490
and the scare stories were
dominant in the culture

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.820
already, people staring at
the sun till they go blind,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.490
thinking they could fly and
falling off of buildings,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.350
and people having trips from
which they never returned.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.030
And so all that weighed on me,
and so I kind of avoided them.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.020
As a writer,
however, I've always

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.030
tried to find a way to
put myself in the story,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.160
just to offer that unique
perspective writing

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.060
from inside.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.990
And this goes back to--

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.630
I realized recently-- to the
time when I was 11 years old

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.650
and my parents gave me a copy
of a book by a Harvard alum

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.950
named George Plimpton
called Paper Lion.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.290
And it was a kind
of amazing book--

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.600
he was also editor
of The Paris Review--

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.300
where he was trying to
reinvent sportswriting.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.880
And he did it by
getting onto the field.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.080
He persuaded the Detroit Lions
to let him play in a scrimmage,

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.240
go through the
summer workout camp,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.760
and then play as
quarterback in a scrimmage.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.710
And he got stuff that not only
no sports writer could ever

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.230
get because they were
on the sidelines,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.200
but no player could get because
they'd been playing continually

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.650
since they were little kids.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.590
And so that quality of
wonder, of first sight,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.110
is available really
only to the person doing

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.060
something for the first time.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.100
And I loved that book.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.610
And I didn't think
about it years later,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.237
but I started doing
that in my work.

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:44.820
When I wrote about
the cattle industry

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.430
for Omnivore's Dilemma,
I bought a cow,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.847
and became a baby cattle
rancher for a couple of months,

00:07:51.847 --> 00:07:54.180
and built a house when I was
writing about architecture.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.880
And it just gave me a vantage.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.640
It gave me humorous
possibilities

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.040
because you're usually
a fish out of water,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.060
and that's always
valuable in writing.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.520
And it gave me narrative.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.630
So that was kind of to one side.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.730
My readers kind of expected
something like that.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.730
And then the other was I
became intensely curious.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.740
For this New Yorker
piece I mentioned,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.140
I was interviewing
cancer patients who

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.770
had participated in a
trial of psilocybin,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.280
the chemical in magic mushrooms.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.860
And the theory-- and they were
reprising research that had

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.289
been done in the '50s and '60s--

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.330
that having the kind of
powerful spiritual experience

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.140
many people do on
psychedelics at a high dose

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.080
might help them deal with
what the doctors called

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.280
the existential distress
of facing your mortality,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.740
or the fear of recurrence.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.970
And I started
interviewing these people,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.520
and their stories
were so amazing.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.850
And I gradually grew
envious of them.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.400
I had never had a
spiritual experience.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.600
I've always thought of myself
as kind of spiritually retarded.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.330
And I was so curious
to have what they had

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.340
and see what that was about.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.500
So at a certain point, I
realized I have to do this.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.390
I don't know how
I feel about it.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.250
I had many conversations
with Judith, my wife,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.750
who had her own trepidations
about my doing this.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.350
We could invite her up
[INAUDIBLE],, but we won't.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.500
But you know, we've been
together for a very long time.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.350
And if one person
in a relationship

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.410
is going to have a big,
supposedly possibly

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.320
life-changing experience, that
could be very destabilizing

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.960
to a relationship.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.900
And would I change in some ways?

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.080
And what she didn't
think enough about

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.670
was that I might get better.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.940
But we can decide whether
I did or not later.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.260
So that was the sort
of thought process.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.930
And then there were all
the mechanics of like,

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.200
how do you do this?

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.420
How do I find someone?

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.700
I couldn't get into
the above ground trials

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.830
at reputable institutions.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.260
So I had to find my way into
the psychedelic underground

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.890
to find people who were
willing to work with me,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.540
knowing that I'd be
writing about them,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.300
and given that they
were doing illegal work.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.600
And obviously there were
legal considerations, too,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.529
and we can talk about
that later or not.

00:10:42.529 --> 00:10:44.320
But I definitely had
misgivings about that.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.420
Did you anticipate
the challenges

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.300
of writing about it even
before you had the experience?

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.910
I mean, were you
thinking about not only

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.080
what is it going to be like
to have the experience,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.740
but what is it going to be like
to write about the experience?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.670
Without question.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.670
I mean, there was the
worry about going to jail,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.610
and then there was to
worry about description .

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.050
And they don't
seem commensurate,

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.640
but I was actually more
worried about the description

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.770
because I'd read Huxley,
Doors of Perception,

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.700
which is the ur-text, in a way.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.490
I mean, every psychedelic
experience since then,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.700
or account of it, has
been influenced by that

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.650
whether you've read it or not.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.470
It's one of those
powerful accounts.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.470
And it was beautiful.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.790
And I didn't think I could
write any account that good.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.850
And then I'd read all these
really crappy trip reports

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.570
that are all over the internet.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.890
It's like the quickest way
to repel someone is tell them

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.040
your dreams, right?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.940
And psychedelic trips can
function in much the same way.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.940
So yes, there was a lot
of anxiety about it.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.390
And the whole time I was
working on the book--

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.920
and there's so many parts
of the book, my travelogue,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.140
as it were- those
accounts loomed ahead

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.150
as these great peaks that
I had to get up and across.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.720
Definitely.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.760
So one of the reasons that
this is particularly germane,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.370
I think, to this
forum is that a lot

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.749
of people who get into the
environmental humanities

00:12:21.749 --> 00:12:23.290
get into the
environmental humanities

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:28.390
because they've had some
experiences in the world that

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.524
more or less feel, to
them, transcendent.

00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:32.440
And then they go in and
they do their studies,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.190
and often there's not
much of a connection

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.650
between the experience that
got them into the study

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.849
and how they actually then
conduct their research

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:42.640
and write about it.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.890
And I've been
fascinated by that gulf.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.950
And it's often only late in
the evening, when you say,

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.840
so why did you do this--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.800
It's embarrassing.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.330
Right.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:51.830
Right.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.770
So can we talk about
that, just a little bit

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:59.530
about the what is it
that is embarrassing,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.910
what is it that
is so difficult--

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.610
Well, you're talking
about academics,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.080
and then you're
talking about emotion.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.631
So-- no, the experience
that gets a lot of people

00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:11.380
into writing about
nature is an experience

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.880
of awe in nature and a
transcendent feeling.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.700
Awe is an overwhelming emotion.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.830
We don't understand
it very well.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.470
And it's interesting that those
people don't write about it

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.160
that much, even though
it was the mode of force.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.780
But I've also met
lots of people who

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.290
got into psychiatry or
neuroscience because

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.980
of a psychedelic experience
and don't necessarily

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.520
talk about it.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.720
So I think sometimes these
motivating experiences happen

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.520
when we're young, too, and
we construct a more grown up

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.240
rationale for what we're doing.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:47.800
But I agree.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.620
I think that the
experience of awe,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.580
anyone who devotes
their life to studying

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.142
nature and the environment.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.330
It's certainly true for me.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.460
I see this work is part and
parcel of all my writing

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.560
on nature I mean,
that's really has been

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.749
what's unified all my work.

00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:08.290
I mean, people think
of me as writing

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.414
about food or psychedelics.

00:14:09.414 --> 00:14:12.140
But what joins them
together, as you pointed out,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.620
is these are ways we engage
with the natural world.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.780
They're not the normal way of
admiring it or writing elegies

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.980
for it or whatever we do.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.330
But I've always been
attracted to the idea

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.320
that we have an active
engagement with nature,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.750
yet when we mostly
write about it,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.937
we write about it as spectators.

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:32.020
Michael, I had a question.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.950
Eating engages us.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.390
Yeah.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.040
A moment ago you
described yourself

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.800
as spiritually retarded.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.500
And throughout the
book, you say that.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.910
You say I'm not sure I've ever
had a spiritual experience.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.760
And yet all your books
are about gardens,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.240
and you describe even
being four years old,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.660
and your first garden
being between a lilac bush

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.340
and a fence and so forth.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.080
And are you just
saying that in the book

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.260
to make everybody
feel at ease and make

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.960
it more believable
when you then start

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.020
going off into outer space?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.210
Well, it's a good question.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.389
I mean, I have had experience
that, from the outside,

00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:17.680
feel like spiritual experience.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.700
And I've talked about meals and
the communal quality of meals.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.760
And in some sense,
that is spiritual.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.950
And many people read
Botany of Desire

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.810
and would tell me
that they thought

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.200
it was spiritual, the fact
that I'm imputing agency

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.110
to the plants, and
that I'm trying

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.660
to see the world from
their point of view.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.510
But it never felt that
way to me, I guess.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.520
That was an idea, to me, that
was very much rooted in what

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.070
we know about co-evolution.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.950
And so I always
thought other people

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.260
were putting that kind
of spiritual gloss on it.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:59.060
But I think, though, I was
having spiritual experience,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.600
and I just didn't
know it because I

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.720
was so uncomfortable with
that vocabulary, spiritual.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.520
I just really had
this sense that

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.700
to be spiritual was to
believe in the supernatural,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.070
and that's what spirituality is.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.200
And that's not a
very good definition.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.440
But it was the one I had.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.990
I saw myself as a
materialist in terms

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.580
of my philosophical attitude.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.400
And people who
were spiritual had

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.550
left the realm of
explaining things according

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.020
to the laws of nature.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.300
And one of the big
things to come out

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.500
of the kinds of
spiritual experiences

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.830
I had in writing
this book was not

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.040
a belief in the supernatural,
which some people do come out

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.100
of psychedelic experience
absolutely convinced of.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.980
And who knows,
they may be right.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.040
I mean, this idea that there is
some universal consciousness.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.470
You know, Huxley talked about
the mind at large, the idea

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.900
that consciousness
is not necessarily

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.349
the product of brains, that
it might exist in the world.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.380
And there are physicists
who believe this.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.310
But I tended to think
that consciousness

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:15.160
was a product of the brain.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.364
But I totally reset
my understanding

00:17:17.364 --> 00:17:20.170
of what spirituality was in
the course of writing the book.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:26.870
And that happened-- let me see.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:28.620
Well, maybe we should
hold that until I've

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.360
talked about some
of the experiences

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.020
because it doesn't make
sense without a long--

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.770
Can we talk about
the experiences,

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:42.000
but I especially want to talk
about them as a writer, when

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.130
you'd had the
experiences, what were

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.030
the challenges and the
risks that you experienced

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.767
as you tried to write
about what you encountered?

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:53.100
Well, the first challenge,
and always the challenge when

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.320
you're writing, is
boredom, I mean,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.030
that you're going
to bore your readers

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.904
and you're going to
describe something that's

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:02.010
so idiosyncratic to
you, like your dreams,

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.290
that who else would
care about it?

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:11.700
And as a writer of nonfiction,
you always have one eye on--

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.340
you have this internal
boredom meter of impatience.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:24.000
And this comes out of writing
for newspapers and magazines

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.190
where I just know how
long I can venture down

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.440
a digression before I'm
going to lose people.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.050
I can just feel them
closing the book.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.560
And that's my
anxiety as a writer.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.730
And so there was that,
that I would bore people.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:47.080
Then there was the fact that
would anyone understand it,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:54.100
because what happens is so
strange and hard to explain.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.200
You know, William
James, who wrote

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.700
about mystical experience, which
is the best analog we have,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:08.160
I think, for the psychedelic
experience, his whole analysis.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.980
And one of the qualities
of the mystical experience

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:17.710
is ineffability, that it
transcends the categories

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.880
we have, the words we have.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.090
It's not like anything else
that's ever happened to us.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.980
And so there was that.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.050
How do you eff the ineffable?

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.360
And so that was a concern.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:40.680
And I had one experience
in particular, the most

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:47.340
kind of upsetting and violent
one, that not only did

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.030
I have an experience of ego
dissolution, which had happened

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.740
on an earlier
experience and is also,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.160
by the way, a hallmark
of mystical experience,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.030
the fact that your sense
of self melts away.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.530
And when that happens,
if you're not panicking,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.240
if you're surrendering to
it, there is this sense,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.180
since there are no boundaries
anymore between you

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.610
and the world, you
have no ego defenses,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.290
you're merging with
something larger.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.760
And that, I think, is the heart
of the mystical experience,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.800
which is a wonderful sense
of being one with nature,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.890
being one with other
people, feeling

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.500
powerful currents of love,
all these things that

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.717
happen when we're undefended.

00:20:31.717 --> 00:20:33.300
That was going to
be hard to describe.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.870
But anyway, so that was the
template, William James.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.850
And it holds up really well.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.750
So how was I going
to put words to this?

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.340
I had never tried to write
about something like this.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.750
And there was definitely
some worry about that.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.980
And I wrote after each
of my experiences.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.750
So just you know, I had
like five or six different,

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.480
seven psychedelic
experiences on a range

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.755
of different substances.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:16.800
So LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca,
and a very weird one called

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.680
5-MeO-DMT, which is--

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.340
this is going to sound odd--
but it's the smoked venom

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.210
of the Sonoran Desert Toad.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.250
The ingenuity of humans
to figure this out.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.349
We've got this
toad here, and you

00:21:32.349 --> 00:21:33.640
know we're going to do with it?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.960
We're going to milk it of
its venom and smoke it,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.270
and something will happen.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.330
Wearing a headlight.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.940
Yes, wearing a headlight
to capture them, yeah.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.460
Now when we're writing,
we need certain things.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.840
We need the element of time,
we need the element of space,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.840
and we need a being, a
character of some kind.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.379
Those are kind of
essential ingredients.

00:21:57.379 --> 00:21:59.670
I mean, you can write without
them, but it's difficult.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.350
I'd never done it.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.860
And on this particular
psychedelic,

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.940
where you take a single puff
and before you have exhaled,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.310
you have left the
Earth and you're

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.520
in a completely
different dimension.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.030
And it's just terrifying
because not only do you

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.420
experience a loss of
self, but you experience

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.410
a loss of any reference of there
is no time, there is no space,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.380
there is no matter.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.810
There is just pure energy.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.815
You are just in this
storm of mental--

00:22:31.815 --> 00:22:34.190
you don't even know if it's
mental, but just this energy.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.700
It's kind of like pre-Big
Bang, as we all remember that.

00:22:40.587 --> 00:22:42.920
But that's what I mean, the
difficulty of describing it.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.880
So I had none of the elements
from which we traditionally

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.600
construct a narrative.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.160
So I didn't know how I was
going to deal with that.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.930
But the bigger worry
was just surviving

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.940
that one, let alone
writing about it,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.180
because it was
really terrifying.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.920
The best thing about
that experience

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.590
was it only lasted
20 minutes, but I

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.960
didn't know it was 20 minutes.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.530
So Elaine, as a
reader, what did you

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:15.570
take away from Michael's
passages about his experience?

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.920
Well, I thought, good,
I don't have to do this,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.920
because I've experienced
it through him.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920
That's a public service.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.120
Yeah.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.000
And it's so
graphically described.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.610
And I thought that
in a number of cases,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.650
there is a strong
element of synesthesia.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:42.670
And in your first event
that you describe with LSD,

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.250
the musical notes are
turning into building blocks,

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:49.280
and then members of your
family are inhabiting them.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.400
And then in the one
with psilocybin,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.150
again, the music is--
whether it's a kind of music

00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:01.360
you didn't like, or whether it's
Yo-Yo Ma playing a cello suite,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.340
the very direct
transformation synesthetic

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.430
experiences into color and
visual events or tactile

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.560
events, like at one
moment, you feel

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.485
that you've become the cello
and Yo-Yo Ma's horsehair.

00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:15.610
I can feel it over my skin.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.740
You're the strings, yeah.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:24.940
And I think that in studies
that I've read of synesthesia--

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.750
and you talk later in the
book about synesthesia--

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.550
one theory is that
all the pruning

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.400
that we learn to do to
separate sections of our brain

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.360
when we're infants and
toddlers and so forth

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.660
is incomplete in people
who have synesthesia.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.960
And there's crosstalk
between areas of the brain.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.200
And one thing that's very
interesting is that some

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.380
neuroscientists-- like
this person Ramachandran,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.770
who's got a very prominent
place in this world--

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.670
believes that that is the
heart of how metaphor works,

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:08.380
that when you use a metaphor,
you are actually experiencing

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.670
a moment of crosstalk
in the brain,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.570
and you're actually eliciting
it from your readers

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.080
because they may
have not themselves

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.850
had the ability or the tendency
to have this kind of breakdown

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.740
in the areas of the brain.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.560
But you can prompt it
by this unexpected leap.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.334
And so I thought--

00:25:30.334 --> 00:25:31.750
and of course, the
things that are

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.441
happening to you during
the event are themselves--

00:25:37.441 --> 00:25:38.940
I mean, they're
literally happening,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.710
but they're not
quite literal events,

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.200
like you gave birth to
your son in one of them.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.800
It's not a literal
event, but it's

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.840
as though it's metaphor that
then requires other metaphors

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.450
to communicate it.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.590
And yet that's not getting
away from the heart

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.350
of the experience.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.390
That is the very
experienced that's

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.000
going on cognitively
is that there's

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.780
all this kind of crosstalk.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.970
And that's what we are coming to
understand neuroscientifically.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.200
There's one illustration
in the book that

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.730
shows how the brain is
wired when you're straight

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.665
and how it gets
rewired on psilocybin.

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:22.290
And it's really
interesting because you

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.320
have this situation where
all these different brain

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.100
networks that are ordinarily--
since that pruning period

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.830
that you're describing--
are kind of segregated.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.320
And they only communicate
with one another

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.920
through this master control
of the default mode network,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.290
which is where the ego appears
to reside, and that suddenly,

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.120
when that network goes quiet,
which happens on psychedelics--

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.900
at least according to
FMRI imaging of the brain,

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.540
this particular kind
of orchestra conductor

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.600
of the brain
network goes quiet--

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.500
suddenly you get these new
connections springing up.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.760
And so your sense of smell might
talk to your sense of sight

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.050
might talk to your
sense of music.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:07.894
And you're right.

00:27:07.894 --> 00:27:10.185
And I think that is why it's
such a metaphoric process.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:20.220
And that is, to me, the
most salient part of it,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.440
is the fact that
music in particular,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:32.260
it becomes so concrete, the most
powerful experiences of music,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.220
both good and bad,
that I'd never had.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.270
So I think that is what it is.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.030
It's a temporary
rewiring the brain.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:44.040
And in a way, it is going
back to child consciousness,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.980
before all that pruning
and division of labor

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.880
has happened in the brain.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.100
And one of the people I talk
to in the book, I interview,

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.830
is Alison Gopnik, the
child psychologist.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.760
And she's convinced that
psychedelic experience

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.690
is the closest we can come
to the mind of the child.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.600
It's kind of the
Wordsworthian drug.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.360
My kids definitely seemed
that way at certain points.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.660
Well, most kids,
four-year-olds and under five

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.200
and younger, many aspects
of their consciousness

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.400
is pretty psychedelic.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.400
They have trouble
focusing on a task.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.770
They're taking in
information from all sides

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.290
at once instead of--

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.070
she describes it as there's
spotlight consciousness, which

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.600
is what we have as adults.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.640
And we can attend to a
particular task or focus.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.570
And then there is a
lantern consciousness,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.050
which is taking in
information from all over.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.420
And in some ways,
their consciousness

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:51.510
is actually more accurate than
ours because when you focus,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.680
you edit out too much.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.950
Wordsworth says, "Of the
child, oh best philosopher,"

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.014
a line that Coleridge
thought was preposterous.

00:29:01.014 --> 00:29:03.780
But it's certainly consistent
with what you're saying.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.630
And she's done these really
interesting experiments

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.610
where she'll give a task--

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:14.010
she'll design a game, a task,
and for many kinds of thinking,

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.950
kids will outperform adults,
little kids will outperform

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:23.490
adults, if the task
requires throwing out

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.530
the rules of the game and trying
something completely different.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.950
So for example, she created
this blicket detector.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.220
And if you put a block
of the right shape

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.320
on in the right position,
the whole thing goes off

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.790
and there's lights and music,
and it's very exciting.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.620
And adults can do
it pretty well.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.730
Kids can do pretty well.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.800
If she changes the
rules so that it's not

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.270
the shape of the block, it's
two blocks, this radical change

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.790
in the rules, kids will
get it before adults

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.780
do because we are in these
narrow channels of behavior

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.440
and pattern.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.065
We're very good at
recognizing pattern,

00:29:57.065 --> 00:29:58.630
but then we get
stuck in pattern,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.510
and kids don't get
stuck in pattern.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.520
So she sees that
as a good analog

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.030
of psychedelic consciousness.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.110
That's fascinating.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.210
I want to ask you another
question about the challenge

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.790
of writing about the ineffable.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.280
So there's a wonderful
quotation in your book

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.020
that is "The mystical
journey seems

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:23.150
to offer a graduate education
in the obvious," which could

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.440
you say a little more
about what you mean?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.940
Yeah.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.880
I mean, in some ways, you
know that's the toughest part,

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.780
is that you have
profound epiphanies that

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.790
are completely banal and that
they belong on a Hallmark card.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.410
And the number of
people who have

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.890
had psychedelic experiences
where they discover that love

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.540
is the most important
thing in the universe--

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.030
Which is what you discovered.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.140
Which I did discover.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.100
And by the way, It's true.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.010
Can we just stipulate that?

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.960
But how do you write about it
in a way that isn't ridiculous?

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.300
And so I struggle with that.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.470
There's no irony in the
psychedelic experience

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.680
that I detected.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.700
I'm sure some people have
had ironic experiences.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.330
But yeah, that was a struggle.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.770
And so the way I dealt with
it finally-- it took me

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.260
a long time to figure
out how to do this--

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.210
and I wrote these
accounts right after,

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.560
and when I read them
over, I was like, ugh,

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.810
this is not going to work.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:29.600
But one of the
things I've learned

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.580
from reading a lot of memoir--

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.580
and this is something
I've talked to my students

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.880
about-- is that they really
get interesting when there's

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.770
kind of a double consciousness.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.500
When you're writing, you're
not just immersed back

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.010
in the four-year-old self or
the eight-year-old self telling

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.280
the whole narrative that way,
but you're kind of jumping back

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.380
and forth between
the adult perspective

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.280
and the kid's perspective,
and that that really gives--

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.900
James Baldwin does
this beautifully

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.510
in Notes Of a Native Son.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.530
And Orwell does it,
too, in his memoirs.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:10.410
And it gives a kind of tautness
or friction to the narrative.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:15.030
So I decided that when
I got to something

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.390
that was kind of
ridiculously banal,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:21.630
or that I knew my reader
was going to struggle with,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.910
I just acknowledged it
and I talked about it.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:24.870
And I said--

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.910
I kind of broke the
fourth wall and said,

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.640
I know how dumb this
sounds, or I know

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.890
how implausible this sounds.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:37.890
And so that the reader, I was
giving him or her something

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.500
to hold on to that I could see
it from their point of view,

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.870
even as I was seeing it
from my point of view.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.080
And so a lot of it is
going back and forth.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.465
And in some ways,
you could say I

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:50.130
didn't have the courage of my
convictions, which is probably

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.560
true.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.760
But I found that I could
talk about something

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:05.340
like the graduate education, the
obvious, in the midst of this,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.890
and say at the same time,
I know how it sounds.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.650
But isn't it also true?

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:14.190
And so there's a kind of a
doubling of the perspective.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.340
And I found when I did
that, it just freed me.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:25.290
And after I had kind of come
up with that approach-- and I

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:27.000
[INAUDIBLE] that many times.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.290
But for example, in describing
the tow trip, I'm very aware,

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.660
and I say, look, I'm going to
give you a couple of metaphors

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.260
because metaphors can help
us with ineffability, as you

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.360
were suggesting.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.970
They're not quite right.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.330
And I proceed to give them.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.530
One is I had the sensation
that I was strapped

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.380
to the outside of a rocket
that was taking off,

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.110
and this thing was
shuddering horribly,

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.650
and the G-forces were
pulling my face down,

00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:00.340
and we were rising through
the sky and through clouds.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.760
And then I said, it
was a little like that.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.500
That's all I could promise.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.210
And then I offered
another metaphor.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.289
And so I found metaphors
saved me, in many ways,

00:34:13.289 --> 00:34:14.580
even when they weren't perfect.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.010
And I was very
frank about the fact

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.960
this isn't exactly
what I felt, but this

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.250
is what I can give you.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.120
This is an analog.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.510
So in a way, yeah, being
straight with the reader

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.239
was helpful.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.730
And then after
that, I have to say

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.679
I had a really good time
writing these scenes.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.110
I probably had more
pleasure in the writing

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.100
than I've had in anything
I've ever written.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100
And that was a surprise.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.320
I really didn't expect that.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.520
Part of it was the freedom.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.429
I'm a journalist.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:45.550
I'm a nonfiction writer.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.130
I write in this tight box
of fact-checkable facts.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.480
And here I was describing the
contents of my imagination,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.310
and nobody could fact
check this stuff.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.800
So I felt more like I imagine--

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.900
I've never written
fiction-- but as I imagine

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.420
the novelist feels who
is describing a narrative

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.270
unfolding in his or her head.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:17.790
Also, all your descriptions
of your ego or your will,

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:25.860
like when you say my ego was
back in uniform and on patrol,

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.590
it so prepares the reader
for not kind of pulling back

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.850
from you when you suddenly
do surrender anything that

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.430
has to do with will or ego.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.350
Well, ego is a really important
term in this whole thing.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.770
And to me, that was the big
takeaway of the experience,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:50.640
is that you could lose
your ego and not die.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.320
You could lose
your ego and still

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.260
have a vantage, a presence.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.120
Anyway, that was my
biggest experience

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.490
was on this one
psilocybin trip, I

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:13.500
had an experience of looking out
at some point and seeing me--

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.010
and I know this isn't going
to make a lot of sense--

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:22.780
but kind of burst into a
little puff of post-it notes.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.610
But I was fine with it.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.090
So who was this I that was
fine with it, if that's me?

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:33.370
Well, I discuss actually
trying to explain well, there's

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.790
another first person
pronoun that we need

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.730
to understand this experience.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.430
But it turns out I'm
not identical to my ego,

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:48.040
and that I can acquire
this distance on it.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.830
And what that
perspective was, I don't

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.110
know, because it was
very different than me.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.940
It was very objective.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.180
It had complete equanimity
about what was happening.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.860
I think this is the
perspective Aldous Huxley would

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.190
have called the mind at large.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.340
He would believe
that at that moment,

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.880
he was acquiring a kind of
more transcendental perspective

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.850
that maybe belongs to the
universe, not to individuals.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.550
I don't know.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.430
I think the double
voice you have

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.190
in writing about it is
very important for a number

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.770
of reasons.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:26.410
One is I actually think
it stages or performs

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.640
disidentification with the
ego, or at least this kind

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.330
of toggling.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.890
I also think it's
a very generous way

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.950
to write because you didn't
lose the readers who had not

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.190
had this experience because
you always gave them back

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.270
their voice, which
is this, like, wow,

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.790
that sounds like a
Hallmark card or whatever.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.580
Well, I was honoring
their skepticism.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.080
Yeah.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.020
And we didn't talk
about the beginning,

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.370
but that is one
of the challenges.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:56.290
Unlike pain-- Elaine's
written brilliantly

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:00.430
about the ineffability of
pain, and I was comparing that

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:04.680
to psychedelic experience.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.870
We can all imagine pain.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.240
We've all been in pain.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.730
But I knew that there would
be a substantial portion,

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.040
or I hope there would
be a substantial portion

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.890
of my readers, who had not
had a psychedelic experience.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.840
And I didn't want
them to feel left out

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.795
or that I wasn't
writing to them.

00:38:25.795 --> 00:38:27.420
And that had been
something I'd noticed

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.520
in most of the literature
around psychedelics.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.470
It kind of assumed you
were in on the game,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.930
you were in the tent.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.250
And I didn't want to
do that, definitely.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:42.300
I thought that-- one of the
things that I noticed once when

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.420
I was trying to deal
with this problem--

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.180
as it happens, with
certain kinds of labor,

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.760
like coal mining--

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.020
is that if a
feature of something

00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:01.399
is that it's inexpressible, then
if you're able to express it,

00:39:01.399 --> 00:39:02.940
there's a certain
way in which you're

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.410
in danger of falsifying it.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.510
So let's say that--

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:11.707
and I was looking at the
example of coal mining.

00:39:11.707 --> 00:39:14.040
It happens that one of my
grandfathers was a coal miner.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.310
But I was looking at coal
mining in Zola's Germinal

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.220
and in Orwell's
Road to Wigan Pier.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.760
And if you say, well,
this phenomenon of labor

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.360
has these features,
A, B, C, D, and then

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.110
it has this other feature,
which is ineffability.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.320
And if you can get
to the ABCD, that's

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.480
great, except that
now you've falsified

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.880
this one because a
key feature of it

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.010
is that it's inexpressible.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.620
And the way that
Zola and Orwell solve

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.150
that is by very
carefully describing

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.990
the path towards which the thing
gets made, comes into being,

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.750
and the path away by
which it gets unmade.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.810
Literally incredible
descriptions

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:02.720
in Germinal of the long
drop down to the ground,

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.970
and long passage
through tunnels.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.140
And same with Orwell.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.860
And then much of the book is
structured on the getting out.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:16.440
But that's true of your
book, that you give us

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.170
the kind of passage
to approach it,

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.710
and then the kind of
coming away from it again,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.910
so that we're not only
getting the features of it

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.880
in-- very graphically
rendered images

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.540
that you haven't even begun
to describe here tonight--

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.440
but all of you, you
should read these,

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.290
these are amazing accounts.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:39.160
But you're also given this
very careful preparation,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.290
not only in the whole kind
of scientific neuroscience

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.870
and the work that's been
done with cancer patients

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:50.980
and people who are
addicted and so forth,

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.230
not only in your
claims that this

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.990
is the start of neuroscience
and the start of--

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.634
I think you actually even
start the Silicon Valley

00:40:59.634 --> 00:41:00.550
as coming out of this.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.690
I can't remember how
you pulled that one off.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.950
Think I oversold that?

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.250
Yeah, I thought that
was a little bit--

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.730
but then the actual
experiences are

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.940
like the jewel in the center.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:22.150
And if you haven't read this, he
interviews 15 spiritual guides

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.600
before he actually arrives
at the ones who are going

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.570
to be there to assist him.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:33.280
And those descriptions
of the rejected guides

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.042
are often quite hilarious.

00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:38.500
Well, they're people
you just don't

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.780
want to have a psychedelic
experience with.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.697
There's a lot of them.

00:41:41.697 --> 00:41:43.321
And the other thing
is that you realize

00:41:43.321 --> 00:41:45.100
that he's really afraid
he's going to die.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.475
You're really
afraid you're going

00:41:46.475 --> 00:41:51.650
to die because it can have
an effect on your heart.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.540
And so it is this
very dramatic thing.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.300
But this set of attributes that
are gradually coming into being

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.340
are preceded by this very
careful, carefully wrought

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.600
account of the progress of
approaching the thing, and then

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.610
the retreat from it.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.070
Well, in my writing
I really like

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:19.000
to approach whatever
is the center of it--

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.770
whether it's our
relationship to plants

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.640
or a psychedelic experience--

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.840
in a circular way.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.120
And let's look at
it scientifically,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.060
let's look at it historically,
let's look at it,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.130
I don't know, anthropologically,
let's look at it

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.450
therapeutically.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:37.330
And then there's
the personal, too.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:41.160
And no one perspective
is adequate.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.220
It's been a conviction in my
work for a very long time.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.170
Scientists don't always
have the last word.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:49.440
Sometimes the poets
get there first.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.630
But it's by multiplying
perspectives

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:57.540
that you begin to get a
richer portrait of it.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.990
And speaking of
multiplying perspectives,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.530
why don't we take this occasion
to open it up for questions.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.230
And we do want questions.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.040
I've talked with Michael
about his experience

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.800
in talking about his book.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.010
And there's many people in the
world who have had experience

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.840
with psychedelics,
and many of them

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.090
like to talk about
those experiences.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.050
And I'm sure they're
very, very interesting.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.030
But it would be
great if we could

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.350
if we could get questions.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.840
Be fantastic.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.390
Yes.

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.890
Please.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:34.990
And the mics are
coming down the aisles.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.540
And for anyone
who has difficulty

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.920
coming to a mic in an
aisle, there's also,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.180
I believe, a roving mic.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.250
It's not on.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.320
I think he's gone.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.510
Turning it on.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:56.243
There it is.

00:43:56.243 --> 00:43:57.210
OK.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.510
So are you still a materialist
in terms of consciousness?

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.720
And what actually shook your
faith, maybe, in materialism,

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.580
and how did you
approach it before you

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.930
got into this experience?

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.790
So I'm glad you brought
this up because I

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.370
left something hanging earlier.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.520
So this experience of ego
dissolution, which I really

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.460
think is central to the
psychedelic experience

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.412
when it works--

00:44:18.412 --> 00:44:19.620
and it doesn't always happen.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.710
For people to be willing to let
their ego completely dissolve,

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.400
they have to feel very safe.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.600
And that's why the choice
of guide is so important.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.670
But the change that
I underwent was I

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:44.160
went from thinking that the
opposite term for spiritual

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.440
was material.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.930
And I came to understand, after
having this period of time

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.870
where my ego was gone--

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.690
when your ego is gone,
your defenses are down.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.480
You feel emotion in
this powerful way,

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.460
and particularly
the emotion of love.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.210
You feel your place in nature
has completely changed.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.240
You no longer feel
you're a subject

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.340
and everything
else is an object.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.770
Actually, the subject
object duality

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:16.440
falls apart when
the ego falls apart.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.170
It's all objective or
all subjective, whatever.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.400
So this powerful connection.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.220
I had this sense of
being in my garden,

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.850
and the sense that consciousness
was spread very evenly over all

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.550
the species in the garden.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.500
I didn't have a monopoly
on consciousness.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.530
The plants had it, too.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.950
So it made me realize that it's
the ego that stands in the way

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.350
of spiritual experience,
and that for me--

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.950
and this is a very
non-supernatural definition

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:47.520
of it--

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.940
the opposite of
spiritual is egotistical.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.040
And it is the
walls that our egos

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.160
build that keeps us from feeling
our connection to nature, that

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.710
keeps us from feeling
love in its most

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.640
profound manifestation.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.250
So for me, that
was a big change.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:09.930
I kind of redefined
spirituality for myself.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.940
And yeah, that was the news.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.230
That was the news for me.

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.730
I know other people
come out of it

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.880
with the idea of
universal consciousness.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.500
And I've heard from
a lot of people

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.140
since the book came out that I
didn't take that idea seriously

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.160
enough, and that maybe
I should, and maybe I

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.780
should look into it.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.300
I still feel like
I am a materialist

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.710
about consciousness.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.240
But I also know
enough about this area

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.050
that we actually don't know that
brains produce consciousness.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.680
There's remarkably
little evidence of that.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.630
It seems to me the more
parsimonious theory,

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:54.440
but there are people who
make good arguments it's not.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.600
As the Dalai Lama said,
the idea that brains

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.140
produce consciousness is
an interesting hypothesis.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.850
But that's all it is so far.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.670
Well, at one point,
you report someone

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.530
as asking you how
confident you are

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:11.900
that God does or doesn't
exist, and you say,

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.180
well, 2% to 3% chance.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:14.910
Oh, yeah.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.041
No, that was about immortality.

00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:17.540
Yeah.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.700
And the person says to
you, but that's a lot.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.200
That's a high percentage.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.620
I was interviewing Roland
Griffith, who is really

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.800
the scientist at Hopkins who's
done the most to get this

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.780
started, the research started.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.530
And he's a very prominent drug
abuse researcher, actually.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.717
And he had a mystical experience
in his meditation practice,

00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:39.800
and that got him very
interested in altered states

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.680
of consciousness and got
him raising questions

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.810
about the nature
of consciousness.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.010
And when I was interviewing
him the first time,

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.260
it was the weirdest question
to hear from a scientist.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.759
I've interviewed
lots of scientists.

00:47:50.759 --> 00:47:53.430
And he'd said, so
what do you think

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.310
the chances are that anything
happens after you die?

00:47:56.310 --> 00:48:00.407
And I'm like, hmm, I
don't know, 2% or 3%?

00:48:00.407 --> 00:48:01.490
And he says, that's a lot.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:05.210
I guess it is a lot.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:08.660
I don't know where I came
up with that number, though.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:12.530
It may have been
journalistic tactic

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:14.450
because if I'd said
zero, given I knew

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.280
he was a spiritual
person, I would

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.720
have less connection with him.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.810
So I don't know if I
really believed it.

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.850
Maybe I'm being defensive now.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:23.497
Thanks.

00:48:23.497 --> 00:48:24.630
Hi.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:28.390
So I understand
and appreciate that

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.230
when you were having
indescribable experiences

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.800
[INAUDIBLE] to have
disclaimers to the audience

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.430
that this might not make sense.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.680
You might not understand this.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.620
Was there any part of doing that
that [INAUDIBLE] that you would

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.550
lose the readers whose
trust you had built

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.920
in either the writing or
[INAUDIBLE] works you had

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.530
leading up to it?

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.150
Were you afraid of
losing that trust?

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.540
Did you think about
what would happen if you

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.190
didn't make those disclaimers?

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.800
Yeah, I didn't think of
them in that context.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.630
I mean, I did have
a general awareness

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.000
that I'd written seven
books before this,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.430
and they were on very
different topics,

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:15.320
and would people who'd
read me on food and nature

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.960
and agriculture read me on this?

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.136
But I think you just
make that leap of faith.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.210
I mean, currying favors
with your readers

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:30.110
is a sure path to bad writing.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.770
So no, s was more
just any reader

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.020
who hadn't had
psychedelic experience.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:45.710
I wanted to honor their
skepticism because I shared it.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.980
You know, I didn't
know how much weight

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.210
to put on this experience.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.480
I didn't know how true it was.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.560
I still don't.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.510
There's so much
about the experiences

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.556
I have I'm still processing.

00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:00.680
It's kind of one of the
interesting things about it

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.220
is that you have powerful
visual images that

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.420
become almost these visual koans
that you just kind of turn over

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.967
in your head, and I still do.

00:50:09.967 --> 00:50:11.300
And I don't know what they mean.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.830
I don't know where
they came from.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.640
And so it really is
just the bringing

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.520
of my normal
journalistic skepticism

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.360
into this psychic space.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.460
So it wasn't just for
keeping the reader on board.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.950
I mean, yes, I'm always thinking
about that to some extent.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:36.640
But it really was because I
didn't emerge from the process

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.930
a convert in the way
that Huxley does.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.610
You know, Huxley I've said
really nice things about,

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.650
and he's a wonderful writer.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:49.820
But I find his account
a little credulous--

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.700
or not credulous.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.020
I think he had the experience
his philosophy prepared

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.760
him to have and then
he wanted to have,

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.310
and that he was illustrating
a kind of metaphysics that he

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:04.610
already had with the mind
at large and the idea

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:09.530
that there was a common core
of mysticism to all religions.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.660
There's a footnote in the
book where I compare him

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.210
to another account of
a mescaline experience

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:21.170
the same year, 1954, by
much less writer named

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.860
Henri Michaux, who wrote
a book about his psyche

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.630
his mescaline experience
called Miserable Miracle.

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:31.290
And Michaux, who's a
poet and an artist--

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:35.580
yeah, you can guess what
he thought about it.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.620
But his challenge
as a writer was I

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:44.060
am not going to distort this
experience with metaphor.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:50.370
I am not going to distort it
with even complete sentences.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.470
It was like my toad experience.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:56.600
This was such a chaotic,
inchoate experience

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.300
that I would be
doing violence to it

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.930
to render it in narrative,
to render it with metaphor.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:07.070
And so you have the
neat, elegant account

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.440
of Huxley on this
side, and you have

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.550
the absolutely unreadable,
crazy account of Michaux,

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.280
whose writing descends into
drawings at various points

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.725
because he just can't
figure out what to say.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.580
I definitely didn't want
to go down that path.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.120
But I respected it,
whereas I thought

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.730
that Huxley was being
a little bit glib,

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:36.300
and that his whole thing
just felt neat to me.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.610
So in a way, those were
my Scylla and Charybdis.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.370
I was trying to find a
path between those two

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.270
models, both of which
I had trouble with.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:47.020
Yeah.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:49.420
I'm curious if you've had
any psychedelic experiences

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.010
since writing the
book, or if you

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.070
feel like you've gotten
kind of all or most of what

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.210
you can get from
these experiences.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.710
Yeah.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.650
I have not had any
experiences since I

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.450
did the research for the book.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:04.150
A couple of reasons for that.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:08.660
Now I'm out publicly talking
about having broken the law

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.160
and don't want to
put myself at risk,

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.694
but more importantly, don't
want to put my guides at risk.

00:53:14.694 --> 00:53:16.360
We didn't talk about
the way I did this.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.770
But I was never alone.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.620
I was with people who
were very professional,

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.860
but taking these chances
with their freedom.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.140
And so if I were to work
with one of them again--

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.510
and I really
believe, by the way,

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:31.660
in having a guide when you're
doing a psychedelic experience.

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.180
If you want to have a
profound experience,

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.310
you don't want to
just be walking around

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:41.290
in the street or even in
the woods on your own.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:43.090
To have an experience
of ego dissolution,

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:48.530
you have to feel so safe and
in such reliable company.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.550
So anyway, so no.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.570
The answer isn't.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:56.210
If it were legal, I would
definitely do it again.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.580
I can totally imagine
a scenario where

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:02.470
I would do this every
year on my birthday,

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:06.140
that that would be kind of a
good way to use these tools,

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:12.260
and a stocktaking addressing
problems, connecting

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.650
with loved ones who have
died, all these kind of things

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:17.690
that happen.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:20.030
If we lived in a
different world--

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.070
and we may get
there, by the way.

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:27.280
We're closer to some form of
FDA approval of psilocybin

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.580
than you would guess.

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.310
It could be 2021.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:32.450
Pretty soon.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.580
So anyway, but thanks
for your question.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.870
No.

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:37.230
Yeah.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:41.970
You were introduced tonight as a
person who writes about nature.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.350
And the word was just
uttered without really

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:49.940
defining it, which is fine.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:54.200
But a lot of writers
and philosophers

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.050
have pointed out that
the concept of nature

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:01.880
is pretty problematic because
on the one hand, any experience

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.520
that a person in human society
has of nature is unavoidably

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.830
mediated by society.

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.540
But on the other
hand, human society

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.370
is itself just kind of
a natural phenomenon.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.430
So it's very difficult
to know where

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:29.060
to draw the line between what's
nature and what's not nature.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.280
And of course, you've
written a lot about how

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.600
the relationship between even
humans and plants, the plants

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.320
that we cultivate, is very,
I guess you would say,

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.430
dialectical.

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:48.440
So I would love to hear you
talk about how you define

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.590
that concept, how
you draw that line,

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:58.430
and also maybe even how both
your experiences as a writer

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.670
and your experiences
with psychedelics

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:07.680
has helped to inform your
understanding of that concept

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.619
and that distinction.

00:56:09.619 --> 00:56:11.160
I'm going to dwell
in the second half

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.800
of that because the first half
we don't have the time for.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.170
And I totally agree
with you that it's

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.810
a problematic conception,
and that we define it

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:23.770
in many different ways.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:25.810
The fact that we
define ourselves

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.360
out of nature so
often, routinely--

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.550
people who write
about nature often

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.920
think of humans as
standing apart from that.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.680
And that's, I think, a very
curious thing about us.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.960
I mean, we feel like we're in
nature but we're not in nature.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.930
So this is something
I've written about a lot.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.440
But in this sense, I'm using it
in terms of the other species

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.140
we share the world with and
our engagement with them,

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:56.300
and the fact that we co-evolve
with other species, and they--

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.020
as I wrote in about
in Botany of Desire--

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.410
their evolutionary
strategy, understanding

00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:06.970
that there's no
intention involved,

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.120
is often to gratify our desires.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.140
And our desires include
changing consciousness.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.150
And there are
certain species who

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:17.690
have engaged with
us on that level,

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:20.140
and the psilocybin mushroom
is definitely one of them.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:25.040
In terms of my own
attitudes toward nature,

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.560
they were affected
profoundly by the experience,

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.360
and specifically the kinds of
ideas that in Botany of Desire

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.230
were an intellectual conceit,
this idea that plants

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.770
manipulate us even as
we manipulate them,

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:46.950
that the corn plant
or the apple tree

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:49.000
is using us for
its own purposes,

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:56.440
or that the grasses have
evolved to get us to mow them,

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.900
which would seem to be
anti- the grass's interests.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.880
But in fact, the
main grass interest

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.130
is keeping the trees
from coming back.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:06.850
So we're actually doing their
bidding when we cut them down

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.190
to this size.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.440
So those kind of
like thinking our way

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.940
through the natural
world, and who's

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.481
in charge, and all
that kind of stuff

00:58:14.481 --> 00:58:16.960
has been something I
enjoy thinking about

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.460
and thought about a lot.

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.724
But in the midst of the
first psychedelic experience

00:58:21.724 --> 00:58:23.890
that I describe in the book,
which is the psilocybin

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.150
experience, unguided, that
took place in my garden,

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:32.800
I had all these intellectual
conceits became flesh.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.320
They became real.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.010
The plants really
were looking at me.

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.380
They were returning my gaze.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.470
And as I said, I had the
sense that consciousness

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:48.010
was spread very evenly
over the natural world.

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:53.200
They were totally benign
and wished me well, I felt.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:59.790
And I don't have to say I
know how crazy this sounds,

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.650
but what had been an
intellectual conceit became

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.330
a conviction, at least during
the time of the experience.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.390
And that goes to another
quality of mystical experience

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:12.750
that James talked about,
the noetic quality,

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:17.460
that there is this weird
authority that whatever

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.330
epiphany you have, whatever
insight or even opinion

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:23.160
you have, is not a mere opinion.

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.170
It's a revealed truth.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:30.060
And that's an amazing quality,
I think, of psychedelics.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.140
I don't understand it.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.050
It may flow from
the idea that you've

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.420
destroyed the usual
subject object

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:40.320
division so that
everything seems objective.

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.110
It's not just if there's
no thinking subject,

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:46.060
there can't just be
opinions or points of view.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.750
It just all is.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.980
But I don't really
understand how it happens.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.580
It's very valuable in
a therapeutic context

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:57.360
because you have addicts, for
example, who have an insight--

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.310
there was a smoking study
done that I described--

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:04.590
where they realized gee,
there's so many amazing things

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:05.790
to do and see in this world.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.550
I've just had this experience of
flying through western history,

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:12.450
I've sprouted wings, and I saw
my body rise from the Ganges.

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:17.340
And what a stupid thing to
smoke and shorten your life.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.620
And that banal insight--
there's another banal insight--

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.980
has the force of revealed
truth and allows that person

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.860
to never have another cigarette.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.720
That's so curious.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.420
So anyway, I had
that noetic quality

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.310
about these ideas in my
relationship to other species,

01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:39.050
and that was powerful.

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.720
Do I now think the
plants are gazing at me

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.100
when I walk through the garden?

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.920
No.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.570
But I also now question my
normal straight perception,

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.745
and that things
are hidden from us.

01:00:55.745 --> 01:01:01.130
As Huxley said, consciousness
is filtering out more

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:05.690
than it's letting
in, and that it just

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.490
allows us access
to what he called

01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.912
the measly trickle of
information we need to survive,

01:01:11.912 --> 01:01:14.120
and that there's a whole
lot of other things going on

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.845
that we don't see day to day.

01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:18.670
Yeah.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:19.190
This tall.

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.011
Sorry.

01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:20.510
Hi.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:25.152
So we talked a
little bit about--

01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:27.110
well, you talked about
your process in the book

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:28.776
a little bit about
how you were writing.

01:01:28.776 --> 01:01:30.380
And it's clear from
your other books,

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.980
too, that you write from
a place of vulnerability

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.960
to like invite your
readers to join you.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.020
And I was wondering,
because psychedelics

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:45.050
are such a vulnerable
experience, the theme of this

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:46.760
is writing the
ineffable, and I'm

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.730
wondering, for bare
bones process-wise,

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.340
how did this differ for you?

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.230
What was your process like
for writing this book compared

01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:57.410
to Botany of Desire or
Omnivore's Dilemma or even

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.570
your books on architecture?

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.240
Yeah, I don't know
that the process

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.510
was fundamentally different.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.200
I think what you're saying about
vulnerability is interesting.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.980
I like to write from a position
of naivete or ignorance.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.040
And almost everything
I've written,

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.140
if you read the first paragraph
or two, I'm kind of an idiot,

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.680
and I don't know things.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.290
And I realized I
really like writing

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.180
at the beginning of
the learning curve

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.490
rather than at the
end as an expert.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:30.190
And most of us, especially
most of us in academia,

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:33.010
we don't start writing until
we've got it all figured out.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.190
And we impersonate
the person who has

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.440
it all figured out on page one.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.740
And I've always found
that a bit of a turnoff.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:47.410
And I think the reader likes
to go on a journey with you

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:48.610
of learning.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:52.180
So this book, like
all my books, begins

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:56.080
in a state of ignorance,
relatively, and curiosity,

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.110
and that we're going to
learn all this together.

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:02.420
And I think that's generally
a good writing strategy.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.320
I think it's awkward for the
academic for various reasons

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.720
having to do with conventions,
and that that vulnerability

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.340
is not welcome in academia.

01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.980
But in general, it was similar.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.780
It was kind of like I'm going
to learn everything I can.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.310
I've got a file called science.

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:25.840
I've got a file called history.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.270
I've got a file called memoir.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.330
And I'm going to fill
those up, and then

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:32.950
figure out how to layer them.

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.060
The big difference is--

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.840
and this is maybe getting
a little too granular--

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.230
is that most of my
books, each chapter

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:44.980
has had the multiplication
of perspectives in it.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.440
So in Botany of Desire there's
a chapter on the apple,

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.330
and you learn about
Johnny Appleseed,

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:51.440
and you learn about the
biology of the apple tree

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.340
and my own experiences
and da da da da da.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.190
Here I couldn't do
that for some reason.

01:03:57.190 --> 01:04:01.030
There was the psychedelics,
and the experience

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:03.640
and the science of
it, and each chapter

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.130
had to be a different lens.

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:08.850
And I'm not sure
exactly why that was.

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.030
It was something about
the nature of the subject.

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:12.703
But it wasn't
fundamentally different.

01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:14.062
Thanks

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:16.131
Thanks.

01:04:16.131 --> 01:04:17.880
I really didn't want
to be the last person

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.610
to ask a question because
mine is quite [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.070
It's got to be
really good, right?

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.108
Oh, great.

01:04:24.108 --> 01:04:28.170
[INAUDIBLE] So yeah, I kind
of have a technical question.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.950
It's also about process.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.560
I'm curious about
your note taking,

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.670
the note-taking process,
how it's different

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:41.760
when you're trying
to write about being

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.450
on psychedelic drug versus when
you're writing about things

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:47.160
that are effable.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.880
Are you taking notes
while you're on the drug?

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.690
What does your notebook look
like at the end if you are?

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:58.430
If you're not, when do
you start taking notes?

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:04.440
And I guess, related
to that, too--

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.850
well, I'll just leave it there.

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:07.080
We want granular.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes, I know.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.510
I know

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.110
We're serious.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.467
So here's some grains for you.

01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:13.050
I guess just to add
on one more thing,

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:15.720
I'm curious if
there's a difference--

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.190
if you felt like you had a lot
more or less drafts that you

01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:24.030
had to write in order to get to
the final version compared to--

01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:24.917
Of the trips?

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:27.000
Yeah, compared to when
you're writing about things

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.810
that are effable.

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:30.390
Yeah.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.800
So I couldn't take notes
during the experience.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.170
It was just too--

01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:37.170
I did bring my computer
into one session,

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.960
and that was a huge mistake.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.820
I had wanted to
perform an experiment

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:45.490
that I'd heard about, which was
the rotating mask experiment.

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:47.940
There's this famous
experiment in psychology

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.760
of a mask that's convex on one
side and concave on the other,

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.682
and it rotates.

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.390
And something really
interesting happens.

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:58.200
As you begin to
perceive the back of it,

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.960
it pops out because the
brain will not allow

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.930
you to see a concave face.

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.520
Faces are convex.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.950
And it's an example of what's
called predictive coding,

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.690
the fact that most
of what we see

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:15.450
is a prediction rather
than literal sensory data.

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:19.230
And I'd heard that people on
psychedelics, it didn't happen.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:20.730
They could see the
back of the mask.

01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:22.563
And it's true of
schizophrenics, apparently.

01:06:22.563 --> 01:06:24.120
They can see the
back of the mask.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:32.889
So this very important brain
function, I wanted to test it.

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.680
And I thought I would
take some notes, too.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.010
The mere act of having
the computer in the room--

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:40.000
Leary famously talked
about set and setting,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.610
that the experiences is highly
vulnerable to your expectations

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:47.550
and the environment you're in.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.210
Half of this experience was
this horrible computer world,

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.640
where the graphics
of that mask became

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.950
the graphics I
experienced, and the music

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:01.800
summoned this video game
world that I hated and I

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.170
felt trapped in for hours.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:07.170
So I never brought my
computer into the room again.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:12.540
And I felt like to write
notes during the experience

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:18.180
would represent not
completely surrendering to it,

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.070
which all my guides
had said was really

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.830
the key to a
successful experience,

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:24.800
is not to fight
anything about it.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.300
If you see a monster, you're
supposed to step right up to it

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.160
and ask what it's
doing in your brain.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.630
If you see a staircase,
you're supposed to climb it.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:35.350
You know, John Lennon said it.

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:37.380
Relax your mind and
float downstream.

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.690
And taking notes
didn't go with that.

01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:43.800
So what I did instead was
I asked my guides to record

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.190
anything I said, and I would
try to say a few things to them,

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:56.130
which never was better than,
like, spectacular, or gnomic

01:07:56.130 --> 01:08:00.464
utterances like, I don't want to
be so stingy with my feelings.

01:08:00.464 --> 01:08:01.130
That was a note.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.340
So that wasn't that helpful.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.410
But what I did
do-- and actually,

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:10.290
what the guides, both
in the university

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:12.960
trials and the
underground experiences,

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.390
tell you is write a
journal right after.

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:18.250
So that night I did two things.

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:22.880
One was Judith debriefed
me over dinner,

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.430
and I said as much as I
could about the experience.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.930
And that was actually
really helpful

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.080
because she could connect
it to other things

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.560
and had various insights,
because what you're doing

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.020
is you're taking something
that's non-linear,

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.590
non-narrative, and you're trying
to turn it into a narrative.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.055
And you are doing
violence to it,

01:08:42.055 --> 01:08:44.430
in a way, because there's tons
of it that makes no sense,

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.770
and you're kind of
editing that out.

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:51.060
And then I would write this
long, loose journal that

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.640
would be like 15 single
spaced pages of everything

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.430
I could remember
about the experience.

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:58.750
And that became the
raw material later.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.260
But one of the things that's
striking about the experience

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.930
is you don't have
trouble remembering it.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.470
It's not like dreams, where you
feel that undertow pulling it

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.870
out of your conscious
awareness and you have

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:12.189
to fight it to preserve it.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:15.420
I've talked to people
who can vividly recall

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.010
trips they had 30 years ago.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.649
It's just stored in the memory
in a very different way.

01:09:20.649 --> 01:09:25.420
But anyway, I used these
journals, and that was the key.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.689
A couple more questions.

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:27.590
Yeah.

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.000
Thank you for being here.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.520
I'm a div school
alum, and so when

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.997
you talk about things
like the plants

01:09:33.997 --> 01:09:36.080
all having consciousness,
that doesn't sound crazy

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.970
at all to us, and
please come over

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:39.410
to our corner of the world.

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:42.649
I see a few other
div school folks.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:46.189
My question was how this
has influenced your thoughts

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:47.554
about what you'll write next.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.600
Frankly, it's made
what I'm going to do

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.660
next harder to think about.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.000
I've never had an
experience that affected me

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.220
in so many ways that was as
consuming as this one in terms

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:09.990
of occupying all my imagination
and whatever skills I have,

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:12.000
that when I think
of other topics,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.440
they seem kind of
small right now.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.550
I'm sure that'll change.

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:15.570
It takes me a while.

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:21.562
My agent had some idea for--

01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:23.020
I had lunch with
her the other day.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.500
She says, you need to
write a short, scary book

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.600
about food and climate change.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.220
And someone needs
to write that book.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.630
But it had no appeal to me.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.560
I'm much more interested in
continuing this exploration

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.790
of self and consciousness.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.960
I don't know where it goes.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.690
But one of the
things I learned is

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:45.670
that there are many
other ways to explore

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.980
this besides psychedelics,
meditation being

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.230
a very important one,
and meditation being

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:53.110
the way many people keep
their psychedelic experiences

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:55.190
alive for themselves.

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:59.980
There's a very interesting
progression from psychedelics

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:04.030
to Buddhism that many, many
Americans have followed,

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:05.350
and there's a logic to that.

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:08.380
And the brain networks are
affected in similar ways.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:11.620
So I'm kind of more interested
in that general area.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.095
But I have no idea.

01:11:13.095 --> 01:11:13.720
I have no idea.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.310
What I normally do between books
is write a couple articles,

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.110
and then one of
them turns out to be

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.650
a bottomless well of
stuff I have to learn,

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:25.390
and I realized
that's the next book.

01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:27.842
But I don't know what is yet.

01:11:27.842 --> 01:11:30.300
I will keep my eye on The New
Yorker and The New York Times

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.633
Magazine and look forward to it.

01:11:31.633 --> 01:11:32.310
Thank you.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:35.040
Thank you.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.290
Thanks very much for the book.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.290
I enjoyed it.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.850
We're at Harvard, and you
just mentioned Timothy Leary.

01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:45.710
And so I'd like to pursue
that a little bit more.

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:49.610
Those of us who were involved
in psychedelics way back

01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:53.450
then in the '60s, when Timothy
Leary was walking among us,

01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:55.340
believe that you
give everybody acid

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.970
and we'll have universal peace.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:02.180
And what you've described, and
what we're talking about here,

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.350
is a very individual,
very personal experience.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.800
But we're doing it in the
context of a center, which

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.380
I imagine is concerned
about the planet, concerned

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.550
about the environment.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:15.920
Is there potential
in psychedelics

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.100
for redressing, repairing
our relationship

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.600
with the environment as a
society beyond the individual?

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.210
I think that's a great question,
and a great question to end on.

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:31.750
You know, a lot of people who do
this research, even university

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:35.440
researchers,
psychopharmacologists

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.100
and pharmacologists, come out of
this work thinking this really

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.372
does have relevance
for our predicament.

01:12:41.372 --> 01:12:43.830
And they're a little nervous
about talking that way because

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.970
of Timothy Leary.

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:49.840
But many people emerge
from the experience

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.704
with that conviction, that it
has something to offer us now.

01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:55.120
And I don't think
it's an accident

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.240
that this revival of research
is happening right now.

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:03.180
There's two ways
to look at this.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:08.610
I do believe that, from
my own experience and also

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.410
from the research,
that the nature

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:14.820
of the psychedelic experience
has a very specific relevance

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.700
for what I see as the two
biggest problems that face us

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.530
as a civilization.

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:24.660
One is tribalism and the other
is the environmental crisis.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.230
And in this sense,
both are based

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:32.030
on the objectifying of
the other and of building

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:36.500
walls rather than
bridges, and that

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.100
the psychedelic experience,
because of the fact

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:44.900
that it can lead to this ego
dissolution and the opening

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.440
of these channels of connection,
this sense of connection

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.180
is the most powerful thing
that comes out of it.

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:56.320
Some of the researchers have
even sought to measure this,

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.520
and there is a
scale psychologists

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.940
have called nature
connectedness, where

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.140
they actually--

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:08.180
going back to your
question-- they assess,

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.130
through a
questionnaire, how much

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:14.440
do you feel you're in
nature or outside of nature?

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.320
And people's scales
change dramatically

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.230
after a psychedelic experience.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:25.540
And that doesn't surprise me
at all that that would happen.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.080
My guess is if you did a similar
scale for how tribal you feel,

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.910
how much you feel
that your group is

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:35.140
no different than the other--

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:37.480
because those two things are
growing from the same place

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:40.210
of objectification.

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:45.700
So if these drugs have the power
to address those two problems,

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:52.630
then you get to another
huge challenge which is,

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.000
how do you prescribe
a drug for a culture?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.560
You can't.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.510
I mean, Timothy
Leary tried to do it.

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:00.970
He would make
calculations on napkins

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:03.910
about how many Americans
he'd have to turn on

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.750
to change America, and
it was like 2.9 million,

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.490
or 1.9 million.

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.110
Well, that many
people were turned on

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:14.980
and everything didn't change.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.720
You're not going to
put it in the water.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.560
It's not like fluoride.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.980
So that's where you
run into trouble.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.530
And that was a
debate in the '50s.

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:31.210
The goal was, if these drugs did
have a positive social effect--

01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.800
and Huxley believed this, too.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.310
Many, many people believed
this during the '50s and '60s--

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:39.280
how do you spread those ideas?

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.640
Leary's theory was
turn on everybody.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.900
He was a Democrat.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.300
He was the populist
of psychedelics.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.870
Huxley and several other people
that he was affiliated with,

01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:53.170
researchers, were
terrified by this idea,

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.090
and they had a much
more Mandarin approach.

01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:57.820
You turn on the elite.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.020
And there were efforts
to turn on the elite.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:03.980
That's how it got into Silicon
Valley, artists, writers,

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:08.230
politicians, people
in the church.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.940
And there was a
deliberate effort--

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.290
I talk about it in the book--

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.450
to turn on these
people with the thought

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:15.340
that this new kind
of consciousness

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.320
would filter down.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.780
That didn't really work, either.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.850
But the possibility is there.

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:25.450
And we can all think
of an individual

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:30.430
who really would benefit
from a psychedelic trip.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:34.480
But it actually wouldn't
work because you really

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.890
have to want to have
your ego dissolved.

01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:43.030
And that's his
superpower, right?

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.100
Objectification of the other.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.235
So maybe you slip
it into his tea.

01:16:49.235 --> 01:16:51.110
But I don't think that's
going to work either

01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:54.940
because you really do have to
want what the experience is.

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.750
So that's the dilemma.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.160
That's the dilemma where we are.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.830
I think it's highly relevant
to the kinds of questions

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:03.120
we're facing.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.660
But exactly how you
get from here to there,

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.990
that's a tough one.

01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:12.610
My next book, Rx for America.

01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:15.380
I want to thank all
of you for coming.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.190
I know there were a lot of
things going on this evening,

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:20.630
and it's a very busy
time of the semester.

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.389
I want to thank Elaine for
coming as a conversant.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.430
I want to thank you, too,

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:26.110
And I want to thank
Michael as well

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:28.880
for his fantastic contribution.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.010
Thank you, Robin.

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:31.560
Thanks.
