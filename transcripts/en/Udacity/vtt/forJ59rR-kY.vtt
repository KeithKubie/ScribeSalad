00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, you may be wondering what can we learn from rolling balls down the hill.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I mean we all know what it looks like when a ball rolls down the hill right? Well, let's see.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This quiz is designed to just test your intuition, and I confessed I would not have passed this test

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
before I actually learned how to mathematically quantify motion.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, let's say we have a ball, and we released it,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and at the same instant that we released it we start the timer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, the timer begins at zero seconds and we release it at this position here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, after 1 second, it's rolled this far.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, given that we now have a ball that's released from rest here and after 1 second is here

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so I want to know where will the ball be at t = 2 seconds.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's gone from here to here in 1 second.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
After 2 seconds, do you think it will be here or here or maybe it will be all the way over here.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Make your guess by selecting the appropriate button.
