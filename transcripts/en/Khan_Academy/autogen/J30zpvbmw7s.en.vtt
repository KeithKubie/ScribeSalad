00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.048
 When considering glycolysis, 

00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:04.509
 the conversion of pyruvate 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.392
 in acetyl-CoA and then the Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle, 

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:12.639
 we saw that in some places we were directly receiving ATP, 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.213
 but we also reduce NAD to NAD. 

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.725
 We said NADN 

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.089
 can later be oxidized 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.915
 and the energy of oxidation, 

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.178
 which is released by the electrons, 

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.383
 can be used to create ATP. 

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.305
 NADN is the main character here, 

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.239
 but there are other enzymes that play a role. 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.741
 For example, coenzyme Q. You see it here. 

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:37.985
 In this video I want to talk about 

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:42.606
 the process we produce ATP 

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:46.477
 from the oxidation of these coenzymes. 

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:49.138
 This process is called 

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:51.959
 oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:55.893
 Oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:57.735
 As we have said, the main character, 

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:01.086
 when talking about cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation 

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:03.508
 is NAD. 

00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:08.151
 N, O is oxidized 

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.941
 to NAD. 

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.242
 Oxidising 

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:17.636
 to NAD, which is positively charged. 

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:21.079
 I often call it NAD +. 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.656
 If we look at this reaction from a point of view 

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.287
 the oxidation of NADH, 

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.587
 remember - oxidation is a loss of electrons, 

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:34.503
 we get + and then we have 

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.936
 hydrogen proton, 

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:40.559
 plus two electrons. 

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.996
 - 

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.059
 This happens when NAD 

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:48.234
 oxidized to NAD. 

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.131
 This is oxidation here. 

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.568
 I'll do it in another color. 

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:56.180
 This is the process of oxidation. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.466
 If these electrons meet the correct acceptor molecule, 

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.810
 a large amount of energy can be released. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.102
 For the ultimate acceptor molecule 

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:09.003
 of electrons this reaction will be a reduction. 

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.501
 I can show the corresponding reaction. 

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:17.366
 We have two electrons plus two hydrogen protons. 

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.553
 Or just two protons, the hydrogen nucleus 

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:21.535
 is a proton, it has no neutrons 

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:23.883
 in the main hydrogen isotope. 

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.852
 Two protons 

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:30.689
 plus half a molecule of oxygen. 

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:32.967
 When we collect all these three 

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.060
 things together, 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.916
 we will get a molecule of water. 

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.400
 We can assume that oxygen 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.120
 is the ultimate acceptor of electrons. 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.424
 Oxygen likes to oxidize 

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:46.693
 various things, 

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:49.008
 hence the name of the oxidation process. 

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.908
 And himself 

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.789
 oxygen likes to be reduced. 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.147
 He likes to take electrons. 

00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:58.738
 Therefore, oxygen is reduced. 

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:02.985
 Oxygen is reduced. 

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:06.404
 If we transfer these electrons 

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:09.357
 directly from NADH to oxygen, 

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:10.916
 a lot of energy will be released. 

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:12.142
 So much energy, 

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.505
 that we will not be able to catch most of it. 

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.766
 We will not be able to use it to do useful work. 

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.971
 That is why we have the process of oxidative phosphorylation, 

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:23.801
 in which the electrons are transferred to the oxygen in a sequence of steps. 

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.367
 The electronics pass 

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.721
 from one electron acceptor to another. 

00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:32.904
 At each pass, some energy is released. 

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.800
 In this way, energy separation is better controlled 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.729
 and can be used to perform a job. 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.065
 In this case, work is pumping hydrogen protons 

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:45.002
 through the membrane and the creation of a gradient, 

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.983
 which will be used to generate ATP. 

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:48.659
 Let's explain this a little in more detail. 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.221
 These electrons 

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:51.247
 will - 

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:52.544
 I will not go into the slightest detail, 

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.319
 I'll give you an overview of the process. 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.815
 The electronics will go through different scouts, 

00:03:57.815 --> 00:03:59.735
 will pass from one acceptor to another. 

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.456
 They can be moved 

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:05.798
 to coenzyme Q then pass 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.999
 to cytochrome C, continue to pass through different acceptors, 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.974
 until they finally reach this state here, 

00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:15.381
 they are accepted 

00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:18.590
 from oxygen 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.149
 and water is obtained. 

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.496
 At each step of this process, energy is emitted. 

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:27.677
 Energy is released 

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:30.451
 and as we shall see, it is used 

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:34.089
 for pumping hydrogen protons 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:37.441
 through the membrane. The resulting gradient will be used 

00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.174
 for production of ATP. 

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.194
 Let's think about it. 

00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:44.275
 Let's look closely 

00:04:44.275 --> 00:04:45.798
 mitochondria. 

00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:47.621
 It's a mitochondria. 

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.733
 I will paint his 

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:52.334
 inner membrane. 

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.770
 These are the folds of the inner membrane, 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.574
 one is called a crystals. 

00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:00.074
 If we talk about many of the folds, we are talking about critics. 

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:03.364
 We have these folds 

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:05.760
 in the inner membrane here. 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.815
 To make it clearer - 

00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:10.211
 this is the outer membrane. 

00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.632
 The outer membrane. 

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:15.483
 This is the inner membrane. 

00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:18.483
 The space between the outer and inner membranes, 

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:19.840
 this space here, 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.049
 is called intermembrane space. 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:25.947
 Intermembrane 

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.728
 space. 

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:34.414
 And the space between the inner membrane, 

00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:37.047
 - 

00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:41.414
 this space here is called a matrix. 

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:45.063
 This is the matrix, the place where it flows 

00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:48.062
 the citric acid cycle or the Krebs cycle. 

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.962
 I will mark it with this sign, 

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:52.952
 we have here the Krebs cycle. 

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:56.195
 And this is where most of the NADN is produced. 

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:58.738
 We also talked about some other coenzymes. 

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:01.677
 In some textbooks and hours you can hear FAD, 

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:06.055
 which is reduced to FADN2 

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.505
 during oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:11.407
 In other cases, it will be associated with an enzyme, 

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:14.737
 then FADN2 

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:19.352
 will be used to reduce coenzyme Q to QH2, 

00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:22.014
 which then participates in the oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.709
 It could be any of these two coenzymes. 

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:26.531
 I will focus on QN2. 

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:27.972
 Or better to stop at NADN, 

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.077
 because the process is similar. 

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:33.431
 FADN2 or QN2 participate on 

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.493
 later in the process. 

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:37.848
 They do not produce so much energy, 

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:41.285
 but can still be used for the production of ATP. 

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:44.621
 As we have said, the citric acid cycle, 

00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.713
 for which we have spoken in previous videos, 

00:06:47.713 --> 00:06:49.892
 flows into the matrix. 

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.183
 We will now look at it closer. 

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:56.662
 If we look at this part closely, 

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.185
 I will use this color to be visible. 

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:03.306
 Let's take a look here, 

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:06.765
 here is this crease from the inner membrane. 

00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:08.639
 Let's make clear, 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.833
 like any membrane, 

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.711
 it is a dual phospholipid layer. 

00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:17.414
 I will use the same color 

00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:20.293
 like this one 

00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:22.011
 of the chart. 

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.799
 We have 

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:30.258
 double layer of phospholipids. 

00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:33.879
 Obviously, my drawing is not in real scale. 

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:39.215
 Almost ready. 

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:42.233
 Another clarification. 

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:46.262
 We have enzymes, 

00:07:46.262 --> 00:07:49.443
 which pass through the phospholipid double layer. 

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:51.444
 These enzymes, 

00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:54.187
 these protein complexes help 

00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:56.125
 oxidative phosphorylation. 

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:59.475
 This sequence of enzymes, 

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:02.637
 this sequence of proteins is called 

00:08:02.637 --> 00:08:05.938
 electron transport chain. 

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:08.074
 I will draw it. 

00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:11.376
 Let's say it's a protein. 

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:14.811
 I'll draw them a little abstractly. 

00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:17.755
 We can accept the electron transport chain as 

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.695
 these proteins or as 

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.513
 the process by which the electrons move from one acceptor to another, 

00:08:21.513 --> 00:08:24.137
 to reach the ultimate acceptor - oxygen. 

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:26.215
 This may be a protein, 

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:29.984
 and this is another. 

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:30.932
 I will draw only a few, 

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:33.489
 this is a very quick review 

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:35.193
 of the process. 

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:39.818
 This is very simple 

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:42.135
 presentation. 

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:45.305
 Let's say that at first 

00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:47.929
 NAD is coming 

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:50.935
 - 

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:53.521
 and lends its protons and electrons, 

00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:56.319
 turning it into NAD +. 

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:58.896
 Oxidising. 

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.907
 These electrons are taken up by the acceptor molecule, 

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.946
 then passed on to another acceptor 

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:05.008
 and the next one. 

00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:07.332
 When passing electrons through the electron transport chain 

00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:09.022
 energy is released, 

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:13.606
 which is used to pump hydrogen protons from the matrix, 

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:15.951
 on this side, the left side here, 

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:17.663
 this is the matrix. 

00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:20.798
 Here goes the citric acid cycle. 

00:09:20.798 --> 00:09:23.730
 We have protons pumped out, 

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.179
 these protons are pumped out, 

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:28.850
 when releasing energy 

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.589
 of the electron transfer from one acceptor molecule 

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:33.819
 to another. 

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:36.406
 Electrons move from higher energy states 

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:39.180
 to lower, releasing energy 

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.892
 and moving towards ever more electronegative acceptors. 

00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:44.605
 They feel more comfortable with water, 

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:47.484
 than with NADH. 

00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:50.780
 When moving, the electrons 

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.232
 - 

00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:54.497
 pass 

00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:56.674
 from a higher energy system to a lower one. 

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:59.194
 We create this proton gradient, 

00:09:59.194 --> 00:10:01.271
 so the concentration of protons 

00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:03.477
 on the right side of the membrane-- 

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:05.020
 This is this country. 

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.138
 This space is here 

00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:10.240
 intermembrane space, 

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.593
 where the concentration of water protons increases. 

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:17.810
 Here we have a reserve of energy, as it represents 

00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:20.490
 electrochemical gradient. All these positive charges 

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.680
 are repelled, 

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.234
 want to get to the less positive matrix here. 

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.005
 Furthermore, because here we have a higher concentration of hydrogen protons, 

00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:29.362
 we will also have diffusion. 

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.684
 Protons will want to move in the direction of their concentration gradient 

00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:32.621
 to the matrix. 

00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:34.699
 There are fewer protons there. 

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:37.741
 There are fewer protons in the matrix, 

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.189
 than 

00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:43.036
 in the intermembrane space. 

00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:47.181
 This is the cell's ability to use this energy, 

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.364
 to produce ATP. 

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:52.189
 To see how this happens, 

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:54.149
 I'll draw some more of the membrane 

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.167
 in another color. 

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:59.011
 In that part of the membrane 

00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:02.611
 we have a protein, 

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:05.224
 called ATP synthase. 

00:11:05.224 --> 00:11:08.913
 ATP synthase is actually a protein complex. 

00:11:08.913 --> 00:11:11.509
 It functions as an enzyme 

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:13.883
 and passes through the membrane. 

00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:16.339
 It is a remarkable molecule. 

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.720
 I will make a clearer chart after a while. 

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.418
 We can see that ATP synthase passes through the membrane. 

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:23.969
 Its mechanical structure is very important. 

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:25.698
 We have a dent 

00:11:25.698 --> 00:11:29.016
 and an axis located therein. 

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:31.867
 It seems like that. 

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:32.903
 You can imagine, 

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:34.988
 that part 

00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:36.888
 keeps everything together. 

00:11:36.888 --> 00:11:38.220
 The enzyme passes through the membrane. 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.017
 I'll show you a better chart. 

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:44.313
 The membrane continues and from now on, of course. 

00:11:44.313 --> 00:11:47.924
 The membrane continues. 

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:49.794
 The important thing is that hydrogen protons 

00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:52.413
 can move in the direction of their concentration gradient 

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:54.706
 via the ATP synthase. 

00:11:54.706 --> 00:11:57.388
 They can stop the axle from rotating. 

00:11:57.388 --> 00:11:59.020
 I will draw it like that. 

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.141
 They make the axle spin, 

00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:05.157
 moving in the direction 

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.141
 of its electrochemical gradient. 

00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:10.537
 This axis rotates, but it is not smooth. 

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:11.997
 Not made of metal, 

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.254
 but from amino acids, 

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:17.246
 will be rugged. 

00:12:17.246 --> 00:12:18.918
 It seems like that. 

00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:21.657
 Thanks to this APPL 

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:23.452
 can be retained here. 

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:26.865
 Let's say this is ADP and then we have a phosphate group. 

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.422
 In fact, there are three different places to which 

00:12:28.422 --> 00:12:29.943
 this can happen. 

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:32.569
 This is ADP, and this is a phosphate group. 

00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:34.305
 There is another place, but I will not paint it. 

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:36.099
 When this turns, 

00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:38.673
 the conformation of the protein is changing 

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:41.244
 and the phosphate group is pushed into the ADP, 

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:43.289
 but energy is needed to get stuck 

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:44.444
 and to form ATP. 

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:45.804
 When forming ATP, 

00:12:45.804 --> 00:12:49.579
 are no longer attached to the active center 

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:50.879
 and are released. 

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.686
 So we have 

00:12:52.686 --> 00:12:54.172
 this mechanical motor. 

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:56.384
 We can treat it as a water turbine. 

00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:58.226
 The water passes through it and its energy 

00:12:58.226 --> 00:12:59.610
 is used to generate electricity. 

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.592
 Here the hydrogen protons pass 

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:03.063
 in the direction of its concentration gradient, 

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:06.645
 the internal movement they cause helps the meeting 

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:09.356
 of the phosphate groups and the ADP molecules in which ATP is formed. 

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:12.455
 This is the way ATP is produced. 

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:15.760
 I'll show another visualization 

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.579
 of the ongoing processes, 

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:17.876
 to better understand what's going on in your body at this point. 

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:18.789
 These processes take place in your body, 

00:13:18.789 --> 00:13:19.899
 otherwise we would not be able to talk. 

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.842
 This is the way we produce energy. 

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:26.233
 Here we have a more accurate image 

00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:29.355
 of the ATP synthase. 

00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:31.979
 Let's do some extra 

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.260
 the inscriptions on this chart. 

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:36.763
 - 

00:13:36.763 --> 00:13:39.006
 - 

00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:45.522
 It is hard to paint on it. 

00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:47.026
 Let's see. 

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.110
 This part here, 

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.061
 this area is 

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:55.371
 intermembrane space. 

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:58.187
 This is it 

00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.646
 the matrix. 

00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:04.692
 This membrane is a dual phospholipid layer. 

00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:08.799
 I can draw the double layer of phospholipids 

00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:10.574
 right here. 

00:14:10.574 --> 00:14:11.644
 This is the inner membrane 

00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:13.439
 or fold the inner membrane, 

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:15.842
 this is a crystal. 

00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:18.338
 Hydrogen protons accumulate 

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:21.089
 in the intermembrane space, 

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:23.348
 thanks to the electron transport chain. 

00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:24.929
 So now they can pass 

00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:28.452
 in the direction of its electrochemical gradient. 

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:29.767
 This rotates the rotor, 

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:32.710
 causing the production of ATP. 

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.419
 We have ADP 

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:38.311
 plus a phosphate group, 

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.592
 what ATP gives us. 

00:14:41.592 --> 00:14:42.894
 It is unbelievable that all this 

00:14:42.894 --> 00:14:44.537
 it flows in your cells, 

00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:45.886
 while we talk. 

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.200
 This is not an abstract process, torn apart 

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.437
 from reality. 

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.438
 In fact, this process makes reality possible. 

00:14:52.438 --> 00:14:54.429
 I hope you appreciate it all better now. 

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:55.870
 We spent a lot of time 

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.495
 in talks about cell breathing. 

00:14:57.495 --> 00:14:59.090
 We talked a lot about ATF production. 

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.282
 We can produce ATF directly 

00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:04.770
 by glycolysis, 

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.489
 but most energy 

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.404
 comes from the reduction of these coenzymes 

00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:10.930
 especially by reducing NAD to NAD 

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.573
 and thanks to oxidative phosphorylation 

00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:15.163
 and the electron transport chain. 

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:19.304
 We use the oxidation of NADH, 

00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:22.874
 to pump protons from the matrix 

00:15:22.874 --> 00:15:24.429
 to the intermembrane space. 

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:26.211
 Then these protons return to the matrix 

00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:29.203
 via the ATP synthase, which 

00:15:29.203 --> 00:15:31.941
 attaches phosphate groups to the ADP to obtain an ATP. 

00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.153
 ATP is the biological currency for energy.
