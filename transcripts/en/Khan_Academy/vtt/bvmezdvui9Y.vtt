00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:01.871
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.871 --> 00:00:04.409
is talk about the broad
categories of where the

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.488
federal government gets
its revenue, and also the

00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:11.082
broad categories of where
it spends its revenue.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:13.919
Now when we talk about revenue
for the federal government

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.969
that primarily comes in the form of taxes.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.747
And what we see in this
visual, it shows the four

00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:23.436
basic types of taxes that the
federal government collects.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.930
You have individual income
taxes, which you are

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.202
probably familiar with.

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.499
If you ever get a pay
stub, and if you thought

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.076
you were making, let's say,
$1,000 in a pay period,

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.368
you might see your
paycheck is closer to $600

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:40.165
because there might be individual
income taxes taken out,

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.095
and both the federal and the state level.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.205
Then you have payroll
taxes, and unless you are

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:48.587
an employer, you might not be
familiar with payroll taxes.

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:51.593
Above and beyond your
individual income taxes,

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.819
your employer also pays
taxes called payroll taxes.

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.141
Now these are primarily
to pay for things like

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.995
Social Security, Medicare,
unemployment insurance,

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.609
and some of you are saying
well don't they take that

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.198
out of my individual
income taxes, as well?

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:09.297
And the answer is yes, but
above and beyond what is

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:12.355
individually paid by you, they also take

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:14.326
payroll taxes to fund that.

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:18.419
Corporate taxes are taxes
on corporations' profits,

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:20.531
and excise taxes, which
you don't hear folks talk

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.009
a lot about these days, but
these are taxes on things

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.272
like gasoline, or alcohol and
tobacco, or airline tickets

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:30.518
that are usually baked
into those products,

00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:33.977
and those taxes can oftentimes
go to the federal government.

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:35.758
Now pause this video and see if you

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:37.608
see any interesting trends.

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:41.127
This visual here shows the
breakdown between these four

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:44.026
taxes for the federal
government's revenue and how

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:47.609
it's changed from 1950
all the way to 2015.

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:52.455
Well it looks like
individual income taxes,

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.275
as a percent of total government revenue,

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:57.162
has stayed roughly stable.

00:01:57.162 --> 00:02:00.570
But what you see is that
payroll taxes have grown

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.939
dramatically while
corporate taxes have shrunk.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.751
Payroll taxes have gone from
11% of the federal government's

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:12.163
revenue in 1950 to nearly 1/3
of the federal government's

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:14.299
revenue in 2015.

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.469
Corporate taxes have gone down from 26.5%

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.184
all the way down to 10.6%,
and excise taxes are a

00:02:21.184 --> 00:02:22.600
very small percentage.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.757
They used to be a significant
part, but they are now

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:27.799
a very small part of
total government revenue.

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.936
Now one thing to keep in
mind, this visual over here

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:32.990
just shows the breakdown.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.008
It's not showing the absolute level.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.350
If you were seeing the absolute
level of government revenue

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.517
you would see that grow as
the nation's GDP grew as well.

00:02:44.332 --> 00:02:48.965
But in big categories, where
does that revenue get spent?

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:51.398
Well this is a similar diagram
that shows the breakdown

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:56.211
of outlays by the federal
government from 1962 all the way,

00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.681
and these are going into
projected outlays, to 2020.

00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.606
At the time of this video,
we are right over here

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:06.512
in 2017, and this chart was made in 2016,

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:08.756
so it was made at around this time.

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:11.578
But you see a couple of big categories.

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:14.378
You first see the mandatory outlays,

00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:16.706
and in parentheses it says on autopilot.

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:17.727
What does that mean?

00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:20.410
Well these are commitments
that the federal government

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.553
has already made by law to people.

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:25.698
These are things like entitlements,

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:28.544
like Social Security, like Medicare.

00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:32.704
And one interesting trend
is these have grown in 1962

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:37.250
from 25% of the total federal
budget, to a projected

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.818
almost 2/3 of the federal budget in 2020.

00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:45.096
Now the discretionary
outlays are things that,

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.995
when we talk about the
appropriations committees

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:50.259
in the Senate, or the
House, this is what they're

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.596
debating where to spend the money.

00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:54.859
And even though it might
sound something that's just

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.920
nice to have, there's some
pretty important things

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.312
in the discretionary budget.

00:03:58.312 --> 00:04:01.179
Things like military
expenditure, and as you can see,

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.263
the discretionary budget
has gone from over 2/3

00:04:04.263 --> 00:04:08.430
of federal outlays, to a little
under 1/4 projected in 2020.

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:13.660
And then this top category,
net interest, well the federal

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.810
government has a debt,
and anyone who has a debt

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.066
tends to pay interest on that debt.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.707
So many people will often
categorize this as a

00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:24.661
mandatory outlay as well,
because we need to pay

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.613
the interest on that debt,
even though it's not officially

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:29.818
a mandatory outlay.

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:34.066
And to see how significant
these entitlement programs are,

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:37.151
and how big of an impact
they have, not just on the

00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.741
federal government's
budget, but as a percentage

00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:44.079
of GDP, we have this
visual right over here.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:46.732
Once again, this is projecting
well into the future.

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:51.286
This chart was created in
2016, so right about here,

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:54.787
but you can see that
these mandatory outlays,

00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:59.103
as a percentage of the GDP
here, so this is not just

00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:01.381
as a percentage of the
budget, they are growing,

00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:04.043
and growing, and growing, and
expected to keep on growing

00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:07.430
while total revenue as a percentage of GDP

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.134
is expected to stay flat.

00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:11.066
And take all of this with a grain of salt.

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:13.829
This is based on
assumptions made at the time

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:15.721
when this diagram was made.

00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:18.426
If we have varying levels
of economic growth,

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:21.179
or the tax policies
change, it's possible that

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.307
the total revenue as a
percentage of GDP might change.

00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:28.183
Also, if there are changes
to some of these entitlement

00:05:28.183 --> 00:05:31.440
programs, like Social Security,
or the health care programs,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.075
or if some of the cost
assumptions baked into this

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:37.007
chart changes, well, then
this diagram might change.

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.719
But if you assume the
data in this visual here,

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.558
and the source is the White House in 2016,

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:45.150
you see that the mandatory
outlays from these

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.250
entitlement programs,
and the net interest,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.857
which is also essentially
mandatory, these are going

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:52.641
to take up all of the revenue

00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:54.864
that the federal government collects.

00:05:54.864 --> 00:05:57.054
And so if the federal
government wants to do anything

00:05:57.054 --> 00:06:01.012
above and beyond those things,
discretionary spending,

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:02.838
and once again, some of
this discretionary spending

00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:05.111
is pretty important, like the military,

00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:08.282
well, then they would
have to run a deficit

00:06:08.282 --> 00:06:11.173
in those years to fund
those things, or they would

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:13.380
have to increase the total revenue.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.370
And the thing is, even once
we get past this point,

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.906
go into the 2040's all
the way to the 2050's,

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:21.072
it gets worse, and worse, and worse.

00:06:21.072 --> 00:06:22.963
So something has got to give here.
