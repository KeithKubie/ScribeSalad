the time travel is a new idea we're so
we're so familiar with it we grow up

we're so familiar with it we grow up
 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.760
we're so familiar with it we grow up
with time travel we have time travel in

first time people thought there could be
 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.750
first time people thought there could be
such a thing as a time machine and

such a thing as a time machine and
 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.639
such a thing as a time machine and
that's that just struck me as weird

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649
that's that just struck me as weird
 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.340
that's that just struck me as weird

we have such an expansive sense of
 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.219
we have such an expansive sense of
time-travel ourselves and we're

see that for example when the Greeks

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840
see that for example when the Greeks
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.070
see that for example when the Greeks
imagined going down to the land of the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080
imagined going down to the land of the
 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.050
imagined going down to the land of the
dead going to Hades and crossing the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
dead going to Hades and crossing the

river Styx
and meeting their dead ancestors that's

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500
and meeting their dead ancestors that's
 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.490
and meeting their dead ancestors that's
a kind of time travel we might say or

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500
a kind of time travel we might say or
 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.880
a kind of time travel we might say or
anyway if you're a sci-fi geek you might

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890
anyway if you're a sci-fi geek you might
 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.980
anyway if you're a sci-fi geek you might
be thinking of you know racking your

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
be thinking of you know racking your
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.170
be thinking of you know racking your
brain trying to think of of predecessors

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180
brain trying to think of of predecessors
 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.850
brain trying to think of of predecessors
and there are things there are sort of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860
and there are things there are sort of
 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.980
and there are things there are sort of
weird things that if you're a geek you

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990
weird things that if you're a geek you
 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.140
weird things that if you're a geek you
can find but it's a it's the truth that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150
can find but it's a it's the truth that
 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.220
can find but it's a it's the truth that
before the late Victorian era it was

before the late Victorian era it was
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.830
before the late Victorian era it was
practically impossible for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
practically impossible for
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.949
practically impossible for
people to conceive of time travel and I

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
people to conceive of time travel and I
 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.890
people to conceive of time travel and I
say it was impossible because they

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900
say it was impossible because they
 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.509
say it was impossible because they
didn't so it raises two questions - you

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519
didn't so it raises two questions - you
 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.130
didn't so it raises two questions - you
know mirror-image questions why not

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
know mirror-image questions why not
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.290
know mirror-image questions why not
before why did what was it that made

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
before why did what was it that made
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.509
before why did what was it that made
this not a natural way to think about

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519
this not a natural way to think about
 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.309
this not a natural way to think about
things and then the other question is

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
things and then the other question is
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.400
things and then the other question is
why now you know was there something

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410
why now you know was there something
 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.420
why now you know was there something
that it is HG Wells kind of an odd just

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
that it is HG Wells kind of an odd just
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.509
that it is HG Wells kind of an odd just
an oddball a one-and-one in a millennium

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519
an oddball a one-and-one in a millennium
 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.640
an oddball a one-and-one in a millennium
quirk or was there something in the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
quirk or was there something in the
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.350
quirk or was there something in the
culture though is there something about

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
culture though is there something about
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.330
culture though is there something about
the times that made time-travel an

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
the times that made time-travel an
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.600
the times that made time-travel an
interesting or natural or plausible idea

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
interesting or natural or plausible idea
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.160
interesting or natural or plausible idea
and of course it's I think it's the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170
and of course it's I think it's the
 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.069
and of course it's I think it's the
second thing and that's the print the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
second thing and that's the print the
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.199
second thing and that's the print the
point of my book is to investigate these

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209
point of my book is to investigate these
 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.940
point of my book is to investigate these
questions or at least this I should say

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
questions or at least this I should say
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.339
questions or at least this I should say
the starting point of the book is to

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349
the starting point of the book is to
 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.160
the starting point of the book is to
investigate these questions one sort of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170
investigate these questions one sort of
 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.640
investigate these questions one sort of
basic thing to say about why it wasn't a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650
basic thing to say about why it wasn't a
 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.050
basic thing to say about why it wasn't a
natural idea is imagine imagine yourself

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
natural idea is imagine imagine yourself
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.300
natural idea is imagine imagine yourself

do you think life is going to be like
for your grandchildren you would say

for your grandchildren you would say
 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.809
for your grandchildren you would say
what do you mean that question doesn't

what do you mean that question doesn't
 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.190
what do you mean that question doesn't
that question doesn't make any sense

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
that question doesn't make any sense

that question doesn't make any sense
life is going to be the same for my

technological progress is kind of
 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.900
technological progress is kind of
inevitable that we are on a on a

that start to change during the

what what was happening there was a kind
 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:59.179
what what was happening there was a kind

people were thinking about time part of

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569
people were thinking about time part of

it had to do with discovery of geology

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819
it had to do with discovery of geology
 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.009
it had to do with discovery of geology
people were digging in the earth and

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:10.019
people were digging in the earth and
 

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:13.179
people were digging in the earth and
looking at buried layers since and and

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:13.189
looking at buried layers since and and
 

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:15.229
looking at buried layers since and and
understanding for the first time that

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:15.239
understanding for the first time that
 

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.279
understanding for the first time that
these layers of different kinds of rock

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289
these layers of different kinds of rock
 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:23.059
these layers of different kinds of rock
sedimentary volcanic rock were a kind of

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069
sedimentary volcanic rock were a kind of
 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.999
sedimentary volcanic rock were a kind of
diagram of the Earth's history and at

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009
diagram of the Earth's history and at
 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.379
diagram of the Earth's history and at
the same time Darwin had had arrived and

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:30.389
the same time Darwin had had arrived and
 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:32.689
the same time Darwin had had arrived and
spoken and people were understanding

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699
spoken and people were understanding
 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.759
spoken and people were understanding
something for the first time about the

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:34.769
something for the first time about the
 

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:40.099
something for the first time about the
history of life on Earth and and the way

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:40.109
history of life on Earth and and the way
 

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:41.539
history of life on Earth and and the way
the history of life on earth could be

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:41.549
the history of life on earth could be
 

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:45.019
the history of life on earth could be
visualized and explored again through

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:45.029
visualized and explored again through
 

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:49.029
visualized and explored again through
buried layers so there's a kind of

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039
buried layers so there's a kind of
 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.069
buried layers so there's a kind of
spatial metaphor for time you can look

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:52.079
spatial metaphor for time you can look
 

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:54.919
spatial metaphor for time you can look
at the earth and archaeologists were

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:54.929
at the earth and archaeologists were
 

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:58.369
at the earth and archaeologists were
digging things up and realizing that

00:07:58.369 --> 00:07:58.379
digging things up and realizing that
 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.549
digging things up and realizing that
this is a kind of record and you can

00:08:01.549 --> 00:08:01.559
this is a kind of record and you can
 

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:05.839
this is a kind of record and you can
think of time as something extending

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:05.849
think of time as something extending
 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:08.179
think of time as something extending
deep into the earth for example I mean

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:08.189
deep into the earth for example I mean
 

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:09.409
deep into the earth for example I mean
there were a lot of new ways of looking

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419
there were a lot of new ways of looking
 

00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.289
there were a lot of new ways of looking
at time here's another example it comes

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:12.299
at time here's another example it comes
 

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:15.019
at time here's another example it comes
along with instrumentation for thinking

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:15.029
along with instrumentation for thinking
 

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.359
along with instrumentation for thinking
about the weather you have a barometer

00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:17.369
about the weather you have a barometer
 

00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:21.019
about the weather you have a barometer
and and it makes a graph of the air

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:21.029
and and it makes a graph of the air
 

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:23.359
and and it makes a graph of the air
pressure over time and so the needle

00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:23.369
pressure over time and so the needle
 

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.739
pressure over time and so the needle
goes up and down and you look at this

00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:24.749
goes up and down and you look at this
 

00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:27.589
goes up and down and you look at this
graph on a paper and one of the

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599
graph on a paper and one of the
 

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:31.269
graph on a paper and one of the
dimensions on the paper represents time

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:31.279
dimensions on the paper represents time
 

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:34.669
dimensions on the paper represents time
and that wasn't a totally new idea in

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:34.679
and that wasn't a totally new idea in
 

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.069
and that wasn't a totally new idea in
the 19th century Descartes did that and

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:37.079
the 19th century Descartes did that and
 

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.769
the 19th century Descartes did that and
Newton did it they graphed time against

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779
Newton did it they graphed time against
 

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:43.879
Newton did it they graphed time against
space as a dimension but so there's

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:43.889
space as a dimension but so there's
 

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:45.829
space as a dimension but so there's
something that also was coming into

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839
something that also was coming into
 

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:49.999
