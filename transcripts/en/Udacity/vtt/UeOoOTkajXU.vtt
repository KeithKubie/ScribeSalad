00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.009
X equals 1/3.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.870
We need another step in order
to be able to solve this, and

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.880
I'll just added over here.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.830
If necessary, because of parentheses,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.880
distribute anything that's multiplied
to the terms inside the parentheses.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.780
And next you should combine like terms.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.030
So, let's use this complete
process to solve for X here.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.570
There are no fractions to clear, so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.970
we can skip this first step; but
the next step we have to do,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.930
we have to distribute the 3 to
the terms inside the parentheses.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.880
So, 3 needs to be multiplied by X and
by 1.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.890
And when we do that, we got 7 plus
3 times x minus 3 times 1 equals 5.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.580
And we're left with 7 + 3x- 3 = 5.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.470
Let's combine like terms.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.748
7 and 3 are like terms.

00:00:51.748 --> 00:00:54.070
7- 3 = 4.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.756
So, 4 + 3x = 5.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:03.460
Now, we can add or
subtract to get the variable term alone.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.832
We want to subtract 4
from both sides and

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:12.310
we get 0 + 3x = 5- 4.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.412
So, 3x = 1.

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:21.800
Now we multiply or divide, so
the coefficient on the variable is 1.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.296
So, we divide by 3 on both sides.

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:30.041
And x = 1/3.
