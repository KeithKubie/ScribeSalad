ALEXANDER MEYER: So
I am Alexander Meyer.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.760
I'm here thanks to Kate
Clugston, who invited me.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.972
She's wonderful.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.180
And I'm very glad to be here.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.880
This is actually my second
trip to the New York Google

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.360
offices, which is very exciting.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.410
It feels slightly familiar now.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.180
But I am from the University
of Western Ontario, AKA Western

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.810
University, depending
on who you ask.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.268
There's a whole
marketing kerfuffle

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:22.320
that we could talk
about at some point.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.370
And of course, here I'm at
Google, and it is May 6, 2015.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.900
And we will come to talk
much more about the fact--

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.350
can we call it a
fact-- that it is

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.585
May 6, 2015 in just a minute as
we talk about time and culture

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:38.710
in ancient Greece and Rome.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.770
And just a little bit
about me because this stuff

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.815
becomes relevant as I talk about
what I'm going to talk about.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:46.880
I am an ancient historian,
specifically a Roman historian.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.390
And my specialty
is Latin epigraphy.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.020
So I spend most of my time
going through old books which

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.655
have then lists of inscriptions
from the Roman world.

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:57.780
Most of these are in Latin.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.571
Some of them that I
read are also in Greek.

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.577
And we'll talk about a couple
Greek inscriptions today.

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:04.160
And they are on all
sorts of material,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.030
from-- largely on stone,
also on bronze, on wood,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.790
and on little pieces of copper,
all sorts of stuff that we

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.290
can find.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.165
And I'm basically
interested in anything that

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:14.860
has writing on it more or less.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.280
And I use this type of
evidence specifically

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.040
to think about issues of
identity in the ancient world.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.230
I'm particularly
interested in the ways

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.189
that different cultural groups,
however we define them--

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.980
whether we think about
terms like ethnicity

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.510
or geography or anything
else that you can think

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.700
of that might divide groups.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.924
Race is something that I
think a fair amount about.

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:36.840
I'm interested in these
things and how they're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.060
expressed in the
ancient world and how

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.994
that might affect our
understanding of them

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:41.160
in the modern world as well.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.350
And we'll return to the
modern world momentarily

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.060
now and then at the end as well.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.260
And I'm interested in a
few other issues as well.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.343
One of these is travel,
and that's of course a way

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.280
that different groups around the
Roman world and the Greek world

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.620
and the ancient world in general
interacted with each other.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.069
And I'm also interested
in maps and geography,

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.860
so the way that people
perceived the world.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.150
And this got me interested
long ago in perceptions of time

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.169
as well and the ways in which
we can see in the ancient world

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.020
people's perception of time.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.117
And some of this comes through
with calendars specifically,

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.450
which is the stuff I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.070
And we can see by
looking at calendars

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.130
from the ancient world,
strangely enough,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.900
a lot of the ways that people
interact with each other.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.304
And we can actually
even start doing this

00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:25.720
by thinking about
the modern world

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.850
as well, as we think about
the calendar and the fact--

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.820
we shall call it, though this
is very subjective-- that it is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.756
May 6, 2015 and the other ways
that we can think about that

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:38.146
in the modern world and think
about how these things interact

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:40.270
with each other and then
how the same sort of thing

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.130
happened in the ancient world.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.080
And we can see
calendars and clocks--

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.670
and we could talk a bit about
clocks as well-- as signs

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.020
of identity formation
and interaction as well.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.350
And I'd like to show you
about five examples of how

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.040
this was possible in the
ancient world throughout today.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.580
Now the first thing
to do though is

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.820
to think about this
idea of the date.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.576
So, as I keep saying, "the
fact" that it is May 6, 2015.

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:05.950
There are all
sorts of other ways

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.990
that we could
express today's date.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.160
You can see on this
slide, of course.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.220
If we go back to the old
Roman way of expressing dates,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.960
we would call this the
day before Nones of May

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.050
in the year 2768.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.030
That is of course the
year from the founding

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.260
of the city of Rome,
the legendary founding

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.660
of the city of Rome
anyway in 753 BC.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.940
We should talk about what
BC actually means as well.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.780
But we call it May 6, 2015
by the Gregorian calendar.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.310
And the Gregorian calendar
is an interesting one.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.430
It was invented--
not really invented--

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.264
instituted by Pope Gregory
XIII in October of 1582.

00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:47.680
So if you think about the grand
scheme of time, of course,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.220
this is not even a blink.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.940
Only in the last
few centuries really

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.162
have we reckoned
this bit of time.

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:56.370
But it's an interesting way
to think about the world.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.520
It's of course a modification
of the older Roman calendar.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.234
We'll talk about the
formation of that

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:01.900
under Julius Caesar
and the modification

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
under Augustus before Gregory.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.780
But its adoption is an
interesting story as well.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.620
So it was instituted
by Gregory in 1582.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.570
It was then adopted in Spain,
Portugal, Italy, and Poland

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.760
also in 1582.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.960
You can see within of
course a correlation still,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.190
a modern correlation
between this relationship

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.601
between the Catholic
Church and nation states.

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:25.100
So these Catholic
countries are then

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.250
adopting this
calendrical system that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.680
was introduced by the
pope in the 16th century.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.790
However, not everybody did this.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.580
For example, the United Kingdom.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.770
The UK didn't actually
adopt the Gregorian calendar

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.820
until 1752, so a couple
hundred years later just about.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.610
The Ottoman Empire didn't
assume it until 1917.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.260
So getting even further
along than that.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.550
Russia adopted the
Gregorian calendar in 1918.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.080
And then the Soviet
Union adopted it in 1922.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.889
So we're getting very much
into the modern world here.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.180
And Greece didn't actually
adopt the Gregorian calendar

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.176
until 1923.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.550
So and you could
think about that

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.390
as a different interaction.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.580
We see some of those
others-- well, the first,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.330
of course, the UK,
it's the interaction

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.607
between the Protestant Church
or churches and the Catholic

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:14.940
Church and then in Eastern
Orthodox and Russian Orthodox

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.001
churches as well.

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.500
And all of these
things then leading

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.590
to some sort of agreement.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.240
But then we can also look
further afield as well.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.215
China didn't adopt the Gregorian
calendar until 1912 or 1929.

00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.420
It was sort of a piecemeal
process in China.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.170
And India, Libya, and Persia--
that is, Iran-- of course

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.960
still use different
calendars today,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.436
for certain purposes anyway.

00:05:38.436 --> 00:05:40.310
As I mentioned before,
the Gregorian calendar

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.730
is a modification of the
earlier Roman calendar,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.250
what we'll refer to for
argument's sake as the Julian

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.360
calendar.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.020
And this is a solar
calendar that was

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.780
implemented by Julius Caesar.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.680
He set it up in 46, and
the calendar actually

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.110
started to be used in 45 BC.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.770
And it replaced an
earlier lunar calendar

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.090
to which I'll return
in a few minutes

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.380
and then again was modified
by Augustus in 9 BC.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.107
The year numbering system
that we use at various times

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:09.940
is also an interesting
thing to think about.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.640
So to think about that
we use-- so that's 2015.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.300
The Romans, where
today it's 2768.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.390
The numbering system
that we use is basically

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.710
attributed to Dionysius Exiguus.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.450
And it replaced a previous
system of calendrical

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.020
dating, going back--
well, actually this

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.780
is a system that we no
longer particularly use.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.380
But Dionysius-- yes, Dionysius
replaced a calendrical system

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.190
which had been based on what's
called the Diocletianic era,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.030
meaning that this had picked up
at the accession of the Roman

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.900
Emperor Diocletian in 284 CE.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.000
And Dionysius established
this system then in 525,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.090
so about a century later.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.085
And that gets us to
our sort of AD-- well,

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.810
it gets us moving anyway
toward our AD, BC dates.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.124
If we think about this
question of AD and BC,

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.540
it's an interesting
thing as well.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.956
And I think as my
lecture goes on,

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:11.730
you'll see that I mostly use
CE and BCE as we go through.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.070
And this is a replacement
then of course of anno Domini

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.300
and before Christ
with a less sectarian

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.180
version of this, which
is the common era

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.410
and before the common era.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.700
And you can see within that
expression of time also

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.256
a very cultural and
political element to this.

00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:28.130
So something of course,
the Western calendar,

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.140
the calendar that we use,
the Gregorian calendar

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.030
having a lot to do with
the Christian church.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.850
But then as we get into the sort
of more modern, hopefully more

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.630
secular world, a modification
of this to be more inclusive

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.520
and not to pin the
calendar to any one faith.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.060
Now this is an interesting thing
also though because of course

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.910
if you just go
sort of half a step

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.720
away from what we
actually call the date,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.562
this is still sort
of a religious thing.

00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:53.770
We didn't change the numbers.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.540
We just changed the labels.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.800
And that may give you an
idea of how dedicated perhaps

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.700
our culture is to incorporating
these different other cultures

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.740
other than the
Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.240
And that I'll leave you to
think about in your spare time.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.520
Write a letter to
the "New York Times."

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.853
I'm sure they'd love to have it.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.390
Right.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.580
But this is only-- and
the modification then

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.760
or the adjustment of
AD to CE is only part

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.220
of a much larger
debate that's going on

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.710
and continues to sort of rage
through the world of calendars

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.920
anyway.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.010
We talked about the
Gregorian date here.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.110
We could also talk about
the old Julian date.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.646
I think I've got that here.

00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.270
By the Julian calendars,
we're actually

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:43.860
nine days before the Kalends
of May in the year 2768

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.142
from the founding of the
city, ab urbe condita.

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:49.350
This is an interesting thing.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.225
You can see actually
these dates don't match.

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:52.910
They're 13 days separated.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.300
And this has to do with errors
in the calendar going back

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.590
to Augustus when he reformed
the previous errors of Julius

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.630
Caesar.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.630
And it has to do with
a fact which may only

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.580
come to mean anything to you if
you actually live to the year

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.750
2100, which is that the
year 2100 will actually not

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.910
be a leap year.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.657
So 2000 was, but 2100 won't be.

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.490
And this has to do with
the length of course

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.615
of the solar year.

00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:22.990
And this is
something that wasn't

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.772
realized until
relatively recently

00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:25.980
and then had to be corrected.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.940
Right.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.940
So the Romans had a
slightly different calendar.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.260
Then it was corrected of
course by Pope Gregory.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.120
We could of course also go
by the Hebrew calendar, which

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.490
gives us a different day, the
18th day of Iyyar in the year

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.390
5775.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.390
The Hebrew calendar is a
very interesting thing.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.931
It's of course incredibly useful
if you do crossword puzzles.

00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:49.010
It comes up all the time.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.854
The months worth
memorizing though,

00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:53.020
especially if you're
competitive about these things.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.811
And I only am because
the "New York Times,"

00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.480
the thing on my iPad
tells me how long

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.760
it took me to do a
crossword puzzle.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.634
And then it says what
the average length was.

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:01.340
And I'm just-- my
personality doesn't

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.960
allow me to be sub-average.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.630
So I have to do that.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.790
It's a pretty great system.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.340
It's a good calendar.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.730
It's a 19 year lunar
solar calendar.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.147
So it corrects itself every
19 years as the seasons shift,

00:10:12.147 --> 00:10:14.604
and the months will change of
course in their relationships

00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:16.710
to the season, which is
sort of a difficult thing

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.680
and not ideal for many purposes.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.120
But of course it has
persisted for a long time.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.620
And systems like
this have certainly

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.859
been used since the
5th century, BC.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.400
The year dates,
interestingly enough,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.900
for the Hebrew calendar are
based supposedly on time

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.520
of creation and were
not calculated actually

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.412
until the 2nd century, CE.

00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:37.120
Think about how far
back these things go.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.480
So a difficult thing
to do, figure out

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.540
exactly when this was.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.990
And even when we hear about the
calculations of when creation

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.260
was, of course, it is calculated
in respect to the Seleucid

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.470
Dynasty, so into this eastern
dynasty, when they were,

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.350
and then going back to
the beginning of the world

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.741
theoretically.

00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:56.490
We could use other
calendars here as well.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.710
The Persian calendar.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.200
By the Persian calendar, this is
the seventh day of Ordibehesht

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.270
in the year 1392.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.270
Very different calendar.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.830
This calendar is still
used in Iran today.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:14.310
It was adopted in the year 1925,
so not a very old calendar.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.740
It begins on march,
which is the time

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.670
of the vernal
equinox, which makes

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.030
a certain amount of sense.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.460
It just depends when you want
to start your year of course.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.270
And interestingly, it has been
modified since 1925 as well.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.910
And from the years 1976 to 1979,
the start date of the calendar

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.560
was moved from the
Hijra of Muhammad

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.340
to the accession
of Cyrus the Great.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.960
So the system by which
they numbered years.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960
And then of course this
was undone with the fall

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.160
of the Shah in 1979.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.580
So you can see the politics
of the calendar sort of very

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.390
overtly expressed in that.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.670
And this of course persists
as an official calendar,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.420
so something that has to be
calculated and reconciled then

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.509
with the Gregorian
calendar as well.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.550
Other countries of course
have their own as well.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.305
So the Indian civil calendar
is continuing on, also

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.120
a politically fraught
issue, by which

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.369
this is the 17th of
Vaisakha in the year 1937.

00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:10.660
The numbers are just close
enough that you can actually

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.790
get confused between
the Gregorian calendar

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.430
and the Indian civil calendar.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.900
The start date of this, as
we're counting years-- it

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.120
starts with the Saka era.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.780
And actually, it began
then-- the numbering--

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.710
with the equinox
on March 22, 79 CE.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.110
Only an interesting
to me-- well,

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.370
for this reason, of course, but
also because that is the year

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.830
the Mount Vesuvius erupted.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.650
So cool.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.360
It gets into the
Roman world anyway.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.122
I wonder if there's some cool
connection between these two.

00:12:41.122 --> 00:12:41.830
I don't think so.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.850
It's just coincidence.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.730
But I would like to think so.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.290
There is a subject for
your historical novel.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.632
So I like to-- just
planting seeds here.

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:50.840
Just put me in the footnotes.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.230
I'll be happy.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.014
The Indian civil calendar then
was adopted on March 22, 1957.

00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:00.180
For those of you who know
your 20th century history,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.721
this is sort of an
interesting thing.

00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.800
It's about 10 years
after the emancipation

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.360
or the independence of India.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.150
And you can see this
as an expression then

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.970
of the difference, the
independence of modern India

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.050
from the United Kingdom.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.560
And Prime Minister Nehru
once wrote, "They"-- that is,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.760
different calendars-- "represent
past political divisions

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.636
in the country.

00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:23.260
Now that we have
attained independence,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.100
it is obviously
desirable that there

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.980
should be a certain
uniformity in the calendar

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.230
for our civic, social,
and other purposes.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.230
And this should be done
on a scientific approach

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.507
to this problem."

00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:36.090
An interesting thing,
that recognition

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.381
of course of the politics here.

00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:40.709
We can read that onto the
Indian-British debate.

00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:42.250
But actually, I
believe at this point

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.960
he was speaking about
the fact that there

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.441
were some ridiculous
number-- I want

00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:48.190
to say it was well
over dozens, hundreds--

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.630
of different
calendars being used

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.350
in different parts of India.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.570
So a very confusing thing.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.290
He's trying to find some unity
for a new country, independent

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:02.170
of its previous
overlord, shall we say,

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.060
its previous dominating force.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.690
My favorite of the now defunct
calendars that goes around

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.340
is the French
Republican calendar.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.840
I think it's
absolutely fascinating,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.430
and it's brilliantly political.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.309
So this is perhaps
the most political

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:17.850
of the calendars
that we can look at,

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.020
at least the most
overtly political.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.950
This would be--
here's the date here.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.630
So Floreal 17th in the year 223.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.440
This calendar was implemented
by a decree of the Convention

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.250
Nationale on October 5,
1793 and implemented then

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.590
on November 24, 1794.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.150
So this is just in the
wake of the revolution.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.480
And in a world then
where of course we

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.980
see the Gregorian calendar, the
power of the Catholic church

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.450
expressed through the French
monarchy, is then overthrown.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.150
And with it, the
calendrical system

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.360
is changed in order
that it will represent

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.160
a more rational and of
course more egalitarian world

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.020
in many ways.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.290
So they created 12 months
then of equal length,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.300
of 30 days each, and
then a six day holiday

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.920
period at the end of the year
when nobody would do anything,

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.759
and it was France.

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:10.050
An absolutely brilliant system.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.260
I like it a lot.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.370
It was abolished though not
long afterwards in 1806,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.260
then reinstituted briefly during
the Paris Commune uprising

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.346
of 1871 but is now gone.

00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:21.720
But it is an
interesting attempt.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.178
And you can also
see this as trying

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:25.927
to rationalize the world in
making equal length months,

00:15:25.927 --> 00:15:28.510
going back toward the invention
of the metric system of course

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.430
and the implementation
of the metric system.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.870
Same kind of ideal
of making the world

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.890
make sense in a way that--
wouldn't it be nice if it did?

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.610
But it does not.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.060
Until a couple years ago,
whenever I talked about this,

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.749
I liked to talk about the
Mayan Long Count calendar.

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:46.290
But we can throw that one out
because it didn't do its thing.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.232
The world didn't end.

00:15:47.232 --> 00:15:49.190
And the dates have gotten
much less interesting

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.290
and much shorter now.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:54.590
We would call it 130277, which
used to be a big long number,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.632
and it was much more fun.

00:15:55.632 --> 00:15:57.798
But you can certainly think--
that's a calendar then

00:15:57.798 --> 00:15:59.880
in the New World of giving
us an idea of the ways

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.570
that these cultures interacted.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.550
Now for you guys, perhaps
more scientifically grounded,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.050
you could think
about different ways

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.850
and different scientific
ways by which we record time.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.919
So the ISO 8601 date,
day three, week 19, 2015.

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:16.460
That sounds nice
and rational, right,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.700
in a way that we don't
have to translate it really

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.120
from language to language.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.230
The Julian day is an
interesting system

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.344
by which we can keep time.

00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:24.760
I think I've
actually gotten this.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.470
Do I have this?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.690
Here's the Julian day.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:35.080
This is day-- god, that's
a big number-- 2,457,149.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.050
It becomes unwieldy
really quickly.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.020
We can abbreviate this.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:44.990
There's a modified version
by which it's 57,148.7 local.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.220
These are dates then
calculating the number of days

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.360
since January 1, 4713 BC.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.140
Again, that BC creeps in.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.950
For some reason, we
have to use that.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.699
And this is a point
at which a whole bunch

00:16:58.699 --> 00:17:00.930
of different calendrical
systems actually coincide.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.700
So it makes sense when
translating from one calendar

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.619
to another to use this date.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.290
And it's basically for
astronomical reasons,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.390
and we can talk
a lot about this.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.240
Interestingly about
this thing as well-- it

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.692
sounds like a very modern idea.

00:17:13.692 --> 00:17:15.900
Of course, somebody had to
have a graphing calculator

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.460
to make this whole thing work.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.077
But it was actually
first proposed in 1583.

00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:23.410
So just about the time of the
Gregorian calendar reform.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.285
Somebody else said,
well, actually, you know,

00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:28.260
there would be a better, more
universal way of doing this.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.216
And not really
widely used today,

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.465
but used for various purposes.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.050
And then for those of you
who are more fancifully-- no,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.940
that sounds dismissive
of me-- inclined.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.460
Discordians among
you, if there are any,

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.540
the date of the
Discordian calendar today

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:49.830
is Sweetmorn Discord 53rd,
Year of Our Lady Discord 3181.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.095
Not many people use this one.

00:17:51.095 --> 00:17:52.720
And it's basically
an invented calendar

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.342
and very interesting for ways of
thinking about invented worlds.

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.800
However, if this
religion kicks on,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.590
just remember I noted it
first and therefore should

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.350
receive salvation.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.350
And this is interesting.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.330
The start date for
this is 1166 BC.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.036
So we still have to express
this in an AD, BC fashion.

00:18:12.036 --> 00:18:13.410
Although I have
written here BCE.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.680
So maybe we could sanitize that
a little bit by saying BCE.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.290
But an interesting
phenomenon as well.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.039
And then the personal
date by which I date

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:24.470
all my correspondence of
course is the Stardate.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.650
And we have to think
about the exact system

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.060
that we're going
to use for this,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.100
commonly in use other than
just changing the numbers

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.340
and putting points
between them, which

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.540
I think is kind of cheating.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:42.380
It would get us to the day
307,656.16 local or 688,824.7

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.016
local.

00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:44.890
Now I also spend a lot
of time thinking about

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.980
whether you would actually
have local time if you

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.570
were serving in the Starfleet.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.210
I mean, of course, there's
also some relativity involved

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.835
and everything.

00:18:50.835 --> 00:18:53.340
But Starfleet headquarters
is in San Francisco.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.250
So should we be using Greenwich
Mean Time or West Coast time?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.090
I don't know.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.720
But another calendar
of course which

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.490
you'll find some use of at
some point in your life.

00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:06.860
Now there are other ways
of dating things of course

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.630
that you guys may
be familiar with,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.430
specifically dates
used digitally, used

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.790
for specific computer programs.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.430
So Excel, for example.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.157
Unix has its own dating system.

00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:18.240
And these are things that
of course mean something

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.906
to some people and
not to others and are

00:19:19.906 --> 00:19:22.012
used for various reasons.

00:19:22.012 --> 00:19:23.470
They also have
significance though.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.710
Any one of these dates we
could all decide to use.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.670
And yet for some reason
in the modern world,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.050
nobody can decide on a
single system to use.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.650
And this is particularly
irritating to me in a way.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:35.650
So I live in Canada now.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.800
I am American by birth.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.176
I spend a lot of time in
the UK and around Europe.

00:19:40.176 --> 00:19:41.550
And every time I
have to fill out

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.990
one of those customs
declaration cards,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.877
I screw it up because I put
the numbers in the wrong order.

00:19:46.877 --> 00:19:48.210
So we can't even decide on that.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.440
We can't decide whether to
separate the months, days,

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.526
and years with dashes
or points or slashes.

00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:56.400
And it's just a mess.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.750
But you will see this.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.100
Whenever I do it, and I
send an email to a student

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.890
or something, they giggle.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.780
And they say, oh, you
did it the American way.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.363
So there is a lot
of identity involved

00:20:04.363 --> 00:20:07.450
in even these small
expressions of time.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.612
Now if we step
back a little bit,

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:11.570
we could think much more
abstractly about this.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.080
And really, I'd like
to step back and talk

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.640
about ancient
calendrical systems.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.690
And we can see the same ways
of these calendars interacting

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.540
that we can see in
the modern world.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.510
And once you see
this, you will start

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.290
to see it all over the place.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.400
So if we think about Greek
calendars, for example--

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.660
really, we can think about
Greek and Roman calendars.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.660
In their very earliest days,
this continued on with-- well,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.660
we'll see it actually
change in Greek calendars.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.140
But they started out in
the Greek and Roman world

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.599
by using lunar calendars.

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:38.390
So these are calendars
that are pinned then

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.940
to the cycles of the moon.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.880
And interestingly enough, each
city-state, basically speaking,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.840
in the Greek world--
and this is a world then

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.320
that after the Greek
colonization period consisted

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.740
of cities everywhere
from southern France

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.780
to the Black Sea,
all over the place.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.830
And all of these cities
had their own calendars.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.280
They were all basically lunar.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.180
They consisted
basically of 12 months.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.990
The 12 months had either 29 or
30 days, which then of course

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.290
makes an imperfect year.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:08.980
There are extra days
at the end that you

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.410
have to correct for things.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.580
So you can't actually
predict on what day

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.210
the equinox or the solstice or
anything like that would occur.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.107
And this required then a
process called intercalation,

00:21:19.107 --> 00:21:21.690
which just means throwing stuff
in the middle of the calendar.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.130
But it's got lots of letters,
so it makes me sound smart,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.790
I hope.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.920
And this was used certainly
by the 5th century, anyway.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.410
There were 30 extra
days then added to years

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.120
three, five, and eighth
of an eight year cycle.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.620
This eight year cycle is
called [? Octorisus ?].

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.920
It was invented-- instituted,
publicized, something

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.210
like that-- by a guy named
Cleomedes of Tenedos.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.046
Sometime between 520 and the
430s is when he was living.

00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:50.420
And during his
life, he did this.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.045
And Tenedos, in case
you're interested,

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:56.420
is in Western Turkey, so
within that Greek world.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.670
Now this meant that
in the Greek world,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.600
there were innumerable--
basically innumerable calendars

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.630
that had to be
negotiated in some way.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.170
And if you wanted to accomplish
anything on a specific date,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.253
you had to figure out what
date it was in the city

00:22:09.253 --> 00:22:11.629
that you were going to or
that you were in or from where

00:22:11.629 --> 00:22:14.170
the person you're dealing with
came from, where you both came

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.760
from, depending where you are.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.240
And it could be a total mess.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.140
And this leads to things in
the archaeological record,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.460
in the epigraphic
record like this,

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.810
which makes no sense
to anybody in the world

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.380
unless you read
Greek, in which case

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.810
it looks something like this.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.870
So this is an inscription
written in Greek

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.090
obviously, as
you've already seen.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.370
And it comes from
Delos, so an island,

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.424
one of the big
islands in the Aegean.

00:22:36.424 --> 00:22:37.840
And I just want
to read it to you.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.381
And we can see within the sum
of this interaction between two

00:22:40.381 --> 00:22:41.450
calendrical systems.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.640
So it says, "Gods.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.040
The Amphiktyons"-- so
this is a council of four

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.690
or five people from
Athens who were then

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.410
in charge of the
temples in Delos.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.030
And Delos at this point-- and
this inscription is from 377,

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.850
I believe, perhaps 373.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.030
Do I have to say BCE?

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.610
I guess I do because that's
the way we're going to keep

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.818
track of these things, right?

00:23:03.818 --> 00:23:06.730
The Athenians would actually
use Archon dates, as we'll see.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.940
So 377 or 373 BC in Delos.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.960
And Athens had basically
been in control

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.200
of Delos for a little over
100 years at this point.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.300
And this is interesting, as
we read this inscription.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.540
So, "Gods.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.180
The Amphiktyons of Athens
enacted the following"--

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.900
and this is a decree about
finances of these temples--

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.510
"from the archonship of Kalleas
to the month of Thargelion

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.640
in the archonship of
Hippodamas in Athens,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.080
and on Delos from the archonship
of Epigenes to the month

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.450
Thargelion in the
archonship of Hippias."

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.530
And then it goes on.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.899
It talks about some
expenditures and things.

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:47.440
And then it comes
back to this issue.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.280
And it says, "The Amphiktyons of
Athens enacted the following"--

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.770
so the second part of this--
"from the month of Skirophorion

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:58.630
in the archonship of Hippodamas
to the archonship of Sokratides

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.580
in Athens, and on Delos from the
month Panemos to the archonship

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.080
of Pyraithos."

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.200
And you could see within
this then two different

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.792
calendrical systems at work.

00:24:09.792 --> 00:24:11.250
So they're saying
exactly when this

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.210
was done by the
Amphiktyons of Athens,

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.940
and it gives the dates for
both the Athenian calendar

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.650
and the Delian calendar.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.900
So people should
understand in either place

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.012
exactly what these were.

00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:25.720
Now within this, you
can see the workings

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.210
of the calendrical
systems as well.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.130
These archons-- so
the head magistrates

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.240
of the city-states who are then
in charge and by whom we're

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.410
going to date years-- this
raises really interesting

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.368
questions about how people
in the ancient world

00:24:36.368 --> 00:24:37.760
perceived the future.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.877
That's a different paper.

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:40.710
But if you're going to
name every year based

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.880
on who's in charge,
and you don't

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.838
know who's going to be
in charge in the future,

00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:45.710
how do you refer to those years?

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.980
Interesting thing.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.840
Forthcoming book.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.360
OK.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.622
An interesting thing.

00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:53.830
And we can see within this
also that Delos and Athens

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.430
have different names
for their months.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.980
And we can go through
and look at a whole bunch

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.800
of these inscriptions.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.960
And if you look at
a bunch of them,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.520
eventually, you
can line them up.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.180
And you can figure out which
month relates to which month.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.650
And basically, you figure that
Delos and Athens had years

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.290
that started six months apart.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:12.380
So they were as different
as they possibly could be.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.040
But you can basically
match them up.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.789
Now once you look at
a bunch of these too,

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:17.630
you figure, the numbers
don't actually work.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.880
Things are slightly different.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.470
That's because they're
intercalating their years

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.620
differently as well.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.397
So on some years, the Athenians
would throw in an extra month

00:25:25.397 --> 00:25:26.730
to try and correct the calendar.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.410
And in some years, the
Delians would do it.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.390
And those weren't
necessarily the same years.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.259
So you have to know
then how people

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:34.550
were going to change their
calendar in order to predict

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.160
a date in the future.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.612
And we don't have much
information about how exactly

00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:39.820
they decided when to do this.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.810
But we know in the Roman world
it was basically an arbitrary

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.170
decision a lot of times.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.772
But if they're following
this [? Octorisus ?] cycle,

00:25:45.772 --> 00:25:48.230
they should be able to predict
within that eight year cycle

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.980
exactly when they're
going to introduce months.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.720
You have to do that.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.428
So clearly, there must
have been somebody

00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:54.220
in charge of calculating dates.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.460
And he must have been--
or she-- very good at it.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.090
But you can see the
complications then

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.190
of these groups working
together in order to do this.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.530
Right.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.155
And remember of course
that this is all

00:26:08.155 --> 00:26:12.151
while Delos is politically
subject to Athens in many ways.

00:26:12.151 --> 00:26:13.650
So the Athenians
probably could have

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.120
forced them to change their
calendar if they wanted to.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.690
But they chose not to.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.530
Or the Delian were so
attached to their own calendar

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.720
that they were determined
to keep it separate.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.780
So you can see this
fierce independence

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.610
in the Greek world.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.750
And we can see this in
other inscriptions as well.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.510
So another way-- and this is a
relatively small transaction.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.150
This is not between archons or
anything, between individuals.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.070
Its subject matter is
slightly unfortunate.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.970
But fortunately, hopefully
largely a thing of the past.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.750
But this is an
interesting inscription.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:47.204
So when Aristoteles son
of Aristarchos was general

00:26:47.204 --> 00:26:49.620
of the Phokians-- so this is
a different part of the Greek

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.390
world-- in the First month--
so they're naming their months

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:57.680
basically just on what order
they come in-- and at Delos,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.080
Xeneas son of Babylos--
or "Bye-blos--"

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.490
was archon in the month Heraios,
Aristeas son of Aristodamos

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.040
of Stiris sold to Pithyan Apollo
a male slave whose name is

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.510
Protos sun of Protos of Sidonian
race for the price of eight

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.580
minas of silver.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.790
So you can see that
these complications then

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.640
of calendrical dates continue
on to personal transactions

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.380
as well.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.950
So here you have somebody
who's selling a slave,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.700
and he's got to give
this date and give it

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.920
in two different ways.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.570
So it becomes very complicated
anywhere in the ancient world.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.500
But you can see again another
place, the Phokians then,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.387
preserving their own calendar
through this period as well.

00:27:37.387 --> 00:27:38.470
So the same kind of thing.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.640
And we can match these
calendars up again.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.970
So you've got here that
Heraios was the 10th month

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.490
of the Delian calendar.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.190
But this is then happening in
the first month of the Phokian

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.940
calendar.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.355
So things get
extremely complicated.

00:27:50.355 --> 00:27:52.480
And one could continue with
this with a whole bunch

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.100
of other Greek cities.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.150
We have fortunately
thousands and thousands

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.860
of Greek inscriptions, many
of which have dates on them.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.740
And you can go and
map them all up

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.916
and thereby give
yourself an aneurysm

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:06.250
and make yourself-- I
don't know-- probably fall

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.462
into a bottle of scotch.

00:28:08.462 --> 00:28:10.920
But through all of this, you
can see within the Greek world

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.830
this fierce determination
to remain independent.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.680
And this goes back
to the very ideas,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.910
the fundamental ideas
of the Greek world,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.945
which is that of the city-state,
these self-governing cities.

00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:22.320
This was something
of course that

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.570
made the Greek city-states very
interesting, created things,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.750
we could say, like
democracy and all this

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.890
or political experiments
of various varieties.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.030
It made Greece a difficult
place to be, of course.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.500
And things like wars with
people from the east,

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.920
because they didn't unite very
well, allowed in some ways

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.410
the Romans to conquer the
Greek world because again they

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:46.510
couldn't put together an army
to resist Roman expansion.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.900
But this is sort of symptomatic
of this type of interaction.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.070
You can see these
dominant forces then still

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.620
not subjugating people in
terms of their calendar.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.230
We can see something
very different

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.020
though happening
in the Roman world.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.680
And we can even see
interaction between

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.130
the Greek and Roman world.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.980
So the Roman calendar,
we think about,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.350
was theoretically set
up by King Numa, who

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.552
was the second king of Rome.

00:29:10.552 --> 00:29:13.010
And it operated a calendar
which was separate then from any

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.680
of the Greek calendars.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.780
Supposedly then in the
8th century, Numa--

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.950
again, the second
king of Rome-- to whom

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.930
are ascribed many of the
religious practices of Rome--

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.940
so the first king,
Romulus, was the warrior.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.300
And he fought to create the city
and expanded it a little bit.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.216
And then Numa came in.

00:29:29.216 --> 00:29:30.980
He was like, everybody
just calm down.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.260
We need some religion here.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.520
We're going to create
a culture, and then we

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.170
can think about expanding again.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.180
And one of the very
first things he does then

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.540
is establish a calendar.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.070
And you can see
this in this quote.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.570
So, "His first act"-- that is,
Numa's first act, of course--

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.560
"was to divide the year
into 12 lunar months.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.350
And because 12 lunar months came
a few days short of the full

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.050
solar year, he inserted
intercalary months"--

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.330
so these are extra months
to correct the calendar--

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.130
"so that every 20 years, the
cycle should be completed"--

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.842
so this is clearly different
than the [? Octorisus ?] that

00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:03.300
we saw with the Greek world--
"the days coming around again

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.960
to correspond with the position
of the sun from which they had

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.965
started."

00:30:07.965 --> 00:30:09.590
So they're realigning
the calendar then

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.440
with the solar year.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:13.980
Right.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.090
So you see within
this, of course,

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.730
the fact that this was
done so early or at least

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.350
ascribed to such an early date.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.740
And this is by Livy, who's
writing in the 1st century BC.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.250
At least with the
Augustan period,

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.600
the calendar was
thought about as being

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.100
such an important
thing that it must

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.064
have been very fundamental to
the establishment of the city.

00:30:29.064 --> 00:30:31.480
And it seems that this 12 month
calendar probably replaced

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.744
a 10 month lunar calendar.

00:30:32.744 --> 00:30:35.160
We don't even need to talk
about 10 month lunar calendars.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.020
They're a disaster.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.520
Why you would do
that, I don't know.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.220
I guess if you like the metric
system, you'd give it a shot.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.720
But you're going to find that
there's a little over 12 lunar

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.386
cycles in a year, so it's
going to get messed up.

00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.010
And we see this then,
the establishment

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.940
of the calendar--
and this becomes

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.444
important-- as this symbol
of the creation of peace.

00:30:53.444 --> 00:30:54.860
So if something
you want is peace,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.770
you can correct a calendar and
make order out of the world.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.690
The system that Numa set up
is not very well understood.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.075
But by 450 BCE,
attempts had been

00:31:05.075 --> 00:31:08.050
made to regularize the
calendar through intercalation.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.760
So this group called
the Second [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.750
the second group of
10, seems to have tried

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.670
to establish a regular system.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.910
And we end up with a
calendar that looks something

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:18.350
like this, which I
think that you probably

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.090
can't see particularly
well from your seats.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.290
But I will lead you through
it, some of the salient

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.360
features anyway.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.620
So it's a 12 month calendar.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.170
And then you can see
12 months across here.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.450
And then right at the end there
one that says inter on the top.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.690
That's the intercalary month.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.410
So the extra that
could be added in order

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.130
to correct the calendar.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.620
Within this calendar-- this
calendar dates from about 60

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.762
BC, so before the reforms
of Julius Caesar--

00:31:44.762 --> 00:31:46.720
there's all sorts of
information about culture.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.850
We could do another hour
at least about the ways

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.980
that you can see culture
reflected in a calendar.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.439
But the salient bits that are
in there of course, something

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:58.063
that's very interesting-- you'll
see the two months that I have

00:31:58.063 --> 00:31:59.440
Mark there that
say quin and sext

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.690
don't have anything to
do really with our naming

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.389
system for months.

00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:04.930
These are the months
that would later

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.757
be known as July and August.

00:32:06.757 --> 00:32:08.590
You can see within that,
it's a manipulation

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.173
of the calendar, people trying
to name months after themselves

00:32:11.173 --> 00:32:13.417
or having months named
after them in this case.

00:32:13.417 --> 00:32:15.500
The emperor Domitian also
tried to name two months

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.570
after himself.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.000
It didn't hold though,
because nobody liked him.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.940
But I think he was trying to
take September and October.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.610
But this is the old
Republican calendar,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.540
so before Julius
Caesar and Augustus.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.330
You can see in here
also then there

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.065
are days of political
action and religious action

00:32:32.065 --> 00:32:32.690
marked on here.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.437
So the ones that are circled
here have an F on them.

00:32:36.437 --> 00:32:38.520
This is fas, meaning that
they are propitious days

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.850
for public activity.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.540
Good stuff can
happen on a fas day.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.709
There are labels for
N, meaning nefas,

00:32:45.709 --> 00:32:48.000
meaning this is not a good
day, when bad things happen.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.530
September 11.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.020
That should be a nefas day,
a day when bad things have

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.760
happened and may continue to
in Roman superstition/religion.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.140
There are more complicated
things on here as well.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.560
So there's the nefasti publici.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.760
These are days when--
public holiday.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.830
It was not a good
day for public work,

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.730
but it could be used
for other things.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.040
So it was largely a holiday.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.240
There are comitial days.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.840
You can see those
in the bottom left.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.880
These are days in
which the comitia

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.600
or the assembly of
the Roman people

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.580
met or at least could meet.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.680
There are these
endotercisi days,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.154
which are half days basically.

00:33:25.154 --> 00:33:27.820
The morning was no good, but you
could do work in the afternoon.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.640
So that's better than nothing.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.710
I haven't had a half
day since, I think,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.002
I was in elementary
school or something.

00:33:34.002 --> 00:33:36.460
And then there are religious
things marked on here as well.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.322
You see these things, QRCF.

00:33:38.322 --> 00:33:43.040
This seems to be the day that
the religious king of Rome

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.500
would go through and
decide what could be done

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.270
and couldn't be done and what
formulas, religiously speaking.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.750
And then-- let's see.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.440
Oh, here we go.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.360
I think I went one too far.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.789
And then also marked
on here in the columns

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:57.830
are the days of the week.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.959
And this is through
a nundinal system.

00:33:59.959 --> 00:34:01.000
Nundinal means nine days.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.416
But by Roman reckoning, nine
days are actually eight days.

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:04.837
So it's an eight day week.

00:34:04.837 --> 00:34:06.670
The week is something
also very interesting.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.294
Think about the establishment of
the seven day week, introduced

00:34:09.294 --> 00:34:13.639
by Augustus largely, dominant
by about the 4th or 5th century.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.681
Of course, we still use
the seven day week today.

00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:17.722
Sort of interesting things
about the perpetuation

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:18.710
of these calendars.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.251
And if we think about the seven
day work week or the five day

00:34:21.251 --> 00:34:24.060
work week, that's an addition
to the calendar of the last 100

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.020
years or so.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.507
So interesting things
certainly to think about.

00:34:27.507 --> 00:34:29.090
There are more things
on here as well.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.179
So there are festivals
of various varieties.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.780
The Lupercal, you can see all
the way on the left there,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.500
the Quirinalia, the celebration
of the matrice, various things.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.190
And if we just look
at May, I think,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.650
we can see what's in
store for us this month.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.480
And here we get the Lemuralia,
which is an interesting thing.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.210
It's all kind of strange.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:57.670
This is the exorcism of
malevolent household spirits.

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.571
And the idea, the tradition
for this-- and please

00:35:00.571 --> 00:35:02.820
feel free to do this at
home-- is that you're supposed

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.380
to walk around
your house barefoot

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.720
and throw beans
over your shoulders.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.280
So if it works, do it.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.066
It's good for it.

00:35:11.066 --> 00:35:12.440
And I have written
here that it's

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.250
supposed to be black beans.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.460
So don't screw up and use
red beans or pinto beans

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.190
or anything.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.424
Make sure you get it right.

00:35:17.424 --> 00:35:18.840
And also, interestingly
enough, we

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.670
learn about May that it's
a bad month for marriage,

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.836
despite the fact that
everybody in the Western world

00:35:22.836 --> 00:35:24.500
gets married in May and June.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.150
So maybe they didn't
have that one right.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.104
And then we have
this, the Agonalia.

00:35:29.104 --> 00:35:31.020
We don't really actually
know much about this.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.019
It happened on the 21st.

00:35:32.019 --> 00:35:34.890
It was probably a celebration
from Mars based on the name.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.200
But mostly, that's
just etymology.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.300
And then my favorite, which is
here, the Tubilustrium, which

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.010
is, as near as we can
figure, the blessing

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.385
of the sacred trumpets.

00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:46.010
It's a big one.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.272
Mark your calendars
for that one.

00:35:48.272 --> 00:35:48.980
That's coming up.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.710
But you can see
all sorts of bits

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.490
of culture wrapped up in that.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.010
Now the Roman
Republican calendar

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.126
was very imperfect though.

00:35:58.126 --> 00:36:00.680
And it largely had to do
with the implementation

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.490
of those intercalary months
because the implementation

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.740
of those months came from
the pontifices, which

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.589
means the priests.

00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:10.130
One pontifex.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.697
It means bridge maker.

00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:12.280
A whole bunch.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.730
There's a college of pontifices.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.120
And they got to make decisions
about when to or not to have

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.150
an intercalary month.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.950
So not even using that
[? Octorisus ?] process

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.580
that we talked about before.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.860
And this then led
to a fair amount

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.790
of arbitrary work that could
be done during this calendar.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.650
And we can see this calendar
getting way out of whack

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.069
at various times as well.

00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:36.610
So here's an example
of this from one

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.140
of the early books of Livy.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.820
This is talking about
the year 190 BC.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.990
It's actually not even
an early book of Livy.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.130
It's about early times,
but a late book of Livy.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.380
So, "On those days,
in which the consul"--

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.780
and the consul he's speaking
of is Lucius Cornelius Scipio--

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.970
"set out for war during
the Games of Apollo,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.810
five days before the
ides of Quintilis"--

00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:03.950
right so that's July-- "in
a clear sky in the daytime,

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.670
the light was obscured when
the moon went under the circle

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.030
of the sun."

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.760
OK.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.218
Moon went under
the circle the sun.

00:37:10.218 --> 00:37:12.750
So we have here a
note of an eclipse.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.790
We're all scientists here of
various varieties, except me.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.340
We could figure out when
eclipses actually occurred.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.350
So the date that this
inscription gives

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.290
is the 11th of July.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.110
But we know that
the eclipse actually

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.110
happened on the 14th of March.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.940
So the calendar then
in the Roman world

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.780
was four months off.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.990
So whoever these
pontifices were had really

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.310
screwed it up at this point.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:39.140
You got to wonder why exactly
they could let it get that bad.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.300
By the year 168, it
had been corrected.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.292
So it was only two
and a half months off.

00:37:43.292 --> 00:37:45.000
So they're getting in
the right direction

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.230
but still not doing a very
good job of keeping this.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.271
And we have to wonder why
it was that they didn't

00:37:49.271 --> 00:37:50.920
do more work to get this right.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.630
If you figure that people are
working crops and everything,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.213
and they actually
predict these things

00:37:55.213 --> 00:37:58.086
by astronomical phenomenon,
if you had a calendar that

00:37:58.086 --> 00:38:00.210
could actually predict when
those things were going

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.543
to happen, you could make plans.

00:38:01.543 --> 00:38:03.580
It's another idea about
what the future was

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.540
like for Greeks and Romans.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.980
But part of this is that this
calendar under this system

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.250
could be manipulated.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.817
People could use it for various
purposes, most especially

00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:15.150
among these is if you had
somebody who was in office who

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.859
you wanted to stay
in office, you

00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:18.150
could add an intercalary month.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.650
And he could get
another month of office.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.024
It made perfect
sense if you were

00:38:21.024 --> 00:38:22.370
trying to accomplish something.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.780
If there were somebody you
wanted to keep out of office,

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.742
you could add an
extra month, or you

00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:27.950
wouldn't add the extra money.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.080
Or you could add an extra
month before he went in,

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.080
and he wouldn't be able to
go in for an extra month.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.580
If you wanted to just
keep ticking along,

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.140
you would allow it
to keep ticking on.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.764
And we can see some
expressions of this

00:38:36.764 --> 00:38:39.800
with a highly charged
political figure as well.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.080
And there is no more highly
charged political figure

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.250
in the ancient world
really than Cicero.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.270
So when Cicero was
doing his Cicero thing,

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.760
he was sent off to be the
governor of Cilicia, 51 and 50

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.160
BCE.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.900
And we have his letters, letters
to his friends and his family

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.760
and specifically--
and most importantly,

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.740
perhaps-- to his best friend,
this guy named Atticus.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.550
And Atticus was an
important politician.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.540
He was equestrian, sort
of a wealthy person,

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.270
but not in the senatorial order,
probably for his own decision.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.460
He didn't want to be.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.187
But Cicero, when
he's off to Cilicia,

00:39:12.187 --> 00:39:14.020
which is in southern
Turkey, to be governor,

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.216
he wants nothing more than to
get back to the city of Rome.

00:39:17.216 --> 00:39:18.840
His letters are
actually hilarious when

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.520
he's leaving because he's
talking about how miserable he

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.400
is and how awful this is.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.320
And he just can't
wait to get back.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.380
And he just hopes there isn't
a battle, because he is not

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.080
a fighting man.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.210
And he doesn't want
to have to fight.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.680
But these letters to Atticus are
really interesting about this.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.890
So he starts out by
saying-- and this

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.350
is-- I've got the dates
right here-- the 14th of June

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.950
in 51 BC.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.580
"Bu remember one thing."

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.810
It's Atticus, we
could add to this.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.350
"You are away now
when it doesn't arise

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.037
but will return in time, so
you have written back to me."

00:39:47.037 --> 00:39:49.370
So he's saying that you've
gone out of the city of Rome,

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:53.200
but you're going to go back,
according to your letter.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.630
And then he asks him, "to see
personally and through all

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.910
our friends, Hortensius
first and foremost"--

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.400
so another powerful politician--
"that my years stays as it is

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.260
and that no new
decree is passed.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.260
Indeed, while I am about
it, I am half inclined

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.460
to ask you to resist any
intercalation as well.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.840
But I must not put
everything on your shoulders.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.512
The year then, hold fast
to whatever happens."

00:40:15.512 --> 00:40:16.720
So Cicero is out of the city.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.960
His enemies are of course
glad to get rid of him.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.317
Anybody who doesn't
like his speeches

00:40:21.317 --> 00:40:22.400
is glad to get rid of him.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.210
He could talk.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.312
But he's concerned
then, the first point,

00:40:26.312 --> 00:40:28.020
that somebody's going
to add another year

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.150
to his term as
governor, and he's

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.760
going to have to stay in
Cilicia for more than a year.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.060
He really doesn't want that.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.040
But he doesn't even
want anybody then

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.020
to intercalate or to
add an extra month so

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.310
that he has to stay in
Cilicia for another month.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.601
You can see the way that the
politicians would do this.

00:40:40.601 --> 00:40:43.110
And it seems to be a very
real fear for Cicero.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.154
And as he's sort
of off presumably

00:40:45.154 --> 00:40:46.570
just writing letters
like a madman

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.010
because he doesn't really
want to be in Cilicia at all,

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.760
he writes another letter a month
and a half later on July 26, 51

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.370
BC.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.770
And he says, "To come back
to affairs of the town."

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.890
That is, city, of course--
that is, the city of Rome.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.590
"For mercy's sake, as
you are staying in Rome,

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.970
do pray first and foremost,
build up a powerful defensive

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.614
position to ensure that
my term remains annual"--

00:41:09.614 --> 00:41:11.530
that I only have to be
in Cilicia for a year--

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.700
"without intercalation even."

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.190
So he's still concerned.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.195
And now he's not
even saying, I'm not

00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:17.600
going to ask you to do
this, because it's a pain.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.769
Now a month later, he's
like, get me out of here.

00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:21.310
And he wants to get
back to the city.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.976
And he's very concerned
then that people

00:41:22.976 --> 00:41:25.160
aren't going to let him.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.586
Now this problem continued on.

00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:28.460
And it basically continued
on from this point

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.350
for another four years or so.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.580
And then Julius Caesar, at
the end of his civil wars,

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.245
went through and
reformed the calendar,

00:41:35.245 --> 00:41:37.870
knowing that it was off, knowing
that it was being manipulated,

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.834
knowing that
these-- well, hoping

00:41:39.834 --> 00:41:41.500
that these types of
political wranglings

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.930
that led to this sort of
thing and the disasters

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:46.600
of 50 years of civil war
that had preceded this,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.310
continuing during this
period when Cicero was off

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.042
in Cilicia-- that he could
correct these-- well,

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.750
he could bring the
world back into order,

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.230
harmonize the calendar,
the sort of symbolic nature

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.700
of the calendar, and make
everything regular again.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.452
And he did his
darndnest to do so.

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.410
And he seems to have
created the perfect system

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.220
to do this, which is essentially
the calendar that we have now.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.830
However, somebody
misread his instructions,

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.860
and they put in a leap
year every three years

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.240
instead of every four years.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.830
And this just has to do with
the Roman numbering system.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.580
He said, every three years--
he said, every four years.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.740
And they counted inclusively,
as they tend to do,

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.520
and did it every
three years instead.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.260
And that got
everything screwed up.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.240
So it got out of whack
a little bit again.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.510
And then Augustus corrected
this in about 10 or 9 BCE,

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.330
implemented it probably in 8.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.049
And he did this essentially
by getting the calendar back

00:42:37.049 --> 00:42:39.340
on track and then making sure
that the leap years would

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.810
happen every four years,
not recognizing of course

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.895
that 100 years that
aren't divisible by 4

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.270
shouldn't actually
be leap years.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.350
That's what Gregory fixed
for us in the 16th century.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.050
Now this is an interesting
time for Augustus as well.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:55.572
So he held just about every
important political position

00:42:55.572 --> 00:42:56.530
that you could in Rome.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.140
Those that he didn't
hold, he was in a position

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.056
where he could just
appoint people or nominate

00:43:00.056 --> 00:43:01.350
them to take these positions.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.960
Except he was not
the Pontifex Maximus,

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.200
until the death of
this guy that he

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.680
had been aligned
with long before

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.870
but had actually
exiles in 36, a guy

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.200
named Lepidus, who
then had the gall

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.520
to survive in exile for
25 years and then died

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.600
in late 13 or early 12 BC.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.715
And then Augustus could
become Pontifex Maximus,

00:43:22.715 --> 00:43:24.340
which then gave him
the power of course

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.840
to correct the
calendar because this

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.950
was within the authority
of the pontifices,

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.790
and bring the world into order.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.140
And something that
he did very quickly.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.570
And he commemorated this by
building a type of monument.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.950
So he erected an Egyptian
obelisk, which you can see.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.170
So here is a Google
Earth, of course,

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.780
picture of the city of Rome.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.890
Just about up here is where
he erected this thing.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.290
A closer picture of it.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.590
This is the Palazzo
Montecitorio in Rome.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.002
The Italian senate house
is the big building

00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:54.960
that you can see there.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.156
And the obelisk
itself is right there.

00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:58.780
It's sort of distorted
in this picture.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.155
Don't get distracted
by that one.

00:44:00.155 --> 00:44:02.040
That's the column
of Marcus Aurelius.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.950
This is about 200 meters,
I think, from where

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.200
it was originally erected.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.180
But it gives us a good idea
of what Augustus was actually

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.920
doing.

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.080
So here you can see the obelisk.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.550
And he was using
it then as a gnomon

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:18.200
for an enormous calendrical
device, we'll call it.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.690
Within academic
circles, the debate

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.270
rages on about whether this
was a sundial of the type

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.540
that you see here
in the drawings

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.660
or whether it was just
a meridian, meaning just

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.340
the north south
line within that.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.450
All we have preserved for
us is the north south line.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.140
You can read a huge
amount of literature

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.070
about this, all very
fascinating, and form

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:35.780
your own opinion.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.095
But we needn't do that today.

00:44:37.095 --> 00:44:43.664
Now the significance of this
sort of is multifaceted.

00:44:43.664 --> 00:44:46.080
So there's certainly this idea
of correcting the calendar,

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.500
bringing the world back
into order in a way

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.554
that it had never been
in the Greek world.

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:51.720
Although at least it was OK.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.150
But really, it was out of
whack in the Roman world.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.180
And Julius Caesar then tried
to bring things in order in 46.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.210
But he was of course
assassinated in 44.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.820
We went back to civil war.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.920
And then Augustus, now
holding all the power

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.490
in the Roman world,
could bring things right

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.199
and properly into their own
or into an orderly fashion.

00:45:10.199 --> 00:45:12.490
And now the manner in which
he did this is interesting.

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.800
So the solar
calendar is probably

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.240
related to the solar calendar
that had been used in Egypt,

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.800
like, forever.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.270
And importing that Egyptian
model of the calendar into Rome

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.590
also did something to
express Augustus' power,

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.390
that he had brought Egypt
into the Roman world.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.870
We'll see an overt expression
of that in just a minute.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.620
And of course, within
that power of Egypt,

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.490
he could then do things
like bring obelisks

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.210
into the city of Rome.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.599
This obelisk is
almost 22 meters tall.

00:45:37.599 --> 00:45:38.640
It's absolutely enormous.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.829
Again, you can go see it today.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:43.370
And he set it up
just about this time

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.280
that he was correcting
the calendar.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.120
Right.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:49.990
And it has all
these things to do

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.600
with his personal power and
the power of the Roman people

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.130
and then also this
imposition of peace,

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.800
as we've seen with
Julius Caesar as well.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.830
And here's a transcription
of the inscription

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.810
that Augustus put on the
base of this obelisk.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:06.290
It says, "The Emperor Caesar
Augustus, son of the divine"--

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:09.370
that is, Julius Caesar,
who had been made a god--

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.040
"Pontifex Maximus"-- interesting
that he puts this here,

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.890
also a single line just
recording that one title

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:15.910
of his.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.285
And this is the one that he
had just acquired and allowed

00:46:18.285 --> 00:46:19.530
him to change the calendar.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.380
"Hailed as conqueror 12
times, consul 11 times,

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.830
holding tribunician power
for the 14th time"--

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:25.990
that's the power that,
among other things,

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:27.781
allowed him to veto
any legislation that he

00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:32.450
didn't like-- "with Egypt having
been brought into the power

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.950
of the Roman people,
dedicated this to the sun."

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.500
So he put up this monument
because Egypt had been

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.120
brought into the Roman world.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.870
So this is another
expression of the power

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.670
and the antiquity
of the Roman world,

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.020
though this obelisk isn't
as old as one might suspect,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:51.060
though pretty old
by our standards.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.880
But also-- yeah,
bringing that in and then

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.296
showing the power of course
that he can import all of this

00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:57.244
and regularize the
calendrical world.

00:46:57.244 --> 00:46:58.410
So a very Interesting thing.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.860
And he was not alone in
this type of expression,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.396
as we'll see in just a minute.

00:47:02.396 --> 00:47:04.020
We can see however
a little bit of this

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.560
and what the actual device that
August built had looked like.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.710
So this is the actual paving.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:12.640
This is probably actually
maybe Domitianic paving,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.385
so paving from later
in the 1st century.

00:47:14.385 --> 00:47:16.760
But very interesting, written
in Greek, so some knowledge

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.468
of the Greek world
then as well, which is

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.310
no surprise in the Roman world.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.240
And each of these
marks then would

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.140
have marked where the
shadow of the obelisk

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.580
should have fallen on any
given day of the year,

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.580
going all the way out to
the furthest one, which

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.680
would be the winter solstice.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.075
And then marked on the sides
are various weather things.

00:47:35.075 --> 00:47:36.950
So the one that I've
highlighted here for you

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:42.569
is [SPEAKING GREEK], which
means the Etesian winds stop.

00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:44.360
These are the northern
winds in the Aegian,

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.350
which don't actually even
make it to Rome really.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.266
So it's sort of strange
that he would do this.

00:47:48.266 --> 00:47:50.380
There's another one
on there though that

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.960
talks about the summer.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.461
And then it's got signs of the
Zodiac written up the edges.

00:47:55.461 --> 00:47:57.210
So you can track exactly
what type of year

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:01.540
it is based on this monument.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.016
And here's just a
drawing if you're

00:48:03.016 --> 00:48:04.390
more interested
in seeing what it

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.890
looks like sort of cleaned up.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.720
Now within the Roman world
too though, the calendar

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.780
could be manipulated in
various ways as well.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.330
And still, expressions of
individuality and conformity

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.465
were able to be given.

00:48:19.465 --> 00:48:21.840
So here's a great inscription,
another Greek inscription.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.673
I've just given you the
English for this one

00:48:23.673 --> 00:48:25.714
though because otherwise
it becomes unwieldy,

00:48:25.714 --> 00:48:27.380
which is an idea of
the interaction then

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.046
between the Greek
calendar and the Roman

00:48:29.046 --> 00:48:31.030
calendar under Augustus.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.450
So it says, "It has been
decreed by the Greeks in Asia"--

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.810
so this is Asia, meaning
basically Western Turkey,

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:40.610
most of Turkey-- "that the New
Year's first month shall be

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:43.070
for all cities on the ninth
day before the Kalends

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.230
of October"-- that
is, September 23--

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.840
"which is the
birthday of Augustus.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.560
In order that each time the day
might correspond in each city,

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.520
the Greeks shall use the Greek
day along with the Roman.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.577
They all make the first
month called Caesar,

00:48:55.577 --> 00:48:57.660
as previously decreed"--
the Greeks like to repeat

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.670
themselves in inscriptions--
"begin with the ninth day

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.320
before the Kalends of October,
the birth of Caesar, Augustus.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.780
Computations of the month
shall be as follows.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.650
Caesar, 31."

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.826
And it goes out and gives the
length of each of the months.

00:49:11.826 --> 00:49:13.950
"And for each month, the
beginning of the new month

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.630
shall be the ninth day
before the Kalends."

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:16.645
That is, about the 23rd.

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.420
"The intercalated
day shall always

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.290
be that of the
intercalated Kalends

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.690
of the month of Xandikos."

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.380
We can go through and calculate
exactly how this all works.

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.390
It turns out then that
Xandikos is march.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.930
The Kalends is the 1st of March.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.760
So putting leap day basically
right in where it should

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.520
be in the Roman calendar.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.242
You can see this then as sort
of a type of assimilation here,

00:49:41.242 --> 00:49:43.200
that the Greeks are
keeping their own calendar.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.730
They're keeping the
names and everything.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.900
They're keeping their own
start date for the year

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.580
but manipulating it in such a
way that it aligns with Rome

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.474
and of course honors Augustus.

00:49:52.474 --> 00:49:54.140
And the introduction
to this inscription

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.820
is also extremely interesting.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:00.515
It sounds like the beginning
of some Christian texts and all

00:50:00.515 --> 00:50:02.560
the amazing things that
it says about Augustus

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.900
and how his birth was the
beginning of the world

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.900
and all of these things.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.054
So an interesting
phenomenon and way

00:50:08.054 --> 00:50:09.970
to manipulate the calendar
in the Greek world.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.094
If you think about that
sort of fierce independence

00:50:12.094 --> 00:50:14.430
that we had seen a few
centuries earlier in Greece,

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:15.888
you see a very
different expression

00:50:15.888 --> 00:50:19.540
of it, a very mollified
or softened expression

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:22.280
of that in the Roman world.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.560
However, at the
same time though, we

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.500
can see some displays-- and
this one particular display--

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.260
of calendrical resistance.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.470
Now the Greeks were only
willing to go so far

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:33.930
to change their calendar.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.460
But even in the 2nd century CE,
when this calendar was made--

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.670
it's called the
Coligny calendar--

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.340
we can see an entirely
different calendrical system

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.890
being used in the Roman world.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:49.190
So this was recovered about
50 miles or so west of Geneva

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.450
in France.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.084
And it is a calendar, but
it's an entirely different

00:50:53.084 --> 00:50:54.500
calendrical system
than the Roman.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.460
It's a Celtic calendar.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.210
It's actually our
earliest piece of Celtic

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:59.320
writing that we have surviving.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.010
And it proposes a calendrical
cycle, a five year lunar

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:07.690
cycle with 60 months in
it, which is 12 per year,

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.790
with days varying in
length from 30 to 29 days.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:14.770
And its details are
fairly poorly understood.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.095
But you can see in this
exactly how different it

00:51:17.095 --> 00:51:18.250
is from a Roman system.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:22.190
So there are names of
months on it, which

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.030
I've just highlighted for you.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.580
You can see a little bit,
so Equos there and Samon.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.510
So there are 29
day months and then

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.935
something called
[? Devertomu ?].

00:51:36.935 --> 00:51:37.810
And you can see that.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:40.040
So there it is right at
the top there, kind of just

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.890
above Samon.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.340
There are good
days and bad days,

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.850
like the fas and nefas
days of the Roman calendar.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:49.580
You can see those,
mat and anmat.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.410
Anmatu, it actually is.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.220
And months are divided in
half, strangely enough,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.540
in a way that they kind
of are in the Roman system

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.590
but not as explicitly.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:01.279
So the atenoux that you
see here means renewal.

00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:02.820
And this sort of
continues on through

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.910
the Irish Celtic tradition
as well, as do things

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:10.350
like Samon and these festivals
that we see at various times

00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.142
here as well.

00:52:13.142 --> 00:52:15.100
Without going into great
detail of this though,

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.920
we can see that it is
an entirely different

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.980
calendrical system.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.650
It's used over a century and
a half-- at least a century

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.150
and a half, probably closer to
two centuries-- from the time

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.858
that this part of Gaul
had been conquered

00:52:25.858 --> 00:52:28.110
by Julius Caesar, oddly enough.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:30.110
And yet this calendar
continues on.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:33.110
You can see however-- well, you
can see great resistance also

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.360
in that all of the festivals
that are on this calendar

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.070
are different from those
in the Roman calendar.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:41.180
There are also no notes within
this calendar of any Roman

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.210
events.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:46.910
So used completely separately
from the Roman calendar.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.830
However, it is written
in the Latin alphabet,

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.450
so some sort of assimilation.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.150
And it is written in a very
similar form to the way

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.680
that you would find a
Roman calendar in as much

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.610
as-- if we go back
to the back here,

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.230
all this stuff--
you can see that it

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.980
is in nice neat columns.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.770
And each of the
days in the calendar

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.710
has a little hole next to it.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:06.660
It's a peg hole.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.440
It's something that we call
a parapegma, of which there

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.260
are many from the
Greek and Roman world.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.290
So you can see some
cultural assimilation here

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.050
in sort of using this format for
a calendar which we don't have

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.030
expressed in any different
way and yet this resistance

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.620
by using a calendar
which is entirely

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.036
different than the
Roman calendar.

00:53:24.442 --> 00:53:26.900
And you can see persistence of
calendars in many other ways

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.399
too.

00:53:27.399 --> 00:53:29.410
We can track some
aspects of this calendar

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.560
through the Celtic world
and the Middle Ages

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.520
for a fairly long time.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.020
We can see of course
the persistence

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.395
of the Roman
calendar, in as much

00:53:36.395 --> 00:53:38.390
as we basically use it today.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.110
The Catholic Church
kind of picked it up.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:41.790
Gregory modified
it a little bit.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.850
But it's essentially
the Roman calendar,

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.820
simplified to express
the days of the month

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.890
rather than from the
Kalends, Nones, and Ides.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.480
And yet, there are
resistances to this

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.140
that have lasted for
2000 years, parts

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.570
of the world that refuse to
use this calendar even today.

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.360
And we can think about
the ways that calendars

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.675
shape what we think about.

00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:03.050
You could think
about, of course,

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.960
Google Calendar, the way that
that actually affects people.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.820
I mean, ways-- the ways that
they envision what their day is

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.611
going to look like.

00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:10.950
We give them-- now you
have infinite opportunities

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.081
to envision your month
however you like.

00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:15.330
I use a calendar that shows
an entire month on one day

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.300
because I don't
have a lot to do.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.470
Other people have every
15 minutes planned out

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.880
because they have more
things to do anyway.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.960
But we can see these
things very different.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.760
Even when making a printed
calendar or something

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.803
like Google Calendar,
there are infinite choices

00:54:29.803 --> 00:54:30.678
that one has to make.

00:54:30.678 --> 00:54:33.320
What holidays are chosen
to appear on a calendar,

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.516
and which aren't?

00:54:34.516 --> 00:54:36.140
Sometimes I just see
the weirdest thing

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.420
appear on the little
calendar that I

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:38.571
buy from Mead every year.

00:54:38.571 --> 00:54:40.820
And I wonder, wow, why did
they put that on this year?

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.220
Who knows?

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.910
It was important to
somebody, and now these

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:44.090
are things that I'm aware of.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.215
It sort of brings them at
least into the mainstream

00:54:46.215 --> 00:54:47.290
of my thinking.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.040
One of the things that
I love about Google

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.998
too is that you get the--
what do you call it--

00:54:50.998 --> 00:54:53.510
Google Doodles every
day, which are in a way

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:54.570
a type of calendar.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.320
It marks something
important on every day.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.528
Some of those are very weird
things that they put on.

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.350
Some are brilliant.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:01.370
Some are-- they,
like, changed my life.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.150
I learn something
amazing every day.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:04.805
And some of them
are, this is the day

00:55:04.805 --> 00:55:06.124
that "Star Wars" came out.

00:55:06.124 --> 00:55:08.290
But if you think about that
as a cultural expression

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.952
in a type of calendar, it
really affects our lives

00:55:10.952 --> 00:55:11.910
in many important ways.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.570
And it expresses little
bits of our culture.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.144
But then as you think
about calendars and clocks

00:55:17.144 --> 00:55:19.060
in many ways as well,
you think about the ways

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.770
that these affect global
commerce and communication.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.360
We saw that a
little bit thinking

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.685
about the Greek
inscriptions, that you

00:55:24.685 --> 00:55:26.351
have different places
that use different

00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:29.350
calendars but still
manage to conduct business

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:30.440
with one another.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.660
As you think about
this, expressing time

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.040
in a much smaller term,
thinking about clocks,

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.784
think about the importance
of time keeping for GPS.

00:55:37.784 --> 00:55:39.950
This is something-- the
only that way we can-- well,

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:41.470
basically the only way
I can navigate myself

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.490
any place other than in New
York, where the roads are

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.560
nice and straight, is
having some sort of system

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.960
to tell me where
things actually are.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.699
And even within that, if you
think even further than that,

00:55:50.699 --> 00:55:52.115
if you think about
commerce, think

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.906
about the importance
of time keeping as far

00:55:53.906 --> 00:55:55.260
as Wall Street is concerned.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.510
Every one of those
transactions that go through

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.890
are timed down to the
picosecond or something

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.210
these days to which
one goes through first.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.400
So the ability to keep
time and to know time

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.110
becomes very, very important
in just about every aspect

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.042
of our lives.

00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:10.250
It's interesting to see that
these things are equally

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.330
true in the ancient world.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.510
So if you have any questions,
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.440
It's a big subject.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.710
But thank you very much.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:27.250
Anybody have questions?

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:27.750
Yeah?

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.220
AUDIENCE: The idea
of anniversaries.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.200
What gave rise to those?

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.741
I assume those
weren't always around.

00:56:31.741 --> 00:56:33.630
But what gave rise
to this belief

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:37.550
that, for whatever reason,
365-ish after an event happened

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.795
was somehow significant?

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:40.849
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah.

00:56:40.849 --> 00:56:42.140
That's an interesting question.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.360
I mean, certainly the
Romans celebrated birthdays.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.920
And they would know when
somebody's birthday happened.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.410
A lot of that, I
think, is astrological.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.532
If you think about--
Augustus's birthday is

00:56:54.532 --> 00:56:56.990
an interesting example
of this, recognizing

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.575
that it was when the sun
was in this position,

00:56:59.575 --> 00:57:01.100
and the stars were
in this position,

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.010
something happened,
to commemorate that.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.385
I mean, I think
there's something

00:57:04.385 --> 00:57:07.190
that's innately human
about commemorating things.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.606
I'm not sure that
we can get that,

00:57:08.606 --> 00:57:10.820
get to exactly what that is.

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:12.910
But within these
calendars also, there's

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.010
nothing, especially
something like that,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:16.750
which is above manipulation.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.000
If you think about the way
that the Roman calendar was

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.630
when August was born-- what, 63
BC-- the calendar was a mess.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.540
It was someplace between two
and a half and four months off.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.671
So the day he was born-- how do
you count that, what day it is?

00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:35.920
Now Augustus himself decided
that the way he was going

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.294
to count that was to say that
it happened at the autumnal

00:57:38.294 --> 00:57:42.430
equinox on September
23, which is always

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.820
picked up in different ways.

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.602
And certainly, as you
can see, religion.

00:57:46.602 --> 00:57:48.060
Doing something on
the same year is

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.720
supposed to propitiate the gods
in some way, that in some way

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.580
it's ordained that these things
happened at a given time.

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.989
But there's also something
extremely arbitrary about it,

00:57:55.989 --> 00:57:57.780
especially when, I
suppose, powerful people

00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:58.500
become involved.

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:02.536
I don't know.

00:58:02.536 --> 00:58:03.560
It's difficult to say.

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.520
But yeah, there
is-- the flexibility

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:10.759
of dates is an
interesting thing.

00:58:10.759 --> 00:58:11.300
Anybody else?

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:11.720
Yeah.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.511
AUDIENCE: How did people
arrange to meet up

00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:15.495
in the era before
precise time keeping?

00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:16.870
ALEXANDER MEYER:
Like day to day?

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:18.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:19.730
ALEXANDER MEYER:
Well basically, you

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:23.370
can use the sun as a sundial
of sorts at any given time.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:25.120
There certainly were
sundials around.

00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.990
There's a guy named
Richard Talbert, who's

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:29.290
I think still working if his
book hasn't come out, all

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:31.270
about portable
sundials in antiquity.

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:32.570
People just carried
sundials around with them.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:33.740
The problem with
that is figuring out

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:36.550
exactly where north and south
are to get your sundial right.

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.384
But basically, that was it.

00:58:38.384 --> 00:58:40.050
So at the archaeological
site I work at,

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.640
a place called Vindolanda
in northern England,

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.060
we have writing tablets.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.640
And basically, when you get
a time of day mentioned,

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.540
it's like noon or dawn or dusk.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.440
And that's about it.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.575
Beyond that, you can use
various Bear Grylls means

00:58:54.575 --> 00:58:56.700
of figuring out what time
it is, which is basically

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.784
to hold your hand
up to the horizon

00:58:58.784 --> 00:59:00.200
and then put one
on top of another

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.030
until you get to an hour.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.860
But that doesn't work very
well in England in the winter,

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.720
because the sun
never gets that high.

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.490
But basically, they're rounding
way off, very simple times

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:11.950
rather than very specific times.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:14.560
So if you had to be
at some place at 3:05,

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.320
get there at 2:30.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.154
That'd be my advice.

00:59:16.154 --> 00:59:17.903
Unless you were the
more important person,

00:59:17.903 --> 00:59:18.740
then wait till 4:00.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.100
They'd be waiting
outside your house.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.656
AUDIENCE: Just the
less important person

00:59:21.656 --> 00:59:23.880
ends up waiting around for
arbitrary amounts of time?

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.170
ALEXANDER MEYER: Basically.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.240
Yeah.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.400
I mean, I'd say Rome was
a very hierarchical world.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.816
And people built
into their houses

00:59:27.816 --> 00:59:30.860
these big benches where
their clients would just come

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.110
and wait for them to turn up.

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:34.759
And we do this.

00:59:34.759 --> 00:59:36.550
They do it in movies
anyway, where somebody

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:37.650
comes to a meeting,
and the guy's

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:38.770
in his office not
doing anything.

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.760
He just makes the guy
wait for a little while.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.010
You get the same kind of
thing in antiquity, I'm sure.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.120
Anything else?

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.348
Yeah?

00:59:47.348 --> 00:59:49.768
AUDIENCE: So since
it was so complicated

00:59:49.768 --> 00:59:53.817
to calculate these times, do
you trust historical records

00:59:53.817 --> 00:59:54.608
when you find them?

00:59:54.608 --> 00:59:56.382
Like, you say, oh, they said
that this month corresponds

00:59:56.382 --> 00:59:57.512
to that month.

00:59:57.512 --> 01:00:01.164
Hmm, maybe I should take
that with a grain of salt.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.080
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.130
You have to be careful
about these things.

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.820
So there are anchor points
that we have in time, things

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:11.460
like eclipses that we can figure
out exactly when they happened.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.250
The chronology, long length
chronology in the ancient world

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.510
is an extremely dodgy subject.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:20.330
And I got interested
into it a while.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.230
And I realized that
there would be madness.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:25.040
It's going to drive me crazy
because once you start picking

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.070
at that house of
cards, it's in danger

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.320
of tumbling at any moment.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.870
So we do have to
be very careful.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:32.870
And really what you look
for in those situations

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:34.310
is some sort of confirmation.

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:36.690
And we have lists
of consuls in Rome

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:38.310
and various events
which we can rely

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:41.470
on to some point in the past.

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:43.720
But there are also points
at which the records in Rome

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.220
were lost.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.044
It burned.

01:00:45.044 --> 01:00:46.960
But we have copies of
them, but you don't know

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.359
if those are the real copies.

01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:50.400
So you have to be really
careful in figuring out,

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.580
especially the further
back you go in time,

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.070
exactly when things happened.

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.030
But things get better.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.530
And there's still a few debates
about this, about the Middle

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.790
Ages and whether we have
the right number of years

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.840
in what we used to think
about as the Dark Ages, now

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.180
medieval times.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.860
And some argue that we're
a couple hundred years off.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.990
So yeah.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:12.010
And in some ways,
we can correct that

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:13.720
by looking at tree
rings and things

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.200
and sort of get a better idea.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:18.317
But yes, you have to be
skeptical about dates for sure

01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:19.400
and look for confirmation.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.437
We try to find independent
literary sources

01:01:21.437 --> 01:01:23.770
for things that aren't using
the same literary tradition

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:25.030
and just mimicking it.

01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:27.650
And that can be
problematic at times.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.480
But we do have lots
of sources, starting

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.830
in really the imperial period
in Rome that are pretty good.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:34.470
That's part of the
reason that I stick

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.300
to Roman imperial history.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.160
Yeah?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.800
AUDIENCE: You mentioned-- most
of these examples of these

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.600
actually being used seem to
be kind of political, having

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.880
to do with decrees and things.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.240
Are there other examples of
when calendars would be applied,

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.892
like for agriculture
or astronomy.

01:01:49.892 --> 01:01:51.610
Maybe they weren't useful,
because it was so ad hoc.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.026
ALEXANDER MEYER:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:53.026 --> 01:01:55.520
So I alluded at one
point to a parapegma,

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.360
of which would have two
or more parapegmata.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.450
And we have several of these
from the ancient world--

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.050
several, many,
depending on how you

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.897
look at it, of these--
in various forms

01:02:04.897 --> 01:02:07.230
from the ancient world, some
literary and some physical.

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:08.646
And the idea was
that you're going

01:02:08.646 --> 01:02:10.710
to move a peg from day
to day and tell the time.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:13.490
And some of these are
specifically astrological.

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.430
And so they talk about the
rising and setting of stars

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.230
throughout courses of the year.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.900
And then some of them
are a combination

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.307
of astrological and agricultural
so that people like Columella

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:26.390
write and say, OK, well,
you should-- and I'm just

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.515
going to make something up.

01:02:27.515 --> 01:02:30.000
I am not a farming man-- that
you should plant your corn

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.295
at the vernal equinox.

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:34.920
And it gives us a good idea then
of how these things were done.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.180
And you can see then the
importance of calendars

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:39.890
as we go through history.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.310
And this becomes particularly
important after the Julian

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.060
calendar reforms and
the Augustan calendar

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.960
reforms to a lesser extent
because you could then

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.380
count on the same thing
happening on the same day.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.460
So if you were going
to plant something

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.020
on the autumnal equinox, you
knew that the autumnal equinox

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.002
was going to happen on or about
the 22nd or 23rd of September.

01:02:59.002 --> 01:03:02.429
It really changes the world
in a kind of nice way.

01:03:02.429 --> 01:03:04.970
It didn't then require people
to do astrological observations

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:05.980
regularly.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.850
But rather, it becomes a
predictive calendar rather than

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:11.540
a sort of expressive calendar.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.850
And we get these-- what
else would you get?

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.045
Those are the big ones,
astrology, astronomy.

01:03:17.045 --> 01:03:18.420
And in the ancient
world, there's

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.200
a very fine line between
astrology and astronomy

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.530
and agriculture.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:24.920
And then there's the
political ones, so three

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.890
or four categories.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:26.390
Yeah.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.221
Oh, you're welcome.

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:29.054
AUDIENCE: With all these
different calendars

01:03:29.054 --> 01:03:31.187
in different city-states,
how did they rectify them

01:03:31.187 --> 01:03:34.247
when it came to pan-Hellenic
festivals and games,

01:03:34.247 --> 01:03:35.330
specifically the Olympics.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.370
ALEXANDER MEYER: Oh,
that's a great question.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:36.930
Yeah.

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:39.013
And there's actually a
whole field of debate about

01:03:39.013 --> 01:03:42.224
when exactly those
happened, when in the year.

01:03:42.224 --> 01:03:44.016
AUDIENCE: So the answer
is we don't know?

01:03:44.016 --> 01:03:44.932
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah.

01:03:44.932 --> 01:03:47.234
The answer would be that it
was very difficult to do.

01:03:47.234 --> 01:03:48.650
So these dates
would be announced,

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:49.610
and then people would
have to calculate

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:51.318
the difference in
their calendar and know

01:03:51.318 --> 01:03:53.016
exactly when to arrive.

01:03:53.016 --> 01:03:55.390
AUDIENCE: You assume some
city-states just showed up late

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:56.160
because they counted wrong.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.280
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.250
And there are
things about people

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.850
being banned from the games
because they didn't get there

01:03:58.850 --> 01:03:59.610
in time.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:00.524
And yeah.

01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:01.440
These things happened.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.380
So they either arrive a
month early or something.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.910
And then people didn't,
and they got in trouble.

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.576
And they weren't
allowed to participate.

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.031
It's all political though.

01:04:08.031 --> 01:04:09.875
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
intentionally using

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:11.720
another state's calendar wrong.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.880
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.900
Yeah, to get some
sort of advantage.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.433
Yeah, it's fantastic.

01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:16.932
Yeah?

01:04:16.932 --> 01:04:17.400
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.212
What are the surviving
mediums in which

01:04:19.212 --> 01:04:20.420
these inscriptions are found?

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.820
What's some of the craziest
forms in which they

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.570
marked stuff down?

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:29.960
ALEXANDER MEYER: So the
ones that survive to us,

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.170
most of them come on stone.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.650
We have only durable
materials mostly.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:36.170
So most of them are on stone.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.340
Many Roman inscriptions
are on bronze,

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.790
especially-- we
get a lot of them

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:43.830
from Spain, where they've
been basically hammered

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.190
into a bronze sheet.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:46.920
Those are great,
except not many of them

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.461
ultimately survive
because they could

01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:50.950
be melted down and made into
something more useful, which

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:53.450
people did.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:56.452
Lots of things we know
were written on wood.

01:04:56.452 --> 01:04:57.910
We still have
preserved from places

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.526
like Pompeii and
Herculaneum many,

01:04:59.526 --> 01:05:01.650
many inscriptions that were
just written on plaster

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.620
walls, painted on them.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.930
We have inscriptions that were
painted on ceramic as well,

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.960
so on pots and stuff, that
say what was in them or jugs

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.250
about how much they
had or who owned them,

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.465
how much was held in
it or who owned them.

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:17.090
From Vindolanda and
a few other places,

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:21.170
we have wooden writing tablets,
where they're just ink on wood.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:23.290
And we have hundreds
of those surviving

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.420
and know that there must have
been an infinite number of them

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.410
in antiquity that just haven't
for various reasons survived

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:32.032
to us.

01:05:32.032 --> 01:05:33.490
I think all sorts
of just household

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.785
implements that have
stuff written on them,

01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:38.510
mostly just names
of people, sometimes

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:43.050
dirty poetry or little bits
of verse of some variety.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.870
They come on all
sorts of things.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:45.870
What else would you get?

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.900
I mean, you also get
things like mosaics.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.885
And there was actually writing
in mosaics or pieces of glass

01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:53.520
that have writing on
them, which are very cool.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.140
And you blow the glass or
form it in some sort of mold.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.860
It would put the
writing right into it.

01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.410
Those are very cool.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.780
What else do we have?

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.105
Pieces of armor,
weapons, anything.

01:06:05.105 --> 01:06:07.230
AUDIENCE: Is it true that
people wrote inscriptions

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.610
on sling stones,
like Pilatus would--

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:09.740
ALEXANDER MEYER: Oh, yeah.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.574
AUDIENCE: It would say,
like, F Mark Antony.

01:06:11.574 --> 01:06:12.740
ALEXANDER MEYER: Absolutely.

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:13.250
Yeah.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.410
Yeah.

01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:14.950
And you see those on
pictures from World War II,

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:16.741
where they're like,
happy birthday, Hitler.

01:06:16.741 --> 01:06:18.460
And then they send
the rocket shells off.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.740
You get the same thing
from the ancient world.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.030
Yeah.

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.570
They say mostly very
unfortunate things

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:23.236
about people and
members of their family

01:06:23.236 --> 01:06:25.430
and what they should do
with these ballista balls

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:28.164
when they arrive at
their destination.

01:06:28.164 --> 01:06:29.080
Yeah.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.580
Yes?

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.537
AUDIENCE: So is
there any correlation

01:06:32.537 --> 01:06:34.495
between sort of the
evolution of the technology

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:36.490
and the evolution
of these calendars?

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.220
Because it seems
from your talk almost

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.280
like the sort of basic
understanding of astronomy

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.481
is more or less there, and
the variations that are made

01:06:45.481 --> 01:06:49.230
are largely driven by
politics or things like that.

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.480
But I'm just curious
as to whether there's

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.690
any sort of technology
running underneath

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:57.540
is as an undercurrent
as the calendars evolve.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.910
ALEXANDER MEYER: Yeah, there is.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:04.590
So when you get to
the 6th century or so,

01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:06.702
really science becomes a thing.

01:07:06.702 --> 01:07:08.910
People are really thinking
critically about the world

01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.390
and trying to determine things.

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:12.560
You get people like
a guy named Meton,

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.920
who erected what looks like
some sort of sundial thing

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.532
on the Pnyx in
Athens to demonstrate

01:07:21.532 --> 01:07:23.900
that this is how
the year progresses

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.640
and exactly how long it is.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.250
And we can-- he actually
proposed a different cycle

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.540
for the number of years
and a more accurate one.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.530
It wasn't really picked
up particularly rapidly.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:36.400
But there are people who were
working on this sort of thing.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.740
And it gets to the point where
better and better methods

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.132
of keeping time, like
short term time, were used.

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:43.840
And you could get to
a better calculation

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.842
than of what exactly
a year looked like

01:07:46.842 --> 01:07:49.900
or what it felt
like or what it is.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.370
But there's no great leap
really from the 5th century

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.930
to the end of the Roman world.

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:59.540
We start building clocks in the
Middle Ages, mechanical clocks.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:04.714
But we have records of-- and
this is recorded in Vitruvius,

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.380
and we know from other
sources as well--

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.290
making water clocks
of various varieties.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:12.947
And even Vitruvius records in
a sort of muddied fashion a way

01:08:12.947 --> 01:08:14.530
to build a water
clock that could also

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:18.332
adjust for the length of days
at different times of year.

01:08:18.332 --> 01:08:20.040
It doesn't seem to
have worked very well.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.873
We may have a couple
fragments, two or three

01:08:21.873 --> 01:08:24.486
fragments of these things in
the archaeological record.

01:08:24.486 --> 01:08:26.069
But we at least know
that they existed

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:27.652
and that there were
much simpler water

01:08:27.652 --> 01:08:33.920
clocks that were used in courts
and-- what do you call them?

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.703
Sand things.

01:08:35.703 --> 01:08:36.805
What do we call those?

01:08:36.805 --> 01:08:37.782
AUDIENCE: Hourgalss.

01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:38.990
ALEXANDER MEYER: Hourglasses.

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.500
Yes.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.319
Absolutely.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.779
Yeah.

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:45.710
But yeah, ancient science
was slow to evolve,

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.210
especially sort of what you'd--
once they had done what they

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:52.888
could with the naked eye,
they were sort of stuck.

01:08:52.888 --> 01:08:53.388
Yeah?

01:08:53.388 --> 01:08:55.304
AUDIENCE: Did the Romans
impose their calendar

01:08:55.304 --> 01:08:57.212
on their target subjects?

01:08:57.212 --> 01:09:00.080
And did that spread
from Italy out?

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.146
ALEXANDER MEYER: Well,
the Greek city-states-- I

01:09:02.146 --> 01:09:04.270
mean, as you see in this
inscription with Augustus,

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.120
continuing to use their
calendar in parallel

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.399
with the Roman calendar-- we
can see that at various times.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.080
And then this Celtic
calendar-- we only

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.920
have the one copy of
the Coligny calendar.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.420
But it seems like
other people would

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.939
use their calendar
separately and perhaps

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:18.609
for separate purposes.

01:09:18.609 --> 01:09:21.520
But when we get correspondence
from the ancient world,

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.937
it's basically either a Greek
calendar or a Roman calendar.

01:09:25.937 --> 01:09:27.770
But yeah, it's difficult
to say whether this

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:32.002
was by practice or by force,
whether people were using it

01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:33.710
because it was actually
a better calendar

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.620
or because it was expressed
in a common language.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.300
We're finding things
written in Latin.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.500
They used the Latin
names for things.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.261
But as far as I'm
aware, there's no decree

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:45.510
that went out saying that
everybody will use the Roman

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:46.910
calendar at all times.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:49.700
It's a sort of haphazard thing.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.390
And this is a huge
area of Roman studies

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:53.550
as well, to think
about the means

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:55.950
by which the cultural
changes were made,

01:09:55.950 --> 01:10:01.490
whether this is a imperialistic
projection of Roman ideals

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:04.010
on other groups or whether
these groups willingly

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:06.510
do things to become more Roman.

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:08.070
And that's very
much open to debate.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:12.220
And it is in itself a
sort of political issue.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.350
As we're in this sort
of post-colonial world,

01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:17.140
we want to empower the
colonial peoples rather than

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:19.070
the imperial powers.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:22.630
And you can see that expressed
in scholarship all the time.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:26.520
But it's very difficult to say.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.280
That's it?

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:28.780
OK.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.121
We can talk after.

01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:30.620
Great.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.000
Thank you all.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.750
[APPLAUSE]
