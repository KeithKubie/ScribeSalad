00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.650
The Bear Who Fought in WWII

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.112
After being invaded by Germany in the west
and later by Soviet Russia in the east, the

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:26.420
Polish government fled Warsaw but continued
to fight from abroad.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.390
After Germany attacked Russia, the Russians
decided to release their Polish prisoners

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.850
of war, who then began re-forming into an
army.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.399
In April 1942, several of these Polish units
landed in Persia and began a trek through

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.540
a mountainous area heading toward Egypt and
Palestine to re-group under the direction

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.750
of the British Army.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.770
While in the mountains, the story goes that
a group of soldiers happened on an Iranian

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.000
shepherd boy who had found an orphaned Syrian
brown bear cub.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.250
(Supposedly the mother had been shot and killed.)

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.020
Food was scarce, so the boy agreed to trade
the cub to the soldiers for some canned meat.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.460
Whether that’s actually how it happened
or not, the soldiers did acquire a bear cub

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.960
during their journey.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.010
They named him Wojtek, meaning “he who enjoys
war” or “smiling warrior.”

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.710
The bear quickly became something of a mascot
for the soldiers, and then much more.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.499
As the author of Voytek the Soldier Bear,
Garry Paulin, stated:

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.460
“The Polish soldiers had come from nothing,
had lost everything during the war.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.490
The bear became so much more than just a mascot
to them.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.679
He was a real boost to their moral.”

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.979
At this point, Wojtek became an unofficial
member of the 22nd Transport Company, Artillery

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.359
Division, Polish II Corp.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.070
When the company relocated to Iraq, then Syria,
Palestine and Egypt, Wojtek moved with it.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.380
While Wojtek was young, the soldiers nursed
him with condensed milk placed in empty vodka

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.070
bottles, then fed him fruit, honey and syrup
until he was able to eat more solid foods.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.719
Knowing little about the care and feeding
of bears, they eventually treated him as if

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.359
he were just another solider, including giving
him beer rations, which quickly became his

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.700
favorite beverage.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.890
He also developed other vices over the years
like smoking and eating cigarettes.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.750
Despite his smoking habit and seemingly a
lack of proper nutrition for a bear, Wojtek

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.280
grew to be a nice sized brown bear standing
in at about 6 feet tall and weighing around

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.400
485 pounds.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.569
His favorite pastime was wrestling his comrades,
though he also enjoyed a good game of tug

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.050
of war.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.630
Besides these activities, Wojtek enjoyed playing
with other animals.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.519
He was best friends with a Dalmatian belonging
to a British liaison officer.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.760
The two animals would play and wrestle together.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.540
Not all animals were open to befriending the
bear though.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.930
Wojtek at one point approached a horse in
a field and was kicked in the head and neck

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.360
several times.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.430
He reportedly stayed away from horses and
mules after that.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.209
In Palestine, Wojtek inadvertently helped
capture a thief who broke into an ammunition

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.209
compound.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.420
To the thief’s surprise, besides ammunition,
he found Wojtek, who often slept in there.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.530
Upon seeing the bear, the would-be thief made
quite a commotion, which alerted the soldiers

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.390
who then arrested the man.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.329
Wojtek was rewarded with a bottle of beer.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.180
As the Polish Army came closer to entering
the war zone in Italy in 1943, the soldiers

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.019
pondered the problem of Wojtek’s status,
in that if he was to continue to accompany

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.690
them, they’d be bringing him to the front
line.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.580
This problem came to a head in 1944 in Egypt
when the soldiers were headed to Naples.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.270
The port authorities refused to let the bear
board the ship.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.830
They solved the problem by giving Wojtek his
own paybook, rank and serial number.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.540
They even taught him how to salute like a
proper soldier.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.760
After the paperwork was filed, he was officially
a member of the Polish Army in the 22nd Artillery

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.310
Supply Company of the Polish II Corps, and
he was now allowed on the ship.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.870
In Naples, it was British Courier Archibald
Brown’s job to help process Polish soldiers

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.540
that had just arrived from Egypt to advance
with British soldiers against German and Italian

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.540
forces.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.819
But when he called Wojtek’s name, no one
answered.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.579
“We looked at the roster, and there was
only one person, Corporal Wojtek, who had

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.410
not appeared,” Brown said in an interview
years later.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.920
So he asked the other soldiers why Wojtek
didn’t come forward.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.710
An amused soldier replied: “Well, he only
understands Polish and Persian.”

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.020
To his great surprise, Brown was led to a
cage holding a full-grown bear.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.620
Wojtek soon proved he was more than just a
mascot when, during the series of assaults

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.570
known as the Battle of Monte Cassino, he put
his strength to good use after being trained

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.380
to carry heavy crates filled with mortar shells
from the supply trucks, delivering them to

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.980
the men operating the large guns on the front
line.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.310
After the battle, a likeness of Wojtek holding
a shell became the official badge of the 22nd

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.700
Transport Company.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.830
The image was put on vehicles, flags and uniforms.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.640
At the end of the war, about 3,000 Polish
soldiers and their bear ended up being stationed

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.010
in Berwickshire, Scotland for nearly two years.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.530
As the soldiers were demobilized in 1947 and
sent home, they said some heart wrenching

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.870
goodbyes to Wojtek.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.320
For his part, Wojtek found a home in the Edinburgh
Zoo where he became a popular attraction.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.830
Many of his Polish servicemen friends visited
him at the zoo over the years.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.730
As one of the zookeepers there said,
“…his old friends would come and visit

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.641
and occasionally they would jump the fence
and give him a cuddle or a bottle of beer.

00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.060
If he heard the Polish language spoken, he
would often perk up.”

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.580
In the wild, Syrian brown bears typically
live to about 20-30 years old.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.840
However, in captivity they can potentially
live as long as 48 years, but it was not to

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.260
be for Wojtek.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:06:04.699
He died in December of 1963 at the age of
just 22.
