00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:01.019
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.019 --> 00:00:01.852
Hello, Paige.

00:00:01.852 --> 00:00:02.685
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:04.567
- [Voiceover] So, Paige,
have you ever heard

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.817
of this man Aldus Manutius?

00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:08.955
- [Voiceover] I don't think I have.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:09.872
That's a pretty cool name, though.

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:12.379
- [Voiceover] His given name
was actually Aldo Manuzio.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.662
He was a Venetian printer around 1500.

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:19.385
And this guy invented the italic typeface.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.218
- [Voiceover] What?

00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.051
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:24.760
So, italic is this word that
really just comes from Italy,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.092
right, so he's from Venice,
which is in modern day Italy.

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:32.471
And what it refers to is text
that is kind of on its side,

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:33.554
so like this.

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:36.295
Kind of slopes to the right.

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:37.565
That's italic.

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.826
And he was one of the first printers,

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:42.972
so he had this movable type
printing machine, this press.

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:45.298
And he developed these letters.

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:47.888
He cut them into pieces of metal

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:51.502
and he developed this
kind of slanted style.

00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:54.498
And today we call this
the italic typeface.

00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:55.331
- [Voiceover] Wow!

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:56.164
- [Voiceover] Actually, technically,

00:00:56.164 --> 00:00:58.513
we'd call this the italic script,

00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:02.670
because it's based on
an earlier kind of hand

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.074
from calligraphy, but all the same,

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:09.324
today we have this thing
in text called italics.

00:01:09.324 --> 00:01:11.501
So, okay, so we've got our typeface here.

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.098
And it comes in two flavors.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:14.886
We've got Roman, which is
kind of standing right up,

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.391
and italic, which is slanted to the right.

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:20.457
Paige, how do we use italics in English?

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:23.741
- [Voiceover] Italics
have two uses in English,

00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:26.601
one is to emphasize and
the other is to indicate

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:28.895
that something is a title.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:30.771
- [Voiceover] So we use it
for emphasis and titling.

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:32.933
Let's dive into the first one.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.200
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.198
- [Voiceover] So if we're
trying to use italics

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.781
to emphasize something in text,

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:42.628
we would just use it to set off one word.

00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:43.961
So, for example,

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:47.866
That's a really spicy pepper.

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.893
- [Voiceover] Yeah, the word
really is said very strongly

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:51.726
in that sentence.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.578
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:56.321
Okay, and use case number two for titling.

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:57.154
And you know what?

00:01:57.154 --> 00:02:01.096
To make it easier on ourselves,
let's pull up a text box.

00:02:01.096 --> 00:02:03.136
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's kind
of hard to write italics.

00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:05.112
- [Voiceover] Yeah, which
is actually gonna lead us

00:02:05.112 --> 00:02:08.152
into another part of this video.

00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:09.663
You'll see, but right now, okay,

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.815
I got my italic type selected.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.735
So how do titles work?

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.285
- [Voiceover] So if you
got a title of something,

00:02:16.285 --> 00:02:18.035
like book or a movie.

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.821
- [Voiceover] So, okay, so
we got a book, The Hobbit,

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.071
we got a movie,

00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:30.556
and we have a full-length musical work

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:31.908
or like a symphony or an album

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:35.353
like Kate Bush's Hounds of Love.

00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:39.520
All of those things can be
rendered in italic type.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.269
So, okay, so for full
works, then, so for books,

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:49.656
movies,

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:55.809
and full-length musical works
like an album or a symphony.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.007
- [Voiceover] Okay, so like
a song or a chapter of a book

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.328
is not considered a full work.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:02.161
- [Voiceover] Correct.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.202
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:06.079
- [Voiceover] Now, as
you pointed out, Paige,

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.749
like the difference between
spicy and really here,

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.494
not the easiest to discern.

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:13.414
So if I were going to be writing
out the title of something

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:16.805
just by hand, it's pretty
hard to do italics.

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:18.852
So what we do when we're
writing things by hand

00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:20.852
is we use the underline.

00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:22.809
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.674
So the underline means
the same thing as italics.

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:28.820
You use it for titles, for full works,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.745
but it's a lot easier to
hand write and underline

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.084
than it is to hand write italics.

00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:35.337
- [Voiceover] Paige,
what's your favorite book?

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:38.606
- [Voiceover] Let's say The Giver.

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:39.689
That's a great book.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.316
- [Voiceover] That is a great book.

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:42.588
All right, so I'm writing The Giver.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.479
I want to indicate that it's a full title.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.823
Voop, put that underline underneath it.

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:48.406
The Give is Paige's

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.256
favorite book.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.787
So, the way we're underlining The Giver

00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:02.600
is the same functionally

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.809
as the way we've italicized The Hobbit,

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:07.781
The Thief and the Cobbler,
or Hounds of Love.

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.614
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.728
- [Voiceover] So, that's
where the italic typeface

00:04:10.728 --> 00:04:12.788
comes from is this guy Aldus Manutius.

00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:14.201
This is how we use it today.

00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:15.188
You can learn anything.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.109
David out.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.111
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
