00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.640
It's just beautiful, isn't it? It's just mesmerizing.
It's double hel-exciting!

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.580
You really can tell, just by looking at it,
how important and amazing it is.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.580
It's pretty much the most complicated molecule
that exists, and potentially the most important one.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.140
It's so complex that we didn't even know
for sure what it looked like

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.740
until about 60 years ago.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.339
So multifariously awesome that if you took
all of it from just one of our cells and untangled it,

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.650
it would be taller than me.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.760
Now consider that there are probably 50 trillion
cells in my body right now.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.290
Laid end to end, the DNA in those cells would
stretch to the sun.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.490
Not once...

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.310
but 600 times!

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.030
Mind blown yet?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.030
Hey, you wanna make one? (oh dear god)

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.480
Of course you know I'm talking about deoxyribonucleic
acid, known to its friends as DNA.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.379
DNA is what stores our genetic instructions
-- the information that programs all of our

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.539
cell's activities.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.299
It's a 6-billion letter code that provides
the assembly instructions for everything that

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:11.850
you are.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.240
And it does the same thing for pretty much
every other living thing.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.359
I'm going to go out on a limb and assume
you're human.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:24.249
In which case every body cell, or somatic
cell, in you right now, has 46

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.789
chromosomes each containing one big DNA molecule.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.869
These chromosomes are packed together tightly
with proteins in the nucleus of the cell.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.100
DNA is a nucleic acid.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.829
And so is its cousin, which we'll also be
talking about, ribonucleic acid, or RNA.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.170
Now if you can make your mind do this, remember
all the way back to episode 3, where we talked

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.770
about all the important biological molecules:

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859
carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. That ring
a bell?

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.420
Well nucleic acids are the fourth major group
of biological molecules, and for my money

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.509
they have the most complicated job of all.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.299
Structurally they're polymers, which means
that each one is made up

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.909
of many small, repeating molecular units.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.119
In DNA, these small units are called nucleotides.
Link them together and you have yourself a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.709
polynucleotide.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.490
Now before we actually put these tiny parts
together to build a

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.619
DNA molecule like some microscopic piece of
Ikea furniture, let's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.480
first take a look at what makes up each nucleotide.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.470
We're gonna need three things:

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.580
1. A five-carbon sugar molecule

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.940
2. A phosphate group

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.540
3. One of four nitrogen bases

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.430
DNA gets the first part its name from our
first ingredient, the sugar

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.470
molecule, which is called deoxyribose.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.020
But all the really significant stuff, the
genetic coding that makes you YOU,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.940
is found among the four nitrogenous bases:

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.970
adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and
guanine (G).

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.100
It's important to note that in living organisms,
DNA doesn't exist

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.080
as a single polynucleotide molecule, but rather
a pair of molecules that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.840
are held tightly together.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.770
They're like an intertwined, microscopic,
double spiral staircase.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.310
Basically, just a ladder, but twisted. The
famous Double Helix.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.620
And like any good structure, we have to have
a main support.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.360
In DNA, the sugars and phosphates bond together
to form twin backbones.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.720
These sugar-phosphate bonds run down each
side of the helix but, chemically, in opposite directions.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.060
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.090
In other words, if you look at each of the
sugar-phosphate backbones, you'll see that

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.520
one appears upside-down in relation to the
other.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.310
One strand begins at the top with the first
phosphate connected to the sugar molecule's

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.050
5th carbon and then ending where the next
phosphate would go, with a free end at the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.930
sugar's 3rd carbon.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.810
This creates a pattern called 5' (5 prime)
and 3' (3 prime).

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.850
I've always thought of the deoxyribose with
an arrow, with the oxygen as the point.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.990
It always 'points' from from 3' to 5'.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.960
Now on the other strand, it's exactly the
opposite.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.660
It begins up top with a free end at the sugar's
3rd carbon and the phosphates connect to the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.100
sugars' fifth carbons all the way down.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.430
And it ends at the bottom with a phosphate.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.160
And you've probably figured this out already,
but this is called the 3' to 5' direction.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.080
Now it is time to make ourselves one of these
famous double helices.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.400
These two long chains are linked by the nitrogenous
bases via relatively weak hydrogen bonds.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.570
But they can't be just any pair of nitrogenous
bases.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.890
Thankfully, when it comes to figuring out
what part goes where, all you have to do is

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.420
remember is that if one nucleotide has an
adenine base (A),

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.640
only thymine (T) can be its counterpart (A-T).

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.010
Likewise, guanine (G) can only bond with cytosine
[C] (G-C).

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.220
These bonded nitrogenous bases are called
base pairs.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.550
The G-C pairing has three hydrogen bonds,
making it slightly stronger than the A-T base-pair,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.500
which only has two bonds.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.930
It's the order of these four nucleobases
or the Base Sequence that allows your DNA

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.319
to create you.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:27.099
So, AGGTCCATG means something completely different
as a base sequence than, say, TTCAGTCG.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.479
Human chromosome 1, the largest of all our
chromosomes, contains a single molecule of

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.169
DNA with 247 million base pairs.

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.930
If you printed all of the letters of chromosome
1 into a book, it would be about 200,000 pages

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.680
And each of your somatic cells has 46 DNA
molecules tightly packed into its nucleus

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.550
-- that's one for each of your chromosomes.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.639
Put all 46 molecules together and we're
talking about roughly 6 billion base pairs

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.909
.... In every cell!

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.189
This is the longest book I've ever read.

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.979
It's about 1,000 pages long.

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.389
If we were to fill it with our DNA sequence,
we'd need about 10,000 of them to fit our

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.689
entire genome.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:08.479
POP QUIZ!!!

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.139
Let's test your skills using a very short
strand of DNA.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.939
I'll give you one base sequence -- you
give me the base sequence that appears on

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.499
the other strand.

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.110
Okay, here goes:

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.719
5' -- AGGTCCG -- 3'

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.330
And... time's up.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.189
The answer is:

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.050
3' -- TCCAGGC -- 5'

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.770
See how that works? It's not super complicated.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.090
Since each nitrogenous base only has one counterpart,
you can use one base sequence to predict what

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.909
its matching sequence is going to look like.

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.999
So could I make the same base sequence with
a strand of that "other" nucleic acid,

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.689
RNA?

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:42.949
No, you could not.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.169
RNA is certainly similar to its cousin DNA
-- it has a sugar-phosphate backbone with

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.110
nucleotide bases attached to it.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.810
But there are THREE major differences:

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.610
1. RNA is a single-stranded molecule -- no
double helix here.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.809
2. The sugar in RNA is ribose, which has one
more oxygen atom than deoxyribose, hence the

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.009
whole starting with an R instead of a D thing.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:08.120
3. Also, RNA does not contain thymine. Its
fourth nucleotide is the base uracil, so it

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.110
bonds with adenine instead.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.949
RNA is super important in the production of
our proteins, and you'll see later that

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:19.949
it has a crucial role in the replication of
DNA.

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:22.719
But first...

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:23.400
Biolo-graphies!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.610
Yes, plural this week!

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.550
Because when you start talking about something
as multitudinously awesome and elegant as

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.559
DNA, you have to wonder:

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.370
WHO figured all of this out?

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.379
And how big was their brain?

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:40.990
Well unsurprisingly, it actually took a lot
of different brains, in a lot of different

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.499
countries

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:44.400
and nearly a hundred years of thinking to
do it.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.110
The names you usually hear when someone asks
who discovered DNA are James Watson and Francis

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.430
Crick.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.379
But that's BUNK. They did not discover DNA.

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.580
Nor did they discover that DNA contained genetic
information.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.249
DNA itself was discovered in 1869 by a Swiss
biologist named Friedrich Miescher.

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.199
His deal was studying white blood cells.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.789
And he got those white blood cells in the
most horrible way you could possibly imagine,

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:12.009
from collecting used bandages from a nearby
hospital.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.889
It's for science he did it!

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.449
He bathed the cells in warm alcohol to remove
the lipids,

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:19.900
then he set enzymes loose on them to digest
the proteins.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.770
What was left, after all that, was snotty
gray stuff that he knew must be some new kind

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.029
of biological substance.

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:30.469
He called it nuclein, but was later to become
known as nucleic acid.

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.689
But Miescher didn't know what its role was
or what it looked like.

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:37.400
One of those scientists who helped figure
that out was Rosalind Franklin, a young biophysicist

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.819
in London nearly a hundred years later.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.499
Using a technique called x-ray diffraction,
Franklin may have been the first to confirm

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:45.259
the helical structure of DNA.

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.869
She also figured out that the sugar-phosphate
backbone existed on the outside of its structure.

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:53.889
So why is Rosalind Franklin not exactly a
household name? Two reasons:

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:58.710
1. Unlike Watson &amp; Crick, Franklin was happy
to share data with her rivals. It was Franklin

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.249
who informed Watson &amp; Crick that an earlier
theory

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:05.869
of a triple-helix structure was not possible,
and in doing so she indicated that DNA may

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:07.460
indeed be a double helix.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.089
Later, her images confirming the helical structure
of DNA were shown to Watson without her knowledge.

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:15.759
Her work was eventually published in Nature,
but not until after two papers by Watson and

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.949
Crick had already appeared in which the duo
only hinted at her contribution.

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:24.650
2. Even worse than that, the Nobel Prize Committee
couldn't even consider her for the prize

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.889
that they awarded in 1962 because of how dead
she was.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.589
The really tragic thing is that it's totally
possible that her scientific work may have

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:35.320
led to her early death of ovarian cancer at
the age of 37.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.409
At the time, the X-Ray diffraction technology
that she was using to photograph DNA required

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.029
dangerous amounts of radiation exposure, and
Franklin rarely took precautions to protect herself.

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.349
 

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:47.529
Nobel Prizes cannot be awarded posthumously.
Many believe she would have shared Watson

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:49.779
and Crick's medal if she had been alive
to receive it.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.480
Now that we know the basics of DNA's structure,
we need to understand how it copies itself,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.259
because cells are constantly dividing, and
that requires a complete copy of all of that

00:08:58.259 --> 00:08:59.149
DNA information.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:03.100
It turns out that our cells are extremely
good at this -- our cells can create the

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.070
equivalent 10,000 copies of this book in just
a few hours.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.449
 

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.350
That, my friends, is called replication.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.519
Every cell in your body has a copy of the
same DNA. It started from an original copy

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:19.800
and it will copy itself trillions of times
over the course of a lifetime, each time using

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.420
half of the original DNA strand as a template
to build a new molecule.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.889
So, how is a teenage boy like the enzyme Helicase?

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:30.940
They both want to unzip your genes. (Hank why)

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:36.250
Helicase is marvelous, unwinding the double
helix at breakneck speeds, slicing open those

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.370
loose hydrogen bonds between the base pairs.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.139
The point where the splitting starts is known
as the replication fork, has a top strand,

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:45.149
called the leading strand, or the good guy
strand as I call it

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:50.440
and another bottom strand called the lagging
strand, which I like to call the scumbag strand,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.769
because it is a pain in the butt to deal with.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:58.339
These unwound sections can now be used as
templates to create two complementary DNA strands.

00:09:58.339 --> 00:09:58.820
 

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.089
But remember the two strands go in opposite
directions, in terms of their chemical structure,

00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:07.399
which means making a new DNA strand for the
leading strand is going to be much easier

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.490
for the lagging strand.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:14.190
For the leading, good guy, strand an enzyme
called DNA polymerase just adds matching nucleotides

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.069
onto the main stem all the way down the molecule.

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:21.540
But before it can do that it needs a section
of nucleotides that fill in the section that's

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.279
just been unzipped.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:27.009
Starting at the very beginning of the DNA
molecule, DNA polymerase needs a bit of a

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:31.720
primer, just a little thing for it to hook
on to so that it can start building the new

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.480
DNA chain.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.740
And for that little primer, we can thank the
enzyme RNA primase.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.980
The leading strand only needs this RNA primer
once at the very beginning.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.300
Then DNA polymerase is all, "I got this"

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.880
and just follows the unzipping, adding new
nucleotides to the new chain continuously,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.050
all the way down the molecule.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.980
Copying the lagging, or scumbag strand, is,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.170
well, he's a freaking scumbag.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.259
This is because DNA polymerase can only copy
strands in the 5' -- 3' direction,

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:59.860
and the lagging strand is 3' -- 5',

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.730
so DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides
to the free, 3' end of a primer.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.290
So maybe the real scumbag here is the DNA
polymerase.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.100
Since the lagging strand runs in the opposite
direction, it has to be copied as a series

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.209
of segments.

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:17.009
Here that awesome little enzyme RNA Primase
does its thing again, laying down an occasional

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:22.420
short little RNA primer that gives the DNA
Polymerase a starting point to then work backwards

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.100
along the strand.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.110
This is done in a ton of individual segments,
each 1,000 to 2,000 base pairs long and each

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:33.209
starting with an RNA primer, called Okazaki
fragments after the couple of married scientists

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:36.350
who discovered this step of the process in
the 1960s.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.230
And thank goodness they were married so we
can just call them Okazaki fragments instead

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.810
of Okazaki-someone's-someone fragments.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.949
These allow the strands to be synthesized
in short bursts.

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:52.230
Then another kind of DNA Polymerase has to
go back over and replace all those RNA Primers

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.550
and THEN all of the little fragments get joined
up by a final enzyme called DNA Ligase. And

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.470
that is why I say
the lagging strand is such a scumbag!

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.240
DNA replication gets it wrong about one in
every 10 billion nucleotides.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.000
But don't think your body doesn't have
an app for that!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.290
It turns out DNA polymerases can also proofread,
in a sense,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.550
removing nucleotides from the end of a strand
when they discover a mismatched base.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.160
Because the last thing we want is an A when
it would have been a G!

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.040
Considering how tightly packed DNA is into
each one of our cells, it's honestly amazing

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.930
that more mistakes don't happen.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.720
Remember, we're talking about millions of
miles worth of this stuff inside us.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.860
And this, my friends, is why scientists are
not exaggerating when they call DNA the most

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.300
celebrated molecule of all time.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.480
So, you might as well look this episode over
a couple of times and appreciate it for yourself.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.690
And in the mean time, gear up for next week,
when we're going to talk about how those

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.629
six feet of kick-ass actually makes you, you.

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:50.060
