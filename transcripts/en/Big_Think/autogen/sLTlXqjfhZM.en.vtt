the whole progress of physics is to

the whole progress of physics is to
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.470
the whole progress of physics is to
start with our everyday experience and

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
start with our everyday experience and
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.230
start with our everyday experience and
to analyze it and look at it and look

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
to analyze it and look at it and look
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.259
to analyze it and look at it and look
for deviations from it so the very

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
for deviations from it so the very
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090
for deviations from it so the very
nature of actually really all the

nature of actually really all the
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.380

Natural Sciences but certainly of

Natural Sciences but certainly of

physics is to really get away from our

physics is to really get away from our
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900
physics is to really get away from our
experience so the things physics comes

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
