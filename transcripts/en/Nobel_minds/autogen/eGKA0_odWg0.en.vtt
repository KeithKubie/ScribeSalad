how the building sits in the city you

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
how the building sits in the city you
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.590

it fitting in is it too high is it too

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
it fitting in is it too high is it too
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049
it fitting in is it too high is it too
because it too is in the right place I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
because it too is in the right place I
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.720
because it too is in the right place I
think was very important for us to inch

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
think was very important for us to inch
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.350

you know insure ourselves and everybody

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
you know insure ourselves and everybody
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.619
you know insure ourselves and everybody
else that the building you know what's

in the building do we have the right

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
in the building do we have the right

in the building do we have the right
things in the building they organized

things in the building they organized
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.770

well enough and convincingly enough for

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
well enough and convincingly enough for
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.930
well enough and convincingly enough for
us to be secure that we need this size

of building because if if the public is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
of building because if if the public is

of building because if if the public is
not convinced that the building needs to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
not convinced that the building needs to
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.859
not convinced that the building needs to
be this big then they're gonna ask more

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
be this big then they're gonna ask more
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.900
be this big then they're gonna ask more
questions about let's go if there's a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910
questions about let's go if there's a
 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.690
questions about let's go if there's a
sense well we trust that this is what a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
sense well we trust that this is what a
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.650
sense well we trust that this is what a
noble center needs in the same way that

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660
noble center needs in the same way that

if it was a railway station no one would

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610
if it was a railway station no one would
 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910
if it was a railway station no one would
say can't you make a smaller railway

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
say can't you make a smaller railway
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.940
say can't you make a smaller railway
station one said well I presume that the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
station one said well I presume that the
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830
station one said well I presume that the
railway planners know how big it needs

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
railway planners know how big it needs
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.059
railway planners know how big it needs
to be obviously the public building

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069
to be obviously the public building
 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.260
to be obviously the public building
isn't quite so scientifically or

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270
isn't quite so scientifically or
 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.219
isn't quite so scientifically or
determined but you know there there is a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
determined but you know there there is a
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.809
determined but you know there there is a
point where the activities that need to

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819
point where the activities that need to
 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.320
point where the activities that need to
come together to sustain the life of

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330
come together to sustain the life of
 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.199
come together to sustain the life of
this building and the concept of the

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209
this building and the concept of the
 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.600
this building and the concept of the
building requires a certain volume and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
building requires a certain volume and
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.059
building requires a certain volume and
requires a certain surface so I think we

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069
requires a certain surface so I think we
 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.979
requires a certain surface so I think we
shook that tree very hard just to make

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989
shook that tree very hard just to make
 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.790
shook that tree very hard just to make
sure that we we weren't being wasteful

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800
sure that we we weren't being wasteful
 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.449
sure that we we weren't being wasteful
we weren't being lazy in terms of and it

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459
we weren't being lazy in terms of and it
 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.800
we weren't being lazy in terms of and it
so I think the the new improved

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
so I think the the new improved
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.089
so I think the the new improved
version is a consequence of really

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099
version is a consequence of really
 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.199
version is a consequence of really
scrutinizing the project interestingly I

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209
scrutinizing the project interestingly I
 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.149
scrutinizing the project interestingly I
mean sometimes when you scrutinize a

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159
mean sometimes when you scrutinize a
 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.009
mean sometimes when you scrutinize a
design especially that's done under

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
design especially that's done under
 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.580
design especially that's done under
competition circumstances there can be a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
competition circumstances there can be a
 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.550
competition circumstances there can be a
tendency for it to collapse and certain

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
tendency for it to collapse and certain
 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.309
tendency for it to collapse and certain
assumptions to disappear and be replaced

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
assumptions to disappear and be replaced
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.660
assumptions to disappear and be replaced
completely in this project I would say

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
completely in this project I would say
 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.280
completely in this project I would say
the scrutiny has tended to reinforce

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290
the scrutiny has tended to reinforce
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.770
the scrutiny has tended to reinforce
most of the decisions at work were there

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
most of the decisions at work were there
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.199
most of the decisions at work were there
before so it hasn't really collapsed I

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209
before so it hasn't really collapsed I
 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.150
before so it hasn't really collapsed I
think we managed to make it more compact

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160
think we managed to make it more compact
 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.229
think we managed to make it more compact
we've made it lower

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239
we've made it lower
 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.619
we've made it lower
we made it shorter I think it's it's

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629
we made it shorter I think it's it's
 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.979
we made it shorter I think it's it's
better in the city and I think nearly

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989
better in the city and I think nearly
 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.479
better in the city and I think nearly
more importantly I think we've worked

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489
more importantly I think we've worked
 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.420
more importantly I think we've worked
very hard with no belt to define really

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430
very hard with no belt to define really
 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.240
very hard with no belt to define really
the program and how this building might

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250
the program and how this building might
 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.670
the program and how this building might
perform and what it needs to do and how

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680
perform and what it needs to do and how
 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.910
perform and what it needs to do and how
it might assume its daily life

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920
 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.980
