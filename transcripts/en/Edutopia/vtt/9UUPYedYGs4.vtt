00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:05.456
&gt;&gt;Jim: The look on a kid's face to
realize that three or four weeks ago,

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:09.976
they had nothing but an idea, and now
they've impacted kids emotionally.

00:00:10.556 --> 00:00:12.916
They've literally had an emotional
experience watching their film.

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:15.766
I love that kids have
the opportunity to get

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.976
that from a classroom like this.

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:29.626
&gt;&gt;Jim: And then you guys don't
go on until Friday, right?

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:30.266
&gt;&gt;Student: Nope.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.036
&gt;&gt;Jim: I teach three
different classes.

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:35.016
The Intro to Video class is
where kids work on projects

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:35.826
that are cross-curricular.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.006
They learn how to shoot, they learn
how to edit, they also learn how

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.476
to research, they learn how to write.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.466
It's a wonderful introductory
class to the rest of the program.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:47.826
&gt;&gt;Jim: Here we go in, three, two.

00:00:47.826 --> 00:00:49.786
&gt;&gt;Student: Better get biking.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:50.386
&gt;&gt;Student: For sure.

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:51.946
Biking is always a fun way to go.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.756
&gt;&gt;Jim: I also teach an
advanced media broadcast class.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:56.816
That's a TV show that
we produced that airs

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.506
at the school level twice a week.

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:00.976
So the entire school watches
our show during homeroom.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.000
&gt;&gt;Student: What's up, Miners?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.646
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey, guys, hope
everyone's having a great week,

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.000
how was your weekend?
&gt;&gt;Student: It went well!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.676
I had fun at the volleyball
tournament, but I'm glad to hear

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.846
that everyone had a blast at prom.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.456
&gt;&gt;Jim: And then I teach an
Advanced Video Production class,

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:19.026
and that class is where kids
really get into video production.

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:21.936
That's the class where they
work outside of the class.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.876
They work with other companies that
maybe hire us to produce things.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:28.736
&gt;&gt;Student: What if we interview
some seniors that do have a job?

00:01:28.736 --> 00:01:29.376
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, yeah, yes.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:29.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Ask them like...

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:33.656
&gt;&gt;Jim: Every kid in the class has a
job, and we rotate those jobs out.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.816
So we have hosts, we have
what we-- basically talent.

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:38.426
I also have a crew.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:42.146
They're the ones who light
and shoot and run the room.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:43.966
And then there's a
shooter, and an editor.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:46.866
The producer is in charge of
writing, and directing that crew.

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.136
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, so
where am I starting from?

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.516
Am I starting from like right here?

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:51.626
&gt;&gt;Jim: What I love about it is

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:54.406
when everything works
perfectly, we switch.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:59.056
And so every kid has another
chance to try another job.

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.816
&gt;&gt;Student: I heard that
you received an 80 percent

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.416
of a full-ride scholarship to...

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:08.706
&gt;&gt;Jim: I try very hard in here to
create a real-world working space.

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:10.776
The first day you're
in here I tell you

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:12.136
about the equipment
that's been bought

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.676
by the kids that came before you.

00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:18.266
"The work the kids did before
you got here bought that camera,

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:19.596
they bought that computer."

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:22.276
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm trying to do something
that's like, "Home Alone Meets War

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.976
of the Worlds," you know?

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.836
I've already got some
great point-of-view shots.

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:28.356
I kind of used some
saturation to make it kind

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:29.636
of like a bluish-greenish color.

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:33.686
&gt;&gt;Jim: You have to learn how to use
the camera, and learn how to edit

00:02:33.996 --> 00:02:36.136
and learn how to write and voiceover.

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:40.026
I want them to have the skills that
are worth money, and that they can go

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.856
out and literally get a job locally,

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:45.156
or at maybe a bigger
market television station.

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:46.296
&gt;&gt;Jim: All right, c'mon.

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:49.406
&gt;&gt;Jim: The Advanced Film Class
is the class we started with.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:51.606
It's advanced for a
number of different reasons.

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:54.286
I aligned it with the UC Visual
and Performing Arts Curriculum.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:55.976
So they get UC credit.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.046
We're also one of the few Apple
Certified Training Centers

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.746
for Education here in California.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:03.626
And so these kids can take
the Final Cut Pro test

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.026
to become certified pros.

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:06.966
Plus, we have also
the high-end equipment

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:08.486
that is being used by these kids.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.066
&gt;&gt;Jim: You want to play that back?

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:10.876
&gt;&gt;Student: All right.

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.956
&gt;&gt;Student: This class has, like,
completely changed what I do

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:19.786
in any other of my classes, because
I looked at other classes as, I need

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:21.026
to get through here just to get out.

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:24.656
Now I'll take math, and I'll
see all the ways I can use it

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.026
for my advantage.

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:29.616
And every classroom, I'm trying to
now take and see how I can use it

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:31.166
for me, how can I better myself?

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.226
How can I take this and
apply it to the real world?

00:03:33.536 --> 00:03:36.286
And I'm looking at every class
like that now, thanks to Video.

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:37.696
&gt;&gt;Jim: And you want
one of the cameras?

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:38.226
&gt;&gt;Student: We need two.

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:41.456
&gt;&gt;Jim: The school calls on us
in that class to produce things

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:45.486
that they might need maybe for
some rally, or for a message

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:46.906
that the principal's
trying to convey.

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:51.416
I have whoever asks us to do
a production come in here

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.586
and talk to us like a client.

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:54.996
&gt;&gt;Student: The focus
is, you're like this,

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:56.906
and then you're just
going to, like, see here.

00:03:56.906 --> 00:03:59.566
&gt;&gt;Jim: I want kids to
realize that with these tools,

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:02.796
and with these skills, you can
change the world that you live in.

00:04:02.986 --> 00:04:05.156
And so we have started doing work

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:08.456
for these local agencies,
mostly non-profits.

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:10.806
And boy, I love to have
my kids partner with them.

00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:13.726
I love for my students to
realize that, "Wait a second!

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:16.156
I just made a big difference!"

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:18.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Hey, that tripod's coming.

00:04:19.716 --> 00:04:22.276
&gt;&gt;Jim: We've been approached by
the Tulare County Council on Child

00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:25.846
and Youth Development to put
together a video that they can use

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:31.056
to really showcase how important
early schooling is for students.

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:35.636
And my students are going to script
it, and most likely come up with most

00:04:35.636 --> 00:04:38.776
of the questions that we're
going to use to interview people.

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:44.476
Plus look around this environment
and find out what needs to be shot.

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:47.816
How do we capture the importance
of that level of education?

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:49.576
&gt;&gt;Student: I think if we
were to interview Judy,

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:52.226
it should be in there, just
because that's her office,

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.286
and you know, more formal looking...

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:55.166
&gt;&gt;Jim: By letting kids
go out of the classroom,

00:04:55.736 --> 00:05:01.326
and see what I taught them modeled,
or mirrored in a real client,

00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:03.966
all this becomes more believable.

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:06.306
And when you actually go
out in the real world,

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.116
and you actually meet these
clients, and you work with them,

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:12.246
they get such a bigger
understanding of what's being taught.

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:15.876
They start taking that little
bit of groundwork that I've laid,

00:05:16.376 --> 00:05:18.056
and they start filling in the gaps.

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:21.356
You know, they really start
going, "I need to do this.

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:21.946
I need to do that."

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.536
And the next thing you know
they're becoming real filmmakers.
