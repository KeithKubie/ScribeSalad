00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.297
We saw earlier how scaling and then rotating is often the most convenient order.

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:10.412
With our snow man the arms were positioned by rotating then translating. Here's

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:14.368
the stick without any transform on it. I made the snowman transparent and

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:18.268
removed the ground plains so we can see the stick's position. It's actually

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.131
inside the snowman halfway through the ground. Whenever you create most

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:26.562
geometric objects in 3JS, the object is centered around the origin. The rotation

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:31.668
along the x axis put the stick into its proper orientation. Then the translation

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:35.168
moved it upward in world coordinates to the proper location. Let's see what

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.693
would happen if we first translated then rotated. First we move the stick

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:42.789
upwards 50 units. The center of the stick is now in place in the middle of the

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.724
body. So far so good. Now if we rotate the stick after positioning it, we

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:50.826
suddenly see it lying on the ground. What happened? The problem is that the

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:55.622
rotation takes place with respect to the origin. In the first step we moved our

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.680
stick up above the origin. In the second we rotated the stick but it rotated

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.513
around the origin. Let's watch this disaster in slow motion. The stick starts

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:09.579
centered at the origin. We move it upwards 50 units, now it's center is at the

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.859
right height. However, when we then apply a rotation, the object rotates around

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.853
the origin, down here, instead of rotating around its center. Finishing the 90

00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:22.482
degree rotation, the sticks landed on the ground. Another way to think about it

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:27.570
is that translating an object moves its center. You're moving the object up.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:31.480
Relative to the stick, you're moving the point it will rotate around down. We've

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.815
established that scaling before rotating is usually what we want. And rotating

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:40.040
before translating is also generally more useful. This is why 3JS uses this

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.273
order, scale, rotate, translate when dealing with a single object.
