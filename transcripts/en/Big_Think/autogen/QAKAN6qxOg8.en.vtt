well I think one of the one of the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
well I think one of the one of the
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.999
well I think one of the one of the
scenarios is the one regarding what our

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
scenarios is the one regarding what our
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.060
scenarios is the one regarding what our
press release was about concerning t pyx

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
press release was about concerning t pyx
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.429
press release was about concerning t pyx
it is but I think that most scenarios

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
it is but I think that most scenarios
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.990
it is but I think that most scenarios
now for example trying to account for

now for example trying to account for
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.880
now for example trying to account for

examples of that and some of the

asteroids are very primitive that is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
asteroids are very primitive that is
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.320
asteroids are very primitive that is
they they have a composition that is

that is they haven't been incorporated

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
that is they haven't been incorporated

in large bodies that undergo geological
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.399
in large bodies that undergo geological
evolution so these are the basic

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
evolution so these are the basic
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.630

building blocks well these building

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
building blocks well these building
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600
building blocks well these building
blocks are that they're out there and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
blocks are that they're out there and
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420
blocks are that they're out there and
and of course they can potentially

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
and of course they can potentially
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.899
and of course they can potentially

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
collide with the planets including earth
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.230

and in fact this is how we think the

and in fact this is how we think the
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.510

during lunar volcanism during during
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.720
during lunar volcanism during during
volcanic activity in lunar history so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
volcanic activity in lunar history so

these collisions happen much more

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740
these collisions happen much more
 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.260
these collisions happen much more
frequently in the past but that doesn't

frequently in the past but that doesn't
 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.040
frequently in the past but that doesn't
rule out that they can't happen now so I

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050
rule out that they can't happen now so I
 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.800
rule out that they can't happen now so I
think it's an area that is really

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
think it's an area that is really
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.620
think it's an area that is really

well within the human lifespan it's it's
 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.289
well within the human lifespan it's it's
a very very low probability but on the

a very very low probability but on the
 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.149
a very very low probability but on the
other hand one cannot rule it out there

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159
other hand one cannot rule it out there
 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.850

visca river but fortunately the area was

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150
visca river but fortunately the area was
 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.969
visca river but fortunately the area was
very sparsely populated and there were

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979
very sparsely populated and there were
 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.689
very sparsely populated and there were
no recorded human fatalities but if that

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699
no recorded human fatalities but if that
 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.520
no recorded human fatalities but if that
event had happened a few hours before in

other words if it had happened when when

if the detonation happened over the

if the detonation happened over the

waves tsunamis and that could have had a
 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.800
waves tsunamis and that could have had a
devastating effect on the coastlines so

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
devastating effect on the coastlines so
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.870
devastating effect on the coastlines so
it was really a lucky thing that the

it was really a lucky thing that the

it was really a lucky thing that the
Tunguska event occurred over Central

Tunguska event occurred over Central
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.000
Tunguska event occurred over Central
Siberia and not over a populated area

like it for example in Central and

like it for example in Central and

would ram into it but they would have to

be very careful because you don't want

be very careful because you don't want

to fragment it too much you don't want

the devastation so you want to make sure

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120
the devastation so you want to make sure
 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.420
the devastation so you want to make sure
it has to be carefully calculated but I

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430
it has to be carefully calculated but I
 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.450
it has to be carefully calculated but I
think this kind of a scenario has been

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
think this kind of a scenario has been
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.529
think this kind of a scenario has been
anticipated and I think that both with

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539
anticipated and I think that both with
 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.659

in case of such an event I mean and of

in case of such an event I mean and of

course you would want to avoid worldwide

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909
course you would want to avoid worldwide

course you would want to avoid worldwide
panic and that kind of thing so it's

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
panic and that kind of thing so it's
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.760
panic and that kind of thing so it's
it's I think the details remain to be

it's I think the details remain to be
 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.089
it's I think the details remain to be
seen but such plans have been in the

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099
seen but such plans have been in the
 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.149
seen but such plans have been in the
works and in case of for example an

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159
works and in case of for example an
 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.019
