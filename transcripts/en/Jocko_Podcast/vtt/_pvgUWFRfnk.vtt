00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.650
Aye. This is real late. Well, I guess, yeah, you got to do this for life.

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.930
I heard you say it is important to think I heard Jocko say this too.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.980
How do you think meaning, how do you talk to yourself?

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.730
Do you ask yourself questions? Do you think by talking to others,

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.530
what do you believe is the most valuable method for becoming a clear thinker and

6
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:21.364
communicator?

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.283
<v 1>Okay,</v>

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.730
<v 0>that's a deep question. I actually think it's pretty easy to answer.</v>

9
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.740
It is easy answer. I think I can answer in one word. Go Detach.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
That's, that's, that's how I think. You can't, you gotta step out.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.410
You've gotta step back mentally. You've got to step back,

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640
look at what's going on and think, and that's where you can think about it.

13
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.730
That's where you can figure out what's going on. If you can do that,

14
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.480
you're there. If you can't do it, you don't even know you're not doing it.

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.430
That's the problem. When you're not detached,

16
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.690
you don't even know you're not detached.

17
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.220
You're in the storm and you don't even know it. That's the job for,

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.600
that's exactly right. I, but I think, you know,

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.770
<v 2>for people that maybe don't fully understand what that means, right?</v>

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.180
[inaudible] this idea of detachment,

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.070
which you've obviously talked a lot about on here and which is such a key thing

22
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.820
for decision making. It's the, the,

23
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.510
I think the key thing there is, is to make sure that you're not,

24
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
you're not clouded by, you know, this emotional attachment to plans,

25
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:21.630
which we often talk about with our leaders in the seal teams.

26
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.750
So I'm emotionally invested in a plan that I came up with.

27
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:29.000
I spent hours or days or weeks or months, you know, involved in, uh, and,

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.490
and I want that to succeed of course, but, but is that, you know,

29
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.790
I got to have that realistic assessment and that's what the detachment really

30
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.791
requires is that you pull yourself not just physically away out of the weeds or

31
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.680
to say, okay, let me think about this in a strategic picture. But you really,

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
you take away that emotional investment that you have to,

33
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.850
to maybe even whether it's a plant, sometimes it's a team member as well.

34
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:51.780
And if you have, you know,

35
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.780
someone that you just have a close relationship with that you, you know,

36
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.690
whether they're a relative of yours or you had a longstanding relationship with,

37
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:01.310
and that maybe you've gotten too close to them and you can't see that, that,

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.621
you know,

39
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.110
they become more important than the mission and they're dragging the rest of the

40
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:04.620
team down.

41
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.740
You're not making the call either tighten them up or let them go if that's,

42
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.461
that's the right case.

43
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.330
So I think what that really requires is you got to emotionally pull back.

44
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:14.130
It's a, it's a, it's a mental thing to,

45
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.990
to really have a brutally honest assessment of the situation. Uh, that's,

46
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.860
that's independent from any kind of, uh, previous bias that you might've had.

47
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.590
<v 0>That's interesting though, because even if you know, like, Oh yeah,</v>

48
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.350
I'm going to detach. Oh, that's not that easy. Yeah.

49
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.870
Like you gotta go through the motions. You can't be like, Hey,

50
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:35.330
I'm going to detach. I'm detached right now. Meanwhile, you're just like, I,

51
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.960
you said clouded by the emotional part that you're like kind of one foot in

52
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.530
emotionally, so you're technically not detached. So it doesn't work.

53
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.170
You know what else is a good way to think is to listen to us in what people are

54
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:53.000
saying. I've been thinking about how more, how he said, if you listen,

55
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.060
you know twice as much.

56
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.910
You know everything that you know when you know everything that the other guy,

57
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.050
yeah, that's a great, that's a great thing.

58
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.620
But if you're sitting in a conversation, I mean from a business perspective,

59
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.260
if you're in a meeting and there's a conversation going on,

60
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.550
if you're in the conversation, you're talking, you're adding your piece,

61
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.390
well then you're, you're not detached, you're in it.

62
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.180
But if you sit back and you listen and you hear what's going on,

63
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.850
you can assemble, you know, thoughts better.
