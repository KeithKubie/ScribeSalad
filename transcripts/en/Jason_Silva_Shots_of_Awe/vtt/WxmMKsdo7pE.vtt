JASON SILVA: So there was
an amazing documentary

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.140
called "Flight
From Death," which

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.390
distilled the human condition
down to its bare bones,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.970
unbearable awareness
of mortality, like that

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.137
is the agitation of mankind.

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:26.011
And the production
company that made the film

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.200
is called Transcendental
Media, and they actually

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.195
say that their slogan is "to
agitate the sleep of mankind."

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:34.680
Now, what does this hint at?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.710
Well, it hints at
a kind of calling.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.414
it hints at a kind
of responsibility.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.830
To people that
make films, they're

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.371
going to encode the
human experience,

00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:44.350
to create narratives
that imbibe themselves,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.180
that incept themselves in
our minds to provide context

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.494
for who and what we are.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:49.910
The storytellers
are the ones that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.710
craft the narrative
"that awaken the mind's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.355
attention from the
lethargy custom,"

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:56.812
as Coleridge used to say,
and instead redirect it

00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:59.480
towards the wonders of
existence so, again, to agitate

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.420
the sleep of mankind.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.882
And today we live in a world
where everybody makes media.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:04.840
Everybody shares media.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.080
The barriers of entry
have been lowered.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.910
All of us now have a
responsibility then

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.130
to output content
that reflects the best

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.860
of the human condition.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
If media is a drug, are we going
to create narcotic drug that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.159
stupefies its audience with
mindless entertainment,

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.096
or are we going to treat
media as a entheogenic that

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:28.930
dissolves boundaries, that
transfigurates modalities

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.910
of thought?

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.530
Perhaps this is
the kind of media

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.620
that we should be celebrating--
media that agitates,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.445
media that transforms,
media that inspires.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.920
Because, again, to agitate
the sleep of mankind

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.470
should be all of our goals.

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:49.100
Hey, guys, if you want to
take a look at "Shots of Awe"

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.835
behind the scenes, how it
all comes to life, well,

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.330
then check out his episode I
shot on "Seeker Stories," which

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.450
explores my daily rituals
and how we make "Shots."
