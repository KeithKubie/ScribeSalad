00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 align:start position:0%
period this is important to keep in mind
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540 align:start position:0%
period this is important to keep in mind
because<00:00:19.380><c> there</c><00:00:19.590><c> were</c><00:00:19.740><c> also</c><00:00:19.950><c> liberal</c>

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 align:start position:0%
because there were also liberal
