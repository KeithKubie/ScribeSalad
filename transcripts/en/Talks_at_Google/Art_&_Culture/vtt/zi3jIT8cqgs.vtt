[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.460
SPEAKER 1: Join me in welcoming
to the stage Giorgia Lupi

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.579
and Kaki King.

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.573
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.060
[MUSIC - KAKI KING]

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:08.339
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:11.420
KAKI KING: Thank you.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.772
I will be 39 in August.

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:19.730
And what that means is
I will have been playing

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.710
guitar for almost 35 years.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.400
I started when I
was really young.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.130
And as you can see, I started
to do something differently

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.790
with the guitar as
a teenager and have

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.600
made a career out of doing
interesting things with it,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.050
some more traditional, some more
unorthodox, like you just saw.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.420
But the most interesting
thing that I did recently

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.520
was I started to incorporate
visuals into my live show.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.990
So the show that I do is based
around a projection mapped

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.890
guitar--

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.260
so the light is only
hitting the guitar--

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.870
and a screen behind me,
and I am in silhouette,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.090
and I'm almost a
character that ceases

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.180
to exist, other than to
serve the purpose of playing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.692
the guitar.

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.150
So because of this show-- it's
called "The Neck is a Bridge

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.370
to the Body"--

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.910
I found myself falling
into worlds that I never

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.754
thought I would,
such as the design

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:12.170
world, and the performing arts
world, and the sort of more

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.370
theatrical world.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.200
And through this,
I was introduced

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.990
to very different people.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.650
Not just musicians, but
designers, and thinkers,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.180
and software
engineers, and people

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.820
who were just fascinated
with what I was doing,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.620
one of whom was a person
that introduced me

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.960
to the amazing woman
sitting here, Giorgia Lupi.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.960
His name is John Mayeda,
and you may know him.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.270
And Giorgia's going
to talk a little bit

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.710
about our
collaborations and what

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.020
we've done since we've met.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.780
And we're going to sort of
continue the conversation.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.055
Welcome, Giorgia Lupi.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.845
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.180
GIORGIA LUPI: Thank you.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.360
Hi, everyone.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.190
My name is Giorgia.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.440
And I'm collaborating with my
dear friend, and as you hear,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.440
the super talented
musician Kaki King.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.090
But I'm not a musician myself.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.500
I work with data.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.720
And we will explain
you and show you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.452
what we are doing together
in the space of data, music,

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:04.410
and data visualization.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.760
But let me take a step back and
share with you who I am first.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.410
I work with data in my day job.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.510
I'm one of the partners
and the Creative Director

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.300
at Accurat, a small data
visualization design firm

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.149
that we started in Milan,
Italy, which is my home country.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.890
And now I also
have a small office

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.649
in New York, where I live.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.520
And yeah, this is
our talented team

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.800
of designers, and data
analysts, and developers.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.850
They say "hi" from Milan.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.510
And we're missing some
of them in this picture,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.890
as it was taken a little ago.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.600
But we hardly are
in the same place,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.620
so that's the more complete
pictures that I have.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.850
So every day, I am, and we
are, presented with challenges

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.480
on how to make sense of a
complex system of informations.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.100
And with my team, we
address, we frame them,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.780
and we solve them through
visual representation.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.650
So we work with very different
clients, clients in the IT,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.560
even with tech companies
like Google itself,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.350
but also with many
non-profits and organizations

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.300
to create tools and
visualizations that

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.930
can make data accessible, both
to their internal and external

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.620
audiences.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.030
And I will give
you a few example

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.770
of the type of challenges that
we are presented with every day

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.630
to give you a sense, from
working with organizations

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.450
such as IBM, re-imagining how
the whole organization uses

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.130
data visualization on
all of their products

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.080
and how they can work with data
effectively on a daily basis.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.810
So design first, a
practical guide on how

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.850
to translate numbers into charts
in the very different cases

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.510
they will encounter, but
also designing guidelines

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.510
for the creation of visuals with
data that will look and feel

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.610
like IBM, to collaborating
with the first Italian woman

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.630
astronaut, Samantha
Cristoforetti,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.810
creating a live web experience
with the data of her mission

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.540
during her six month long
expedition to the International

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.500
Space Station.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.900
And that was really
exciting indeed,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.330
but where we actually
involve her funds directly

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.460
in the experience,
giving them the chance

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.640
to interact with her
as she was in space.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.160
And to creating and
building real time tools

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.550
for social science researchers
that, through visualization,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.990
can help them monitor
large-scale social experiments.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.000
But I also do more
experimental work

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.370
and artistic work,
such as art commissions

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.980
or self-initiated
projects, where I mainly

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.300
try to explore and adopt a
broader definition of data,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.940
accepting also the more
subjective intimate

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.330
and therefore imperfect aspects
of these information systems

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.100
that we live in.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.320
I talk a lot about what
I called it a humanism.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.260
That is my attempt to define
the focus of my research

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.240
and to understand what
my personal contribution

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.980
to the field of data could be.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.050
And where here,
I try to advocate

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.180
that to make data
faithfully representative

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.120
of our human nature, we
need to start designing ways

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.210
to include empathy--

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.180
again, imperfection
and human qualities--

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.370
into how we collect,
process, and display data.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.270
And this is really
what guides my work.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.760
The project that I'm
probably most known for

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.280
is called "Dear Data," a
year-long collaboration

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.890
with another information
designer, Stefanie Posavec.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.310
That was, for me, the
big data hangover cure.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.980
Stefanie and I only
met twice in our life,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.670
where we decided to run
this very radical experiment

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.410
around one main question,
is it possible to get

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.960
to know another human
being through data only?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.140
So for what we called
"Dear Data," every weekend

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.420
for one year, we used
our personal data

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.240
to get to know each other.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.570
Every week and for one year,
we would collect personal data

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.120
around weekly shared mundane
topics, from our thoughts

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.730
and ideas, to the interaction
with our partners,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.810
to the compliments that
we gave and received,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.680
to our most intimate feelings,
so 52 excuses in form

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.210
of data to investigate and
reveal aspects of ourselves

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.150
in our lives, personal data
that we would then manually

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.440
hand draw on a postcard size
sheet of paper that every week,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.050
we would send from London
to New York where I live,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.390
and from New York to
London, where she lives.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.300
And I'm always so jealous
of the red London post box

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.010
when I show these
slides, compared

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.540
to the creepy [INAUDIBLE]
in New York and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.030
So every Monday
and for one year.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.209
So the front was always the
data drawing and the back

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.750
of the postcard
contained, of course,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.100
the address of the other
person, but also the legend,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.620
how to interpret our drawings.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.150
And so we started looking
at our days through data,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.060
but not only quantifying
the numbers of times

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.370
we would perform
a certain actions,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.500
instead adding
context or details

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.390
about why what was
happening, what

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.850
was the situation
and the feeling,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.470
realizing really, week after
week, how to put ourself

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.880
in these numbers and how
the context of our very

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.799
personal stories,
for the moment,

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.580
was as important, if not more,
than the activity we were

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.710
counting, if we wanted
to make this data truly

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.549
meaningful and
representative of ourselves.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.410
We've investigated our minds
and our most intimate thoughts

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.900
and fears through data,
sharing with the other person

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.420
all the moments we felt--

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.280
anxious, sad,
frustrated, fearful,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.990
and explaining why
through the way

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.920
we categorized our
moments of negativity.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.770
And ultimately, as we say,
we have been using data

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.410
as our unique language,
really as our alphabet,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.470
to discover and communicate
our lives to the other person

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.347
for one year.

00:09:09.347 --> 00:09:11.430
After the project, Stefanie
and I worked on a book

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.290
where we illustrated
all of the lessons

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.000
that we've learned
in life and data.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.250
And "Dear Data" has been
exhibited around the world.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.850
And then to our incredible
joy and surprise,

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.570
it's found the
most exciting home,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.122
as the original set
of our cards has

00:09:23.122 --> 00:09:25.080
been acquired as part of
a permanent collection

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.150
of the Museum of Modern Art.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
But what excited us
even more is that

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.640
what really made us
want to explore further

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.610
this idea in our jobs, which is
also what I'm doing with Kaki,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.010
is that "Dear Data" has
been so well received

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.440
from the public outside
the data community.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.270
We've seen really
thousands of postcards

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.430
made by people who
learned about the project

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.660
and wanted to experiment
on themselves,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.980
and even teachers of any
grade using this format

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.550
to teach their students
the world of data.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.390
It has, in a way,
opened the idea

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.880
of data to really a
wider audience that

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.920
made it more
approachable, a tool that

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.630
can be useful for
everyone and not

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.300
only for who already
work with data

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.530
or is keen to self-tracking.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.020
And I really ask myself, why did
this project resonate so much

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.800
outside the data community?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.010
And I feel it's because
it showed that data is not

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.980
interesting, or boring,
or scary, or big

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.340
per se, but it's really a
tool in medium [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.430
and a material that is
actually out there for everyone

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.960
to use in many different ways.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.610
And this is what guides
all of my projects,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.660
whether they are purely
artistic projects--

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.660
this is a data visualization
that was up at MoMA

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.450
last fall, closing Paola
Antonelli's last exhibition

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:36.980
"Items--

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.313
is Fashion Modern?"-- I don't
know if you got the chance

00:10:39.313 --> 00:10:41.250
to see the exhibition,
where I didn't have

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.420
any data besides the list
of the 111 items of clothing

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.140
and accessories included in the
show and the research material

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.180
put together by the curators.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.430
And this was another
project where activity

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.180
builds my data sets by asking
systematic questions that I

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.440
was reading as I was reading
and studying the taxonomies.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.312
But I'm not going to
talk about my projects

00:11:03.312 --> 00:11:05.520
today, though you can find
all of them on my website.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.730
I wanted to give you a sense of
my approach to data in general

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.070
before talking about
our collaboration,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.550
because it's also what
I'm using in our work.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.710
So Kaki and I started
working together

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.560
when design guru John Mayeda,
who, again, you might know,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.950
called us to collaborate on the
new brand identity for the 200

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.530
years anniversary of a
limited edition for Hennessy,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.470
the cognac brand, where we
designed a visual identity made

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.726
of music and data visualization.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.642
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.500
And this is, of
course, Kaki playing.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.210
And so starting from a trip
that Kaki took to Cognac,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.340
Kaki composed the 200 beats
song to hundreds of the 200

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.660
years of the limited edition.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.810
And then I dissected and
analyzed every single movement

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.450
that Kaki does with her
hands as she plays this song.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.452
And this is--

00:12:00.452 --> 00:12:01.930
KAKI KING: Every
single movement.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.370
GIORGIA LUPI: It was
kind of laborious, Yeah.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.400
KAKI KING: Yeah, it was
incredibly laborious.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.880
Yeah, so normally when you
have music, you have notation.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.380
With guitar, you
can have tablature,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.910
which is a map of the
neck of the guitar,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.993
where to place your hands.

00:12:16.993 --> 00:12:20.740
But in this case, it was
if the left hand index

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.580
finger swipes up
on this beat, that

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.210
is its own symbol, as
opposed to the middle finger

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.190
of the right hand doing so.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.590
I am still--

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.450
I mean, even after so
many collaborations,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.670
I'm still floored that
you went to the length

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.581
that you did to
dissect what you did.

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:40.830
And the cool thing about
it-- as you're going to see--

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.540
it wraps around the box.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.350
And it is a tribute to
the 200 years of VSOP.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.520
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah, my work
tends to get pretty detailed.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.314
I tend to get very
obsessed with that.

00:12:50.314 --> 00:12:52.230
KAKI KING: Your brain
is built for it, though.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.050
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.341
Well, I mean, so this is the
idea of the whole process.

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.340
And then visually,
I was taking cues

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.370
from Hennessy's visual legacy,
which is really done of all

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.080
of these calligraphy types.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.840
And I plotted all of that
into this visual score,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.620
where every vertical line is
one beat-- so again, 200 beats--

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.660
to create the visual
centerpiece of the branding

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.750
on this special edition.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.452
And this is how it
looks like in the end.

00:13:14.452 --> 00:13:15.910
So again, every
symbol that you see

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.470
is really the
representation of things

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.720
that Kaki does with her hands.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.610
And I mean, I feel like-- and
we are starting to open up this

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.620
into a more
conversational thing--

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.190
I feel that the reason why
we decided to go this far

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.290
is that there's only
so much information

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.020
that can be told through
a score or a tablature.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.790
And especially in
Kaki's case-- and you've

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.590
heard how she plays--
there is a lot that

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.180
can be really transformed.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.910
KAKI KING: It's hard even
to transcribe what I do

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.250
and to make it as
specific as possible.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.170
It's still very
difficult for people--

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.700
without seeing me do it or
having it explained to them,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.410
it's hard for it
to just be placed

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.620
on a traditional notation
in tablature score.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.550
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.340
But then Kaki and I fell in
love with each other's work.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.160
And we decided to keep
exploring together.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.870
Early last year, we
guided an audience

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.260
of 2,000 people in
the Opera Theater

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.520
in Cape Town on how to see music
exactly as we were describing,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.950
based, again, on a laborious
representation of what

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.830
Kaki does with her hands
on her guitar as she plays.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.830
And actually in this case, where
both the song and the visuals

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.100
were informed by personal data
collection from our lives.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.560
As I did into your data,
we also did it together

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.520
to compose a structure for
Kaki to interpret what we did

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.070
in our days and compose a song.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.110
And this is the
visualization of the song

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.440
that she played live as
she guided the audience

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.520
to really understand
what every symbol means.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.700
And just really quickly,
in every section,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.370
the number of black lines
is the number of beats.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.640
And the symbol above represents
the song being played,

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.550
where the top of the
flower is Kaki's left hand

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.649
and the bottom part
is her right hand.

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:52.690
And the position of the
colors and the dimensions

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.940
of the symbol represent
exactly the gestures

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.380
that Kaki does with her hands.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.317
And it sounds like this.

00:14:58.317 --> 00:15:01.299
[GUITAR MUSIC]

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.370
But then, unfortunately,
something not pleasant

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.330
happened.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.110
And I'd like Kaki
to describe it.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.034
KAKI KING: So Giorgia and I
had done these two projects

00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:57.450
together, which, you know,
when you work on a project that

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.310
is as time-consuming
and laborious,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.730
and back and forth, as it is,
you get to know each other,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.310
even just doing one or two,
as was the case at this point.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.490
And so I had a trust in
Giorgia that I turned out

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.140
would need, really.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.760
My daughter, who at the
time was almost three

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.265
this last year-- this is
her in her hospital bed.

00:16:18.265 --> 00:16:20.640
She was diagnosed with a very
strange autoimmune disorder

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.122
called ITP.

00:16:22.122 --> 00:16:23.580
It's normally not
life-threatening.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:29.340
But it causes your body to
attack its platelets, which is

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.690
essential for blood clotting.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.970
So my daughter basically
woke up one morning

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.291
and had blood in her mouth.

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:35.790
She was just
spontaneously bleeding,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.100
and it was terrifying.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.990
This is her in the hospital
with her owl, her trusty owl.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.135
Her arm is wrapped up
because she's having an IV.

00:16:45.135 --> 00:16:47.010
She's actually having
a platelet transfusion.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.640
She had two of those, and it
was absolutely terrifying.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.560
It's a strange disorder.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.470
It's very, very weird when you
are told that your daughter's

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.690
body is attacking itself.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.679
If it's something from the
outside, it's like, OK, look.

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:04.470
We can fix this, we
can make sense of this.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.750
But that's what's
happening inside.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.020
And also, there's very few side
effects when children have it.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.140
So she was fine.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.380
She didn't have
fever or fatigue.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.500
But you can show them
the next one, yes.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.190
This is what was
happening to her body.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.930
Spontaneously, these
types of bruises

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.480
were coming up everywhere.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.300
My son had been born
just a few weeks earlier.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.810
So we had a new
baby and a daughter

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.181
with a very strange illness.

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:31.680
So the family was
kind of separated.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.430
I stayed in the hospital
with my daughter.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.310
And I just watched these
bruises appear on her body.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.590
But a few weeks into the
process, she was sent home.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.565
She had medications.

00:17:43.565 --> 00:17:45.690
We were told, you know,
don't let her hurt herself.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.680
Don't let her fall off the--

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.346
I mean, she's a very
rambunctious child.

00:17:48.346 --> 00:17:49.917
So that was hard.

00:17:49.917 --> 00:17:51.000
I started to collect data.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.970
Because I knew
that this was a way

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:00.340
to keep track of what was
happening with her, but also,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.620
I think, that it really
became more about me.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.320
Because I was losing my--

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.580
I was not parenting
well, I was not

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.720
coping well, and collecting
data on my daughter,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.580
on her medications,
on her bruises,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.650
on all of these things.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.120
And then at the end
of my data collection

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.600
was the annotations part,
with basically the information

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.890
I had about myself.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.150
And I recognized that.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.060
So we would go back to the
doctor, get her platelet count,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.230
get her number.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.990
And I would base my
life off of that number,

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:34.210
whether I was happy
or sad, or able

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:39.710
to deal with some other
issue or not, or I had to--

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.260
and I connected my emotions
and my stability to this number

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.360
that, for my daughter,
really wasn't--

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.650
it wasn't affecting her.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.860
She was still happy,
and she was energetic.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.530
And she just happened to
have this thing that she was

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.720
hopefully going to grow out of.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.420
So the data collection
we did really

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.320
helped me disconnect
from what was happening

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.989
to her medically versus what was
happening to her emotionally.

00:19:04.989 --> 00:19:05.780
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.910
So I mean, if you
think about it,

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.520
ITP is a very visual disease.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.170
And in this moment
of uncertainty,

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.310
what Kaki was doing, and what I
was trying to support her with,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.650
is define a structure for how
to observe what was happening.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.600
And so she started
the daily observation

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.120
of a mix of quantitative
and qualitative information,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.010
really bringing together
the clinical inputs

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.090
from Cooper's lab tests together
with much more soft data,

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.400
if we want to think data-wise,
from Kaki's observation

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.330
and from her life.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.780
And we did so primarily to
channel stress and anxiety

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.150
into a semblance of control.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.510
But also, as a step further
in our collaboration,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.760
we decided to share
this story, the story

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.630
of the fourth month of data
collection, through data only.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.580
And as I was reading
Kaki's records,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.590
I was really
overwhelmed by feeling.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.630
And the things that
I asked myself,

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.360
as a person who then worked
with data as a material

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.360
to build a narrative,
can that data

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.990
visualization evoke also
empathy and activate,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.580
as in the people
who looks at that,

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.940
also at an emotional level and
not only at a cognitive one?

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.070
And can looking at
a data visualization

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.740
make you feel part of a
story of a human life?

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.490
So then I'll guide you
through the process

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.364
of the visualization.

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:21.280
And then we'll tell
you more about it.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.680
I structured this
fluid timeline,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.210
where each white element--

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.440
we can call them petals--

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.750
is a different day, for
a total of four months

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.990
of data collection.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.590
And as Kaki was
anticipating, the time

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.960
that is structured in
sections are the moments

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.550
in between the
readings, meaning when

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.320
Cooper was admitted
to the hospital

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.760
to have her blood checked.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.820
Because this moment
really paced their days.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.360
And so the timeline
of the months

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.060
was not linear in their life.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.620
And every time
there is a lab test,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.090
we start a new group of petals.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.400
And the platelet counts
from the lab tests

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.080
are represented
by these red dots

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.254
at the beginning of
each group of days.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.920
And we need to say
that the normal range

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.850
for a platelet count
varies from 150 to 400.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.520
And so the numbers
of 1, 7, and 30

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.530
that you see in the beginning
are really frightening.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.870
And then I began to
incorporate Cooper's skin

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.730
as was observed by Kaki.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.980
The intensity of the
bruises is represented

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.900
by these purple and
green splotches.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.770
Of course, the more
intense and present,

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.147
the more they were present
that day on Cooper's skin.

00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:24.480
KAKI KING: And sorry to jump in.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.830
But those were really
hard things to quantify.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.300
And I knew that, again,
my trust in Giorgia

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.880
was that I could say, you
know, these bruises are bigger

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.080
or they're more purple.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.160
What happens when
you have a bruise

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.576
and you have ITP
is your platelets

00:21:41.576 --> 00:21:43.580
don't rush in to help
the clotting process.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.680
So you sort of bleed
into your bruise.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.230
And an old bruise
can even become new

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.060
if your platelet count drops.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.560
The blood simply
starts to leak out.

00:21:54.459 --> 00:21:56.000
And there's also
these things-- and I

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.010
know you're about to speak
about them-- but petechiae.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.926
And they're basically
just burst blood vessels

00:21:59.926 --> 00:22:03.470
under the skin that can
also happen spontaneously.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.800
Normally, if you scrape yourself
and don't break the skin,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.440
you might get a few,
but they go away fast.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.980
There would just be this
horrible rash on her neck,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.040
on her face.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.790
So yeah, it was a very
visual disease, but one that

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.180
was really hard to measure.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.330
And so I had to use descriptive
words, rather than numbers,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.830
at times.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.621
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah.

00:22:24.621 --> 00:22:26.750
And when I was reading
these, I was not, of course,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.005
interested in exact numbers
of bruises in petechiae,

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:31.640
but about the four
month of data collection

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.410
and the evolution of
all of this over time.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.030
And so I took my own ways to
measure the intensity based

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.615
on the top, the day
that they were higher

00:22:40.615 --> 00:22:41.990
and the day that
they were lower.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.530
And I tried to use these
strokes and brushes that

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.680
can resemble visually the
disease in a way that also

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.965
helped us quantify the
data and really see

00:22:50.965 --> 00:22:53.090
the picture, or the big
picture, that you're seeing

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.110
over a longer period of time.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.860
Well, by then, we added
details about when

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.000
Cooper was taking medication--
steroids, specifically--

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.680
and they are these grape
shapes that affects the day.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.420
Also, Cooper had some incidents,
such as she fell at the park

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.390
while playing or she got
bitten by a mosquito, that

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.890
caused her skin to worsen.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.400
And we wanted to see how
that affected the skin,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.310
so we also included that.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.070
And you see how these fluid
timelines begin to take form

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.390
and to visually tell the
story of these months.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.390
And again, as Kaki
was describing,

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.130
besides medical
data, there's also

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.400
what was going on in Kaki's
life and in her mind.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.225
She tours a lot.

00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.890
And she felt very
stressed when away

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.804
from home in this
particular period of time.

00:23:35.804 --> 00:23:37.220
And the days that
she was gone are

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.080
indicated with these black dots
on the days that she was gone.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.480
There also have been, luckily,
positive moments in these four

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.310
months, such as a fun
birthday party for Cooper

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.160
or her brother, or a
great Halloween night,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.040
that I represented as these
bright yellow spots that

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.140
cheer up the visual, in a way.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.170
And lastly, Kaki also kept track
of her level of hope and fear

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.290
for the day that she reported
on a scale from 1 to 10

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.080
for both emotions, and
that here are visualized

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.140
through the floating
lines framing the days,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.980
where the dark
lines are her fears

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.750
and the orange
line are her hopes.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.750
And as she was describing,
this whole process

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.020
is not only about
Cooper, but it's mostly

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.900
about Kaki, and her
life, and their feelings.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.380
And all around, we had some
bits of Kaki's personal notes

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.020
for the day.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.390
And this is the final artwork.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.210
And ultimately, these data
also became, of course,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.240
a piece of music that she
composed directly from the four

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.399
months of data collection.

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.190
And I don't know if
you want to explain it.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.410
But this is the score that--

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.510
KAKI KING: This is
my score to help

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:46.520
me analyze the data
that I had written down

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.550
and to create a piece of music.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.890
So these are all the measures.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:54.940
So I believe we did each beat--
no, each measures is a day.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.760
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah, and
the song is 120 measures,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.100
covering the 248 and 20
days of data collection.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.900
And the timeline of
the song is exactly

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.420
representing what was
happening in their life,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.552
exactly, as the
data visualization.

00:25:07.552 --> 00:25:09.260
Yeah, there are elements
in the song that

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.570
reference the amount of
petechiae on Cooper's skin,

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.830
Kaki's changing mood.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.820
And the main guitar
part is a musical map

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.370
of the bruises on Cooper's skin.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.410
KAKI KING: This is
a really hard one.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.610
It was really hard.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.270
And even now, having some
distance, looking back,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.180
I'm like, whoa, this is a very--

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.960
but again, I owe
this all to you.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.170
Because this was a way--

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.460
like, the only way through--

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.480
the only way out was through.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.650
And this is
something that I felt

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.691
necessary to do in order
to share it with people,

00:25:41.691 --> 00:25:47.880
but also to create
something that was positive.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.070
GIORGIA LUPI: So we
premiered this project

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.090
at a closed conference
of health care executives

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.790
in San Francisco
in January, where

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.800
Kaki played the song live.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.730
And we're going to
play the song for you

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.100
here through this video.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.400
And we invite you to get
immersed in this data

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.497
and to see if you feel
something through data only.

00:26:08.497 --> 00:26:11.491
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:13.986
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:29.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.990
So that is pretty intense.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.780
But for the purpose
of talking about it

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.250
and sharing it with you,
as you can probably see,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.970
this is not by any means a
scientific representation

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.780
of data.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.490
But still, we think
that it paints

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.240
a pretty complete and sensorial
picture of these very personal

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:48.780
journeys.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.750
And really, this type of
overlooked information--

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.480
what's going on in people's
lives, their feelings--

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.180
might be as important
as clinical data and lab

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.040
tests to frame a
disease, especially

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.710
from the point of view of the
patients and their family.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.250
And after we released
the project publicly,

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.500
we received really
a lot of messages,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.680
very personal messages, from
parents, caregivers, health

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.290
care practitioners, and in
general, human beings that

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.610
were deeply moved by this story
that we only told through data.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.340
Many practitioners,
they mentioned

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.260
that they realize for the
first time that data could be

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.320
[INAUDIBLE] and used in
this way, many sharing how

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.440
the project really made them
think about data differently

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.504
in their work.

00:30:29.504 --> 00:30:31.170
And they are starting
to think about how

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.530
to include other types of
data that they can measure

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:35.940
with the more human side.

00:30:38.674 --> 00:30:40.590
Kaki and I are keeping
on to explore together.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.330
And we will have some news soon.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.226
I feel we'll also now like to
open it up to a conversation.

00:30:46.226 --> 00:30:47.850
And for those of you
who are wondering,

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.400
Cooper is fine now, right?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.480
KAKI KING: Cooper is OK.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.800
She still has ITP.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.450
She's still probably-- we're
unsure whether or not she

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.900
will grow out of it entirely.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.120
This is her and her baby
brother a few months ago.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.850
But she has been in a
healthy and fairly high

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.560
range, although not
in a normal range,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.480
for platelet counts
for several months now.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.900
So she hopefully will be fine.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.300
And hopefully-- as
a childhood disease,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.130
typically children
grow out of it.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.769
She has had it
for almost a year,

00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:21.060
and therefore they're a little
skeptical whether or not

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.570
it's going to stay.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.530
But it's manageable.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.400
It's manageable.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.530
Yeah, thanks Giorgia.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.900
GIORGIA LUPI: Thank you.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:35.220
SPEAKER 1: So I would
like to personally

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.170
say thank you for
sharing this story

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.650
and for coming and
not only sharing

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.750
your musical art with
us, but visual art,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.550
and dealing with data.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:49.500
And in watching this, I'm
reminded of Neil Gaiman's

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.480
speech about make great art.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.910
No matter what comes along,
no matter what you face,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.570
make great art.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.520
And this is a perfect
example of what

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.119
seems to be great art coming
out of a difficult situation.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:01.910
KAKI KING: I agree.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.960
I mean, I think
that when I see--

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.750
every time the-- it's
never been easy to--

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.750
it's never been easy
to witness this.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.360
And certainly, this is not
the first time I've cried.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.460
But when everything
pans out at the end

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.070
and you see the full artwork,
and especially when I

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.190
see the printed art, I
think, that's so beautiful.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.910
And it does change
my emotional state

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.400
from something that's
just filled with anxiety

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.599
and tenseness to wow,
at the end of the day,

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:31.140
we were able to make
something that's

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.380
really healing and beautiful.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.030
And you know, I owe everything
about that to Giorgia.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.780
GIORGIA LUPI: I was
only a supporter here.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.580
KAKI KING: That's not true.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.540
SPEAKER 1: But there's also just
this incredible density to it.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.697
Not just the data
set, but the way

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:48.030
that it's layered, and the
artwork, and then the density

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.710
in the music.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.060
And it, in an interesting
way, reflects the music

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.000
that you've always been making,
which is incredibly dense

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.440
and almost needs, as you kind of
alluded to before, to be seen.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.130
Hearing it almost
undersells the importance

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.232
of what's actually going
on, the whole package.

00:33:05.232 --> 00:33:07.440
KAKI KING: And I think that's
the strength of Giorgia

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.516
and our work together is that
alone, my music is what it is.

00:33:12.516 --> 00:33:13.890
Alone, her artwork
is what it is.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.210
It's both very good.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.310
But together, we're able
to make something that's

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.890
very, very intensely powerful.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:26.940
I think any time you merge
visual and musical information,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.270
there's always an increase
in the emotional content

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.250
and people's ability to
connect and to have feelings.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.530
But I think when you
understand that there

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.770
is a data point underlying every
single piece of information

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.880
that you're seeing and
hearing, that there's

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.750
a system and a logic
to it, it brings

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:51.540
it even more strength and
something solid to stand on.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.430
Not to say art is
random, but it can be.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.790
It can be more however
the wind blew that day.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.909
But this is something that's
beautiful and very grounded.

00:33:59.909 --> 00:34:01.450
GIORGIA LUPI: Just
to add on to that,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.020
I feel that again,
the reason why we like

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.810
collaborating and we feel that--

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:07.410
yeah.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.076
It's really good for
us to work together

00:34:09.076 --> 00:34:14.310
is that both your music and
my way of visualizing data--

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.170
again, as you pointed
out in the beginning--

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.120
are very dense and very
rich, very detailed.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.170
KAKI KING: They
complement each other.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.669
GIORGIA LUPI: I
feel that, you know,

00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:23.580
if I was probably a person
who worked with data in a more

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.889
standard way, and if
you were a musician who

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.995
worked with music in a
more standard way, probably

00:34:28.995 --> 00:34:30.270
we still would get along.

00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:33.900
SPEAKER 1: I know
you mentioned--

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.239
this composition, the
music that's underlying,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.570
is based around the data.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.250
Out of curiosity,
have you looked

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.159
at examining other
massive data sets

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.980
to see what they sound like?

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.750
KAKI KING: Well, it's tricky.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.150
And I mean, even the
previous things that we've

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.635
done together, it's very--

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.740
music wants to have rules.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.480
And it wants to
fit into a much--

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.150
you know, typically, the
scale has seven notes.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.050
There isn't an infinite
amount of options.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.387
There are many, many textures,
and styles, and colors.

00:35:13.387 --> 00:35:14.970
But one thing that
we talk about a lot

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:19.140
is how music is something
that develops over time.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.390
And now, you've always
said data does too.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.390
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah,
especially a data collection

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.490
that you do on your cell phone
on-- anything in the world

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.260
develops over time.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.380
KAKI KING: But it's also
potential to stack data

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.080
like this.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.320
And it's trickier to
do that with music,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.380
to sort of say, well, I've got
30 data point, which you can

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.990
easily sort of show in a line.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.960
But to put those 30 data
points into a musical note

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.520
or a musical measure--

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.160
it's a lot harder.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.920
So I guess what I'm saying
is trying to work within

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.830
the parameters of
music in general--

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:01.140
even pretty far out ideas
and work with data sets is

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.800
challenging--

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.424
but it's also feasible and
something that we're taking on.

00:36:07.424 --> 00:36:09.090
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah,
we're collaborating.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:10.779
We will have some news soon.

00:36:10.779 --> 00:36:11.820
Hopefully, something big.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.403
KAKI KING: We're
going to have a baby.

00:36:13.403 --> 00:36:14.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:16.350
SPEAKER 1: A beautiful,
artistic baby.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:16.890
Wonderful.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.100
Let's take some questions
from the audience, please.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.210
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.380
KAKI KING: Yes.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.010
AUDIENCE: First off,
thanks for coming, again.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:31.230
And so a lot of creative
projects, pretty much everyone

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.030
that I know of, where
you're collaborating,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.270
there's often disagreements.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.940
And I was wondering,
especially when

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.450
it's something so personal,
you might bite your tongue.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:47.230
And if maybe one person has an
opinion about the other one's

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.620
expertise, it's
harder to talk about.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.420
But I was just wondering
if you could tell us

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.880
any stories about that, if
there was any disagreements.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.910
KAKI KING: You know, in
this particular case,

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:07.780
I was still so distraught
that I needed guidance.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.520
And I feel, for the most part--

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.770
and you'll have to correct me.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.125
Because my memory, even
of this time period--

00:37:14.125 --> 00:37:15.620
it's very cloudy.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.190
My son, unfortunately, also
had an issue with his heart.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.050
So just having two sick
children is more than--

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.680
it's really difficult.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.590
So I looked to
Giorgia for guidance.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:31.310
And I really didn't step in the
way of anything, unless I did.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.200
Did we have a fight?

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:32.908
GIORGIA LUPI: No.

00:37:32.908 --> 00:37:35.410
Honestly, I feel that we
never had a fight at all.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.212
KAKI KING: But we have had our--

00:37:37.212 --> 00:37:38.170
we're different though.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.985
GIORGIA LUPI: We're
different, yeah.

00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:40.360
KAKI KING: We're
very, very different.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.443
We have different styles
and different approaches.

00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:45.542
Even today, how many emails
did you send me about today?

00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:47.500
And I was like, Giorgia,
it's going to be fine.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.583
We're just going to do our
thing, speak to people.

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:51.909
And you're like, Kaki,
I have to have my notes.

00:37:51.909 --> 00:37:52.700
GIORGIA LUPI: Well.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.325
It's different.

00:37:53.325 --> 00:37:55.400
I mean, I do public
speaking the whole time.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.640
But since I don't
have a guitar with me,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.450
and you don't have a structure.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.700
And she's more like, whatever.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.880
Because I'll play and I'll talk.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.250
KAKI KING: I think that
we do approach our work--

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:11.680
and I've been performing on
stage for my entire career.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.960
That's all my career has
ever been, since I was 23.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.620
So I have a different
approach to most things,

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.789
really, just
getting things done,

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:21.580
not worrying about
their presentation, kind

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.737
of not thinking that this
project is the last thing that

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:27.820
will ever matter, just
sort of working through it.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.880
And you are so precise, down to
every-- like, look at her work.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.087
It is down to every
single last detail.

00:38:37.087 --> 00:38:38.920
GIORGIA LUPI: You make
me sound very boring.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.990
KAKI KING: No, I'm not
making you sound boring.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.370
Because I don't know, trust me.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.830
Because I respect
you, and in this way,

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.960
love you so much
because I'm not that.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.040
I don't worry about the details
because in live performance,

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.200
it's gone.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.190
The mistake is
forever forgotten.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.390
I mean, really.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.070
You just roll on
to the next gig.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.950
And for you, what you
do is your legacy.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.067
And it stays.

00:39:01.067 --> 00:39:02.275
And there can be no mistakes.

00:39:02.275 --> 00:39:05.320
And there can be no
something accidental.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.580
Because again, what
data works-- sorry,

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.800
what Giorgia works with--

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.700
this is data.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.320
What data works with is Giorgia.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.490
That's really the truth.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:17.890
So I think that
sometimes, because we

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.300
are working intimately
together on things,

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.060
our personal style-- like,
she'll send me 10 emails.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.659
And I'm like, [LAUGHS]
I'll reply eventually.

00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:29.200
I don't know.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.920
I'm on tour.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.670
What do you want?

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.170
But no.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.400
I think we meet halfway.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.650
And I think that I am inspired
by Giorgia's attention

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:40.390
to detail and her sort of
relentless Giorgianess,

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:45.700
if I can, getting both at
the data and representation

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.420
of the data perfectly,
but also the data

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.770
humanism, the beauty of it.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:55.040
Those are the things that
inspire me about you.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.820
GIORGIA LUPI: Well, thank you.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.110
But I feel yours is really
an interesting question,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.330
especially because as
I met Kaki personally--

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.390
it was right about after
the "Dear Data" project--

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.890
it was another
intense collaboration

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.610
with another woman.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.276
And I feel that the
difference is there.

00:40:08.276 --> 00:40:10.990
For example, if I had to compare
these two collaborations, which

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:15.180
are both amazing, and I have
two amazing friends out of that,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.670
but is if you're collaborating
with a person who does exactly

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.020
what you do, it's harder.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.360
Like, with Stefanie,
it has been way harder.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.110
KAKI KING: Really?

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:23.710
GIORGIA LUPI: It is.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.340
Oh, my god, yes.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:24.990
You have no idea.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.080
KAKI KING: She's talking
crap about her ex.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.900
GIORGIA LUPI: We have.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.020
No, no.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.560
We share this on stage as well.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.000
Stefanie and I
arrived to a point

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.080
where we really needed
to have a shared

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.140
spreadsheet of the
things that we hated

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.260
about each other's design so
that we didn't, like, you know,

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.390
by mistake pick
a font or a color

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.770
that the other person
didn't like in the book,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:43.450
in the website.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.200
So you have no idea what a
collaboration that doesn't work

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.510
looks like.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.810
But I'm really, really
excited about I'm still

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.070
collaborating with Stefanie.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.100
But I guess what I'm saying
is that what you and I do

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.930
is so different.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.460
For me, collaborating
with you is

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.910
having a source of data,
a source of inspiration,

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.760
a source of really
things that are not

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.380
even comparable to my work.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.720
This is really a fool
to my work in a way.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.370
And I also believe that
our personalities--

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.920
we really also joke about that.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.260
I send you pictures of
my perfectly organized

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.130
and color-coded drawers
and folded things.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.210
KAKI KING: We do
have that in common.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.670
I have two children,
and I have a wife

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:28.240
that works in set design, so
our house is just whatever.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.465
I mean, it's a disaster.

00:41:29.465 --> 00:41:31.090
GIORGIA LUPI: When
you need to breathe,

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.780
I can send you
pictures of my house.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.840
KAKI KING: And when I need
to breathe, I ask Georgia,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.010
can you just send me a
picture of your pens, just

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.400
your organized pens?

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.180
And I get these
beautiful photos.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.100
And I get so calm.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.280
And then I threaten her.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.890
I'm like, I'm going to send you
a photo of my medicine cabinet.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.420
So yeah, we do like clean
and organized things.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.010
We do have that in
common, for sure.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.850
And I think that ultimately,
I think we like our lives

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.040
to be clean and
organized and our work

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.380
to be powerful in that way.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.340
So no.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.290
No giant fights yet.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:10.800
But definitely, certainly
different personalities,

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.370
but probably that have
arisen from the work

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.480
that we've been in for so long.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.210
And I think my music and touring
has shaped who I am, for sure.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.210
GIORGIA LUPI: Of course.

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:25.575
I mean, and I, on my hand-- and
then we'll change the subject--

00:42:25.575 --> 00:42:27.410
but I work with clients.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.190
Every time, I need
to be organized

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.394
and precise with emails,
with deadlines, with stuff.

00:42:31.394 --> 00:42:33.060
I mean, it's really
different, probably,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.726
to be a musician, and
touring the world,

00:42:34.726 --> 00:42:36.700
and to run a company,
and working with data.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.870
So it's kind of, really, the
opposite end of the spectrum.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:43.382
But still I feel, again,
we meet in the middle.

00:42:43.382 --> 00:42:45.340
SPEAKER 1: Well, on the
topic of organization--

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.800
and I think we do have a couple
more minutes for questions.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.790
If anybody else, please
make your way to a mic.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.070
On the topic of
the organization,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.940
it makes me curious about
with the flowers project.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.990
When you saw that
visually represented,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.824
how did you process
that's what you're doing?

00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:07.740
Because you talk about
not really fussing over

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.910
the details.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.086
When you see it laid
out and so detailed of,

00:43:11.086 --> 00:43:12.960
like, yeah, that's your
finger moving, that's

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.790
this other finger and this.

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.800
How did that impact you?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.580
KAKI KING: I think it
is such an exciting--

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.260
I feel honored that what
I do is interesting enough

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.300
to know the person, not just
to learn it on the guitar,

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.910
or not just to be
curious about what it is.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.440
But to be able to take
the time to work out

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.470
exactly what it is that
each finger on each hand

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.170
is precisely doing.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.010
And the result is beautiful.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.080
For me, when I look
at Giorgia's work,

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.360
it's about the
result. Again, I'm not

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.620
the most detailed person.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.622
So you can read
the legend, you can

00:43:58.622 --> 00:43:59.830
see exactly what's happening.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:00.970
You can decipher it all.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.490
It's all built on something
with this-- you know,

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.290
it all exists in the real world.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:12.160
But that is less
important to me than what

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.040
has come out of it, which
is this glorious picture

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.340
of these beautiful, strange
flowers that have opened up.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:22.030
So it's hard for me to
believe that that's my music,

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.040
that literally,
that is my music.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.170
That is Giorgia's
interpretation of,

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.940
but that it's every
single thing that I do

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.260
is contained in that
visual representation.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.570
So I think it's just this--

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.500
it's awe.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.980
I'm just in awe of
both my sheer luck

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.520
that I get to work with
someone that cares enough.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.302
that It resonates.

00:44:41.302 --> 00:44:43.510
Every time you go to a
conference and you present it,

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.970
you're like, Kaki,
people loved it.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.270
It was great.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.670
GIORGIA LUPI: That's so true.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.000
KAKI KING: Yeah.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.540
And not being a person
that has any origin,

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:58.630
individual or tech world,
at all to be invited in

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.710
and to be having my music
expressed in this way is just--

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.000
I'm floored, I'm honored.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.187
And it's just very special.

00:45:05.187 --> 00:45:07.270
GIORGIA LUPI: But you
started to work with visuals

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.300
even before meeting me.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.090
So I guess that you
were already drawn

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:15.070
into making your music not
only listenable, but also--

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.270
KAKI KING: It's true.

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.880
I had been starting
to work with visuals.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:25.262
But the connection was
very soft, and not this--

00:45:25.262 --> 00:45:26.470
GIORGIA LUPI: Yeah, not data.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.850
KAKI KING: Not
data driven, yeah.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.225
SPEAKER 1: Well,
and I think it's

00:45:29.225 --> 00:45:33.010
a great nexus of a lot of
different wants, and needs,

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.610
and weird triangulation
way, in that musicians

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.770
forever have sought
to make music

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.750
videos to have a visualization.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.890
And people in the big
data world are like, well,

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.650
if it's just a bunch of
numbers, it's very dry.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.310
So how do you make that
visually interesting,

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.790
or just interesting beyond
people who really like numbers?

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.780
And this seems to be a
great triad nexus of music

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.090
meets visual meets data.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.380
And it's presented in a truly
awesome and awe-inspiring way.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.489
So thank you very much, both.

00:46:03.489 --> 00:46:04.780
We do have a couple of minutes.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.724
Would you mind gracing
us with another song?

00:46:07.724 --> 00:46:09.140
Oh, did you have
another question?

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:09.848
Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:09.848 --> 00:46:12.860
AUDIENCE: I'd prefer hearing
another song, actually.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.526
SPEAKER 1: I think
we got time for both.

00:46:14.526 --> 00:46:15.550
Please.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.904
AUDIENCE: First of all, thank
you both for being here.

00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:20.320
Kaki, I was just wondering if
you could share a little bit

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.390
about how you normally approach
writing songs from scratch,

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:31.060
and then how it's different
to approach this song,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.310
where you have these parameters
set out for you, where

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:38.074
if this data point represents
a percussion to hit here,

00:46:38.074 --> 00:46:40.240
you sort of have to follow
that through for the rest

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.320
of the song.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.460
KAKI KING: So when I
write a song from scratch,

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.420
I have total freedom.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.230
Tempos, moods,
tunings, whatever--

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:54.430
I have no parameters, which
can be its own challenge.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:47:00.920
With this tune, like I said,
sort of cramming data in--

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.080
I want to say cramming.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.380
But when I get frustrated,
that's how I feel.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.470
Because I feel like I'm not
servicing the data in the way

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.210
it should be.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:15.980
And then there's certain musical
elements that just need to be--

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.780
there's a timeline.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.235
There should be a beat.

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.800
There has to be an
opening and closing point.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.290
So we did four months
of data because that

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.360
would fit into a
three minute song

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:31.340
with each measure being
three beats and 120 measures.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:36.370
But basically, we had to cap
it to allow it to make sense

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.530
visually and musically.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:42.820
And so for instance, there is a
part where my mood would shift,

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.040
and the piano sound
would go from a major

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.770
to a minor, or the
underlying synthesizer sound.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.600
And I wasn't exactly
happy with it

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.240
because occasionally,
it wouldn't

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.040
happen in a four bar phrase.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.310
It would sort of happen in
a bar five or a bar seven.

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.820
And even though I'm hip to
that, it wasn't always working.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:06.100
So without shifting anything,
I nudged a little bit.

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.770
I sort of did that.

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.570
So trying to retain all of
the integrity of the data

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.810
and retaining the
integrity of music

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.010
is actually hugely challenging.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.010
And that's something that
I think that I'm still

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.559
figuring out the process of.

00:48:19.559 --> 00:48:21.100
GIORGIA LUPI: If I
can add one thing.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.500
Following you from afar as
you were composing the music--

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.770
like, not from afar,
but from the outside--

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.150
is not that you
decided what notes

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.430
to play based on the data.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.260
But you had some melodies in
mind, or melodies that like,

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.340
let's say,
combinations of sounds

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.900
that then would integrate
the timelines and the data

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.440
collection.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:43.130
So it was not really a direct
translation of data a note,

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:44.260
G minor or something.

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.790
But it was more
like, OK, following

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.370
some structures, knowing
that there are some sections,

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:52.300
and moments that needed to
be represented with a sound

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:55.610
to really pay the truth
to the data collection.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.562
But there were
moments when I feel

00:48:57.562 --> 00:48:59.020
it's not that you
were improvising,

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:04.990
but that you took a fair amount
of freedom in little phrases

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:07.840
to express also things that
were really personal for you,

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.000
like your changes of mood.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.570
So I guess I'm saying
it's not really

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:14.110
always a direct translation,
but it's more like data that

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.670
informs the music composition.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.410
Whereas with data
visualization, probably

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.890
also because it's
more formalized

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.950
and because people need
to understand and see--

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.640
well, data visualization--
it is a direct translation

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.110
of the data points.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.750
KAKI KING: Well, but also what
you do and with your focus

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:32.980
on data humanism, it
allows me to look at data

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.980
and say, I have a feeling now.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.152
So much of what you do--

00:49:38.152 --> 00:49:39.610
with your data,
with other things--

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:43.840
has so much personal
emotion built into it.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.520
And music is the
language of emotion,

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.290
especially instrumental
music, which

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.030
is a language I'm
very familiar with.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:53.830
So it's almost like, is it more
important for this precise note

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.980
to land on this exact
measure to represent

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.540
when we were in the hospital?

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.180
Or is it more important
to you to feel that?

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.890
And I think that
the data humanism

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.920
aspect of Giorgia's
work and music

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.590
allows that
connection to be made,

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.190
allows that freedom to
take a tiny bit of liberty,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:16.025
but still more effectively
getting the point across.

00:50:16.025 --> 00:50:16.900
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.230
Thank you.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:20.990
Again, just absolutely
astounding work.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.410
It's really beautiful.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.992
It's really sonically
amazing and astounding.

00:50:24.992 --> 00:50:26.450
And you both have
created something

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:30.740
amazing that I think people
in the world can grow from,

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:31.500
just watching.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.460
And hopefully, it
does have that impact.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.840
We look forward to what is next.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.500
Are you able to tell us anything
about this art and music baby?

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.830
KAKI KING: Because of
the foray into performing

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.980
arts and theatrical
work that's still

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.320
based all around me
playing the guitar--

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.440
but I have a lot more
creative freedom and license--

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.450
and because of my
work with Giorgia,

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.870
there are arts organizations out
there who are basically saying,

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:04.490
we are inviting you to create
a work that incorporates what

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:09.890
I do, what Giorgia does,
and tells more of a story

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:10.580
through data.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:14.750
Not just data visualization,
but to kind of address

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:19.400
all of what does that word do to
your mind and to talk about it.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.170
And Giorgia has been--

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:31.060
I've sort of signified her as
my muse, and my consultant,

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.570
and as well as
someone that's going

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.000
to do a lot of visual
work for the show,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.970
both in the things that
you've already seen

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.405
and hopefully, some ways
that we haven't tried yet.

00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:41.780
GIORGIA LUPI:
Yeah. so it will be

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.150
hopefully a full show together.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.620
Like with Kaki,
of course, that's

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.840
going to be the person
playing in 2019.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.280
For me, it's also
real interesting

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.220
to take this idea
of data humanism

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.160
and bring it outside the data
community or the visualization

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.370
community, and try
to tell a story

00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:59.960
of the many different ways
that we have to look at data.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.340
And that data-- soft and
small, and big and cold--

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.520
influences our lives.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.230
So that will be it.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:07.330
KAKI KING: Stay tuned.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:07.680
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.080
Well, I'm certainly
looking forward to it.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.610
And again, thank you very much,
both, for being here today.

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.484
KAKI KING: Thank
you for having us.

00:52:13.484 --> 00:52:14.900
SPEAKER 1: And
absolutely, please.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.360
The stage is yours.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.110
KAKI KING: I will.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.635
Here we go.

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:20.605
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.810
This song goes out to
my buddy Aaron over here

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:36.700
and also my buddy
Giorgia over there.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.800
[MUSIC - KAKI KING]

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.350
[APPLAUSE]
