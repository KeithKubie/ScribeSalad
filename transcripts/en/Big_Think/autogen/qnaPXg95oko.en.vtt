something good happens I cried when I
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.410
something good happens I cried when I
learned I I my paper got into science

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420
learned I I my paper got into science
 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.670

think that women not all women but some
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.029
think that women not all women but some
women are more open to to that that it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
women are more open to to that that it's
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.660
women are more open to to that that it's
it's it's a movement that is not really

authentic emotion into the practice of
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.940
authentic emotion into the practice of
science because as you know the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
science because as you know the
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.600
science because as you know the
stereotype is closed you know

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610
stereotype is closed you know
 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.130
stereotype is closed you know
unemotional it's just data it doesn't

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
unemotional it's just data it doesn't
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380
unemotional it's just data it doesn't
matter but the truth is that all

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
matter but the truth is that all
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749
matter but the truth is that all
scientists are passionate about their

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
scientists are passionate about their
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.480
scientists are passionate about their
ideas and what they're doing and that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
ideas and what they're doing and that
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.660
ideas and what they're doing and that
leads to two passionate emotions that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
leads to two passionate emotions that
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420
leads to two passionate emotions that
could include crying or laughing or

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
could include crying or laughing or
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.179
could include crying or laughing or
celebrating and I know lots of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
celebrating and I know lots of
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039
celebrating and I know lots of
scientists that that that do show those

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
scientists that that that do show those
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469
scientists that that that do show those
emotions but the stereotype is and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
emotions but the stereotype is and
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.920
emotions but the stereotype is and
perhaps the old guard is that shut down

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
perhaps the old guard is that shut down
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990
perhaps the old guard is that shut down
kind of thing and and the the squall

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
kind of thing and and the the squall
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.249
kind of thing and and the the squall
chain of any show of emotion so I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
chain of any show of emotion so I
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.459
chain of any show of emotion so I
certainly have had emotional situations

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
certainly have had emotional situations
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.800
certainly have had emotional situations
in my lab where I had to tell say

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
in my lab where I had to tell say
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.569
in my lab where I had to tell say
difficult things did people and there

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
difficult things did people and there
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910
difficult things did people and there
have been tears shed and I have to say

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
have been tears shed and I have to say
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.389
have been tears shed and I have to say
that I've had a journey myself and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
that I've had a journey myself and
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.619
that I've had a journey myself and
learning how to deal with that at first

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
learning how to deal with that at first
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390
learning how to deal with that at first
it's like I don't want you to cry

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
it's like I don't want you to cry
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.020
it's like I don't want you to cry
because if you cry I will cry and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
because if you cry I will cry and
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.820
because if you cry I will cry and
that's terrible so I tried not to have

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830
that's terrible so I tried not to have
 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.250
that's terrible so I tried not to have
them cry but my my approach now is look

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
them cry but my my approach now is look
 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.730
them cry but my my approach now is look
that's natural if you need to cry you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740
that's natural if you need to cry you
 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.940
that's natural if you need to cry you
cry it's just part it doesn't show

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950
cry it's just part it doesn't show
 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.460
cry it's just part it doesn't show
anything weak or strong it's just part

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
anything weak or strong it's just part
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.410
anything weak or strong it's just part
of the emotion that's coming out and I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
of the emotion that's coming out and I
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.210
of the emotion that's coming out and I
understand that because I'm saying

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
understand that because I'm saying
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.920
understand that because I'm saying
something that may be difficult for you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
something that may be difficult for you
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.729
something that may be difficult for you
to hear and I can see that and you know

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
to hear and I can see that and you know
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.120
to hear and I can see that and you know
that my tagline is scientists are people

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130
that my tagline is scientists are people
 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.430
that my tagline is scientists are people
too and we have emotions and I think we

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440
too and we have emotions and I think we
 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.880
too and we have emotions and I think we
need to acknowledge that so I'm I think

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
need to acknowledge that so I'm I think
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.229
need to acknowledge that so I'm I think
it's appropriate that that scientists

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239
it's appropriate that that scientists
 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.640
it's appropriate that that scientists
step down i think that represents

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650
step down i think that represents
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.710
step down i think that represents
something that we need to move away from

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720
something that we need to move away from
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.070
something that we need to move away from
in science and embrace the fact that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080
in science and embrace the fact that
 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080
in science and embrace the fact that
scientists of people and they have

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
scientists of people and they have
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.330
scientists of people and they have
emotions and that were very passionate

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
emotions and that were very passionate
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.180
emotions and that were very passionate
people and so crying can happen i don't

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190
people and so crying can happen i don't
 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.510
people and so crying can happen i don't
care if your man or a woman
