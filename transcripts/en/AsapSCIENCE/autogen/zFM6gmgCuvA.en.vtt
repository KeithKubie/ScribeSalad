 We watch all the time in movies and TV shows as birds reach messages. 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.769
 Whether it is a historical drama, or a Western drama in the series "Conflict of Arush" one has to ask 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.429
 Can birds really communicate messages accurately? 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.220
 Not to awaken you from your dreams of roses, but the crows, which are usually very intelligent, 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.430
 Not likely birds to complete this task. Sorry John Snow! (Crow in the serial) But the fact is a bit amazing 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.460
 Other birds, like the bath, are amazing in this work! Hence the name (bath pigeons) 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.769
 In fact, the bathroom was used effectively 3,000 years ago, to advertise the exterior of the Olympic winner. 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.739
 Translation of AraSense _ 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.989
 The bathroom has the innate ability to return home, which means that it will return to its nest for mating. 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.929
 There were 1,800 km of bathroom flights. Because of this, use for centuries to send messages, 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.879
 But with emphasis on the word "but" - and in general, the bathroom carries messages 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.369
 One way only. The bathroom is away from home and, if needed, can be delivered 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:59.399
 The messages come back to him again, because his innate instinct is to return home. So the idea 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 Sending a bird to whatever place you want is a little tricky. However, put it 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.100
 Feed it with one location, and home with another, the bathroom trains to fly back and forth 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.420
 Between two sites reliably. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.310
 The bath has a high visibility, uses the sun, stars, landscapes, scents and sound waves, 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 Perhaps also the earth's magnetic field to determine its habitat. Not to mention it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.899
 Apparently he has an internal compass that guides him. Because of his migration behavior, 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.630
 He can train as a mass flight, unlike other birds require 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.719
 Individual attention to completing the task. 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.729
