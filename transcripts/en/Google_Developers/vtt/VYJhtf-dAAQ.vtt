KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.060
We are at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.310
I'm joined in the
studio today by Iddo.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.740
He is the founder
and CEO of Invi.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.350
IDDO TAI: Yes.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.560
KORY JEFFREY: Thank
you for joining.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.470
IDDO TAI: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.261
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.580
And tell me a little
bit about what is Invi.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.490
IDDO TAI: So Invi is
a rich media messaging

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.790
app that replaces on your
Android device your regular SMS

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.756
app and just makes it better.

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:25.630
KORY JEFFREY: How so?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.572
What makes it better?

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:28.030
IDDO TAI: So once
you install Invi,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.520
it takes all over
your SMS experience.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.680
And it just works slick.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.760
And it looks cool.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.920
And it has a lot of rich media
integration on top of that.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.310
So you have mini apps.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.220
You can watch YouTube while
messaging with your friends.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.600
You can play
games-- [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.830
all that, and immediately
share with your friends.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.200
And when you get
rich media, it's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.080
not just a blue link that takes
you away from your experience.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.220
If I send you a
YouTube, if you click,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.460
you cannot chat with me anymore.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.500
So what we do, we
changed it to a widget.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.440
And you continue watching
it while messaging

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.190
with your friends.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.816
KORY JEFFREY: And this is all
from within the app itself?

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:06.566
IDDO TAI: Exactly.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.280
KORY JEFFREY:
That's pretty slick.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.580
So there's been a lot of
interesting, big things

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.360
happening in the chat
space, obviously,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.525
with Facebook buying WhatsApp,
and then WeChat investing

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.200
in Kik in a big way.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.310
What are your thoughts
on the space in general?

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.800
IDDO TAI: I think that all
those messaging apps are great.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.860
And over 20% of Americans
has WhatsApp or Kik

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.470
and they use it as their
international messaging abroad,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.552
but they don't use it
between themselves.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:35.730
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.980
IDDO TAI: They still send SMS.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.810
And I think that my take on it,
it's because SMS is free here.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.280
And also, we don't have a
good internet connection

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.320
on our mobile phones.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.903
If you say, hey, I'm downstairs
and you're sending a WhatsApp,

00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:49.290
it will not get there on time.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050
So with your cousin
abroad, it's OK.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.700
With your buddy that you're
waiting for, it's not OK.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.930
And therefore, SMS is strong.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.677
We just take it over and we
make an iMessage experience.

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:01.385
So if both of us are
on good connections,

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:03.250
it will be over the internet.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.790
But if not, it will send an SMS.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.123
So it ensures that your
friend's going to get a message.

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:07.810
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.560
How long have you
been working on this?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.750
IDDO TAI: Over three years.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.500
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.405
IDDO TAI: Yeah.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.527
KORY JEFFREY: Any big milestones
over those three years?

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:16.110
IDDO TAI: Yes.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.160
I think that understanding
the market needs

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.970
and why other messaging apps
are not successful for the US

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.440
market for most
of your messaging,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.430
and just bring
them what they want

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.690
and tailor it to the Android.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.690
That's what we're
all excited about.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.102
And our user really likes it.

00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:35.310
KORY JEFFREY: That's awesome.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.260
So we're at Founder World.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.820
There's been thousands of
people walking around today.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.995
What attracted
you to this event?

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:44.870
IDDO TAI: I think that
our mission in general

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.050
is to just upgrade your
communication, make it reach.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.984
And this was a good
opportunity to talk about Invi

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:52.865
and to see how
other entrepreneurs,

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.260
a lot of other entrepreneurs
trying to raise money.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800
They ask us questions, how
did you guys raise money?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.030
What did you guys go through?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.220
We just share our story.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.360
That's what I love doing.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.151
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:04.654
So you just came off the stage.

00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:06.570
And is that where you
were sharing your story?

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.980
What was the main
message you were

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.110
giving while you were speaking?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.276
IDDO TAI: I think the main
message was on the stage.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.620
They asked a few tough
questions there, like,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.750
how do you deal with
investors, what is your rank.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.440
It was all around, the crowd was
very interested about funding

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.135
your app, your startup.

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:22.134
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.507
Probably very topical
for a lot of people here.

00:03:24.507 --> 00:03:25.090
IDDO TAI: Yes.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.209
I have very extreme
opinions about that.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.500
KORY JEFFREY: Any in particular
that you want to share?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.083
IDDO TAI: I think
the one thing that I

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.290
shared there, as
an entrepreneur,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.210
you're in the mindset of
sometimes you go to investors,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.190
say look, you don't
have enough users,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.960
or this is a space we don't
understand so much about.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.940
And practically, they're
saying you no in a nice way.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.080
I think you should thank
them for their time

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.330
and you should leave the room.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.570
You should go outside the
building to the sidewalk.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.003
You go in the middle of the
street and just shout, next!

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.440
KORY JEFFREY: And just move on.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.740
IDDO TAI: Then move
on and find people

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.781
that are inspiring you
and you want to work with,

00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:07.650
that are extraordinary,
that can really help.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.520
And we have an amazing
group of investors

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.430
that helps us, that really
become friends and understand

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.480
the hard task we go through,
but also understand the outcome.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.240
Once we solve it, rich media
messaging for the US market

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.590
can be huge.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.700
And people who just made it
in China on WeChat, $5 billion

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.760
of revenue, 850
million active users.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.510
The CTO of the group just led
the round of investing in us

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.290
and joined the board, together
with the CTO of Weibo,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.900
which is the Twitter of China.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.180
So there's a lot of people
that done that that really

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.830
understand.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.650
I think you should
really want to find

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.440
the top, top extraordinary
people in your space

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.985
and try to work with
them and learn from them.

00:04:51.985 --> 00:04:53.360
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.860
I didn't know Weibo
had invested locally.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.033
That's really cool.

00:04:57.033 --> 00:04:58.660
IDDO TAI: It's the CTO himself.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.896
He has another company.

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:02.270
KORY JEFFREY:
That's even better.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.860
IDDO TAI: Yes.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.970
Working with the right people.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.760
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.843
So as you walk around
today, you see a whole bunch

00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:09.620
of different
technologies, from VR

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.160
to robots to all sorts
of different things.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.130
Is there anything, other
than the chat space,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.338
that kind of gets you really
excited about the future

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:17.920
of tech?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.660
IDDO TAI: So many.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.030
I'm personally into making
communication between people

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.530
better.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.650
I think it's a key.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.220
But any technology that
just makes life better

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.870
gets me excited.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.960
Make our life better and
make my wife less mad at me.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.667
Makes everything better.

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:38.875
KORY JEFFREY: Improves the
communication between you,

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:39.374
right?

00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:40.090
IDDO TAI: Yeah.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.530
KORY JEFFREY: So last question.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.090
What is your favorite
Google technology?

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.900
IDDO TAI: Google has a lot
of strong technologies,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.490
and we are dependent
on a lot of them.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.511
Google Cloud Messaging,
and the Android platform.

00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:55.010
But if you ask me
as a consumer what

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.810
I use the most, what I like
the most, it's pretty vanilla,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.550
but it's Google Maps.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.700
It's saved my marriage.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.970
I just turn it on.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.040
It's working.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.982
And then I can be free
to drive and communicate.

00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:11.190
KORY JEFFREY: That's awesome.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.150
IDDO TAI: No more one person
navigate, the other one

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.650
driving.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.470
I can do them both.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.120
KORY JEFFREY: And then you
both have something else

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.430
to blame if you get lost.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.640
IDDO TAI: Exactly.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.803
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
very much for joining us.

00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:20.710
IDDO TAI: Thank
you for having me.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.600
I appreciate it.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.340
It was fun.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.965
KORY JEFFREY: Thank
you for joining us.

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:27.510
We are on location at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.560
