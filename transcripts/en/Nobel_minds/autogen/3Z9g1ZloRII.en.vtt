00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
hello my name is Peter and given away I

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160
hello my name is Peter and given away I
 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.500
hello my name is Peter and given away I
wonder about the synergy between the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510
wonder about the synergy between the
 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.520
wonder about the synergy between the
nanotechnology and the biotechnology how

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
nanotechnology and the biotechnology how
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.250
nanotechnology and the biotechnology how
do you see that will progress in the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
do you see that will progress in the
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.960
do you see that will progress in the
coming 10 years and we can you give some

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
coming 10 years and we can you give some
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.320
coming 10 years and we can you give some
examples be pathetic you know what you

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
examples be pathetic you know what you
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.279
examples be pathetic you know what you
think will happen in 15 years so time

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
think will happen in 15 years so time
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.359
think will happen in 15 years so time
from now yeah the synergy comes from the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
from now yeah the synergy comes from the
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090
from now yeah the synergy comes from the
common tools and finally what are the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
common tools and finally what are the
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.830
common tools and finally what are the
nanotechnology this is a several many

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
nanotechnology this is a several many
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.040
nanotechnology this is a several many
tools that now can be used by the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
tools that now can be used by the
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529
tools that now can be used by the
physicist by the chemist by a so by the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
physicist by the chemist by a so by the
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.760
physicist by the chemist by a so by the
biologist and so for example and so this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
biologist and so for example and so this
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.619
biologist and so for example and so this
tools prepare mainly by the physicists

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
tools prepare mainly by the physicists
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380
tools prepare mainly by the physicists
can be extend to a self field and for

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
can be extend to a self field and for
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.280
can be extend to a self field and for
exam for the and biotech you can use a

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290
exam for the and biotech you can use a
 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.960
exam for the and biotech you can use a
proximity microscope for exam STM used

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
proximity microscope for exam STM used
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600
proximity microscope for exam STM used
before by the physicists you can use

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
before by the physicists you can use
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.200
before by the physicists you can use
also by your ships fabricate on the same

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
also by your ships fabricate on the same
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.719
also by your ships fabricate on the same
with the same methods are the ships of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
with the same methods are the ships of
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.679
with the same methods are the ships of
the electrician's or you can use also

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689
the electrician's or you can use also
 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.670
the electrician's or you can use also
the techniques of micro 3d t2 for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
the techniques of micro 3d t2 for
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.080
the techniques of micro 3d t2 for
example to survive fluids in analysis

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
example to survive fluids in analysis
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.609
example to survive fluids in analysis
device and so this is this in facts now

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
device and so this is this in facts now
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.560
device and so this is this in facts now
many fields of research share these

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570
many fields of research share these
 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.000
many fields of research share these
tools were called the nano technologies
