00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's do some more examples
with exact

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.670
differential equations.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.300
And I'm getting these problems
from page 80 of my old college

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.430
differential equations books.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.890
This is the fifth edition of
Elementary Differential

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.540
Equations by William Boyce
and Richard DiPrima.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.800
I want to make sure they get
credit, that I'm not making up

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980
these problems. I'm getting
it from their book.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.180
Anyway, so I'm just going to
give a bunch of equations.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.760
We have to figure out if they're
exact, and if they are

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.850
exact, we'll use what we know
about exact differential

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.070
equations to figure out
their solutions.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:40.850
So the first one they have is,
2x plus 3, plus 2y minus 2,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.840
times y prime is equal to 0.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.440
So this is our M of x and y--
although, this is only a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.360
function of x-- and then
this is our N, right?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.130
You could say that's
M, or that's N.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.560
You could also say that, if this
is exact-- well, first

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.873
let's [? test ?]

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.120
this exact, before we start
talking about psi.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.220
So what's the partial of this,
with respect to y?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.950
The partial of M, with
respect to y.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.590
Well, there's no y
here, so it's 0.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.230
The rate of change that
this changes with

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.580
respect to y is 0.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.380
And what's the rate of
change this changes,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.120
with respect to x?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.140
The partial of N, with respect
to x is equal to-- well,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.490
there's no x here, right?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.510
So these are just constants from
an x point of view, so

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.240
this is all going to be 0.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.210
But we do see that
they're both 0.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.480
So M sub y, or the partial with
respect to y, is equal to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.060
the partial with respect to x.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.380
So this is exact.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500
And actually, we don't have to
use exact equations here.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.340
We'll do it, just so that
we get used to it.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010
But if you look here, you
actually could have figured

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.670
out that this is actually
a separable equation.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310
But anyway, this is exact.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.240
So knowing that it's exact, it
tells us that there's some

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.610
function psi, where psi is
a function of x and y.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.040
Where psi sub x is equal to this
function, is equal to 2x

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.800
plus 3, and psi-- I shouldn't
say sub x.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.920
I say the partial of psi,
with respect to x.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.310
And the partial of psi, with
respect to y, is equal to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.270
this, 2y minus 2.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.000
And if we can find our psi, we
know that this is just the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.960
derivative of psi.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.290
Because we know that the
derivative, with respect to x

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.510
of psi, is equal to the partial
of psi, with respect

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.840
to x, plus the partial
of psi, with respect

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.270
to y, times y prime.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.750
So this is this just the
same form as that.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.280
So if we can figure out y,
then we can rewrite this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.390
equation as dx, the derivative
of psi, with respect to x, is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.250
equal to 0.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.490
Let me switch colors, or it's
going to get monotonous.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:53.890
This right here, if we can find
a psi, where the partial

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.130
with respect to x, is this, the
partial with respect to y,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.930
is this, then this can
be rewritten as this.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.700
And how do we know that?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.870
Because the derivative of psi,
with respect to x, using the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.990
partial derivative chain
rules, is this.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.190
This partial with respect
to x, that's this.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.070
This partial with respect to
y, is this, times y prime.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.070
So this is the whole point
of exact equations.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.760
But anyway, so let's figure
out what our psi is.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.170
Actually, before we figure out,
if the derivative of psi,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.410
with respect to x, is 0, then
if you integrate both sides,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.710
you just-- the solution
of this equation is

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.440
psi is equal to c.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.030
So using this information, if we
can solve for psi, then we

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.630
know that the solution of this
differential equation is psi

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.140
is equal to c.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.880
And then if we have some initial
conditions, we could

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.970
solve for c.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.960
So let's solve for psi.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.830
So let's integrate both sides
of this equation,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.350
with respect to x.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.980
And then we get psi is equal
to x squared plus 3x, plus

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.180
some function of y.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.590
Let's call it h of y.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.740
And remember, normally when you
take an antiderivative,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.810
you have just a plus
c here, right?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.210
But you can kind of say we
took an anti-partial

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.560
derivative.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.760
So when you took a partial
derivative, with respect to x,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.370
not only do you lose constants--
that's why we have

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.870
a plus c, normally-- but you
also lose anything that's a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.570
function of just y, and not x.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.110
So for example, take the partial
derivative of this

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.130
with respect to x, you're going
to get this, right?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.430
Because the partial derivative
of a function, purely of y,

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.090
with respect to x,
is going to be 0.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.450
So it will disappear.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.550
So anyway, we take the
antiderivative of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.440
this, we get this.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.270
Now, we use this information.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.650
Well, we use this information.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.240
We take the partial of this
expression, and we say, well,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.000
the partial of this expression,
with respect to y,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.805
has to equal this, and then we
can solve for h of y, then

00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:47.420
we'll be done.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.890
So let's do that.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.920
So the partial of psi, with
respect to y, is equal to--

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.980
well, that's going
to be 0, 0, 0.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.850
This part is a function of x.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.910
If you take the partial with
respect to y, it's 0, because

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.370
these are constants, from
a y point of view.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.460
So you're left with
h prime of y.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.810
So we know that h prime of y,
which is the partial of psi,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.540
with respect to y,
is equal to this.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.200
So h prime of y is equal
to 2y minus 2.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.580
And then if we wanted to figure
out what h of y is, we

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.180
get h of y-- just integrate both
sides, with respect to

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.020
y-- is equal to y squared
plus-- sorry-- y

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.720
squared minus 2y.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.340
Now, you could have a plus c
there, but if you watched the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.410
previous example, you'll see
that that c kind of merges

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.740
with the other c, so you
don't have to worry

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.750
about it right now.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.540
So what is our psi function,
as we know it now, not

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.640
worrying about the plus c?

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:56.160
It is psi of x and y is equal
to x squared plus 3x, plus h

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.810
of y-- which we figured
out is this-- plus y

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.100
squared, minus 2y.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.450
And we know a solution of our
original differential equation

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.400
is psi is equal to c.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.280
So the solution of our
differential equation is this

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.710
is equal to c.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.230
x squared plus 3x, plus
y squared, minus

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.860
2y is equal to c.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.520
If you had some additional
conditions, you could test it.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.600
And I encourage you to test
this out on this original

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.390
equation, or I encourage you to
take the derivative of psi,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.800
and prove to yourself that if
you took the derivative of

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.750
psi, with respect to x, here,
implicitly, that you would get

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.150
this differential equation.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.710
Anyway, let's do another one.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.770
Let's clear image.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.190
So the more examples you
see, the better.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:07:04.130
So let's see, this one says 2x
plus 4y, plus 2x minus 2y, y

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.420
prime is equal to 0.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.340
So what's the partial of
this with respect to y?

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.230
So M, the partial of M, with
respect to y-- this is 0-- so

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.160
it's equal to 4.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.180
What's the partial of this, with
respect to x, just this

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.970
part right here?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.460
The partial of N, with
respect to x, is 2.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.980
This is 0.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.090
So the partial of this, with
respect to y, is different

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.920
than the partial of N,
with respect to x.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.500
So this is not exact.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.360
So we can't solve this using
our exact methodology.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.070
So that was a fairly
straightforward problem.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.960
Let's do another one.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.790
Let's see.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.710
I'm running out of time, so I
want to do one that's not too

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.190
complicated.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:54.130
Let's see, 3x squared minus
2xy-- actually, let me do this

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.810
in the next problem.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.170
I don't want to rush
these things.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.430
I will continue this
in the next video.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.680
See you soon.
