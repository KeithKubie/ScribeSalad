everything we've gone through so far if
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.630
everything we've gone through so far if
not ask questions okay because if you

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
not ask questions okay because if you
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.820
not ask questions okay because if you
don't understand what we've done the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
don't understand what we've done the
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.830
don't understand what we've done the
second half of the course will be harder

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840
second half of the course will be harder
 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.180
second half of the course will be harder
putting together viruses there are a

putting together viruses there are a
certain assembly of viruses occurs in a

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
certain assembly of viruses occurs in a
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.119
certain assembly of viruses occurs in a
very ordered fashion if it didn't things

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
very ordered fashion if it didn't things
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310
very ordered fashion if it didn't things
would be a mess with viruses so most

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
would be a mess with viruses so most
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.880
would be a mess with viruses so most
viruses undergo a common set of assembly

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

you have to make the viral proteins

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
you have to make the viral proteins
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900
you have to make the viral proteins
first and you assemble them into

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
first and you assemble them into
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299
first and you assemble them into
structural units that can be one or it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
structural units that can be one or it
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520
structural units that can be one or it
can be several proteins you have to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
can be several proteins you have to
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740

assemble the shell that happens

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
assemble the shell that happens
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.130
assemble the shell that happens
spontaneously you have to put the genome

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
spontaneously you have to put the genome
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500
spontaneously you have to put the genome
in the shell talk a little bit about how

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
in the shell talk a little bit about how
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.190
in the shell talk a little bit about how
that happens for some viruses an

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
that happens for some viruses an
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.429
that happens for some viruses an
envelope is acquired but not for all

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

cell and some viruses actually mature

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960
cell and some viruses actually mature
 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.510
cell and some viruses actually mature
after they get out of the host cell

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
after they get out of the host cell
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.969
after they get out of the host cell
we'll talk of an example of that today

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979
 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.090
now the way viruses look can tell you a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
now the way viruses look can tell you a
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.030
now the way viruses look can tell you a
lot about how its formed you can you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
lot about how its formed you can you
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620
lot about how its formed you can you
should be able to look at most of these

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
should be able to look at most of these
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.330
should be able to look at most of these
viruses and tell me how its formed that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
viruses and tell me how its formed that
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.859
viruses and tell me how its formed that
would be a good question don't you think

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
would be a good question don't you think
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.630
would be a good question don't you think
I could give you a picture of a virus

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
I could give you a picture of a virus
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.319
I could give you a picture of a virus
and you say tell me how this matures so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
and you say tell me how this matures so
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330
and you say tell me how this matures so
you could look at an envelope virus and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
you could look at an envelope virus and
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.090
you could look at an envelope virus and
say it has to acquire its envelope by

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
say it has to acquire its envelope by
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010
say it has to acquire its envelope by
budding in some way and we'll talk about

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
budding in some way and we'll talk about
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.730

anything so you can learn a lot just by

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
anything so you can learn a lot just by
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.889
anything so you can learn a lot just by
looking at the structure of the virus

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
looking at the structure of the virus
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.620
looking at the structure of the virus
you can tell how its formed and even how

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
you can tell how its formed and even how
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210
you can tell how its formed and even how
it gets into a south because with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
it gets into a south because with
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830
it gets into a south because with
envelopes you know we've talked about

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
envelopes you know we've talked about
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780
envelopes you know we've talked about

can't emphasize that enough they have to
 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.560
can't emphasize that enough they have to
survive in the environment but they have

survive in the environment but they have
 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.350
survive in the environment but they have
to come apart upon infection so they are

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360
to come apart upon infection so they are
 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.050
to come apart upon infection so they are

this is a very interesting point because
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.670
this is a very interesting point because
as you will see the assembly pathways

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
as you will see the assembly pathways
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.270
as you will see the assembly pathways
that lead to viruses virion particles

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940
nucleus all right these are all but
 

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.580
nucleus all right these are all but
needs our old directionality is that are

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:16.590
needs our old directionality is that are
 

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.560
needs our old directionality is that are
established because the viral genomes

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:18.570
established because the viral genomes
 

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.260
established because the viral genomes
replicate in the nucleus how about if

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.270
replicate in the nucleus how about if
 

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.150
replicate in the nucleus how about if
you want a viral protein to be on the

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160
you want a viral protein to be on the
 

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.790
you want a viral protein to be on the
plasma membrane many viruses put them

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800
plasma membrane many viruses put them
 

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.380
plasma membrane many viruses put them
there so that they as you will see they

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.390
there so that they as you will see they
 

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.070
there so that they as you will see they
can bud form particles by budding so you

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:31.080
can bud form particles by budding so you
 

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.850
can bud form particles by budding so you
to do that you need to utilize the

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:33.860
to do that you need to utilize the
 

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.710
to do that you need to utilize the
transport pathway of the cell the

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720
transport pathway of the cell the
 

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.750
transport pathway of the cell the
proteins have to have a signal sequence

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760
proteins have to have a signal sequence
 

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.880
proteins have to have a signal sequence
that targets them to the endoplasmic

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:40.890
that targets them to the endoplasmic
 

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.100
that targets them to the endoplasmic
reticulum they are produced in the lumen

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:43.110
reticulum they are produced in the lumen
 

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.260
reticulum they are produced in the lumen
they then move to the plasma membrane

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:45.270
they then move to the plasma membrane
 

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.800
they then move to the plasma membrane
via the Golgi stacks and on the way

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:48.810
via the Golgi stacks and on the way
 

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.530
via the Golgi stacks and on the way
there glycosylated and modified in

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540
there glycosylated and modified in
 

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.470
there glycosylated and modified in
various ways and eventually they are

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480
various ways and eventually they are
 

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.000
various ways and eventually they are
delivered to the cell surface now by

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.010
delivered to the cell surface now by
 

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.880
delivered to the cell surface now by
vesicles that bud off the Golgi and are

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:01.890
vesicles that bud off the Golgi and are
 

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.760
vesicles that bud off the Golgi and are
transported on tracks just like other

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:04.770
transported on tracks just like other
 

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.710
transported on tracks just like other
movements in the cell up to the surface

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720
movements in the cell up to the surface
 

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.590
movements in the cell up to the surface
so here are some viral glycoproteins

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600
so here are some viral glycoproteins
 

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.120
so here are some viral glycoproteins
coalescing at the cell surface getting

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.130
coalescing at the cell surface getting
 

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.880
coalescing at the cell surface getting
ready to receive nucleic acids as well

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:13.890
ready to receive nucleic acids as well
 

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.130
ready to receive nucleic acids as well
see so it's another example of the

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.140
see so it's another example of the
 

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.400
see so it's another example of the
addresses that are important in

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:18.410
addresses that are important in
 

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.210
addresses that are important in
targeting proteins to the

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220
targeting proteins to the
 

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.550
targeting proteins to the
place so let's talk about a couple of

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560
place so let's talk about a couple of
 

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.520
place so let's talk about a couple of
different strategies for making viruses

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:25.530
different strategies for making viruses
 

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.240
different strategies for making viruses
and one of the key concepts is that

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.250
and one of the key concepts is that
 

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.950
and one of the key concepts is that
we're going to make sub-assemblies we're

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:30.960
we're going to make sub-assemblies we're
 

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.750
we're going to make sub-assemblies we're
not going to take 20 proteins and have

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760
not going to take 20 proteins and have
 

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.330
not going to take 20 proteins and have
them all come together at once we're

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:35.340
them all come together at once we're
 

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.800
them all come together at once we're
going to have a few proteins make one

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:36.810
going to have a few proteins make one
 

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.690
going to have a few proteins make one
sub assembly and if you make another and

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:38.700
sub assembly and if you make another and
 

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.070
sub assembly and if you make another and
then the sub assemblies will come

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:40.080
then the sub assemblies will come
 

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.480
then the sub assemblies will come
together and each step is going to be

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.490
together and each step is going to be
 

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.460
together and each step is going to be
irreversible so we're going to look at

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.470
irreversible so we're going to look at
 

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.860
irreversible so we're going to look at
three strategies here and the first one

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:45.870
three strategies here and the first one
 

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.440
three strategies here and the first one
is assembly from individual protein

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:48.450
is assembly from individual protein
 

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.110
is assembly from individual protein
molecules an example here is simian

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120
molecules an example here is simian
 

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.590
molecules an example here is simian
virus 40 of poly a polynomial virus and

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600
virus 40 of poly a polynomial virus and
 

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.660
virus 40 of poly a polynomial virus and
this is one of our double-stranded DNA

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:56.670
this is one of our double-stranded DNA
 

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.600
this is one of our double-stranded DNA
viruses relatively small Tyrion's the

00:13:59.600 --> 00:13:59.610
viruses relatively small Tyrion's the
 

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.170
viruses relatively small Tyrion's the
capsid is made up of vp1 vp2 and vp3

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180
capsid is made up of vp1 vp2 and vp3
 

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.690
capsid is made up of vp1 vp2 and vp3
these proteins are translated from

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700
these proteins are translated from
 

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.330
these proteins are translated from
individual messenger RNAs in the

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:08.340
individual messenger RNAs in the
 

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.860
individual messenger RNAs in the
cytoplasm and they fold and then

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:11.870
cytoplasm and they fold and then
 

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.820
cytoplasm and they fold and then
assemble to form the sv40 pentamer so

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:16.830
assemble to form the sv40 pentamer so
 

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.430
assemble to form the sv40 pentamer so
the pentamer has mostly vp1 a little bit

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440
the pentamer has mostly vp1 a little bit
 

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.860
the pentamer has mostly vp1 a little bit
of vp 2 and v p 3 so this is an example

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:21.870
of vp 2 and v p 3 so this is an example
 

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.320
of vp 2 and v p 3 so this is an example
of a sub assembly then these are going

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.330
of a sub assembly then these are going
 

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.650
of a sub assembly then these are going
to go on in form intact fury ons so you

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660
to go on in form intact fury ons so you
 

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.420
to go on in form intact fury ons so you
make a lot of sub assemblies and make

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.430
make a lot of sub assemblies and make
 

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.040
make a lot of sub assemblies and make
the very end the key here these are made

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.050
the very end the key here these are made
 

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.660
the very end the key here these are made
from individual protein molecules

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:32.670
from individual protein molecules
 

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.970
from individual protein molecules
another example is add no virus one of

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980
another example is add no virus one of
 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.000
another example is add no virus one of
these larger DNA viruses with different

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.010
these larger DNA viruses with different
 

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.400
these larger DNA viruses with different
proteins in the shell serving different

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:40.410
proteins in the shell serving different
 

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.770
proteins in the shell serving different
functions and remember one of those

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:42.780
functions and remember one of those
 

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.020
functions and remember one of those
proteins is the fiber that sticks out

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.030
proteins is the fiber that sticks out
 

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.620
proteins is the fiber that sticks out
from each five fold axis of symmetry so

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:48.630
from each five fold axis of symmetry so
 

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.090
from each five fold axis of symmetry so
we're looking at the Assembly of the

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100
we're looking at the Assembly of the
 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.070
we're looking at the Assembly of the
fiber and the the base that it's

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.080
fiber and the the base that it's
 

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.060
fiber and the the base that it's
attached to the pent on so the protein

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.070
attached to the pent on so the protein
 

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.030
attached to the pent on so the protein
for is produced by translation of viral

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040
for is produced by translation of viral
 

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.850
for is produced by translation of viral
mrna is this this becomes a trimer and

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860
mrna is this this becomes a trimer and
 

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.920
mrna is this this becomes a trimer and
folds to form the fiber the base is a

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:05.930
folds to form the fiber the base is a
 

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.380
folds to form the fiber the base is a
pentamer of protein 3 these are focus

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:09.390
pentamer of protein 3 these are focus
 

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.600
pentamer of protein 3 these are focus
again translated individually they fold

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:11.610
again translated individually they fold
 

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.090
again translated individually they fold
into the structure needed and then five

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100
into the structure needed and then five
 

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.090
into the structure needed and then five
of these form the pent on base so then

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100
of these form the pent on base so then
 

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.670
of these form the pent on base so then
those two come together to form the pent

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680
those two come together to form the pent
 

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.800
those two come together to form the pent
on which consists of the fiber and the

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:21.810
on which consists of the fiber and the
 

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.660
on which consists of the fiber and the
pent on base so again an example of a

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:23.670
pent on base so again an example of a
 

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.000
pent on base so again an example of a
sub-assembly these eventually we'll go

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.010
sub-assembly these eventually we'll go
 

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.760
sub-assembly these eventually we'll go
into constructing new virions and

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:28.770
into constructing new virions and
 

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.010
into constructing new virions and
they're just made simply by making

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:31.020
they're just made simply by making
 

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.380
they're just made simply by making
individual proteins

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.390
 

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.390
yeah so these proteins have all the

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.400
yeah so these proteins have all the
 

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.070
yeah so these proteins have all the
information in their structure to be

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.080
information in their structure to be
 

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.800
information in their structure to be
able to fold into the right

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:41.810
able to fold into the right
 

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.930
able to fold into the right
configuration and also to associate with

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940
configuration and also to associate with
 

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.560
configuration and also to associate with
other proteins as well some cases there

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:48.570
other proteins as well some cases there
 

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.020
other proteins as well some cases there
are there are chaperone proteins in the

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.030
are there are chaperone proteins in the
 

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.540
are there are chaperone proteins in the
cell that help the folding but most the

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:53.550
cell that help the folding but most the
 

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.340
cell that help the folding but most the
information is in the amino acid

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.350
information is in the amino acid
 

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.580
information is in the amino acid
sequence to dictate how this works yeah

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:57.590
sequence to dictate how this works yeah
 

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.070
sequence to dictate how this works yeah
and here's the third strata another

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.080
and here's the third strata another
 

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.500
and here's the third strata another
strategy from making sorry to strategies

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.510

and what we think is that the RNA

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:01.450
and what we think is that the RNA
 

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.150
and what we think is that the RNA
actually binds the pentamer and that

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.160
actually binds the pentamer and that
 

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.700
actually binds the pentamer and that
helps it in caps a day but that's a

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.730
helps it in caps a day but that's a
little bit speculative so the packaging

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:08.740
little bit speculative so the packaging
 

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.260
little bit speculative so the packaging
of the genome will talk more about

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:10.270
of the genome will talk more about
 

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.330
of the genome will talk more about
packaging a bit later isn't really

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:12.340
packaging a bit later isn't really
 

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.100
packaging a bit later isn't really

assemblies okay here's another example

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:24.970
assemblies okay here's another example
 

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.800
assemblies okay here's another example
of this assembly line concept taken to a

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:28.810
of this assembly line concept taken to a
 

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.840
of this assembly line concept taken to a
greater extreme because this is a more

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
greater extreme because this is a more
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.150
greater extreme because this is a more
complex virus this is a bacteriophage

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:33.160

these are all the proteins that go into
 

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.560
these are all the proteins that go into
making the base plate and then you make

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:19.570
making the base plate and then you make
 

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.510
making the base plate and then you make
the shaft and then you put these rings

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520
the shaft and then you put these rings
 

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.210
the shaft and then you put these rings
around it and there you go that's that's

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:24.220
around it and there you go that's that's
 

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.210

and you're adding additional proteins at

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:35.860
and you're adding additional proteins at
 

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.220

each step that's then attached to the
 

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.770
each step that's then attached to the
neck or the tail and then finally you

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:40.780
neck or the tail and then finally you
 

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.560
neck or the tail and then finally you
make the tail fibers and put those on so

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.570
make the tail fibers and put those on so
 

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.180
make the tail fibers and put those on so

also that all these are irreversible and

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:49.650
also that all these are irreversible and
 

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.070
also that all these are irreversible and
that assures that they flow forward if

that assures that they flow forward if
 

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.870
that assures that they flow forward if
you make the proper assembly if you make

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880
you make the proper assembly if you make
 

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.600
you make the proper assembly if you make
the right base plate it flows through

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:57.610

that's the assembly line concept with

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:07.780
that's the assembly line concept with
 

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.840
that's the assembly line concept with
sub assemblies that's why I say you

not how it works they're done in very
precise steps so assembly line

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.430
precise steps so assembly line
 

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.700

mechanisms make sure you make the virus

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.710
mechanisms make sure you make the virus
 

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.040
mechanisms make sure you make the virus
and the right sequence of events you

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.050
and the right sequence of events you
 

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.990
and the right sequence of events you
make discrete structures and quality

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000

look at how another kind of virus is

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.350
look at how another kind of virus is
 

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.030
look at how another kind of virus is
assembled this one in the nucleus this

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.040
assembled this one in the nucleus this
 

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.310
assembled this one in the nucleus this
is a herpes virus and as you know this

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320
is a herpes virus and as you know this
 

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.950
is a herpes virus and as you know this
is a virus with a rather large d a

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960
is a virus with a rather large d a
 

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.740
is a virus with a rather large d a
double-stranded DNA genome that genome

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:55.750
double-stranded DNA genome that genome
 

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.800
double-stranded DNA genome that genome
replicates in the nucleus so here's

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:58.810
replicates in the nucleus so here's
 

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.020
replicates in the nucleus so here's
here's the nucleus right here most of

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.030
here's the nucleus right here most of
 

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.700
here's the nucleus right here most of
the slide users are nuclear pore complex

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:02.710
the slide users are nuclear pore complex
 

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.730
the slide users are nuclear pore complex
as the cytoplasm is out here so the

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:05.740
as the cytoplasm is out here so the
 

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.380
as the cytoplasm is out here so the
genome replicates in the nucleus and

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:07.390
genome replicates in the nucleus and
 

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.270
genome replicates in the nucleus and
that's where the particles are going to

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280
that's where the particles are going to
 

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.550
that's where the particles are going to
be assembled so the particles of course

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:11.560
be assembled so the particles of course
 

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.200
be assembled so the particles of course
are made of proteins of different sorts

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.210
are made of proteins of different sorts
 

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.300
are made of proteins of different sorts
those are translated in the cytoplasm

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.310
those are translated in the cytoplasm
 

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.600
those are translated in the cytoplasm
have to be imported into the nucleus and

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:18.610
have to be imported into the nucleus and
 

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.180
have to be imported into the nucleus and
so here we're showing the import of a

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:21.190
so here we're showing the import of a
 

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.970
so here we're showing the import of a
variety of components that are important

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:23.980
variety of components that are important
 

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.760
variety of components that are important
for assembly of this herpes virus we

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:26.770
for assembly of this herpes virus we
 

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.110
for assembly of this herpes virus we
have VP 26 we have some vp5 penta MERS

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120
have VP 26 we have some vp5 penta MERS
 

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.390
have VP 26 we have some vp5 penta MERS
we have some other proteins here as well

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400
we have some other proteins here as well
 

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.830
we have some other proteins here as well
and then we have our portal if you

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840
and then we have our portal if you
 

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.680
and then we have our portal if you
remember there's one portal / virion

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:36.690
remember there's one portal / virion
 

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.310
remember there's one portal / virion
through which the DNA goes in and out

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320
through which the DNA goes in and out
 

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.990
through which the DNA goes in and out
now these are very large virions and in

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000
now these are very large virions and in
 

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.950
now these are very large virions and in
fact they're very difficult to make as

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960
fact they're very difficult to make as
 

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.530
fact they're very difficult to make as
empty capsids so what is done is that a

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:49.540
empty capsids so what is done is that a
 

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.290
empty capsids so what is done is that a
scaffold is built first and then the

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:52.300
scaffold is built first and then the
 

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.090
scaffold is built first and then the
capsid is built around you notice

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.100
capsid is built around you notice
 

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.830
capsid is built around you notice
scaffold is on a building right it's

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840
scaffold is on a building right it's
 

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.930
scaffold is on a building right it's
those metal things they put on the

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:57.940
those metal things they put on the
 

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.270
those metal things they put on the
outside so that they can then bring the

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:00.280
outside so that they can then bring the
 

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.250
outside so that they can then bring the
building up same idea except here the

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:02.260
building up same idea except here the
 

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.920
building up same idea except here the
scaffold is interior it's really clever

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:04.930
scaffold is interior it's really clever
 

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.080
scaffold is interior it's really clever
you can't just build the shallow would

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:07.090
you can't just build the shallow would
 

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.610
you can't just build the shallow would
fall apart so you build a protein

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:08.620
fall apart so you build a protein
 

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.330
fall apart so you build a protein
scaffold you build the caps it around at

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:12.340
scaffold you build the caps it around at
 

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.800
scaffold you build the caps it around at
all these capsid proteins are then

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:13.810
all these capsid proteins are then
 

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.050
all these capsid proteins are then
assembled this is an icosahedral shell

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:16.060
assembled this is an icosahedral shell
 

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.770
assembled this is an icosahedral shell
and then inside there is also a viral

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:19.780
and then inside there is also a viral
 

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.630
and then inside there is also a viral
protease which then when the whole thing

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640
protease which then when the whole thing
 

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.730
protease which then when the whole thing
is complete digests away

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:23.740
is complete digests away
 

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.520
is complete digests away
scaffold so that's what we see here VP

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:26.530
scaffold so that's what we see here VP
 

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.480
scaffold so that's what we see here VP
24 protease digests away the scaffold so

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.490
24 protease digests away the scaffold so
 

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.100
24 protease digests away the scaffold so
now it's empty here but it's stable

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.110
now it's empty here but it's stable
 

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.260
now it's empty here but it's stable
because it's all been built and then we

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:34.270
because it's all been built and then we
 

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.440
because it's all been built and then we
can pump the DNA n so the DNA goes in

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.450
can pump the DNA n so the DNA goes in
 

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.970
can pump the DNA n so the DNA goes in
through a portal and there you see the

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:38.980
through a portal and there you see the
 

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.250
through a portal and there you see the
DNA all coiled inside the capsid so

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:44.260
DNA all coiled inside the capsid so
 

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.669
DNA all coiled inside the capsid so
these scaffolding proteins established

00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679
these scaffolding proteins established
 

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:48.930
these scaffolding proteins established
transient structures they're not there

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:48.940
transient structures they're not there
 

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.210
transient structures they're not there
permanently and the viral protease

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.220
permanently and the viral protease
 

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.930
permanently and the viral protease
packaged in them become activated to get

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:54.940
packaged in them become activated to get
 

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.840
packaged in them become activated to get
rid of the scaffold at one point this of

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:57.850
rid of the scaffold at one point this of
 

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.900

you need the pant on which we talked

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:44.650
you need the pant on which we talked
 

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.470

all of these are produced in the

00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679
all of these are produced in the
 

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.919
all of these are produced in the
cytoplasm they're imported and what you

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:49.929
cytoplasm they're imported and what you
 

00:25:49.929 --> 00:25:51.660

do four add no viruses you build an

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:51.670
do four add no viruses you build an
 

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.210
do four add no viruses you build an
empty capsid and then the DNA gets

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:54.220
empty capsid and then the DNA gets
 

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.090
empty capsid and then the DNA gets
imported into it and that produces

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.100
imported into it and that produces
 

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.650

important for you to to know at all the
 

00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:04.680
important for you to to know at all the
fact here is that you make an empty

capsid without a scaffold and then you

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880
capsid without a scaffold and then you
 

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.820
capsid without a scaffold and then you
import the DNA the DNA by the way is

but I always think of it when I talk

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.190
but I always think of it when I talk
 

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:40.200
but I always think of it when I talk
about it so a lot of these assembly

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.210
about it so a lot of these assembly
 

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.060

information for assembly is built into
 

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:48.990
information for assembly is built into
the amino acid sequence but some of them

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000
the amino acid sequence but some of them
 

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.009

nucleic acid genomes are needed as
 

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.379
nucleic acid genomes are needed as
scaffolds or chaperones so we saw an

00:27:40.379 --> 00:27:40.389
scaffolds or chaperones so we saw an
 

00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:42.570

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:44.970
thing begins to butt out of course the
 

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.660
thing begins to butt out of course the
glycoproteins have already been shipped

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:47.670
glycoproteins have already been shipped
 

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.730
glycoproteins have already been shipped
up to the plasma membrane these are

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740
up to the plasma membrane these are
 

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.820
up to the plasma membrane these are
encoded by the envelope gene and they're

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:52.830
encoded by the envelope gene and they're
 

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.320
encoded by the envelope gene and they're
right here so now we're forming a

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.330
right here so now we're forming a
 

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.800
right here so now we're forming a
particle by budding this if this were

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:57.810
particle by budding this if this were
 

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.720
particle by budding this if this were
influenza virus this particle would be

00:35:59.720 --> 00:35:59.730
influenza virus this particle would be
 

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.790
influenza virus this particle would be
done but it's not this is a retrovirus

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800
done but it's not this is a retrovirus
 

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.770
done but it's not this is a retrovirus
this particles not finished there is a

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780
this particles not finished there is a
 

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.500
this particles not finished there is a
protease in here which after the budding

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.510
protease in here which after the budding
 

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.710
protease in here which after the budding
occurs acts to cleave viral proteins and

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720
occurs acts to cleave viral proteins and
 

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.810

icosahedral shell and that only
 

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.410
icosahedral shell and that only
assembles in its final form after the

assembles in its final form after the
 

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.720
assembles in its final form after the
virus has butted off so it's an example

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:23.730
virus has butted off so it's an example
 

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.690
virus has butted off so it's an example
of a virus that matures after it's

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700
of a virus that matures after it's
 

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.190
of a virus that matures after it's
released from the cell okay and that's

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200
released from the cell okay and that's
 

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.260
released from the cell okay and that's
why in one of those first slides we had

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:33.270
why in one of those first slides we had
 

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.110
why in one of those first slides we had
at the bottom of that scheme maturation

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.120
at the bottom of that scheme maturation
 

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.090
at the bottom of that scheme maturation
after the virus was released from the

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:38.100
after the virus was released from the
 

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:47.560
after the virus was released from the
cell yes

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:47.570
 

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.240
okay the difference between NC and ma

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:50.250
okay the difference between NC and ma
 

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.780
okay the difference between NC and ma
and C is nucleocapsid this binds the RNA

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:53.790
and C is nucleocapsid this binds the RNA
 

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.850

the membrane that's what brings the the
 

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:20.310
the membrane that's what brings the the
complex up to the plasma membrane okay

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320
 

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.930
alright so this is a schematic of the

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:22.940
alright so this is a schematic of the
 

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.950

membrane glycoproteins we have

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:34.630
membrane glycoproteins we have
 

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:38.230
membrane glycoproteins we have
glycosylation sites there are cleavage

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240
glycosylation sites there are cleavage
 

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.140
glycosylation sites there are cleavage
sites those big triangles or cleavage

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.150
sites those big triangles or cleavage
 

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.700
sites those big triangles or cleavage
sites because you have to have an

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:42.710
sites because you have to have an
 

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.370
sites because you have to have an
n-terminal fusion protein but remember

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:45.380
n-terminal fusion protein but remember
 

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.320
n-terminal fusion protein but remember
you want to keep it buried near the

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:47.330
you want to keep it buried near the
 

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.680
you want to keep it buried near the
viral membrane until it's ready to fuse

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:49.690
viral membrane until it's ready to fuse
 

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.390
viral membrane until it's ready to fuse
and then at the n-terminus you have a

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400
and then at the n-terminus you have a
 

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.780
and then at the n-terminus you have a
signal sequence the protein looks sort

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:55.790
signal sequence the protein looks sort
 

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.180
signal sequence the protein looks sort
of like this in the final version in the

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:58.190
of like this in the final version in the
 

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:02.170

virus the cleavage separates it into two

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.180
virus the cleavage separates it into two
 

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.320
virus the cleavage separates it into two
pieces called TM four transmembrane that

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:05.330
pieces called TM four transmembrane that
 

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.440
pieces called TM four transmembrane that
remains attached to the membrane and su

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:08.450
remains attached to the membrane and su
 

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:11.080
remains attached to the membrane and su
for surface they are held together by a

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:11.090
for surface they are held together by a
 

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.150
for surface they are held together by a
disulfide bond so they do stay together

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160
disulfide bond so they do stay together
 

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.910
disulfide bond so they do stay together
and the su portion will eventually bind

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920
and the su portion will eventually bind
 

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.520
and the su portion will eventually bind
the receptor and remember that receptor

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:18.530
the receptor and remember that receptor
 

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.320
the receptor and remember that receptor
binding will help expose the fusion

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.330
binding will help expose the fusion
 

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.450
binding will help expose the fusion
peptide which is buried so you see why

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:22.460
peptide which is buried so you see why
 

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.220
peptide which is buried so you see why
you have to cleave this otherwise the

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:24.230
you have to cleave this otherwise the
 

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.920
you have to cleave this otherwise the
n-terminal would the n-terminus sorry if

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:26.930
n-terminal would the n-terminus sorry if
 

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.240
n-terminal would the n-terminus sorry if
you didn't cleave it the fusion peptide

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:28.250
you didn't cleave it the fusion peptide
 

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:33.760
you didn't cleave it the fusion peptide

one example with influenza virus where

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:39.320
one example with influenza virus where
 

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.400
one example with influenza virus where
the c-terminus of the h.a was modified

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:42.410
the c-terminus of the h.a was modified
 

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.350
the c-terminus of the h.a was modified
by a lipid I think it's palmitate but

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.360
by a lipid I think it's palmitate but
 

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.920
by a lipid I think it's palmitate but
I'm not sure and that helps direct the

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:47.930
I'm not sure and that helps direct the
 

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.810
I'm not sure and that helps direct the
c-terminus to embed in the membrane

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:49.820
c-terminus to embed in the membrane
 

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.000
c-terminus to embed in the membrane
which is apparently important these are

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.010
which is apparently important these are
 

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.890
which is apparently important these are
just examples of some other lipids that

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:53.900
just examples of some other lipids that
 

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.860
just examples of some other lipids that
can be included you don't have to learn

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:56.870
can be included you don't have to learn
 

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.140
can be included you don't have to learn
any of these you don't have to learn the

00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.150
any of these you don't have to learn the
 

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.200
any of these you don't have to learn the
structure you don't even have to know

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.210

the individual names you just need to

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:03.620
the individual names you just need to
 

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.620
the individual names you just need to
know that some viral proteins can be

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:05.630
know that some viral proteins can be
 

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.210
know that some viral proteins can be
modified with lipids and they have

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.220
modified with lipids and they have
 

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.100
modified with lipids and they have
specific functions so here's the

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.110
specific functions so here's the
 

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.800
specific functions so here's the
modification with myristate myristate on

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:11.810
modification with myristate myristate on
 

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:15.520
modification with myristate myristate on
the first amino acid of a protein and

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:15.530
the first amino acid of a protein and
 

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.730
the first amino acid of a protein and
here is the modification with farnesyl

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:18.740
here is the modification with farnesyl
 

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:23.380
here is the modification with farnesyl
and other this allows you to target

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:23.390
and other this allows you to target
 

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:25.900
and other this allows you to target
proteins to various membranes without

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:25.910
proteins to various membranes without
 

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.670
proteins to various membranes without
having a signal sequence so remember a

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680
having a signal sequence so remember a
 

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.430
having a signal sequence so remember a
signal sequence targets a protein to the

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440
signal sequence targets a protein to the
 

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.400
signal sequence targets a protein to the
to the secretory pathway makes the

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:32.410
to the secretory pathway makes the
 

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.990
to the secretory pathway makes the
protein go into the ER and eventually

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000
protein go into the ER and eventually
 

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.090
protein go into the ER and eventually
move up the plasma membrane maybe you

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:36.100
move up the plasma membrane maybe you
 

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.500
move up the plasma membrane maybe you
don't want to go in that pathway well

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:37.510
don't want to go in that pathway well
 

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.690
don't want to go in that pathway well
you put a lipid in like one of these and

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:39.700
you put a lipid in like one of these and
 

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.710
you put a lipid in like one of these and
it can target it to other membranes so

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720
it can target it to other membranes so
 

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.540
it can target it to other membranes so
in this case you can make the protein in

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:45.550
in this case you can make the protein in
 

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.940
in this case you can make the protein in
the cytoplasm and then put the lipid on

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:47.950
the cytoplasm and then put the lipid on
 

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.470
the cytoplasm and then put the lipid on
and we'll go wherever the lipid is

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480
and we'll go wherever the lipid is
 

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.030
and we'll go wherever the lipid is
telling it to go so it doesn't have to

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040
telling it to go so it doesn't have to
 

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.400
telling it to go so it doesn't have to
enter that secretory pathway so these

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.410

membrane the reason it does so is

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.060
membrane the reason it does so is
 

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.270
membrane the reason it does so is
because it has myristic acid and its

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280
because it has myristic acid and its
 

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.010
because it has myristic acid and its
n-terminus and that allows it to go to

00:40:59.010 --> 00:40:59.020
n-terminus and that allows it to go to
 

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.590
n-terminus and that allows it to go to
the plasma membrane and if you mutate

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:01.600
the plasma membrane and if you mutate
 

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.980
the plasma membrane and if you mutate
the sequence so the myristic cannot be

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:04.990
the sequence so the myristic cannot be
 

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.980
the sequence so the myristic cannot be
attached which is easy to do you block

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:07.990
attached which is easy to do you block
 

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.740
attached which is easy to do you block
assembly and budding so this is totally

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:10.750
assembly and budding so this is totally
 

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.180
assembly and budding so this is totally
essential for assembly and budding

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:12.190
essential for assembly and budding
 

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.540
essential for assembly and budding
because it directs the matrix protein to

point here is that you have to just

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440
point here is that you have to just
 

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.000
point here is that you have to just

package cellular genomes that would be a
 

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.860
package cellular genomes that would be a
waste of an ice caps it because you

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:03.870
waste of an ice caps it because you
 

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.540
waste of an ice caps it because you
can't do anything with that cellular

can't do anything with that cellular
 

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.370
can't do anything with that cellular
genome so you have to be able to

yet every pretty much everything that's

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:38.130
yet every pretty much everything that's
 

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:41.540
yet every pretty much everything that's
packaged into particles is viral RNA so

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:41.550
packaged into particles is viral RNA so
 

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.010

not packaged or you take what you think

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:13.470
not packaged or you take what you think
 

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.890
not packaged or you take what you think
is a packaging sequence and put it on a

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:10.819
this is a retrovirus packaging sequence
 

00:48:10.819 --> 00:48:12.670
this is a retrovirus packaging sequence
let's start with the upper right here

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680
let's start with the upper right here
 

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.140
let's start with the upper right here
this is the left-hand end of to retro

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.150
this is the left-hand end of to retro
 

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.950
this is the left-hand end of to retro
viral genomes a an avian leukosis virus

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960
viral genomes a an avian leukosis virus
 

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.049
viral genomes a an avian leukosis virus
genome of bird retrovirus and a mouse

00:48:23.049 --> 00:48:23.059
genome of bird retrovirus and a mouse
 

00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:27.309
genome of bird retrovirus and a mouse
retro virus genome so here's an M here's

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319
retro virus genome so here's an M here's
 

00:48:27.319 --> 00:48:29.019
retro virus genome so here's an M here's
a full-length mRNA this could be a

00:48:29.019 --> 00:48:29.029
a full-length mRNA this could be a
 

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:32.230
a full-length mRNA this could be a
genome mRNA there's a packaging sequence

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240
genome mRNA there's a packaging sequence
 

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:37.359
genome mRNA there's a packaging sequence
right here thus I symbol that allows the

00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:37.369
right here thus I symbol that allows the
 

00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:40.990
right here thus I symbol that allows the
full-length genome to be packaged the

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000
full-length genome to be packaged the
 

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.180
full-length genome to be packaged the
other if you remember the envelope

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:43.190
other if you remember the envelope
 

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.789
other if you remember the envelope
protein cannot be translated from the

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:45.799
protein cannot be translated from the
 

00:48:45.799 --> 00:48:49.509
protein cannot be translated from the
full-length mRNA what has to happen is

00:48:49.509 --> 00:48:49.519
full-length mRNA what has to happen is
 

00:48:49.519 --> 00:48:51.940
full-length mRNA what has to happen is
that you have a splice to remove this

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:51.950
that you have a splice to remove this
 

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.890
that you have a splice to remove this
sequence in the middle so then you have

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:53.900
sequence in the middle so then you have
 

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.749
sequence in the middle so then you have
the n-terminal piece joined to the

00:48:55.749 --> 00:48:55.759
the n-terminal piece joined to the
 

00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:57.609
the n-terminal piece joined to the
envelope and that can then be translated

00:48:57.609 --> 00:48:57.619
envelope and that can then be translated
 

00:48:57.619 --> 00:49:00.700
envelope and that can then be translated
so the splicing event removes this

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:00.710
so the splicing event removes this
 

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.420
so the splicing event removes this
packaging sequence so envelope messenger

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:04.430
packaging sequence so envelope messenger
 

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.490
packaging sequence so envelope messenger
rnas are not packaged only the

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:06.500
rnas are not packaged only the
 

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.339
rnas are not packaged only the
full-length mRNA is packaged because

00:49:09.339 --> 00:49:09.349
full-length mRNA is packaged because
 

00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:13.509
full-length mRNA is packaged because
they have that size sequence ok for this

00:49:13.509 --> 00:49:13.519
they have that size sequence ok for this
 

00:49:13.519 --> 00:49:16.569
they have that size sequence ok for this
virus the size sequence is upstream of

00:49:16.569 --> 00:49:16.579
virus the size sequence is upstream of
 

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:19.930
virus the size sequence is upstream of
the splice site so that is actually

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:19.940
the splice site so that is actually
 

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.059
the splice site so that is actually
present in both full-length RNAs and

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:22.069
present in both full-length RNAs and
 

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:26.109
present in both full-length RNAs and
envelope rnase but only the full-length

00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119
envelope rnase but only the full-length
 

00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:27.759
envelope rnase but only the full-length
is packaged so there's something else

00:49:27.759 --> 00:49:27.769
is packaged so there's something else
 

00:49:27.769 --> 00:49:29.440
is packaged so there's something else
going on here that we don't understand

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:29.450
going on here that we don't understand
 

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:33.339
going on here that we don't understand
so this is necessary for packaging but

00:49:33.339 --> 00:49:33.349
so this is necessary for packaging but
 

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:35.410
so this is necessary for packaging but
apparently why the envelope is excluded

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:35.420
apparently why the envelope is excluded
 

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.990
apparently why the envelope is excluded
we don't understand so that's a very

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000
we don't understand so that's a very
 

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.809
we don't understand so that's a very
specific sigh or packaging signal that

00:49:40.809 --> 00:49:40.819
specific sigh or packaging signal that
 

00:49:40.819 --> 00:49:43.690
specific sigh or packaging signal that
directs packaging of full-length rnas

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:43.700
directs packaging of full-length rnas
 

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.359
directs packaging of full-length rnas
what does that look like here is the

00:49:46.359 --> 00:49:46.369
what does that look like here is the
 

00:49:46.369 --> 00:49:50.769
what does that look like here is the

although by itself it's not enough other

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180
although by itself it's not enough other
 

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.690
although by itself it's not enough other
sequences are needed so if you took this

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:10.700
sequences are needed so if you took this
 

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.950

not get packaged into HIV particles but

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:16.940
not get packaged into HIV particles but
 

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.380
not get packaged into HIV particles but
if you take this maloney sigh sequence

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:20.390
if you take this maloney sigh sequence
 

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:23.050
if you take this maloney sigh sequence
and put it into a different RNA that

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:23.060
and put it into a different RNA that
 

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.930
and put it into a different RNA that
will be packaged so this is necessary

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:25.940
will be packaged so this is necessary
 

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.030
will be packaged so this is necessary
and sufficient this is necessary but not

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040
and sufficient this is necessary but not
 

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.579
and sufficient this is necessary but not
sufficient so this is an extensively

sufficient so this is an extensively
 

00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:33.849
sufficient so this is an extensively
folded sequence as you can see and what

00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:33.859
folded sequence as you can see and what
 

00:50:33.859 --> 00:50:35.710
folded sequence as you can see and what
we think happens is that two of them

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720
we think happens is that two of them
 

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.680

interact to form what's called a kissing

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:38.690
interact to form what's called a kissing
 

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.870

loop complex so these are the these are

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880
loop complex so these are the these are
 

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.240
loop complex so these are the these are
the individual loop here SL one of the

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:43.250
the individual loop here SL one of the

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.130
two packaging sequences these red areas
 

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.609
two packaging sequences these red areas
are believed to base pair and that base

00:50:48.609 --> 00:50:48.619
are believed to base pair and that base
 

00:50:48.619 --> 00:50:51.940
are believed to base pair and that base
paired structure is then the substrate

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:51.950
paired structure is then the substrate
 

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.089
paired structure is then the substrate
for packaging so the individual RNAs

00:50:55.089 --> 00:50:55.099
for packaging so the individual RNAs
 

00:50:55.099 --> 00:50:56.920
for packaging so the individual RNAs
cannot be packaged only two of them

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:56.930
cannot be packaged only two of them
 

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:00.099
cannot be packaged only two of them
remember the retro viral RNA is actually

00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:00.109
remember the retro viral RNA is actually
 

00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:02.680
remember the retro viral RNA is actually
two pieces in the capsid and so this

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:02.690
two pieces in the capsid and so this
 

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.230
two pieces in the capsid and so this
brings the two genomes together and that

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240
brings the two genomes together and that
 

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.560
brings the two genomes together and that
is recognized as being package' below

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:10.570
 

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.970
here's another way to look at that

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:12.980
here's another way to look at that
 

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.120
here's another way to look at that
here's one RNA genome and this is the

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.130
here's one RNA genome and this is the
 

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.550
here's one RNA genome and this is the

you put two of them together you get

00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119
you put two of them together you get
 

00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:22.359
you put two of them together you get

binding sites for the viral nucleocapsid

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:29.210
binding sites for the viral nucleocapsid
 

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:34.359
binding sites for the viral nucleocapsid
protein and c and that allows the viral

00:51:34.359 --> 00:51:34.369
protein and c and that allows the viral
 

00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:37.270

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280
RNA to be incorporated into virions all
 

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.710
RNA to be incorporated into virions all
right so the packaging signal is

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720
right so the packaging signal is
 

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.540
right so the packaging signal is
essential for binding of NC which in

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:40.550
essential for binding of NC which in
 

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.730
essential for binding of NC which in
turn is needed for packaging but you can

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:42.740
turn is needed for packaging but you can
 

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.980
turn is needed for packaging but you can
only get this NC binding site expressed

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:44.990
only get this NC binding site expressed
 

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.130
only get this NC binding site expressed
if you have to viral rnas making this

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:48.140
if you have to viral rnas making this
 

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.070

consideration for packaging is that

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280
consideration for packaging is that
 

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.900
consideration for packaging is that
there is what's called a packaging limit

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:06.910
there is what's called a packaging limit
 

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.820
there is what's called a packaging limit
there is typically a limit on the size

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:09.830
there is typically a limit on the size
 

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.609
there is typically a limit on the size
of nucleic acid that you can put into

00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:12.619
of nucleic acid that you can put into
 

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:14.800

especially an icosahedral capsid

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:14.810
especially an icosahedral capsid
 

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.140
especially an icosahedral capsid
remember icosahedron have fixed internal

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.150
remember icosahedron have fixed internal
 

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.570
remember icosahedron have fixed internal
volumes so there is a little space in

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:19.580
volumes so there is a little space in
 

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.940
volumes so there is a little space in
the inmost capsids for putting extra

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.950
the inmost capsids for putting extra
 

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:24.640
the inmost capsids for putting extra
sequences but it's not limit unlimited

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:24.650
sequences but it's not limit unlimited
 

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.450
sequences but it's not limit unlimited
because

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:25.460
because
 

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.910
because
captions cannot expand so you typically

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920
captions cannot expand so you typically
 

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.490
captions cannot expand so you typically
have a five or ten percent extra that

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:30.500
have a five or ten percent extra that
 

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.849

you can put in so with these icosahedral

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:32.859
you can put in so with these icosahedral
 

00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:34.990
you can put in so with these icosahedral
viruses if you want to put jeans in

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000
viruses if you want to put jeans in
 

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.940
viruses if you want to put jeans in
virgina p you really need to take out

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:36.950
virgina p you really need to take out
 

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:38.349
virgina p you really need to take out
some sequence because you can't fit

00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359
some sequence because you can't fit
 

00:52:38.359 --> 00:52:42.430
some sequence because you can't fit
enough in for up for a gene so that's

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:42.440
enough in for up for a gene so that's
 

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.859
enough in for up for a gene so that's
one thing packaging lipids some viruses

00:52:44.859 --> 00:52:44.869
one thing packaging lipids some viruses
 

00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:47.290
one thing packaging lipids some viruses
like polio we have never been able to

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:47.300
like polio we have never been able to
 

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.660
like polio we have never been able to
find a packaging signal no one has ever

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:49.670
find a packaging signal no one has ever
 

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.760
find a packaging signal no one has ever
been able to do that so we don't know

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:51.770
been able to do that so we don't know
 

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.030
been able to do that so we don't know
why these viruses always have just viral

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040
why these viruses always have just viral
 

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.320
why these viruses always have just viral
RNA in them not cellular RNA one idea is

00:52:59.320 --> 00:52:59.330
RNA in them not cellular RNA one idea is
 

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.690
RNA in them not cellular RNA one idea is
that the packaging occurs on these

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:01.700
that the packaging occurs on these
 

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.940
that the packaging occurs on these
membrane vesicles which is where RNA

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:03.950
membrane vesicles which is where RNA
 

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.220
membrane vesicles which is where RNA
replication occurs if you remember from

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:06.230
replication occurs if you remember from
 

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.890
replication occurs if you remember from
our talking about RNA synthesis the

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:08.900
our talking about RNA synthesis the
 

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.870
our talking about RNA synthesis the
viral RNA polymerase is on a vesicle and

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880
viral RNA polymerase is on a vesicle and
 

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.150
viral RNA polymerase is on a vesicle and
it's very concentrated there and it

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160
it's very concentrated there and it
 

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.920
it's very concentrated there and it
could be that that is where packaging

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:14.930
could be that that is where packaging
 

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.770
could be that that is where packaging
occurs because there's no other RNA

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:16.780
occurs because there's no other RNA
 

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.359
occurs because there's no other RNA
present on that vesicle so that may be

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:19.369
present on that vesicle so that may be
 

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:21.700
present on that vesicle so that may be
where the specificity comes from from

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:21.710
where the specificity comes from from
 

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:23.380
where the specificity comes from from
being on a vesicle so there are a number

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:23.390
being on a vesicle so there are a number
 

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.510
being on a vesicle so there are a number
of viruses for which we don't have such

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520
of viruses for which we don't have such
 

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.020
of viruses for which we don't have such
signals and that may explain the

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:28.030
signals and that may explain the
 

00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:31.720
signals and that may explain the
packaging how about segmented RNA

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:31.730
packaging how about segmented RNA
 

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:33.370
packaging how about segmented RNA
genomes this is a special problem

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:33.380
genomes this is a special problem
 

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.140
genomes this is a special problem
because if you have a virus with eight

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:35.150
because if you have a virus with eight
 

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:37.690
because if you have a virus with eight
or ten or twelve pieces how do you make

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:37.700
or ten or twelve pieces how do you make
 

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:41.230
or ten or twelve pieces how do you make
sure that the virions get one of each

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240
sure that the virions get one of each
 

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.839
sure that the virions get one of each
and not to of one and three of another

00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:43.849
and not to of one and three of another
 

00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:46.690
and not to of one and three of another
it wouldn't be infectious okay one copy

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:46.700
it wouldn't be infectious okay one copy
 

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.609
it wouldn't be infectious okay one copy
of each segment it's an interesting

00:53:48.609 --> 00:53:48.619
of each segment it's an interesting
 

00:53:48.619 --> 00:53:50.980
of each segment it's an interesting
problem so there are two mechanisms that

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:50.990
problem so there are two mechanisms that
 

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:53.140
problem so there are two mechanisms that
have been proposed as a random mechanism

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:53.150
have been proposed as a random mechanism
 

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.200
have been proposed as a random mechanism
and a selective mechanism so random

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:56.210
and a selective mechanism so random
 

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.420
and a selective mechanism so random
means that the virus just grabs eight

00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:58.430
means that the virus just grabs eight
 

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:00.430
means that the virus just grabs eight
segments at one time it doesn't matter

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440
segments at one time it doesn't matter
 

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.829
segments at one time it doesn't matter
and eventually you'll get one virus in

00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839
and eventually you'll get one virus in
 

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:06.250
and eventually you'll get one virus in
so many that's infectious right and and

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:06.260
so many that's infectious right and and
 

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.230
so many that's infectious right and and
selective means there's a binding site

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240
selective means there's a binding site
 

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.680
selective means there's a binding site
on the segment for specific genome

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:11.690
on the segment for specific genome
 

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:15.099
on the segment for specific genome
segments so if you did a random

00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:15.109
segments so if you did a random
 

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:17.320
segments so if you did a random
mechanism with influenza virus which has

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:17.330
mechanism with influenza virus which has
 

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:19.870
mechanism with influenza virus which has
eight segments you would get one

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880
eight segments you would get one
 

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.180
eight segments you would get one
infectious particle out of every four

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:22.190
infectious particle out of every four
 

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.790
infectious particle out of every four
hundred assembled so basically 399 would

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800
hundred assembled so basically 399 would
 

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.710
hundred assembled so basically 399 would
be garbage because they would have they

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720
be garbage because they would have they
 

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.079
be garbage because they would have they
would be missing a segment or two or

00:54:29.079 --> 00:54:29.089
would be missing a segment or two or
 

00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:31.359
would be missing a segment or two or
more and one would be infectious and

00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:31.369
more and one would be infectious and
 

00:54:31.369 --> 00:54:33.579
more and one would be infectious and
that is actually close to the known

00:54:33.579 --> 00:54:33.589
that is actually close to the known
 

00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:36.280
that is actually close to the known
particle the pfu ratio of the virus

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:36.290
particle the pfu ratio of the virus
 

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:38.680
particle the pfu ratio of the virus
remember particle the pfu ratio you look

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:38.690
remember particle the pfu ratio you look
 

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:39.370
remember particle the pfu ratio you look
at all the part

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:39.380
at all the part
 

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.720
at all the part
because of a virus and you asked which

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:40.730
because of a virus and you asked which
 

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:42.640
because of a virus and you asked which
ones are infectious for fluids about one

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:42.650
ones are infectious for fluids about one
 

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:45.009
ones are infectious for fluids about one
and four hundred so it could be that

00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:45.019
and four hundred so it could be that
 

00:54:45.019 --> 00:54:47.559
and four hundred so it could be that
there's a random mechanism going on here

00:54:47.559 --> 00:54:47.569
there's a random mechanism going on here
 

00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:53.349
there's a random mechanism going on here
but if 12 segments are packaged ten

00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359
but if 12 segments are packaged ten
 

00:54:53.359 --> 00:54:54.999
but if 12 segments are packaged ten
percent of the particles would contain a

00:54:54.999 --> 00:54:55.009
percent of the particles would contain a
 

00:54:55.009 --> 00:54:56.529
percent of the particles would contain a
complete genome so you could put a lot

00:54:56.529 --> 00:54:56.539
complete genome so you could put a lot
 

00:54:56.539 --> 00:54:59.109
complete genome so you could put a lot
of pack segments in and you could get

00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119
of pack segments in and you could get
 

00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:01.990
of pack segments in and you could get
even more infectivity than one in four

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000
even more infectivity than one in four
 

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.579
even more infectivity than one in four
hundred we don't know if this actually

00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:03.589
hundred we don't know if this actually
 

00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:05.740
hundred we don't know if this actually
occurs or not more recently there

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:05.750
occurs or not more recently there
 

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.329
occurs or not more recently there
there's some evidence that there are

00:55:07.329 --> 00:55:07.339
there's some evidence that there are
 

00:55:07.339 --> 00:55:10.390
there's some evidence that there are
specific sequences on each RNA segment

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400
specific sequences on each RNA segment
 

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.480
specific sequences on each RNA segment
that says put this one into the capsid

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:13.490
that says put this one into the capsid
 

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.789
that says put this one into the capsid
put RNA one two three and four and not

00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799
put RNA one two three and four and not
 

00:55:15.799 --> 00:55:18.190
put RNA one two three and four and not
ten of RNA one or eight of RNA one

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200
ten of RNA one or eight of RNA one
 

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.230
ten of RNA one or eight of RNA one
specific sequences so if you if you take

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240
specific sequences so if you if you take
 

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.329
specific sequences so if you if you take
a cross-section of virions that are

00:55:25.329 --> 00:55:25.339
a cross-section of virions that are
 

00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:27.759
a cross-section of virions that are
maturing from cells this is what you see

00:55:27.759 --> 00:55:27.769
maturing from cells this is what you see
 

00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:32.200
maturing from cells this is what you see
and the point here is that you can see

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:32.210
and the point here is that you can see
 

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:35.499
and the point here is that you can see
the viral rnas are very in a very

00:55:35.499 --> 00:55:35.509
the viral rnas are very in a very
 

00:55:35.509 --> 00:55:38.289
the viral rnas are very in a very
regular pattern here so they're all they

00:55:38.289 --> 00:55:38.299
regular pattern here so they're all they
 

00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:40.900
regular pattern here so they're all they
all look like they're standing up top to

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:40.910
all look like they're standing up top to
 

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.079
all look like they're standing up top to
bottom as shown in this model right here

00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:43.089
bottom as shown in this model right here
 

00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:46.569
bottom as shown in this model right here
okay so you see the one two three four

00:55:46.569 --> 00:55:46.579
okay so you see the one two three four
 

00:55:46.579 --> 00:55:49.359
okay so you see the one two three four
five six eventually there are eight rnas

00:55:49.359 --> 00:55:49.369
five six eventually there are eight rnas
 

00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:50.620
five six eventually there are eight rnas
you can't see them all in this section

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:50.630
you can't see them all in this section
 

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.410
you can't see them all in this section
but they seem to be very ordered in the

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:53.420
but they seem to be very ordered in the
 

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.990
but they seem to be very ordered in the
particle so the model has arisen is that

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000
particle so the model has arisen is that
 

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.299
particle so the model has arisen is that
at the ends of each RNA there are

00:55:58.299 --> 00:55:58.309
at the ends of each RNA there are
 

00:55:58.309 --> 00:56:00.430
at the ends of each RNA there are
specific sequences that and interact

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440
specific sequences that and interact
 

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.220
specific sequences that and interact
with the viral proteins as this particle

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:03.230
with the viral proteins as this particle
 

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.499
with the viral proteins as this particle
is budding and they put each RNA in a

00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:05.509
is budding and they put each RNA in a
 

00:56:05.509 --> 00:56:07.539
is budding and they put each RNA in a
very specific place in the capsid and

00:56:07.539 --> 00:56:07.549
very specific place in the capsid and
 

00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:10.180
very specific place in the capsid and
each RNA has a signal that directs it to

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:10.190
each RNA has a signal that directs it to
 

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:11.499
each RNA has a signal that directs it to
the particle you can't have more than

00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:11.509
the particle you can't have more than
 

00:56:11.509 --> 00:56:14.049
the particle you can't have more than
one of each segment in the particle as a

00:56:14.049 --> 00:56:14.059
one of each segment in the particle as a
 

00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:16.630
one of each segment in the particle as a

don't start the process so this you

00:57:04.809 --> 00:57:04.819
don't start the process so this you
 

00:57:04.819 --> 00:57:06.400
don't start the process so this you
would predict from this that every

infectious particles and it seems to be

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:15.410
infectious particles and it seems to be
 

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.890

happens after internal structures are
 

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.049
happens after internal structures are
assembled as with influenza virus and

00:57:35.049 --> 00:57:35.059
assembled as with influenza virus and
 

00:57:35.059 --> 00:57:41.200

we'll talk about that or it may happen

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.210
we'll talk about that or it may happen
 

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:52.510

membrane here we have a situation where

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:00.740
membrane here we have a situation where
 

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.829

the envelope glycoproteins and the

00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839
the envelope glycoproteins and the
 

00:58:02.839 --> 00:58:05.890
the envelope glycoproteins and the
capsid are both essential for budding so

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:05.900
capsid are both essential for budding so
 

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.390
capsid are both essential for budding so
you have to express both the capsid

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400
you have to express both the capsid
 

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.400
you have to express both the capsid
which is shown in yellow here and the

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:09.410
which is shown in yellow here and the
 

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.130
which is shown in yellow here and the
glycoproteins then you get a particle so

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:12.140
glycoproteins then you get a particle so
 

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.200
glycoproteins then you get a particle so
that's one here we have an example where

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:14.210
that's one here we have an example where
 

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:17.079
that's one here we have an example where
the internal proteins drive budding so

00:58:17.079 --> 00:58:17.089
the internal proteins drive budding so
 

00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:19.750

their own Drive budding you don't need

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:23.030
their own Drive budding you don't need
 

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.020

to have any glycoproteins present here

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.030
to have any glycoproteins present here
 

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.329
to have any glycoproteins present here
we have envelope proteins driving

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:28.339
we have envelope proteins driving
 

00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:30.400

scenario where the matrix protein will
 

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:40.690
scenario where the matrix protein will
drive budding but you need additional

00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:40.700
drive budding but you need additional
 

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.480
drive budding but you need additional
proteins such as the glycoproteins in

you could drive this budding just by the

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:14.950
you could drive this budding just by the
 

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.579
you could drive this budding just by the
synthesis of H a in cells but in fact in

00:59:37.059 --> 00:59:37.069
retroviruses is targeted to the plasma
 

00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:39.819
retroviruses is targeted to the plasma
membrane by hydrophobic regions so

00:59:39.819 --> 00:59:39.829
membrane by hydrophobic regions so
 

00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:41.710
membrane by hydrophobic regions so
there's an n-terminal hydrophobic region

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720
there's an n-terminal hydrophobic region
 

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.960
there's an n-terminal hydrophobic region
on the m1 protein there are also regions

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:43.970
on the m1 protein there are also regions
 

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.719
on the m1 protein there are also regions
that bind the RNA so remember here's the

00:59:46.719 --> 00:59:46.729
that bind the RNA so remember here's the
 

00:59:46.729 --> 00:59:49.779
that bind the RNA so remember here's the
m1 protein bound to the RNA and then the

00:59:49.779 --> 00:59:49.789
m1 protein bound to the RNA and then the
 

00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:51.430
m1 protein bound to the RNA and then the
m1 is going to target the plasma

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440
m1 is going to target the plasma
 

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:53.410
m1 is going to target the plasma
membrane so what brings it there are

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:53.420
membrane so what brings it there are
 

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.259
membrane so what brings it there are
these hydrophobic sequences on the

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:56.269
these hydrophobic sequences on the
 

00:59:56.269 --> 00:59:57.880
these hydrophobic sequences on the
n-terminus and of course the RNA is

00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:57.890
n-terminus and of course the RNA is
 

00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.339
n-terminus and of course the RNA is
bound here same goes for vesicular

01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:00.349
bound here same goes for vesicular
 

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:03.009

stomatitis virus m protein which is also

01:00:03.009 --> 01:00:03.019
stomatitis virus m protein which is also
 

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:05.890
stomatitis virus m protein which is also
a sub membrane protein you have n

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:05.900
a sub membrane protein you have n
 

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.979
a sub membrane protein you have n
terminal hydrophobic regions sorry we

01:00:08.979 --> 01:00:08.989
terminal hydrophobic regions sorry we
 

01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:10.749
terminal hydrophobic regions sorry we
have n-terminal charged reasons that

01:00:10.749 --> 01:00:10.759
have n-terminal charged reasons that
 

01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:13.359
have n-terminal charged reasons that
bind to the RNA and in a more internal

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:13.369
bind to the RNA and in a more internal
 

01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:15.099
bind to the RNA and in a more internal
hydrophobic region for membrane binding

01:00:15.099 --> 01:00:15.109
hydrophobic region for membrane binding
 

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:17.709
hydrophobic region for membrane binding
so another way of explaining how we

01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:17.719
so another way of explaining how we
 

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:19.809
so another way of explaining how we
target these sub assemblies to the

01:00:19.809 --> 01:00:19.819
target these sub assemblies to the
 

01:00:19.819 --> 01:00:22.749
target these sub assemblies to the
budding complex so that's why we don't

01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:22.759
budding complex so that's why we don't
 

01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:25.749
budding complex so that's why we don't
get just empty particles made you would

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:25.759
get just empty particles made you would
 

01:00:25.759 --> 01:00:27.400
get just empty particles made you would
think while you're making a che why

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:27.410
think while you're making a che why
 

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:29.109
think while you're making a che why
don't we just butt off empty particles

01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119
don't we just butt off empty particles
 

01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:31.900
don't we just butt off empty particles
because this association of the rnp is

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:31.910
because this association of the rnp is
 

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.719
because this association of the rnp is
very efficient and the same goes for

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:36.729
very efficient and the same goes for
 

01:00:36.729 --> 01:00:39.279
very efficient and the same goes for
retroviruses we discussed this already

01:00:39.279 --> 01:00:39.289
retroviruses we discussed this already
 

01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:41.170
retroviruses we discussed this already
but I want to make the point is that if

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:41.180
but I want to make the point is that if
 

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.019
but I want to make the point is that if
you just synthesize the gag protein

01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:44.029
you just synthesize the gag protein
 

01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:47.859
you just synthesize the gag protein
alone this is sufficient to make virus

01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:47.869
alone this is sufficient to make virus
 

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:50.950
alone this is sufficient to make virus
particles but when you do have RNA

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960
particles but when you do have RNA
 

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.410
particles but when you do have RNA
present the RNA efficiently associates

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:53.420
present the RNA efficiently associates
 

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.349
present the RNA efficiently associates
with the gag protein via that NC protein

01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359
with the gag protein via that NC protein
 

01:00:56.359 --> 01:00:58.660
with the gag protein via that NC protein
and so that the virus particles that are

01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:58.670
and so that the virus particles that are
 

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.420
and so that the virus particles that are
made contain the genome if you just make

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:01.430
made contain the genome if you just make
 

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.880
made contain the genome if you just make
gag by itself you will get particles but

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:03.890
gag by itself you will get particles but
 

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.319
gag by itself you will get particles but
when RNA is present those are

01:01:05.319 --> 01:01:05.329
when RNA is present those are
 

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.059
when RNA is present those are
selectively incorporated to the

selectively incorporated to the
 

01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:11.200
selectively incorporated to the
particles now a very interesting

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:11.210

understanding of the budding process

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:13.279
understanding of the budding process
 

01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:17.289
understanding of the budding process
came about five or six years ago when I

01:01:17.289 --> 01:01:17.299
came about five or six years ago when I
 

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.299
came about five or six years ago when I
mean certain amino acid changes in the

structural precursor were shown to cause

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:22.730
structural precursor were shown to cause
 

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.420
structural precursor were shown to cause
a budding arrest at a late stage so

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.430
a budding arrest at a late stage so
 

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:28.750
a budding arrest at a late stage so
these are examples of mutations that the

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:28.760
these are examples of mutations that the
 

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.490
these are examples of mutations that the
virus would start to bud and then it

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:30.500
virus would start to bud and then it
 

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.290
virus would start to bud and then it
would arrest at this stage so here's an

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:32.300
would arrest at this stage so here's an
 

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.720
would arrest at this stage so here's an
example of that over here and here so

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:34.730
example of that over here and here so
 

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.310
example of that over here and here so
the virions are on the surface they're

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:36.320
the virions are on the surface they're
 

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.080
the virions are on the surface they're
almost fully matured but they're stuck

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.090
almost fully matured but they're stuck
 

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.780
almost fully matured but they're stuck
by this stalk and they never come off

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:40.790
by this stalk and they never come off
 

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:43.180
by this stalk and they never come off
and this is because they have amino acid

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:43.190
and this is because they have amino acid
 

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:47.020
and this is because they have amino acid
changes in the gag protein and these

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:47.030
changes in the gag protein and these
 

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:49.210
changes in the gag protein and these
regions that accommodated these changes

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:49.220
regions that accommodated these changes
 

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.800
regions that accommodated these changes
were called late domains because they

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:50.810
were called late domains because they
 

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:54.359
were called late domains because they
had a late effect in virus maturation

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:54.369
had a late effect in virus maturation
 

01:01:54.369 --> 01:01:57.070
had a late effect in virus maturation
these have subsequently been found in

these have subsequently been found in
 

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.859
these have subsequently been found in
many plus and minus strand RNA viruses

01:01:59.859 --> 01:01:59.869
many plus and minus strand RNA viruses
 

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:03.130
many plus and minus strand RNA viruses

these l domains so again these are

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480
these l domains so again these are
 

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.220
these l domains so again these are

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:48.230
domains in viral proteins if you change
 

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:52.330

them you block the budding of viruses so

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:52.340
them you block the budding of viruses so
 

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.220
them you block the budding of viruses so
for example retroviruses these are all

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:54.230
for example retroviruses these are all
 

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.230
for example retroviruses these are all
different retroviruses here that infect

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240
different retroviruses here that infect
 

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.960
different retroviruses here that infect
different species they have L domains of

01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:58.970

their viral protein so to rabies viruses

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:13.970
their viral protein so to rabies viruses
 

01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:17.020
their viral protein so to rabies viruses
and arena viruses and they're different

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:17.030

pralines etc so there are three

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:25.490
pralines etc so there are three
 

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.460

different kinds of L domains so again if

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:27.470
different kinds of L domains so again if
 

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.440
different kinds of L domains so again if

cell proteins that are involved in
 

01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:43.390
cell proteins that are involved in
vesicle trafficking so the trafficking

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400
vesicle trafficking so the trafficking
 

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.200
vesicle trafficking so the trafficking
of vesicles in cells has been dissected

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.210
of vesicles in cells has been dissected
 

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.730

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:54.080
the protein complexes that are important
 

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.400
the protein complexes that are important
for vesicle budding out of cells and for

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:57.410
for vesicle budding out of cells and for
 

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:58.840

vesicle budding so the virus in order to
 

01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:20.380
vesicle budding so the virus in order to
bud has latched on to these proteins and

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:20.390
bud has latched on to these proteins and
 

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:24.820
bud has latched on to these proteins and
this helps pull them out of the cell so

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:24.830
this helps pull them out of the cell so
 

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:28.270
this helps pull them out of the cell so
in in normal cells uninfected cells this

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:28.280
in in normal cells uninfected cells this
 

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.130
in in normal cells uninfected cells this
is called the escort machinery by the

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:30.140
is called the escort machinery by the
 

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.010
is called the escort machinery by the
way that cell protein machineries here

that helped direct vesicle traffic in
 

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:39.310
that helped direct vesicle traffic in
and out of the cell there are three

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120
mature virus is the this is the nucleic
 

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.910
mature virus is the this is the nucleic
acid here and as two tails on either

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920
acid here and as two tails on either
 

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.090
acid here and as two tails on either
side if you do an infection of this our

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100
side if you do an infection of this our
 

01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.290
side if you do an infection of this our
key a in the lab at 90 degrees the virus

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300
key a in the lab at 90 degrees the virus
 

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.150
key a in the lab at 90 degrees the virus
that's produced from the cell looks like

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:02.160
that's produced from the cell looks like
 

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.510
that's produced from the cell looks like
this ok it's not mature so these are

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520
this ok it's not mature so these are
 

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.870
this ok it's not mature so these are
released from the arc EA in this form if

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880
released from the arc EA in this form if
 

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.930
released from the arc EA in this form if
you let the particle sit in the medium

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940
you let the particle sit in the medium
 

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.320
you let the particle sit in the medium
at 90 degrees for an hour or so they

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:15.330
at 90 degrees for an hour or so they
 

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.540
at 90 degrees for an hour or so they
begin to mature into the final particle

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:17.550
begin to mature into the final particle
 

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.940
begin to mature into the final particle
so this is all happening extracellular

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:19.950
so this is all happening extracellular
 

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.580
so this is all happening extracellular
Lee it goes from this lemon shaped

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:22.590
Lee it goes from this lemon shaped
 

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:24.940
Lee it goes from this lemon shaped
particle to this one with the two tails

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:24.950
particle to this one with the two tails
 

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:27.440
particle to this one with the two tails
so everything is in there to complete

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:27.450
so everything is in there to complete
 

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.940
so everything is in there to complete
this maturation there's no more cell

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:28.950
this maturation there's no more cell
 

01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:30.830
this maturation there's no more cell
this is happening extracellular Lee so

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840
this is happening extracellular Lee so
 

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.860
this is happening extracellular Lee so
this is a brand new discovery how

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:33.870
this is a brand new discovery how
 

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.720
this is a brand new discovery how
widespread it is we don't know but it's

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:35.730
widespread it is we don't know but it's
 

01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:37.010
widespread it is we don't know but it's
very interesting because this all

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020
very interesting because this all
 

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:47.009
very interesting because this all
happens outside of the cell

01:13:47.009 --> 01:13:47.019
 

01:13:47.019 --> 01:13:49.079
you
