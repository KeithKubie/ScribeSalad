resolution games we're based in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
resolution games we're based in
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590
resolution games we're based in
Stockholm Sweden and when we develop

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
Stockholm Sweden and when we develop
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.890
Stockholm Sweden and when we develop
games in virtual reality now we would

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
games in virtual reality now we would
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.730
games in virtual reality now we would
like to start in reality and then try to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
like to start in reality and then try to
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.090
like to start in reality and then try to
bring the things that are interesting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
bring the things that are interesting
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.120
bring the things that are interesting
into fantastic an example of that is one

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
into fantastic an example of that is one
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.440
into fantastic an example of that is one
of our games we had the fortunate to be

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
of our games we had the fortunate to be
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819
of our games we had the fortunate to be
one of the launching titles for a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
one of the launching titles for a
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.969
one of the launching titles for a
daydream and it's called Wanda glade and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979
daydream and it's called Wanda glade and
 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.670
daydream and it's called Wanda glade and
it's basically doing something familiar

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
it's basically doing something familiar
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.230
it's basically doing something familiar
in an unfamiliar context so the example

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
in an unfamiliar context so the example
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
in an unfamiliar context so the example
from Wanda grade that is that throwing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
from Wanda grade that is that throwing
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.880

basketball is very familiar and you
can't trick the brain you get it you got

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
can't trick the brain you get it you got
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620
can't trick the brain you get it you got
to make it feel like you're throwing

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
to make it feel like you're throwing
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749

so sometimes when a new kind of

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250
so sometimes when a new kind of
 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.500
so sometimes when a new kind of
technology comes along it's really

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
technology comes along it's really
 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.090
technology comes along it's really
tempting to kind of get caught up in

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100
tempting to kind of get caught up in
 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.010
tempting to kind of get caught up in
what that technology can do for you and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020
what that technology can do for you and
 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.390
what that technology can do for you and
maybe to forget some of the things that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
maybe to forget some of the things that
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.610
maybe to forget some of the things that
make your brand what it is and you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620
make your brand what it is and you
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.110

might be as practical as the kind of
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.300
might be as practical as the kind of
like the logos that you use or the color

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
like the logos that you use or the color
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010
like the logos that you use or the color
schemes that you use and so on but

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020
schemes that you use and so on but
 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.360
schemes that you use and so on but
beyond that there should be there should

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370
beyond that there should be there should
 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.800
beyond that there should be there should
be other things in terms of kind of like

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810

taking your brand into a new media like
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.170
taking your brand into a new media like
VR you need to be rigorously applying

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
VR you need to be rigorously applying
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.810
VR you need to be rigorously applying
those kind of you know those sort of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820
those kind of you know those sort of
 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.760
those kind of you know those sort of
checks and processes when you sort of

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770

and to give you an example we're doing a
 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.840
and to give you an example we're doing a
lot of work at the moment with BBC Earth

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850
lot of work at the moment with BBC Earth
 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.730

some of you might be familiar with this
 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.330
some of you might be familiar with this
one of the last things that we did was

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
one of the last things that we did was
 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.700
one of the last things that we did was
called planet Earth - there's a scene in

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710
called planet Earth - there's a scene in
 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.950
called planet Earth - there's a scene in
that where there's iguanas versus snakes

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960
that where there's iguanas versus snakes
 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.200
that where there's iguanas versus snakes
we call these kind of iconic scenes and

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210
we call these kind of iconic scenes and
 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.610
we call these kind of iconic scenes and
these are something that we tend to have

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620
these are something that we tend to have
 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.400
these are something that we tend to have
always when we put out our own kind of

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410
always when we put out our own kind of
 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.290
always when we put out our own kind of
what we called landmarks or easy-chair

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300
what we called landmarks or easy-chair
 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.720
what we called landmarks or easy-chair
but really this is just underpinning the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730
but really this is just underpinning the
 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.760
but really this is just underpinning the
kind of brand values that make up what

scientific rigor we make sure that
everything we do in whatever medium is

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
everything we do in whatever medium is
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.300
everything we do in whatever medium is
rigorous in terms of its application of

kind of the kind of the science that we
 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.660
kind of the kind of the science that we
apply probably the kind of the the the

biggest and most important thing is also

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620
biggest and most important thing is also
 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.530
biggest and most important thing is also
storytelling that's something that in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540
storytelling that's something that in
 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.060
storytelling that's something that in
everything that we do and if you think

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070
everything that we do and if you think
 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.710
everything that we do and if you think
about it that kind of iguanas versus

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720
about it that kind of iguanas versus
 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.590
about it that kind of iguanas versus
kind of snakes example is a good example

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600
kind of snakes example is a good example
 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.180
kind of snakes example is a good example
of storytelling right and that's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190
of storytelling right and that's
 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.440
of storytelling right and that's
something that we want to carry through

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450
something that we want to carry through
 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.820
something that we want to carry through
into all of the kind of like the media

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830
into all of the kind of like the media
 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.960
into all of the kind of like the media
that we do and all the content that we

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970
that we do and all the content that we
 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.010
that we do and all the content that we
produce so that's something that we're

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
produce so that's something that we're
 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.510
produce so that's something that we're
thinking about when we're creating VR

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520
thinking about when we're creating VR
 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.910
thinking about when we're creating VR
experiences and finally and this is easy

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920
experiences and finally and this is easy
 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.449
experiences and finally and this is easy
with VR

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459
with VR
 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.250
with VR
we're thinking about innovation so that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
we're thinking about innovation so that
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.690
we're thinking about innovation so that
doesn't necessarily come to mind when

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700
doesn't necessarily come to mind when
 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.070
doesn't necessarily come to mind when
you're thinking about BBC Natural

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080
you're thinking about BBC Natural
 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.710
you're thinking about BBC Natural
History content but actually every time

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
History content but actually every time
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120
History content but actually every time
a new series comes out we're using new

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130
a new series comes out we're using new
 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.500
a new series comes out we're using new
technology we're either using new

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
technology we're either using new
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.390
technology we're either using new
cameras we're using drones to take

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400
cameras we're using drones to take
 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.550
cameras we're using drones to take
pictures we're using new submersible

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560
pictures we're using new submersible
 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.350
pictures we're using new submersible
techniques and again we want to carry

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
techniques and again we want to carry
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.409
techniques and again we want to carry
through that kind of brand value into VR

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419
through that kind of brand value into VR
 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.460
through that kind of brand value into VR
so the type

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
so the type
 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.650
so the type
things the types of kind of content that

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660
things the types of kind of content that
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.760
things the types of kind of content that
we're delivering the way in which people

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770
we're delivering the way in which people
 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.220
we're delivering the way in which people
interact and so on we want to innovate

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230
interact and so on we want to innovate
 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:44.320
interact and so on we want to innovate

trigger for VR data was really that it's

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410
trigger for VR data was really that it's
 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.050
trigger for VR data was really that it's
in something at the medium which

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060
in something at the medium which
 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.180
in something at the medium which
attracts interest of all generations I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190
attracts interest of all generations I
 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.490
attracts interest of all generations I
mean from kids to grandparents everybody

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500
mean from kids to grandparents everybody
 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.760
mean from kids to grandparents everybody
is attracted by by VR and is fascinated

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770
is attracted by by VR and is fascinated
 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.510
is attracted by by VR and is fascinated
by that but to get and to keep this

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520
by that but to get and to keep this
 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.660
by that but to get and to keep this
there's interest for VR productions we

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670
there's interest for VR productions we
 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.270
there's interest for VR productions we
started now in 2014 I think with the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280
started now in 2014 I think with the
 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.210
started now in 2014 I think with the
first one it's really a key question is

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220
first one it's really a key question is
 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.920
first one it's really a key question is
really the interface and the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
really the interface and the
 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.730
really the interface and the
accessibility so interacting in VR

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740
accessibility so interacting in VR
 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.560
accessibility so interacting in VR
should be close to human behavior as

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570
should be close to human behavior as
 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.510
should be close to human behavior as
easy as breathing or drinking water it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
easy as breathing or drinking water it
 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.590
easy as breathing or drinking water it
should be really easy to seamlessly get

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600
should be really easy to seamlessly get
 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.470
should be really easy to seamlessly get
into into VR and and also the same for

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480
into into VR and and also the same for
 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.690
into into VR and and also the same for
for augmented reality for some projects

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700
for augmented reality for some projects
 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.090
for augmented reality for some projects
we're working on I would like to show

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100
we're working on I would like to show
 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.600
we're working on I would like to show
you two examples how we distinguish the

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610
you two examples how we distinguish the
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.330
you two examples how we distinguish the
things a bit I mean one is that we do a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340
things a bit I mean one is that we do a
 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.760
things a bit I mean one is that we do a
lot of more linear productions based on

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770
lot of more linear productions based on
 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.100
lot of more linear productions based on

seriously we have series we just

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440
seriously we have series we just
 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.590
seriously we have series we just
published so we take people to

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600
published so we take people to
 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.540
published so we take people to
exceptional places and to give access to

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550
exceptional places and to give access to
 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.030
exceptional places and to give access to
exceptional places in this example you

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040
exceptional places in this example you
 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.820
exceptional places in this example you
can really dive with free divers more

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830
can really dive with free divers more
 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.340

down in the ocean you can swim with

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120
down in the ocean you can swim with
 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.909
down in the ocean you can swim with
dolphins and stuff like that and sperm

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919
dolphins and stuff like that and sperm
 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.860

wells so something exceptional you

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870
wells so something exceptional you
 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.830
wells so something exceptional you
cannot live like that out of the box and

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840
cannot live like that out of the box and
 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.170
cannot live like that out of the box and
the second one is more interactive

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180
the second one is more interactive
 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.600
the second one is more interactive
experiences but also with the same goal

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610
experiences but also with the same goal

it's not an easy kind of medium to
 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.050
it's not an easy kind of medium to
develop for at first there's quite a

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.060
develop for at first there's quite a
 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.200
develop for at first there's quite a
steep learning curve our first foray

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210
steep learning curve our first foray
 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.629
steep learning curve our first foray
into it we sort of thought wow this will

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639
into it we sort of thought wow this will
 

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.399
into it we sort of thought wow this will
be relatively easy and I will sort of

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:51.409
be relatively easy and I will sort of
 

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.159
be relatively easy and I will sort of
know we'll crack a couple of kind of

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:53.169
know we'll crack a couple of kind of
 

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.899
know we'll crack a couple of kind of
experiences out there and you know get

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:55.909
experiences out there and you know get
 

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:58.209
experiences out there and you know get
them through submission and everything

00:07:58.209 --> 00:07:58.219
them through submission and everything
 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.740
them through submission and everything
took three times as long cost three

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750
took three times as long cost three
 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.390
took three times as long cost three
times as much as we were expecting and

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400
times as much as we were expecting and
 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.309
times as much as we were expecting and
actually to kind of go back to my point

00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319
actually to kind of go back to my point
 

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:05.200
actually to kind of go back to my point
I was making before to uphold the things

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.210
I was making before to uphold the things
 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.820
I was making before to uphold the things
that are important to us about our brand

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830
that are important to us about our brand
 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.159
that are important to us about our brand
like the quality of the output and so on

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:09.169
like the quality of the output and so on
 

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:11.649
like the quality of the output and so on
actually took a significant amount of

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:11.659
actually took a significant amount of
 

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:12.999
actually took a significant amount of
time and I think it's only read just now

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:13.009
time and I think it's only read just now
 

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.309
time and I think it's only read just now
that we've really kind of you know

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319
that we've really kind of you know
 

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:18.279
that we've really kind of you know
learnt how to approach that properly and

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:18.289
learnt how to approach that properly and
 

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.200
learnt how to approach that properly and
you know sort of do things in the right

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.210
you know sort of do things in the right
 

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.059
you know sort of do things in the right
way and that will be a sort of

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:22.069
way and that will be a sort of
 

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.830
way and that will be a sort of
continuing learning processes sort of

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840
continuing learning processes sort of
 

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.320
continuing learning processes sort of
new tech comes out and so on so what

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.330
new tech comes out and so on so what
 

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.659
new tech comes out and so on so what
would you say that then in that sense to

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:28.669
would you say that then in that sense to
 

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:30.100
would you say that then in that sense to
someone who's just thinking of starting

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.110
someone who's just thinking of starting
 

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.939
someone who's just thinking of starting
out all right any of you guys that have

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:32.949
out all right any of you guys that have
 

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:35.949
out all right any of you guys that have
of a good piece of wisdom in terms of

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959
of a good piece of wisdom in terms of
 

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:37.810
of a good piece of wisdom in terms of
the first thing to think about or the

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:37.820
the first thing to think about or the
 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.370
the first thing to think about or the
first potential failure that you have to

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:39.380
first potential failure that you have to
 

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.250
first potential failure that you have to
think about in terms of developing for

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.260
think about in terms of developing for
 

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.230
think about in terms of developing for
the R

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240
the R
 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.699
the R
I would say start with the core start

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:47.709
I would say start with the core start
 

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:49.889
I would say start with the core start
simple one of my developers usually says

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:54.580
sticks and you got a try you got to try
 

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.850

a lot of things because it's a moving

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:56.860
a lot of things because it's a moving
 

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.260
a lot of things because it's a moving

just feels good knowing what your

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.070
just feels good knowing what your
 

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.800
just feels good knowing what your
objectives are you know you have an end

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:07.810
objectives are you know you have an end
 

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.210
objectives are you know you have an end
goal what are you actually trying to

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:09.220
goal what are you actually trying to
 

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.430
goal what are you actually trying to
achieve with this you know you trying to

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440
achieve with this you know you trying to
 

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.960
achieve with this you know you trying to
do this is from a commercial point of

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:12.970
do this is from a commercial point of
 

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.040
do this is from a commercial point of
view we're trying to do it from a brand

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.050
view we're trying to do it from a brand
 

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.660
view we're trying to do it from a brand
point of view what it you know what are

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:15.670
point of view what it you know what are
 

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.800
point of view what it you know what are
your objectives and that's probably true

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:16.810
your objectives and that's probably true
 

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.510
your objectives and that's probably true
of most ventures right but I think it's

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:18.520
of most ventures right but I think it's
 

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.160
of most ventures right but I think it's
particularly true with something which

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.170
particularly true with something which
 

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.260
particularly true with something which
combines a lot of creativity and a lot

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:22.270
combines a lot of creativity and a lot
 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.510
combines a lot of creativity and a lot
of tech so it is like you say it's a

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:24.520
of tech so it is like you say it's a
 

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.040
of tech so it is like you say it's a
kind of a moving target and you know

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.050
kind of a moving target and you know
 

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.139
kind of a moving target and you know
sometimes it moves whilst you're

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:28.149
sometimes it moves whilst you're
 

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:30.510
sometimes it moves whilst you're
developing for it right so yeah I mean I

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:30.520
developing for it right so yeah I mean I
 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.769
developing for it right so yeah I mean I
think it's good to have an end goal in

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:31.779
think it's good to have an end goal in
 

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.620
think it's good to have an end goal in
mind I think it's also extremely

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.630
mind I think it's also extremely
 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.990
mind I think it's also extremely
interesting important to work on ideas

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
interesting important to work on ideas
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.320
interesting important to work on ideas
in a way that you have an idea and you

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.330
in a way that you have an idea and you
 

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.730
in a way that you have an idea and you
can put it in one sentence

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:41.740
can put it in one sentence
 

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.500
can put it in one sentence
and you pitch it to someone and it may

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:43.510
and you pitch it to someone and it may
 

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.310
and you pitch it to someone and it may
click and I think that's a key factor in

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320
click and I think that's a key factor in
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.810
click and I think that's a key factor in
the beginning and then you add the text

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:48.820
the beginning and then you add the text
 

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.880
the beginning and then you add the text
to it but if you have this kind of basic

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:50.890
to it but if you have this kind of basic
 

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.430
to it but if you have this kind of basic
idea which really convince people and it

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440
idea which really convince people and it
 

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.199
idea which really convince people and it
convinced you know a little bit of five

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:55.209
convinced you know a little bit of five
 

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:57.870
convinced you know a little bit of five
years or a granny of ninety and then you

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880
years or a granny of ninety and then you
 

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.370
years or a granny of ninety and then you
think you you know that you were really

00:09:59.370 --> 00:09:59.380
think you you know that you were really
 

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.470
think you you know that you were really
working on something interesting and

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480
working on something interesting and
 

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.090
working on something interesting and
grave and which can be really great and

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.100
grave and which can be really great and
 

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.350
grave and which can be really great and
then you add the tech you had a

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360
then you add the tech you had a
 

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.069
then you add the tech you had a
different ways of sound of cameras of

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079
different ways of sound of cameras of
 

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:10.139
different ways of sound of cameras of
unity whatever you decide what you want

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:10.149
unity whatever you decide what you want
 

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.060
unity whatever you decide what you want
to use for it and that's I think a key

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.070
to use for it and that's I think a key
 

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.660
to use for it and that's I think a key
factor that's great I mean I think one

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:15.670
factor that's great I mean I think one
 

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.790
factor that's great I mean I think one
interesting mantra that we all know in a

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800
interesting mantra that we all know in a
 

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.490

mobile world is failed cheap and fail
fast and I just want to kind of drill

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.180
fast and I just want to kind of drill
 

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.760
fast and I just want to kind of drill
down on that a little bit in the context

down on that a little bit in the context
of this question as well it kind of

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:26.649
of this question as well it kind of
 

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:28.199
of this question as well it kind of
works in mobile pretty well like you can

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:28.209
works in mobile pretty well like you can
 

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:31.889
works in mobile pretty well like you can
you know fail cheap and fail fast with

that's presumably a lot harder to do so

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:39.700
that's presumably a lot harder to do so

how do you do you still apply the same

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399
how do you do you still apply the same
 

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.420
how do you do you still apply the same

the market will develop

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860
the market will develop
 

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.430
the market will develop
I think that's risky very risky so I

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440
I think that's risky very risky so I
 

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.639
I think that's risky very risky so I
think it's really key to kind of

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:03.649
think it's really key to kind of
 

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:05.889
think it's really key to kind of
you know to be thinking of your consumer

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:05.899
you know to be thinking of your consumer
 

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:16.079
you know to be thinking of your consumer
always what's going to be good for them

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089
 
 

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:22.360
 
linear and interactive I think the real

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.370
linear and interactive I think the real
 

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.870
linear and interactive I think the real
interactive is still based on mobile

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880
interactive is still based on mobile
 

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.590
interactive is still based on mobile
it's based on VR headsets and we see a

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600
it's based on VR headsets and we see a
 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.050
it's based on VR headsets and we see a
growth that there are more and more

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:32.060
growth that there are more and more
 

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.090
growth that there are more and more
headsets on the market so the kind of

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.100
headsets on the market so the kind of
 

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.000
headsets on the market so the kind of
market is getting bigger and bigger

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.010
market is getting bigger and bigger
 

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:41.800
market is getting bigger and bigger
still with linear you have the advantage

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:41.810
still with linear you have the advantage
 

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.430
still with linear you have the advantage
that you can really make access to

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440
that you can really make access to
 

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.300
that you can really make access to
people who don't have a headset but who

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.310
people who don't have a headset but who
 

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.189
people who don't have a headset but who
are familiar with video in general so

00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199
are familiar with video in general so
 

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.850
are familiar with video in general so
they understand it like that and I think

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:54.860
they understand it like that and I think
 

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.920
they understand it like that and I think
if you if you create out of that great

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:56.930
if you if you create out of that great
 

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.550
if you if you create out of that great
experiences that can be a bit more

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560
experiences that can be a bit more
 

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.230
experiences that can be a bit more
convincing just to understand this new

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240
convincing just to understand this new
 

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.470
convincing just to understand this new
evolutionary step into computing and

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480
evolutionary step into computing and
 

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.960
evolutionary step into computing and
this kind of new platform this kind of

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:10.970
this kind of new platform this kind of
 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.250
this kind of new platform this kind of
new interactive realities coming up

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:15.260
new interactive realities coming up
 

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.160

there it's a really good tool like a

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.170
there it's a really good tool like a
 

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.960
there it's a really good tool like a

technology that's kind of doing the
bridge between the two and that's why we

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:22.910
bridge between the two and that's why we
 

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.060
bridge between the two and that's why we
shouldn't underestimate really linear

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:25.070
shouldn't underestimate really linear
 

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.410
shouldn't underestimate really linear

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:29.420
 
 

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.509
 
from the daydream side we've seen that

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519
from the daydream side we've seen that
 

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.880
from the daydream side we've seen that
actually the most used app on on day

dreamers YouTube so like linear 360

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120
dreamers YouTube so like linear 360
 

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.769
dreamers YouTube so like linear 360
video is playing a big part and I don't

video is playing a big part and I don't
 

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:44.980
video is playing a big part and I don't
think we want to say that 360 or linear

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:44.990
think we want to say that 360 or linear
 

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.500

video is some kind of a step towards the

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:47.510
video is some kind of a step towards the
 

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.360
video is some kind of a step towards the
ultimate goal which is interactive it's

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.370
ultimate goal which is interactive it's
 

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.639
ultimate goal which is interactive it's
not like I think as Bradley mentioned

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:51.649
not like I think as Bradley mentioned
 

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:53.980

it's really about what you're trying to
 

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.900
it's really about what you're trying to
achieve and sometimes 360 video is

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:55.910
achieve and sometimes 360 video is
 

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.650
achieve and sometimes 360 video is
exactly the right format and also it's

00:16:59.650 --> 00:16:59.660
exactly the right format and also it's
 

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.720
exactly the right format and also it's
you know often cheaper to produce so

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:01.730
you know often cheaper to produce so
 

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.210
you know often cheaper to produce so
that's a good thing too I think that was

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:04.220
that's a good thing too I think that was
 

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:10.500
that's a good thing too I think that was

language learning app and we've just

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:15.860
language learning app and we've just
 

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.030

built a VR experience for another

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.040
built a VR experience for another

platform and one of my questions is

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799
platform and one of my questions is
 

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:25.329
platform and one of my questions is
around replayability because obviously

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:25.339
around replayability because obviously
 

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:30.100
around replayability because obviously
those experiences are quite finite and I

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.110
those experiences are quite finite and I
 

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.190
those experiences are quite finite and I
guess as all platforms will be looking

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200
guess as all platforms will be looking
 

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.560
guess as all platforms will be looking
at retention as a key metric so how do

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:35.570

00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679
BBC research actually that was done
 

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:08.609
BBC research actually that was done
recently about the kind of barriers you

00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:08.619
recently about the kind of barriers you
 

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:10.379

might have seen it is really interesting
 

00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:11.849
might have seen it is really interesting

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.099
your headset put it on go through the
kind of process of sort of putting it up

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:26.109
kind of process of sort of putting it up
 

00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:27.899
kind of process of sort of putting it up
and so on and that the research found

00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:27.909
and so on and that the research found
 

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:28.889
and so on and that the research found
that that was one of the most difficult

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:28.899
that that was one of the most difficult
 

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:31.079
that that was one of the most difficult
things about VR is that people tend to

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:31.089
things about VR is that people tend to
 

00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:33.149
things about VR is that people tend to
do things in order of how easy they are

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159
do things in order of how easy they are
 

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:35.999
do things in order of how easy they are
and VR comes to fairly sort of low down

00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:36.009
and VR comes to fairly sort of low down
 

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.979
and VR comes to fairly sort of low down
the kind of list and that's one reason

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:37.989
the kind of list and that's one reason
 

00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:39.599
the kind of list and that's one reason
why I think it has to have that added

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:39.609
why I think it has to have that added
 

00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:42.329
why I think it has to have that added
value it has to be something that kind

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:42.339
value it has to be something that kind
 

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:43.259
value it has to be something that kind
of like you know people are going to

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:43.269
of like you know people are going to
 

00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:44.849
of like you know people are going to
kind of want as a destination to come

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:44.859
kind of want as a destination to come
 

00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:46.859
kind of want as a destination to come
and go to but I do think as well we're

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:46.869
and go to but I do think as well we're
 

00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:48.479
and go to but I do think as well we're
just talking about this before that we

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:48.489
just talking about this before that we
 

00:19:48.489 --> 00:19:50.430
just talking about this before that we
are in the really early stages of VR

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440
are in the really early stages of VR
 

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.930
are in the really early stages of VR
there's been a huge amount of noise

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:51.940
there's been a huge amount of noise
 

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.789
there's been a huge amount of noise
about it and people are saying oh it's

00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799
about it and people are saying oh it's
 

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:55.079
about it and people are saying oh it's
not gonna work and you know people

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:55.089
not gonna work and you know people
 

00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:56.639
not gonna work and you know people
aren't investing in it and so on it's

00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:56.649
aren't investing in it and so on it's
 

00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:57.959
aren't investing in it and so on it's
incredibly unfair because it's only

00:19:57.959 --> 00:19:57.969
incredibly unfair because it's only
 

00:19:57.969 --> 00:19:59.549
incredibly unfair because it's only
really been in its current form around

00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559
really been in its current form around
 

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:02.099
really been in its current form around
for 18 months to two years if you look

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:02.109
for 18 months to two years if you look
 

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:03.329
for 18 months to two years if you look
at the mobile market which has been

00:20:03.329 --> 00:20:03.339
at the mobile market which has been
 

00:20:03.339 --> 00:20:05.759
at the mobile market which has been
around for a long long time many of the

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:05.769
around for a long long time many of the
 

00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:08.159
around for a long long time many of the
surface of the sophistication about kind

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:08.169
surface of the sophistication about kind
 

00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:09.629
surface of the sophistication about kind
of retention and so on it's I mean

00:20:09.629 --> 00:20:09.639
of retention and so on it's I mean
 

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:11.489
of retention and so on it's I mean
really now kind of coming to kind of

00:20:11.489 --> 00:20:11.499
really now kind of coming to kind of
 

00:20:11.499 --> 00:20:12.810
really now kind of coming to kind of
like the four and you look at the way

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:12.820
like the four and you look at the way
 

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.249
like the four and you look at the way
that kind of mobile companies sort of

00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:14.259
that kind of mobile companies sort of
 

00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:16.560
that kind of mobile companies sort of
reengage people and so on that's sort of

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:16.570
reengage people and so on that's sort of
 

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.339
reengage people and so on that's sort of
you know years of kind of R&amp;D and

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:20.349
you know years of kind of R&amp;D and
 

00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:22.379
you know years of kind of R&amp;D and
investment and tying to social channels

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:22.389
investment and tying to social channels
 

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.460
investment and tying to social channels
and so on and I think VR na are

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:24.470
and so on and I think VR na are
 

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.410
and so on and I think VR na are
we'll have that eventually as well and

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:26.420
we'll have that eventually as well and
 

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.730
we'll have that eventually as well and
that will help with kind of attention

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:27.740
that will help with kind of attention
 

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.930
that will help with kind of attention
and getting people to come back in and

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:28.940
and getting people to come back in and
 

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.520
and getting people to come back in and
discoverability and all those things

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:32.530
 
 

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.860
 
because actually the first mover or

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:35.870
because actually the first mover or
 

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.450
because actually the first mover or
smartphones they came to market in the

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:37.460
smartphones they came to market in the
 

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.790
smartphones they came to market in the
90s something like that but it made boom

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.800
90s something like that but it made boom
 

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.390
90s something like that but it made boom
in the 20 in the 2000s with Android with

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400
in the 20 in the 2000s with Android with
 

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.580
in the 20 in the 2000s with Android with
iOS and stuff like that so there was a

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:45.590
iOS and stuff like that so there was a
 

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.490
iOS and stuff like that so there was a
quite a big period in between the first

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:48.500
quite a big period in between the first
 

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.520
quite a big period in between the first
really market phones like the Nokia back

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:51.530
really market phones like the Nokia back
 

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.150
really market phones like the Nokia back
in the days and stuff like that I think

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.160
in the days and stuff like that I think
 

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.110
in the days and stuff like that I think
that seeing the moving today since like

00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120
that seeing the moving today since like
 

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.830
that seeing the moving today since like
25 14 cents we do it it's really fast I

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840
25 14 cents we do it it's really fast I
 

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.690
25 14 cents we do it it's really fast I
think I'm quite surprised and in

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:04.700
think I'm quite surprised and in
 

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.110
think I'm quite surprised and in
different levels I mean an adoption and

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120
different levels I mean an adoption and
 

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.410
different levels I mean an adoption and
stuff like that but I think also that

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:11.420
stuff like that but I think also that
 

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.290
stuff like that but I think also that
the midterm or the next goal would be

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:14.300
the midterm or the next goal would be
 

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.520
the midterm or the next goal would be
that it's kind of something yeah which

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:18.530
that it's kind of something yeah which
 

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.860
that it's kind of something yeah which
is where people ask for experiences but

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:20.870
is where people ask for experiences but
 

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.480
is where people ask for experiences but
not because it's we are because they

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:22.490
not because it's we are because they
 

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.340
not because it's we are because they
asked that they heard something is

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.350
asked that they heard something is
 

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.020
asked that they heard something is
really great and they want to play it or

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.030
really great and they want to play it or
 

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.790
really great and they want to play it or
they want to see it or whatever I think

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:27.800
they want to see it or whatever I think
 

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.950
they want to see it or whatever I think
that will be the next go for for the

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960
that will be the next go for for the
 

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.870
that will be the next go for for the
next year to your question around with

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880
next year to your question around with
 

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.400
next year to your question around with
replayability there's that's kind of I

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.410
replayability there's that's kind of I
 

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.510
replayability there's that's kind of I
think three things that need to happen

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520
think three things that need to happen
 

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.910
think three things that need to happen
and aligned in in in a certain way which

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:39.920
and aligned in in in a certain way which
 

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.790
and aligned in in in a certain way which
is hardware software and content right

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:42.800
is hardware software and content right
 

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.920
is hardware software and content right
so it becomes the barrier to

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:44.930
so it becomes the barrier to
 

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.270
so it becomes the barrier to
experiencing here it's a lot lower than

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.280
experiencing here it's a lot lower than
 

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.890
experiencing here it's a lot lower than
replayability is not really that much of

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:47.900
replayability is not really that much of
 

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.270
replayability is not really that much of
an issue because you can just pick this

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280
an issue because you can just pick this
 

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.220
an issue because you can just pick this
thing up and it's cheap and it's easy

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:51.230
thing up and it's cheap and it's easy
 

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.870
thing up and it's cheap and it's easy
right

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880
right
 

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.680
right
and I think to follow on with this one

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:56.690
and I think to follow on with this one
 

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.330
and I think to follow on with this one
interesting you know stat that I guess

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.340
interesting you know stat that I guess
 

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.740
interesting you know stat that I guess
you guys know is that you know Goldman

00:21:59.740 --> 00:21:59.750
you guys know is that you know Goldman
 

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.210
you guys know is that you know Goldman

billion dollar industry taking over TV

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320
billion dollar industry taking over TV
 

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.910
billion dollar industry taking over TV
that's interesting well what do you so

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:12.920
that's interesting well what do you so
 

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.210
that's interesting well what do you so
you know be that as it may what do you

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:16.220
you know be that as it may what do you
 

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.460
you know be that as it may what do you
think are the key steps that need to

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:18.470
think are the key steps that need to
 

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.850
think are the key steps that need to
happen in order for your to go

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.860
happen in order for your to go
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.380
happen in order for your to go
mainstream whatever that means

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:26.390
 
 

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.260
 
we have four if you look back on

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:29.270
we have four if you look back on
 

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.450
we have four if you look back on
smartphone market I mean today you have

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:31.460
smartphone market I mean today you have
 

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.270
smartphone market I mean today you have
a phenomena that people say they talk to

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:34.280
a phenomena that people say they talk to
 

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.070
a phenomena that people say they talk to
someone but you don't know how I mean

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080
someone but you don't know how I mean
 

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.649
someone but you don't know how I mean
did I call them did they write or what

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:38.659
did I call them did they write or what
 

00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:40.360
did I call them did they write or what
the hell did whatever you know you don't

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:40.370
the hell did whatever you know you don't
 

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.880
the hell did whatever you know you don't
know they just say that a communication

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:42.890
know they just say that a communication
 

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.669
know they just say that a communication
with someone and I think we are should

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679
with someone and I think we are should
 

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:48.310
with someone and I think we are should
be and a are should be at the same level

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320
be and a are should be at the same level
 

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.870
be and a are should be at the same level

more or less that it's used intuitively
 

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.519
more or less that it's used intuitively
like okay it's there it's something and

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:54.529
like okay it's there it's something and
 

00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:56.769
like okay it's there it's something and
I do a call with my friends in the

00:22:56.769 --> 00:22:56.779
I do a call with my friends in the
 

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:59.230
I do a call with my friends in the
states in 360 and I see where they are

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240
states in 360 and I see where they are
 

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.759
states in 360 and I see where they are
and we can share the environment and

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:00.769
and we can share the environment and
 

00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:02.380
and we can share the environment and
stuff like that so all this I think will

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:02.390
stuff like that so all this I think will
 

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.380
stuff like that so all this I think will
come but you know I think this is this

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:05.390
come but you know I think this is this
 

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.720
come but you know I think this is this
this will be more or less the kind of

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.730
this will be more or less the kind of
 

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:15.250
this will be more or less the kind of
level when will arrive is an interesting

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.260
level when will arrive is an interesting
 

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.840
level when will arrive is an interesting
kind of like adoption curve with any new

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:16.850
kind of like adoption curve with any new
 

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.580
kind of like adoption curve with any new
technology that it has to become sort of

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:18.590
technology that it has to become sort of
 

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.310
technology that it has to become sort of
you know has to be accessible to people

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320
you know has to be accessible to people
 

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.720
you know has to be accessible to people
and sort of be something that kind of

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:22.730
and sort of be something that kind of
 

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:23.889
and sort of be something that kind of
people are familiar with and obviously

00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:23.899
people are familiar with and obviously
 

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:25.779
people are familiar with and obviously
as a younger generation grows up without

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:25.789
as a younger generation grows up without
 

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:27.039
as a younger generation grows up without
tech they kind of you know they're

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:27.049
tech they kind of you know they're
 

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:28.570
tech they kind of you know they're
probably be more willing to kind of put

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.580
probably be more willing to kind of put
 

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.389
probably be more willing to kind of put
kind of headsets on and so on but again

00:23:31.389 --> 00:23:31.399
kind of headsets on and so on but again
 

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:32.649
kind of headsets on and so on but again
I think it just comes down to kind of

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:32.659
I think it just comes down to kind of
 

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:34.269
I think it just comes down to kind of
like what are the applications going to

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279
like what are the applications going to
 

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.279
like what are the applications going to
be and I think you'll probably begin to

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:36.289
be and I think you'll probably begin to
 

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:39.159
be and I think you'll probably begin to
see a you know they are finding

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:39.169
see a you know they are finding
 

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:40.899
see a you know they are finding
different areas which it's really good

00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:40.909
different areas which it's really good
 

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:42.460
different areas which it's really good
at so I think it has lots of

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:42.470
at so I think it has lots of
 

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.779
at so I think it has lots of
applications for kind of business

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:43.789
applications for kind of business
 

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:45.820
applications for kind of business
business the business and training and

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:45.830
business the business and training and
 

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.560
business the business and training and
that type of thing I think there'll be a

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:47.570
that type of thing I think there'll be a
 

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.070
that type of thing I think there'll be a
lot more installation basically are

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080
lot more installation basically are
 

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.940
lot more installation basically are
coming up in the next couple of years

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:51.950
coming up in the next couple of years
 

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.169
coming up in the next couple of years
you know you'll see that it at theme

00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:53.179
you know you'll see that it at theme
 

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:55.120
you know you'll see that it at theme
parks you'll see it in kind of malls and

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.130
parks you'll see it in kind of malls and
 

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.799
parks you'll see it in kind of malls and
things like that and I think that again

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:56.809
things like that and I think that again
 

00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:58.240
things like that and I think that again
will kind of like you know give the

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.250

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.980
will kind of like you know give the
general public much more exposure to it

00:23:59.980 --> 00:23:59.990
general public much more exposure to it
 

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.180
general public much more exposure to it
and that's a good way for them getting

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:01.190
