00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.510
So as we saw in the demos, the cookies can have extra parameters,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.720
not just the value.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.870
So, let me, let me draw anoth, an, an example cookie for you.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.220
Here's a, here's an example set cookie header for

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.260
setting this cookie, whose name is name, nice and confusing.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.420
Whose value is Steve.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.890
And now we've added a couple extra parameters.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.025
We've got semicolon to end the value.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.490
We've added this domain parameter.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.220
And this is what domain this cookie is relevant to.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.280
So in this case, it is relevant to www.reddit.com and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.130
this is the path that it's relevant to.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520
So the path is easier to explain.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.310
basically, you can put whatever you want here and

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.060
then, in this case, this is the default path.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.580
If you don't specify a path we just assume you mean slash.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.020
And this is actually the most common use case of cookies.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.220
You the cookie applies to all of the paths.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.750
But if you want to restrict the cookie to a particular path, you can specify

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.730
that path here and the browser will make sure that the path you're requesting

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.310
starts with this value before it sends the cookie.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.290
So the domain is much more interesting and much more complex.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.120
And let's, let's talk about this a little bit so this means that basically, this

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.040
cookie will not get sent by the browser to the server unless the server's domain

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.090
is www.reddit.com or basically, ends with www.reddit.com.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.777
So, domains that this work for are, for

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:28.256
example, www.reddit.com foo.www.reddit.com.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:33.184
Domains that, that will not receive this cookie, would be for

00:01:33.184 --> 00:01:36.470
example just reddit.com without the ww, or

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.525
bar.reddit.com because this cookie was restricted to www, so basically,

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:48.830
the, the site you're at has to begin, or I mean sorry end with www.reddit.com.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.820
You can't set cookies to just .com, you have to have at least two periods.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.350
So the minimum domain you can set a cookie for is .reddit.com.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.272
If you try to set for

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:02.969
just reddit.com, the, that first period will automatically get added.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.953
That controls,

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:07.971
the domain controls which domain a browser will send the cookie to.

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.703
What about, you know, can, can I have can I

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:14.620
have a web server at reddit.com that sets a cookie for google.com?

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.930
The answer is, no.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.000
Similar to how the domain parameter restricts which domains a browser will

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.120
send a cookie to, the domain who's serving the request, the, the,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.920
basically the domain of the web server, that, of,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.560
of the webpage, you may only set a cookie to that domain or higher.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.810
So if we're at www.reddit.com the browser will only accept cookies for

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.020
by default, www.reddit.com if there's no, no domain parameter.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.430
If there is a domain parameter,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.180
the only valid domains are www.reddit.com or reddit.com.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.374
We can't set a cookie for bar.reddit.com or foo.reddit.com.

00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:57.787
And, and this is to prevent you know, if you have multiple websites,

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:02.203
kind of sharing the same top-level domain, you know, halfspot.com for

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:04.445
example, you know, you don't, I,

00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:08.750
I can't see a cookie on, in my app that affects the behavior of your app.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.880
I can only set a cookie that get sent with www and with the top level.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.920
That's how the domain restrictions work.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.060
Let's have a little quiz.
