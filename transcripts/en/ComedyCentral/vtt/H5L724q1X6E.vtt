&gt;&gt; Larry: I WANT ONE
MORE QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS
FOR ME AT @MRNEWKLUTE.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:17.050
HE SAID IS IT ODD THAT A FEW
WEEKS AFTER YOU MOVE INTO THE

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.386 align:start position:0%
NEIGHBORHOOD, JON STEWART
DECIDES HE WANTS TO MOVE OUT?

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:28.127 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WOULD SAY THAT YES, IT IS ODD.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.430 align:start position:0%
I'VE SAID ALL ALONG THAT JON IS
A RACIST.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:34.333 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
PEOPLE NEVER BELIEVE ME.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.467 size:84% position:42%
NOW THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.938 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T MAKE HIM STAY, BUT, HEY,
YOU KNOW, JON, WHATEVER.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.509 align:start position:0%
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:44.677 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.613 align:start position:0%
REMEMBER, WE ACTUALLY WORKED IN
THE CBS BUILDING WITH JOHN

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
OLIVER.

00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:49.448 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TRUE STORY.

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.951
WE WORKED-- BEFORE WE MOVED INTO
THIS BUILDING, WE WORKED ON THE

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.888
SAME FLOOR AS JOHN OLIVER, AND
RIGHT WHEN THIS SHOW MOVED IN,

00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:01.828
THEY PUT UP A BIG SECURITY DOOR.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.897 size:88% position:44%
"THE BLACK SHOW IS IN TOWN."

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.933 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THEY WERE OUT ON
HIATUS

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.236
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:11.471
TIME TO GET TO "KEEP IT 100".

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
IT'S TIME TO GET REAL ON A
PERSONAL LEVEL.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.441 align:start position:0%
KEEP IT 100.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.710 align:start position:0%
THERE WE GO.
&gt;&gt; IT'S ACTUALLY A HUNNED

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:22.615
I SAID IT SO MANY TIMES, YOU
HAVE NO IDEA-- IF I SAY KEEP IT

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:27.854
ONE HELP IF I SAID KEEP IT A
HUNDRED, IT'S NO KEEP IT 100.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.656 size:88% position:44%
THAT'S HOW THE TWEETS SOUND.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start position:0%
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE SOUND ON
YOUR TWEETS.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.094 align:start position:0%
