[cheers and applause]

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.352
(Rob)
A couple years ago,

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.389
my wife and I--we,
we bought a house.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.391
My favorite feature
was that

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.428
lining the front
of the property

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.363
was a fence.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:08.335
This fence had a motor.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.673
Right?
Yeah.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.475
This was a Hot Rod fence.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.945
And there was a button
at the end of the driveway

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.813
and if you pushed
that button,

00:01:19.847 --> 00:01:23.684
the gate in front
of the driveway, it opens.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.486
And if you press
that button again,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.222
it closes.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.991
So I was outside one day
at the end of my driveway,

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.193
just hitting the button.
[mimics gate opening]

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.562
Pvvvvvvvuh.
Pvvvvvuh.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.565
Just passing the time
opening and closing my gate.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.804
When my next door neighbor
peeks over her fence.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:47.875
She says, "Hey.
Enjoying your fence, huh?

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:52.446
"You know, I--I told
the former owner...

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.548
"that fence is over height.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.253
It's too high, it actually
violates zoning regulations."

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.754
So I said...

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.422
"Why don't you mind
your own business,

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.058
you old, dried up bitch?
Who asked you?"

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:09.096
Is what I should have said.
That's what I should have said.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.098
Now, I didn't think
much of it.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.600
And then about two weeks ago,
I'm--I'm walking out

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:17.070
my front door, maybe gonna
squeeze in some mid-afternoon

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.574
opening and closing
of the gate.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.911
And I see that my fence...

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.180
got a ticket.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:27.414
[laughter]

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:29.082
That's right.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.919
Somebody from the zoning board,
probably, uh,

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.454
probably one of
the zoning board cops,

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:41.428
pulled over my Hot Rod fence
and gave it a ticket.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.231
Now, I like to imagine
when my fence was pulled over,

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.867
that it was like
kind of a dick.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.302
You know, that it was
like, all cocky

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.536
kind of belligerent.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.704
The zoning board guy
pulled him over,

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.339
he's like--walks up.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.541
Zoning board cop's like,

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.677
"You know why I pulled you over
today?"

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.646
My fence is like,
"Pffff. 'Cause you went

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.582
to a state school,
can't find a better job?"

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:06.320
High fives the mailbox!
[laughter]

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.656
And so this is where--this is
the point where my wife

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.460
smashes into the story
like some human-sized

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.729
pitcher of Kool-Aid.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.165
And she's like...

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:23.403
"It was that coughing bitch
next door who turned us in."

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.573
Quick sidebar.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.409
The woman next door,
our neighbor in question,

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:35.315
has emphysema--ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.583
Not cool.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.319
So I said to my wife,

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:41.955
like, "What are we gonna do,
Confront her?

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.192
I mean, she has emphysema."

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.828
And my wife's like,
"Oh, I'll give her emphysema."

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.897
And I was like, "No, no, no.
You don't have to.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.366
You know what, she's got it."

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.569
She's got the thing.

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.738
Uh, so, I mean, that was it.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:01.642
There was nothing we could do
except tear the fence down.

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.210
Um, that's right.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:07.881
I'm sorry but about--
about a month later,

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.050
I'm at work and I get
a call from my wife.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.286
"Hey!
Hey, what's going on?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.222
"Sorry to bug you at work.
Just a quick question.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.824
How do you un-send
an email?"

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.460
[laughter]

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:21.895
And I was like,
"Super-easy.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.463
"To un-send an email,
all you do

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:28.535
"is live in 1994
when we're all in dial-up

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.171
"and that was even
a remote possibility.

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:33.307
Why do you want to
un-send an email?"

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.875
And she's like,
"Oh, God.

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:38.679
"So today, I get an email
from our dying lady

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:42.416
"next door, and she's like,
'Hey, keep an eye on the people

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.817
"'that live behind you,
'cause they're doing

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.552
"'some work on your
retaining wall

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:48.488
and it might affect
the slope of your backyard.'"

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:52.292
"So," my wife is saying,
"I forwarded that to you

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:54.995
with a note that said,
'See?'"

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.265
And I am quoting my wife
directly now.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.033
"See?

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:04.505
"This proves that it was
that know-it-all [bleep]...

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:07.674
[laughter]

00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:10.711
who turned us in for having
an over-height fence."

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.613
And I was like, "Baby, I didn't
get an email from you."

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.115
And she was like,
"I know,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:20.554
because instead of hitting
'forward,' I hit 'reply.'"

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:23.056
[laughter]

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.093
"So what do we do?"

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:29.630
"It's super-easy.
All we have to do is move."

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.732
And I was like,
"The only other thing

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:35.435
we could do is kill her and make
it look like emphysema."

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.374
So my wife, she walked next door

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:44.578
and knocked on the door
and apologized face-to-face.

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:45.579
- [whistle]
- Yeah.

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:49.449
High road.
[applause]

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:51.518
So I learned that day
that that's what you do.

00:05:51.552 --> 00:05:53.720
You take the high road.
You apologize...

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:54.855
to someone's face.

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:56.623
I also learned
from my wife

00:05:56.657 --> 00:06:00.294
that when you do so,
it'd be helpful to have

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.063
your newborn baby
in your arms as you do it.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:04.631
She was like,
"Oh, my God.

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.034
"I am so sorry.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:09.136
"Can you please
find it in your heart

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.272
"to--oh, did you hear that?

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.242
Someone's got the hiccups!"

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.344
Thank you, everybody.
[cheers and applause]
