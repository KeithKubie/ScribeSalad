00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:03.000
In order to have a respectable
understanding of the Vietnam

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.130
War, we have to rewind all
the way back to the late 1800s

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.190
when France was
colonizing Southeast Asia.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.400
And in particular, it colonized
what is now Laos, Vietnam,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.450
and Cambodia-- and
they were collectively

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.260
called French Indochina.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.170
You can see Cambodia here,
Vietnam along the coast,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.340
and then, Laos, right over here.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.150
And France stayed the
colonizing power--

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.380
I have a little gap
in my timeline here--

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.980
and they stayed a
colonizing power

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.537
all the way through
World War II.

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:35.370
And so you can imagine,
during World War II,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.740
France was quickly
overrun by the Germans.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.790
The Vietnamese wanted
their independence,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.410
and so you have a liberation
movement that rises up.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.950
And it was led by the Viet
Minh, and the Viet Minh

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.270
were led by Ho Chi Minh.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.620
This right here is a
picture of Ho Chi Minh.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.730
And besides being a
liberation movement,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.770
they were also communist,
which, you could imagine, later

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.840
on during the Cold
War will kind of bias

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.930
the United States against them.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.930
But you fast forward
through World War II.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.170
Eventually, the Japanese
take control over Indochina,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.980
over Vietnam.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.260
But by the time '45
rolls around, or at least

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.960
the end of '45-- and we know
that the United States defeats

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.140
Japan-- now, all of a
sudden, the Viet Minh

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
are able to declare a somewhat
temporary independence.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.880
And it's temporary
because shortly

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.640
after that-- and the region
is occupied temporarily

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.585
by the Chinese in the north, and
the British in the south, who

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:38.030
were part of the Allied
forces against the Axis.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.030
But eventually, you have
the French coming back,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.430
and they want to
reassert their control

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.880
over their former colony.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.010
And you have this war that
develops-- the First Indochina

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.540
War between the
French and the people

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.465
sympathetic to the
French-- the Vietnamese

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:55.527
who were loyal to the
French-- and the North.

00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:57.110
And the French--
just to make it clear

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.140
how it sets up, at the
end of World War II

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.740
when you had the temporary
occupiers, the British

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.660
and the Chinese, the
Chinese, obviously,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.690
had more influence in the North.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.350
The British had more
influence in the South.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.260
When the French come
back they, essentially,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.710
are able to reinstate
control over the South.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.780
So right when the
Indochina War is beginning,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.320
the French already have
more control over the South.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.930
And actually,
historically the French

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.700
had more influence in
the South, as well.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.780
During French colonial rule it
was really the southern third

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.640
of Vietnam where you had
a lot of French influence.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.730
And this is a current
map, and the current map

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.620
does not have this
orange boundary over here

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.890
that we'll talk
about in a second.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.620
Vietnam is now unified.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.660
But before the Vietnam War,
this was not Ho Chi Minh City,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.410
this was Saigon.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.740
And Saigon was kind of where
most of the French control

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.190
was centered.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.590
But you fast forward
to 1954, this

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.910
ends up in a bit of a stalemate.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.750
And so you have the
Geneva Conference of 1954

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.990
that partitions Vietnam along
the 17th parallel between North

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.339
Vietnam and South Vietnam.

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.880
And the whole point
of this partition

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.136
was, really, to just
allow for a cooling

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.010
off period, a period
where you can have thing

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.130
settling down, and
then having elections.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.930
It wasn't meant to be
a permanent partition.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.450
But there was a
300-day period where

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.306
people could move
across the partition.

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:18.930
And during that
partition, you actually

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.790
had 900,000 people, mainly
Catholics, move from the North

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.290
to South.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.123
You also had several
hundred thousand people

00:03:25.123 --> 00:03:26.840
moving from the
South to the North,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.560
so it wasn't a one-way movement.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.530
But net net, most of the
movements by Roman Catholic

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.520
Vietnamese was from
the North to the south.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.660
You fast forward a little
bit, you eventually have--

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.220
and I'm sure I'm butchering
the pronunciation here--

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.770
Ngo Dinh Diem take control.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.710
He starts off as
prime minister in '54,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.000
eventually he takes control,
and becomes president in '55.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.970
This is him right here.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.900
He takes control
of South Vietnam,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.870
and this guy is not a big
fan of things like elections,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.227
or non-corrupt government,
and all the rest.

00:04:00.227 --> 00:04:01.810
And he takes control
of South Vietnam.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.800
But you could imagine that the
United States is positively

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.780
inclined to him.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.063
One, he dresses in nice
Western suits and all of that,

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:10.530
and had nicely combed hair.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.360
But he was also anti-communist.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.860
And at this time period,
the United States

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.990
is starting to think in
terms of the Cold War.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.420
And in terms of, how
do we stop communism?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.540
How do we contain it?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.970
This whole theory
of containment--

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.370
that the best way to
stop the Soviet Union

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.160
is to just make sure that
communism can not spread.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.714
That it gets contained.

00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:31.630
We have the domino theory
in the United States

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.390
that if one country falls
to communism in a region,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.690
that the rest of the countries
will eventually fall.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.990
And that is not good
for containment.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.150
So we did not want
South Vietnam to fall.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.162
We essentially start supporting
these characters over here.

00:04:44.162 --> 00:04:46.120
And even from the early
'50s, the United States

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.570
starts supporting
the anti-communist.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.480
And at first, this
support, it's in the-- I

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.880
guess we should say--
the guise of advisers.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.710
But these advisers--
one, we start

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.990
sending more and more aid,
and more and more advisers.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.510
And these advisers started
getting more and more involved

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.100
in the actual conflict.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.050
And so after this
partition, you can imagine,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.500
that you still have
an ongoing conflict

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.620
between the North and the South.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.670
And on top of that,
you have actors

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.520
who are sympathetic
to the North,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.270
sympathetic to the Viet Minh,
sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.110
in the South.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.850
Some of them were in the North,
they come back to the South.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.220
Some of them were
just in the South.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.764
And they did not like
the Diem government.

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:26.680
Besides just being
sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.580
Diem was a fairly
corrupt autocratic ruler,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.160
who wasn't a big
fan of democracy.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.830
And so these
players in the South

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.440
who started to rise up against
President Diem or the Viet

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.120
Cong.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.790
And so this really sets up what
the Vietnam War is all about.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.200
You have the communist Ho
Chi Minh-controlled North

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.020
that was fighting a conventional
war against the South.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.700
You have this partition
on the 17th parallel.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.490
And on top of that, you have an
unconventional fighting force--

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.990
I guess you'd call
them guerrillas--

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.220
in the South of Vietnam
called the Viet Cong.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.172
So it was, kind of, a
double-- There were two things

00:06:10.172 --> 00:06:12.630
that the South had to fight
against-- the North officially,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.692
and also this insurrection that
was occurring within the South.

00:06:16.692 --> 00:06:18.650
And so the whole time
the United States did not

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.680
want this insurrection
to succeed-- they did not

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.710
want all of Vietnam
to become communist.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.920
We keep sending more
and more advisers.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.660
It actually started
even before Kennedy,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.110
but Kennedy he starts
sending-- he escalates

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.830
the number of advisers
that gets sent.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.280
It's still not, at this point,
it's still not a formal war.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.920
We haven't officially
declared-- where

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.380
we don't have, officially,
soldiers in battle.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.400
You fast forward to
1963, besides all

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.260
of the great characteristics of
Diem that I already mentioned,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.220
he also was into
persecuting Buddhists.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.510
So to make matters worse,
not only was he corrupt,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.200
not only did he
not like elections,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.460
but he liked persecuting
his own people.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.580
And by 1963, this
kind of got out

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.480
of hand, his level of
persecution of the Buddhists.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.060
He started toward storming
temples, and all the rest.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.530
And so he was assassinated.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.191
And not only was
he assassinated,

00:07:14.191 --> 00:07:15.690
it kind of leaves
this power vacuum,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.800
and you have all these
people jockeying for control,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.180
none of these really
especially savory characters

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.470
inside the South.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.460
These two guys eventually
come to power, Nguyen Cao Ky

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.080
and Nguyen Van Thieu.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.810
Wait a few years,
Nguyen Van Thieu

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.870
is able to get this
guy out of the picture.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.270
And then by 1967--
I don't have it

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.430
over here-- you have Thieu
has now taken control.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.030
But during that
period-- or actually,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.830
before Ky and Thieu
take power-- in 1964,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.260
you have one of the shadiest
incidents in American history.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.880
As you can imagine, we, in
our function as advisors,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.360
we had sent ships into the
Gulf of Tonkin, right off

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.030
of the coast of North Vietnam.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.080
So the original
story goes-- and this

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.440
is a very suspect
original story-- in 1964,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.974
the US Maddox-- and this is
the original story-- claimed

00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:10.390
to that it was
attacked, or it was

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.380
claimed that the US
Maddox was attacked

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.920
by North Vietnamese
patrol boats,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.280
and that there was a
little skirmish-- there

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.530
was an exchange of fire.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.690
And it was also claimed that
a few days later another boat

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.580
in the Gulf of Tonkin,
another US vessel,

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.860
was attacked by a
North Vietnamese boat.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.850
That was the original story.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.890
This angered Congress, this
angered the American people.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.789
How dare they attack ships that
are sitting off of the coast,

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.669
warships that are
sitting off the coast.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:44.590
And so this kind of
gave the emotional fuel

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.420
to pass the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.560
So these incidents, or these
purported incidents-- this,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.182
kind of, attack
on the USS Maddox,

00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:54.390
and this other thing that
might have happened-- these

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.320
were called the Gulf
of Tonkin Incidents.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.810
This angered Congress,
angered the American people,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.880
so we passed the Gulf
of Tonkin Resolution,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.720
and what's relevant about it
is that it gave LBJ, here,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.940
it gave him the
authority to officially

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.060
engage in a war in Vietnam,
to officially escalate it

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.712
to an actual war that
the US was involved in.

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:17.420
And this whole time
I've been saying it's

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.040
shady, because
it's now been shown

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.360
that one, the Gulf of
Tonkin-- well it's not clear

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.730
that really anything happened.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.480
There might have been some
firing from the USS Maddox.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.180
They might have actually engaged
the North Vietnamese patrol

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.240
boats.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.880
The other possibility
that might have happened

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.170
is that nothing happened.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.110
But any way you look at it,
it's now been fairly established

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.955
that it was not a real incident.

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:52.280
It was not really North Vietnam
attacking the United States.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.010
But it was relevant because
it really escalated the war.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.120
So now you have Johnson-- did
I say North Korea originally?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.164
I apologize for that.

00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.580
We're talking about
North Vietnam.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.710
I don't remember what
my brain actually said.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.190
Of course, North Vietnam.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:11.490
But it gave Johnson the
power to escalate the war.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.080
And so his
administration is really

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.630
the heart of the
Vietnam War, when

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.300
the war was really escalated.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.880
We eventually get to
500,000 US troops.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.500
But the whole time this is
happening, you can imagine,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.800
Johnson and the American
military leaders in Vietnam

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.610
are telling the American people,
oh, we're fighting communism.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.090
We're about to win.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.910
This is a noble war.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.590
And you fast forward,
and especially,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.152
the part about to win--
you fast forward to 1968,

00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:41.110
and all of a sudden you
have the Viet Cong, who

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.750
the American leaders have
told the American people

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.350
and the Congress, that
they're about to be defeated,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.020
and then in 1968, the Viet Cong
orchestrate the Tet Offensive,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.550
which is this massive
coordinated attack

00:10:53.550 --> 00:11:00.750
on a bunch of targets
throughout South Vietnam.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.010
And so even though it was
wasn't completely successful

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.460
militarily, the intent
of the Tet Offensive

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.940
was to completely turn
the tides in the war.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.970
It made the American
people and the Congress

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.020
rightfully suspicious.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.450
You, Mr. Johnson,
you had told us

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.970
that we were about
to win the war,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.350
and the Viet Cong were almost
defeated, and all of a sudden,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.380
they orchestrate this
sophisticated attack on us.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.860
It rightfully made the
American public suspicious.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.890
On top of that, and this
probably made matters

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.860
a lot worse, the My
Lai Massacre comes out.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.900
And in every war
there are massacres,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.130
but the United States,
at least believes,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.880
that its soldiers can kind
of take the high road.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.680
They don't engage in
these type of things.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.800
But the My Lai Massacre showed
that, really, no soldiers

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.760
are immune to massacres.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.120
And this is really a
disgusting massacre,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.300
and it was documented.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.280
And if you really
want to be disturbed,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.730
do a Google search for images
of the My Lai Massacre.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.360
It will ruin your weekend.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.080
It'll depress you.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.520
It's US soldiers killing a
village of innocent women

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.450
and children.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.870
There's pictures of dead babies.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.410
It's horrible, and to
make matters worse--

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.095
or even, add insult to injury--
the soldiers who committed

00:12:13.095 --> 00:12:14.470
it-- there was
actually a few who

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.860
tried to defend the villagers
and when they came back,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.070
they were treated
almost like traitors.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.390
But the soldiers who actually
did the attack, only one

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.930
of them got jail time and it
was only a couple years of jail

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.500
time, and this
was for massacring

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.250
a village of women and children.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.130
So already, you had
the Tet Offensive.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.120
It makes the American
public suspicious

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.834
of whether we can
even win this war.

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:39.250
Then you have the
My Lai Massacre,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.600
which just disgusts
the public, and makes

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.540
people realize that
we're involved in a war

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.860
that it's not even clear who are
the good guys anymore, not even

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.790
clear what the real goals are.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.860
Make matters worse, you
fast forward to 1971.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.110
The Pentagon Papers get
leaked to the New York Times.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.590
And these pretty
much articulate--

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.680
it's a classified
document that articulates

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.640
that the leadership, the
military and non-military

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.990
leadership of the Vietnam
War, was, to some degree,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.882
lying to Congress and
the American people.

00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:10.590
It was lying about
how the war was going.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.140
It was lying about what
activities it was doing.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.360
It did not tell the
American people and Congress

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.620
that it was actually engaged
in war in Laos and Cambodia.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.757
And a lot of the reason
why we were engaged

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:22.340
in Laos and Cambodia
is because that's

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.950
where the supply routes
were between the North

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.510
and the South-- they ran
through Laos and Cambodia.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.260
And the most famous of them,
and you might have heard of it,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.290
is the Ho Chi Minh trail.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.640
And it wasn't just one
trail, it was actually

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.050
a network of trails.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.530
And so a lot of
the activity that

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.280
was going on in
Laos and Cambodia

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.230
was, kind of, carpet bombing
of what the US thought were

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.630
some of these supply routes.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.434
And we never really
got a good-- well,

00:13:48.434 --> 00:13:49.600
that's a whole other debate.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.209
But it wasn't just one
trail the was easily bombed.

00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:53.750
It was all of these
little foot paths

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.250
and all of these
other things, where

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.320
arms were able to be transported
from the North to the South.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.030
But the Pentagon
Papers, rightfully,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.880
made the American people
even more suspicious.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.320
And then now we're entering
into Nixon's administration,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.890
and he was still doing
the carpet bombing, still

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.070
atrocities going on,
but he, his whole goal

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.690
was to kind of
wind down the war,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.340
bring the troops out on a
timetable without, kind of,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.210
an unofficial defeat.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.930
So you fast forward to 1973, you
have the Paris Peace Accords,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:29.210
where officially there is peace
between the North, the South,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.960
the North, and the Americans.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.480
You can imagine it from
the North's point of view,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.100
they're like, sure, we'll
sign some peace accords.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.683
It'll just make the
Americans go away,

00:14:35.683 --> 00:14:37.520
once the Americans
go away they won't

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.228
be able to come back,
since this was such

00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:40.510
a hugely unpopular war.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:46.330
It was such a waste for
America on so many dimensions.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.374
Especially, America's
prestige as a global actor.

00:14:49.374 --> 00:14:50.790
We'll just wait
for them to leave,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.960
and then we can overrun
the South after that.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.460
And that's essentially
what happens.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.720
In 1975, the North just
overruns the South,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.630
and then later
that year, you have

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.390
Saigon falling to the North.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.460
And then it becomes
Ho Chi Minh City.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.650
And just this whole
period, you have

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.730
President Thieu is in
power, and just to show

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.450
where his priorities
are-- near the end,

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.642
right when the North is
falling to South Vietnam--

00:15:16.642 --> 00:15:18.100
and you can kind
of see the writing

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.725
on the wall-- he gives a speech
to the Vietnamese people saying

00:15:20.725 --> 00:15:22.040
that he'll never desert them.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.860
But then when it
becomes pretty clear

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.310
that Saigon is going to fall
to the North Vietnamese,

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.800
he gets on a big
US transport plane

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.857
with, literally,
15 tons of luggage.

00:15:35.857 --> 00:15:37.940
I'll let you think about
how much luggage that is.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:44.880
And $15 million worth of
gold, and this is $15 million

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.990
worth of gold in 1975.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.170
So you can imagine
how much he really

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.390
cared about the
Vietnamese people.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.890
And he eventually ends up
settling in Massachusetts.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.360
And he died there
about 10 years ago.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.845
So you could imagine, this was
an ugly incident for the world.

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:05.030
A super ugly incident for
the Vietnamese people.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.220
A super ugly chapter
in American history.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.390
It was the first war
that one, America lost,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.320
but more, it hurts prestige,
it hurts America's ability

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640
to influence what was going on
in other parts of the world.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.060
You had the containment
theory, that we

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.740
have to stop communism
from spreading.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.870
And the domino theory,
that if one country

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.930
would fall to communism
then the other ones were.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.770
That didn't happen.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.450
The South did
fall, but we didn't

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.530
have the rest of Southeast
Asia falling to communism.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.020
So it kind of disproved
the domino theory,

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.810
especially because
after the Vietnam War

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.750
the United States would
not be able to enter

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.930
another war like
it for some time,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.190
because the American people
wouldn't let it happen.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.310
So to some degree, it would
have been easier for communism

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.420
to spread, because
people would have

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.250
known that the US
couldn't engage it.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.410
But despite that, the
domino theory didn't happen.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.820
But it was just all-around ugly.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.155
I mean, besides the
massacres, and the raping,

00:17:00.155 --> 00:17:03.110
and the pillaging of innocence
that happened on, really,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:09.474
on all sides of this, you have
1 to 3 million Vietnamese--

00:17:09.474 --> 00:17:11.390
and no one will really
know the actual count--

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.431
but that's a huge number.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.849
1 to 3 million
Vietnamese were killed.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:21.804
You have 58,000 American
troops being killed.

00:17:21.804 --> 00:17:23.220
And you have
hundreds of thousands

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.020
of Cambodians and Laotions
who are never really formally

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.090
involved in the war,
they were killed.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.980
Especially, due to a lot of
this carpet bombing campaign.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.010
So these are just atrocious
numbers, and really one

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.310
of the worst and ugliest
chapters in US history.
