00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.474
In our ice cream cones and drowning deaths example, what other factors do you

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:06.510
think could have contributed to the number of drowning deaths and the number of

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.565
ice cream cones consumed? Could it be the location of where the study took

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:15.711
place? Could it be the number of people swimming during the study? Could it be

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.461
the climate of where the study took place? Or could it be the overall

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:23.078
population of where the study took place? Chose as many or as few of these as

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:24.160
you would like.
