00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.970
The cost in dollars of producing
x gallons of wood stain is

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.260
given by C of x is equal to
3,200 plus 0.1x minus 0.001x

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.940
squared plus 0.0004x
to the third power.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.740
What is a formula for the
marginal cost function

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.760
C prime of x?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.560
So we really just have to
take the derivative of C

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.280
with respect to
x, to think about

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.660
how does C change as x changes.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.217
As our quantity increases,
how does our cost change?

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:35.300
So what's the derivative
of this, right over here?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.600
Well, the derivative of 3,200
with respect to x is just 0.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.640
The derivative of 0.1x is 0.1.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.550
The derivative of negative
0.001x squared is going to be

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.610
negative 0.002x.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.320
And then finally, the
derivative of this

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.220
is going to be-- let's see,
this is 4 ten thousandths.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.690
So 3 times 4 ten thousandths
is 12 ten thousandths.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.810
So 0 point 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.360
Yep, that's 0.0012x squared.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.251
So that right over there is
equal to the marginal cost

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:17.750
function.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.166
So if you see this
in an exercise,

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.680
you just want to type
in the expression here.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.060
But this, of course, is
equal to C prime of x.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.870
To the nearest penny,
what is the marginal cost

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.080
of producing the
101st gallon of stain?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.800
So they say C prime of 100
is equal to blank dollars

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.400
per gallon.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.296
So what do they
want us to do here?

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:48.670
What they really
want us to do is

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.620
approximate what the incremental
cost of the next gallon

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.440
is going to be using the
marginal cost function.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.260
So for example, let's say
that this right over here,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.410
so this is our x-axis,
this is 100 gallons.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.770
And let's say this is the
next gallon, it's 101 gallons.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.765
And our cost function might
look something like this.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.230
When you calculate
C prime of 100,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.300
is going to give you
the slope at this point,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.540
is going to give you the
slope of the tangent line

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.160
at this point.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.525
That's C prime of 100.

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:32.400
So let me write this.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.984
Slope is equal to
C prime of 100.

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:39.900
And so what they really
want us to figure out,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.295
if we want to know the exact
actual cost of producing

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.550
the 101st gallon, what we would
do is we we'd say well, look,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.410
this value right over
here is C of 100.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.510
This value up here, this
value over here is C of 101.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.110
Let me do that in
a different color.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.050
C of 101.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.290
If you just want to calculate
the exact cost of producing

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.100
that next extra unit, you would
take C of 101 minus C of 100.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.180
And so that's what they want to
do next to do the exact cost.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.700
But we can approximate it
using the marginal cost,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.340
the derivative of our cost
function right at this point.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.010
We could figure out what this
slope is, C prime of 100,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.170
and then multiply it
times that one extra unit.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.020
If you take a slope and you
multiply it times-- remember,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.660
slope is change in y or
change in the vertical axis

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.160
over the change in
the horizontal axis.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.620
If you then multiply it times a
change in the horizontal axis,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.140
which in this case
is one unit, it's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.600
going to give you the resulting
change in the vertical axis.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.270
So in this first one, if
you take C prime of 100

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.850
and then multiply
that times 1 unit,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.030
so you're still just going
to get C prime of 100,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.290
you're going to get this
distance right over here,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.140
which we can view
is an approximation

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.940
for this large one.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.720
I exaggerated the difference
between this curve

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.740
and this tangent line.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.340
But let's just
actually calculate it.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.560
And I'll get my
calculator out to do it.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.380
So C prime of 100 is going
to be-- C prime of 100

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.950
is-- C prime, so it's
0.1 minus 0.002 times

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:33.634
100 plus 0.0012
times 100 squared,

00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:35.800
which is going to be 10,000,
I'll just type that in.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.910
So it's $11.90.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.800
So this is going to be $11.90.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.190
So that's this right over here.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.119
We just took this slope times 1.

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.410
We're doing one extra gallon,
and we we're getting this

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.450
approximation, which is
this distance being $11.90.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.960
Now let's actually calculate
this thing right over here.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.560
Let's see, we could
actually simplify it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.870
a little bit before I even
type it into my calculator.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.270
This expression is
going to be 3,200

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:19.120
plus 0.1 times 101
minus 0.001 times 101--

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.110
I'm going to switch colors for
contrast-- times 101 squared

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.020
plus 0.0004 times 101
to the third power.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.920
And then we're going
to subtract 3,200.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.830
We're going to
subtract 0.1 times 100.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.820
We're going to then add
0.001 times 100 squared.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.240
And then we're going to
subtract-- let me change colors

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:55.340
here-- subtract 0.0004 times
100 to the third power.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.870
So let's get the calculator
out and calculate that.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.880
So 3,200s will cancel out, so
I don't have to even type that

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.650
in.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.310
And let's see, this
is going to be-- we

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.607
could write this as 0.1
times 101 minus 100.

00:06:08.607 --> 00:06:11.190
Well, that's just going to be
1, I don't even have to do that.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.150
So this is just going to be 0.1.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:27.850
So then we're going to have
minus 0.001 times 101 squared

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.240
minus 100 squared.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:47.320
And then we have plus 0.0004
times 101 to the third power

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.760
minus 100 to the
third power, gives

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.660
us-- they said to the
nearest penny-- so $12.02.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.110
So this is going to be $12.02.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.350
So that was a pretty
good approximation

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.840
using the derivative
and multiplying

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.070
by the incremental
number of units.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.570
That was a pretty
good approximation

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.360
for the actual
difference, which was

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.270
the actual cost of producing
that next unit was $12.02.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.940
And you might say, once
again, why is it discrepancy?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.880
Remember, the marginal
cost of this derivative

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.410
is just for the
next drop, right at

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.300
that-- it's the
instantaneous rate of change.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.320
Well, each incremental drop was
getting more and more and more

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.780
expensive, because the curve
does not have a constant slope,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.310
does not have a
constant rate of change.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.980
So we use this
as, you could view

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.360
this is really a
linear approximation.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.480
And this right over
here is the exact value.
