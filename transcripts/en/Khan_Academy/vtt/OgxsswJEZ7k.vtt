00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.150
We're on problem 173.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.109
The probability is 1/2 that a
certain coin will turn up

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.780
heads on any given toss.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780
Fair enough.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.880
If the coin is to be tossed
three times, what is the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.100
probability that on at least
one of the tosses the coin

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
will turn up tails?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.140
So probability, at
least one tails.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.320
That might seem really
hard for you.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.680
How do I know which tails
it is and all of that?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
But let's think about the
opposite circumstance.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.320
This is equivalent to saying
what is the probability that I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.930
don't get all heads?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:47.980
These are equivalent things.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.850
At least one tails means that
I don't get all heads.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.240
What is the probability that
I don't get all heads?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.710
Well, that's 1 minus
the probability

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.960
that I get all heads.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.970
Figuring out the probability
that you get all

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.040
heads isn't that hard.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.450
Because you have 1/2 probability
of heads on the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.390
first time, times 1/2
probability because you have

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.020
to get a heads on the second
time, times 1/2 probability

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600
because you have to get a
heads on the third time.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.240
That's equal to 1/8.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.910
So 1 minus 1/8 is equal
to, 8/8 minus 1/8,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.110
which is equal to 7/8.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.250
So that is choice D.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.610
A lot of these probability
questions, you have to get at

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.080
least 1 of something.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.670
If you think of it that
way, it's very hard.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
You'll have to start thinking of
combinatorics and binomial

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.900
coefficients and all of that.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.950
But if you just think of the
opposite problem, what would

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.860
have to be true?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860
That I don't get all heads.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.420
What's the probability that
I do get all heads?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.880
And then that's a much easier
thing to solve for.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.540
You just take that from 1, and
you get the probability that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.560
it doesn't happen.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.290
Next question, 174.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.970
Of the final grades received by
the students in a certain

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:12.180
math course, 1/5 are A's, 1/4
are B's, 1/2 are C's, and the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.900
remaining 10 grades are D's.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.260
What's the number of the
students in the course?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.560
So if we know what fraction 10
is, then we know the number of

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.880
students in the course.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
So, essentially, what do these
fractions add up to?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.100
So let's find a common
denominator.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.460
Looks like a common denominator
between

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.300
4, 5, and 2 is 20.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.840
So, 1/5 get A's.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.200
So that's four 20's plus 1/4.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.100
So, that's five 20's
plus one 1/2.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.890
That's ten 20's.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.330
So the A's, B's, and C's are
equal to-- what is this?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.530
4 plus 5 is 9 plus 10 is equal
to 19/20 of the class.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.850
They're saying that the
remaining 10 grades are D's.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.650
So there are no F's
in this class.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.290
So the remaining grades, that's
1/20 of the class.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.290
So that's equal to 1/20.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.930
Right?

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.120
Because if the A's, B's and
C's are 19/20, and all the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.540
other grades are D's, then all
the other grades are going to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.980
be 1/20 of the class because
that's what's left over.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.790
So if I say 1/20 of the class is
equal to 10, multiply both

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.630
sides by 20.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.170
You get the class is equal
to 200 students.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.420
That's choice D.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.450
Next question, 175.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:46.560
As x increases from 165 to 166,
which of the following

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.750
must increase?

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.250
Interesting.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.080
So 1, 2x minus 5.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.680
Well sure, as I go from 2 times
165 to 2 times 166, this

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.920
is obviously going to increase,
and this is going to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.880
stay the same.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.830
So this is going to increase.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.680
You can substitute the numbers
in there if you don't believe

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.970
me, but I think that should
make some intuition.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.440
Statement 2, 1 minus 1 over x.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:27.270
So, 1/165 is greater
than 1/166.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.410
This is a larger fraction
than that is.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.005
1 over 1 million is much
smaller than 1/2.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.720
So 1/65 is greater than 1/66.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.590
So you might say, as I go from
165 to 166, this term right

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.560
here gets smaller.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.570
Right?

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.210
That term does get smaller.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.530
But we're subtracting
that term.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.260
So if we're subtracting a term
that's getting smaller, the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.740
whole value is actually
going to get larger.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.280
We're subtracting a smaller
number as we go to 166.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.770
1 minus 1/166 is a larger number
than 1 minus 1/165.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.890
So this, also, gets larger.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:19.640
Statement 3, 1 over
x squared minus x.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.380
So the question is, what happens
to x squared minus x

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.200
as we go from 165 to 166?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.170
If you think about it, we are
well beyond any type of x

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.460
squared, any kind of
vertex in this.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.070
If you know a little bit of
calculus, you could figure out

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.590
the vertex really fast. So, this
is going to be some type

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.270
of a parabola.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.180
This x squared minus
x is going to look

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.810
something like this.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.500
Right?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.930
Its vertex is actually-- 2x
minus 1 is equal to 0-- its

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.730
vertex is at x is
equal to 1/2.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.850
It's a very small number.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.190
So we're in the point
of this curve

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.250
that's increasing upwards.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.550
Right?

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.220
So when we go from 165 to 166,
this right here is definitely

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.990
increasing.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.350
This denominator is definitely
going to

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.100
increase from 165 to 166.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.270
You might say, we're
going to be

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.630
subtracting a larger number.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.140
But that's more than offset by
squaring the larger number.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.130
So this denominator is
going to increase.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.530
But if the denominator is
increasing, then the whole

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.370
fraction, which is the inverse
of the denominator, that's

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.450
going to decrease.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.410
So this one is not increasing.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.500
So, 1 and 2 only.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.750
So that's C.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.380
Next question, 176.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.630
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.980
A rectangular box is 10 inches
wide, 10 inches long, and 5

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.170
inches high.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.210
So, it's 10 inches, 10 inches,
and then 5 high.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.260
Fair enough.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.400
That's the box.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.970
What is the greatest possible
distance in inches between any

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.520
two points on the box?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.070
So, this is a bit
of an old trick.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.730
So, the longest distance in
this box is kind of a

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.420
three-dimensional diagonal.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.160
So, a normal diagonal goes
along one surface.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.230
But if you go from this point
back here-- and I'll do that

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.180
in a different color-- to this
point over here, that's the

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.840
longest dimension in the box.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.660
If you know how to figure out
distance in three dimensions,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.490
then that's all you really
need to know how to do.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.760
It's going to be the square
root of 10 squared plus 10

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.470
squared plus 5 squared.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.570
So that's the fast
way to do it.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.510
I'll show you the logic
of it in a second.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.000
So, 10 squared plus 10 squared
plus 5 squared.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.550
If we had a fourth dimension,
which is hard to visualize, we

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.220
would at that distance squared
and take the square root of

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.820
everything.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.810
So this is equal to the
square root of what?

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.390
100?

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.020
225?

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.770
225, which is equal to 15.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.980
That's choice A.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.940
Let me give you the logic.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.920
So if I'm taking the distance
from this point to this point,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.060
how do we figure that out?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.960
Well let's see, the easiest way
to think about it is can

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.890
we figure out this distance
right here?

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.590
So this is going along
the top of the box.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.840
Let me do that in the magenta.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.770
Well sure, if we look at the box
straight down, what I just

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.200
drew-- if this is 10 and
10-- what I just

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.300
drew goes like that.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.840
Right?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.030
It's going along the
top of the box.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.110
So, this is going to be the
square root of 100 squared,

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.310
the square root of 10
squared plus the

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.900
square root of 10 squared.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.080
So, this just the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.600
This distance right here is
the square root of 200.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.320
I just used the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.660
I just said this is 10, this is
10, so this has to be the

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.780
square root of 200.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.130
Now we have to do a little
bit of visualization.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.630
To figure out that green line
that's the longest diagonal in

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.470
this box, think about
it this way.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.760
We still have a right triangle
although maybe it's a little

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.410
harder to visualize.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.180
Well, maybe it isn't.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.250
So, the right triangle looks
like this, where the side is

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:11.390
the square root of 200,
that's this up here.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.000
This side right here is 5.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.800
They tell us that.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.580
So the side right here is 5.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.880
Then the diagonal that
we're trying to

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.050
solve for is in green.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.500
That's the longest diagonal.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.840
Remember this line is the same
thing, if you view from the

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.180
top, as this line.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.610
It's just that you can't
see what's below it.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.740
So here we just use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.500
So, we could say c squared--
let's call this c-- is equal

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.170
to 25 plus this squared
plus 200.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.190
Then you get to the same answer
that we just got to.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.620
So c is equal to the
square root of 225,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.700
which is equal to 15.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.770
What problem was I on?

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.310
That was choice A if I haven't
already said it.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.690
Anyway.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.530
See you in the next video.
