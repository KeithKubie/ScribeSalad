00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.730
Cross validation is a great tool, but

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.850
the typical usage of it doesn't fit
financial data applications well.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.200
The reason is that it can
permit peeking into the future.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.440
So for instance, if our training
data is after our test data

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
that means we're seeing
the future ahead of our test.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.230
Any sort of peeking like this can read
to unrealistically optimistic results,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.870
so with this sort of
data we need to avoid it.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.440
One way to avoid this problem is
with role forward cross validation.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.950
That means our training data is
always before our testing data.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.100
But we can still have multiple trials
just by rolling our data forward,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.522
like this and this and this,
till we run out of data.
