00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.660
- [Instructor] A crate of honey bees

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.750
arrived at my house by accident,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.280
so I took them immediately
to animal control.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.630
All right, so what is this pronoun, them,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.400
trying to refer to?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.740
As it might be tempting to say

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.280
that it's referring to the honey bees,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.420
but the subject of this first part,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.730
this first clause of the
sentence right over here,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.950
they didn't say honey
bees arrived at my house,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.460
they say a crate of honey bees.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.090
So the subject here is actually singular,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.580
it's a crate, a crate.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.900
This right over here is singular.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.830
So when we use the pronoun,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.400
we also want the singular form.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.233
You could try it out

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.680
by replacing it with the
word that it's referring to.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.880
A crate of honey bees arrived
at my house by accident,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.760
so I took the crate
immediately to animal control.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.970
So instead of the crate,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.260
I wouldn't say them, I would say it.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.350
I would replace the plural pronoun

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.320
with the singular, with
the singular pronoun.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.900
So I took it immediately
to animal control.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.430
This is a very, this is one

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.450
that'll, will trip many
people up many times

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.190
because you see a singular thing

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.920
that contains many things,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.090
and so you might say,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.040
okay, well there, I'm talking
about a lot of honey bees,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.460
so I wanna use plural.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.410
Well, that would be the case

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.550
if we just said, honey bees

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.030
arrived at my house my accident,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.820
so I took them immediately
to animal control.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.976
That would actually be okay.

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.450
But we're not talking
about honey bees arriving,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.670
we're talking about a crate,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.680
one crate of honey bees arriving.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680
So the pronoun here is referring

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.930
to that one crate,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.633
so it should be it.
