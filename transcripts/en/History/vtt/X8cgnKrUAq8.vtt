00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.710
NARRATOR: The 1941 bombing of
Pearl Harbor by the Japanese

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.710
was one of the most devastating
attacks on American soil.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
But just a few decades earlier,
Japan and the United States

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
were allies in World
War I. So how did

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.960
things get so bad between them?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.460
It all comes down to oil.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.330
To explain, we need
to go all the way

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.580
back to the 19th century.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.250
Once an isolated nation, Japan
underwent a makeover of sorts

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.000
to compete with the West.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.580
Known as the Meiji Restoration,
it embraced industrialization,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.420
built up its military, and
restored Japan's emperor

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.670
as the powerful head of state.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.750
Aided by two successful,
wars Japan aggressively

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.580
expanded its empire.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.580
The Japanese were becoming
an imperial superpower

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.250
until the Great Depression hit.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.500
You see, Japan is
an island nation

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.750
with few natural resources.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.000
So it depends on
international trade

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.920
to keep its economy afloat.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.000
The economic crisis
put a stop to all that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.710
Japan was in a bind.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.460
So its military leaders, who
called the shots at this point,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.290
decided the best defense
against financial ruin

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.120
would be a good offense.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.790
They would invade nearby
China, particularly Manchuria,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.580
for its plentiful resources like
iron, soybeans, and land, lots

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.080
and lots of unsettled land.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.880
So what does this all have
to do with the United States?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.120
Well, the US was a
longstanding Chinese ally.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.460
And it watched uneasily
from the sidelines

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.540
as the two nations
clashed in the 1930s.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.710
But America wanted nothing
to do with another war,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.710
so it just denounced
Japan's aggression.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.460
Tensions rose in 1937,
when Japan invaded

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.750
the Chinese city of Nanjing.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.670
In doing so, they attacked
an American gunboat, killing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.330
three and wounding dozens.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.920
Disturbing images coming
out of war-torn China

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.500
further swayed American
opinion against Japan.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.170
In response, America
attacked Japan's resources.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.790
They imposed economic
sanctions of aircraft,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.670
scrap metal, and other items
crucial to Japan's military.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.080
The US hoped the sanctions
would stop Japanese expansion.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.170
But Japan doubled down, invading
French Indochina in 1940,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.790
and then teaming up
with Germany and Italy.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.250
Why those two countries?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.620
Because like Japan,
they were controlled

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.670
by militaristic governments
obsessed with conquest

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.000
and driven by a deep
sense of nationalism.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.210
The final straw
came in July of 1941

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.290
when President Franklin
D. Roosevelt announced

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.790
a trade embargo on oil.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.460
An oil shortage was
an absolute disaster

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.540
for Japan, who relied on
imports for 90% of its supply.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.290
Not only would this destroy
the Japanese economy,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.460
but it would put its military
at a literal standstill,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.380
which meant no more expansion.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.540
Japan resented the
US for meddling

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.880
in its quest to dominate Asia.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.210
The only solution left for
the Japanese was total war--

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.120
crush the US fleet
in the Pacific

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.170
and then occupy Southeast
Asia and claim its resources.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.210
And so on December 7, 1941,
Japan launched its surprise

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.540
attack at Pearl Harbor.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.330
[sirens]

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.920
At first, it seemed like
a win for the Japanese,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.750
destroying or damaging 21
US ships and more than 300

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.420
aircraft, and killing
around 2,400 soldiers,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.750
sailors, airmen, and civilians.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.040
But the success was short-lived.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.580
The United States declared war
on Japan on December 8, 1941.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.250
Not long after, the Japanese
would realize the mistake

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.080
it made at Pearl Harbor.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.750
Their bombers had failed
to deliver a mortal blow

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.670
to the Pacific
fleet, missing oil

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.500
tanks, ammunition sites,
repair facilities,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.830
and aircraft carriers.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.620
Just six months later,
remnants of the US fleet

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.880
would score a key
victory against Japan

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.880
at the Battle of
Midway, turning the tide

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.290
of the war against the
once mighty Japanese.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.250
