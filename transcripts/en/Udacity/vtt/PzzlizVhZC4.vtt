We've talked a lot about different
monetization strategies in your game,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.950
but one more thing to consider is
how to make money outside your game.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.623
So how can you generate
alternate streams of revenue?

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:13.640
&gt;&gt; Well,
you can create physical products.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.450
Things like t-shirts or toys that
have your game characters on them.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.808
&gt;&gt; I've even seen games that sell
their own merchandise in their stores.

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:24.895
I've seen t-shirts like you
mentioned and even phone cases.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.540
Games can promote their own merchandise
by putting it in a game store or

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.410
even displaying their own ads.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.720
&gt;&gt; Merchandise can get be a great way
to monetize if you have a big fan base.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.980
&gt;&gt; Companies like Amazon offer an easy
way to create and sell merchandise.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.790
For example,
Merch by Amazon is an on-demand

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.542
service that let's you sell t-shirts
with your apps logo on it.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:49.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so as you're building
your game, keep in mind

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.110
that you aren't limited to end game
purchases and ads to make money.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.280
There are many other
innovative options out there.
