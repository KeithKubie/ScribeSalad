00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.240
This is going to be a very bad film.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.740
It will teach you nothing.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.620
You'll wonder at the end where those few minutes of your life have gone.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.600
You'll feel bitter, resentful, and increasingly furious.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.240
Now, that's a tiny example of what pessimism can do for you.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200
It prepares you for the worst,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.820
reduces the tension of expectations,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.320
protects you from disappointment, and might even make you laugh a bit.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.920
It should be a recipe for life.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.540
We live in an absurdly and painfully optimistic world.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.160
Mostly, that's the result of all the businesses out there trying to sell us things.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.240
And, understandably, using cheerfulness to do it.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.960
And partly, it's the influence of technology,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.900
which is always getting better, coloring our view of life as a whole, which often, isn't improving.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.460
In the process, we've lost sight of the wisdom of seeing the glass half empty.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.980
For centuries, religions peddled dark messages.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.580
Buddhism told its followers that life was suffering.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.420
Christianity spoke of the fallen state of mankind and of the inevitability of earthly imperfection.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.320
It was helpful: it kept our expectations in check.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.620
The psychologist, William James, came up with an equation:

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.640
Happiness equals expectations over reality.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.500
So, there are two ways to ensure contentment.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.980
Change reality, or, change expectations.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.660
Pessimists know to reduce the expectations.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.860
Good pessimists rehearse some key lessons to themselves every day:

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.880
Life generally goes wrong.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.520
Everyone is worried and sad most of the time.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.460
It's normal to have very big regrets around careers.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.600
The only people we can think of as "normal" are people we don't yet know very well.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
It's hard to be happy for more than fifteen minutes.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.100
Almost all your hopes are going to be dashed.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160
Mediocrity is the norm.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.900
Today, however grim, will probably be one of those days you end up looking back on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.800
and wondering why you didn't appreciate more fully.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.780
That's how much worse it will eventually get.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.400
Don't think of us pessimists as grim;

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.300
the gap between what should be and what is can be filled with laughter,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.380
a generous laughter, but one of certainty that today will go wrong,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.500
tomorrow will probably be even worse, until the worst of all happens.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.160
But that's okay.
