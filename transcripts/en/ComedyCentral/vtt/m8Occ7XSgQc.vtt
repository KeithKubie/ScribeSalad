BESPECTACLED TEENAGER.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.277
IT'S A HARD WORD,
"BESPECTACLED."

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.679

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.185
UH-OH, A WHITE LADY.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.186
A WHITE LADY
GETS ON THE BUS.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.487
THE WHITE LADY'S LIKE,

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:25.292
HEY, YOU GUYS HAVE TO MOVE,

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.394
CLAUDETTE'S FRIENDS LEAVE,
BUT CLAUDETTE STAYS,

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.396
AND IS LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT,

[bleep] YOU.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.702

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.471
WHITE LADY'S LIKE,
I WILL NOT HAVE A SEAT.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.640
THE BUS DRIVER'S LIKE,
I'M GONNA GET THE COPS.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.475
SO THE COPS ARE LIKE, MOVE.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.343
CLAUDETTE'S LIKE,
I SHALL NOT BE MOVED,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.979
AND THEY DRAG HER
OFF THE BUS.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.649
THE ONLY THING SHE KNOWS
TO DO IS TO GO,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.450
IT'S MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.421
AND THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S 1955,
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO [bleep],

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.622
SO [bleep] YOU.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.759
CLAUDETTE'S LIKE,

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.327

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.263
I'M SORRY I BURPED,
BUT I'M NOT SORRY!

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.965
SO WAIT, WHAT?

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.134 line:0%

IS FLOODED WITH LETTERS SAYING,

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.605 line:0%
 
CLAUDETTE COLVIN IS SO BRAVE,
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.607
AND THE PERSON
WHO READS THESE LETTERS,

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:17.244
THE SECRETARY OF THE N.A.A.C.P.,
ROSA PARKS.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.646
ROSA PARKS GOES

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.849
AND IS LIKE, CLAUDETTE,
YOU'RE THE [bleep].

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.584
CLAUDETTE'S LIKE,
I [bleep] KNOW.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.220
I'M THE ONE WHO GOT MY ASS
DRAGGED TO JAIL.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.255
AND THAT'S HOW THEY REALLY
CONNECT AND BECOME FRIENDS.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.725 line:0%
 
SO, WHENEVER SHE'S
AT AN N.A.A.C.P. MEETING,

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.728 line:0%
 
SHE SPENDS THE NIGHT
AT ROSA PARKS' HOUSE.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.265 line:0%
 
AND ROSA PARKS IS LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GREAT.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:39.533 line:0%
 
CLAUDETTE COLVIN IS LIKE,
YOU'RE GREAT.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.736 line:0%
 
THEY REALLY CONNECT.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.306 line:0%
 
TIME PASSES, AND E.D. NIXON,

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.642 line:0%
 
THE PRESIDENT OF THEIR LOCAL
CHAPTER OF THE N.A.A.C.P.,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:52.713 line:0%
 
IS LIKE, WE NEED
TO START A BUS BOYCOTT,

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.349 line:0%
 
AND THIS BUS BOYCOTT
WILL START A REVOLUTION.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.684
WE SHOULD USE
CLAUDETTE COLVIN'S ARREST

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.854
AS A REASON TO BOYCOTT
THE BUSES.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:01.855
PEOPLE WILL GET BEHIND HER.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.223
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE,

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.627
OH, BUT NOT WHITE PEOPLE,
BECAUSE SHE HAS DARKER SKIN,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:11.298
AND WE CAN'T HAVE A 15-YEAR-OLD
AS THE FACE

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:14.101
OF THE ANTISEGREGATION MOVEMENT,

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.504
BUT WE CAN HAVE ROSA PARKS
AS THE FACE OF THIS MOVEMENT.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.207
SO IT'S AT THAT TIME

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:25.712
THAT ROSA PARKS SITS DOWN
IN THE WHITE SECTION OF THE BUS

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.781
AND GETS TAKEN OFF TO JAIL,

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.552
BUT SHE HAD TO ACT LIKE,
OH, I WAS JUST TIRED.

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.720
AREN'T I NOT THREATENING,
WHITE PEOPLE?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.657
AND THEN WHITE PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
OH, SHE'S JUST TIRED.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:39.960
WE'RE EATING THIS UP.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.095
OKAY.
[laughs]

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.732

HYPERAWARE THAT, LIKE,

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:49.837

COULD BE ON NATIONAL TV.
