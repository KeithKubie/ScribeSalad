00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.310
We're asked to solve
the proportion

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.670
8/36 is equal to 10/n.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.740
So we need to figure
out what n is.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.580
And the easiest way to do this
is to multiply both sides of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.630
this equation by both
denominators.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.520
So if we multiply both sides
of this equation by

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.990
n, what do we get?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.020
The whole purpose of doing that
is so that this n in the

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.270
denominator will cancel out
with this n, which is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.310
essentially in the numerator.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.810
You can view this as n/1.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.620
So if you do that, the left-hand
side of our equation

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.660
becomes 8/36 times n, or you
can even view it as 8n/36

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.430
because you can really
do this as n/1.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.200
So the left-hand side
becomes 8n/36.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.610
And then that will be equal
to 10/n times n/1.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.590
This n and that n cancel out,
and you're left with

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.690
10/1, or just 10.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.880
Now we can multiply both
sides of this equation.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.130
To really get rid of that 36
in the denominator, we can

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.090
multiply both sides by 36, or
you can imagine, by 36/1.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.120
Either way.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.470
36/1 is the same thing as 36.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.140
This 36 cancels out
with that 36.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.580
And on the left-hand side, we
have 8n, and on the right-hand

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.080
side is equal to 10
times 36 is 360.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.260
Now to solve for n, we can just
divide both sides of this

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.040
equation by 8.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.970
So if you divide that side by
8, and that side by 8, the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.080
left-hand side, the 8's will
cancel out, and you are left

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.590
with n is equal to 360 divided
by 8, and then we can figure

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.880
out what that actually is.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.990
8 goes into 360.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.835
So 8 is divisible not into
3, it's divisible

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:01.110
into 36 four times.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.520
4 times 8 is 32.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.680
Subtract.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.540
6 minus 2 is 4.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.169
3 minus 3 is nothing.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.000
Bring down the 0.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
8 goes into 40 exactly
five times.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.860
5 times 8 is 40, and then
you have no remainder.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.930
So n is equal to 360/8, which is
the exact same thing as 45.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.270
So going back to our original
proportion, we now solved for

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:39.270
n, and we know that 8/36 is the
same exact thing as 10/45.
