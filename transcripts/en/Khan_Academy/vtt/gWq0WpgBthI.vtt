00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:01.920
All right.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.930
We're on problem number five.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.052
OK, problem number five.

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:17.170
If m to the x times m to
the 7th is equal to 28.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.800
They also tell us that m to the
5th, and then that whole

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.700
thing to the y power, is
equal to m to the 15th.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.236
What is the value of x plus y?

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:31.872
x plus y equals what?

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.710
So this is really just a test
of whether you know your

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.100
exponent rules.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.680
So what is m to the x
times m to the 7th?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.670
So your temptation might have
been to say 7x, but no.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.970
Remember, when you multiply two
numbers of the same base,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.620
and the base is m, you
add the exponents.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.020
So it's m to the x plus 7.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.280
And they actually wanted to
tempt you to do 7x because

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.940
they actually use the number 28
here, which is a multiple

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.540
of 7, so they were tempting
you to do 7x.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.820
But we know that you add the
exponents when you multiply m

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.860
to the x times m to the 7th.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.060
And so we have m to the x times
m to the 7th-- oh sorry,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.105
I wrote it down wrong.

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:12.080
It equals m to the 28.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.990
Sorry, well you knew that.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.935
Anyway, m to the x times m to
the 7th is equal to m to the x

00:01:16.935 --> 00:01:21.280
plus 7, and that equals
m to the 28.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.660
So the exponents have to equal
each other, so x plus 7 is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.860
equal to 28.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.060
x is equal to 21.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.340
Now let's go here.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.950
Here we have m to the 5th,
and then we're raising

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.080
that to the yth power.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.240
So here we actually would
multiply the exponents, if you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.800
remember your exponent rules.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.160
So you have m to the 5y is
equal to m to the 15th.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.610
So 5y must equal 15.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.710
5y is equal to 15,
y is equal to 3.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.820
So what's x plus y?

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.280
It's 21 plus 3, which
equals 24.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.670
And that is choice d.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.920
Next problem.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.070
Looks like there's going
to be some drawing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.676
for Sal in this problem.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:20.160
I'll try my best. Oh, I thought
I was using-- undo.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.250
Edit undo.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.770
I thought I was using
the line tool.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.510
OK.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.880
That's my y-axis, draw
a straight line.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.570
I drew a straight line.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.270
That's my x-axis.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.540
And then what do
they have here?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.730
They have 19-- let's see,
1985, '86, '87,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.300
'88, '89, then '90.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.240
Let's see, 1985 is, maybe,
looks about 148,000.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.450
So if this is 150,000,
1985 is here.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.710
Let me just draw it all out.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.540
1985, then 1986 is up
here at 160,000.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.096
This is 140,000.

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:13.436
soon.

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:17.370
So 1986 is up here at 160,000.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.280
1987 is a little bit less, 1987
looks like about 150,000,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.340
I don't know, eyeballing
it at 156,000.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.870
1987 is here.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:44.270
1988 looks like a little
bit above 140,000.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.410
1989 is between 130,000
and 120,000.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.950
All the work here is drawing
what you hopefully already

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.430
have in your book.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.080
So where was I?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.390
Oh sorry, this is 1988.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.120
1988 was a little bit
better than 140,000.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.710
Ignore that one.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:09.620
1989 looks like about 126,000.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.310
Then 1990 is, I don't know,
112,000 or something.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.184
1990 is out here.

00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:23.350
And then if I were to connect
the dots, look

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.600
something like that.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.540
And then let's read
the question.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.890
According to the graph above,
which of the following is

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.280
closest to the decrease per year
in the number of homes

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.610
sold between 1987 and 1990.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.890
So we're talking about from
1987, so it's from

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.410
this year, to 1990.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.220
So how much did we decrease
in the first year, right?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.070
The first year we decreased
by this much.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.600
And I'm going to look in the
book because I don't know how

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.700
well I drew this graph.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.910
But in 1987, it looks like
we're about 156,000.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.950
And then as we go to 1988, it
looks like about 142,000 just

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.620
eyeballing it, right?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.180
So this distance right
here is what?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.710
It'd be 156,000 minus 142,000.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.010
About minus 14,000, right?

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.966
That's how much we changed
over this one year.

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:32.860
And if I look at the choices,
there already is choice c,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.920
which is 14,000, but let
me just do one more

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.460
just to make sure.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.180
So if we want to figure out from
1988 to 1989, so we said

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.080
1988 is at 142,000,
where is 1989?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:59.310
Looks like 128,000, I
would say 128,000.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.270
And so 142,000 minus 128,000,
that's also 14,000.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.060
And if we do the last one,
that's 128,000, and then this

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.110
looks something about
114,000 right here.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.660
So this is also 14,000.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.450
So the answer is c, 14,000.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.520
Next problem.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.770
Problem 7.

00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:30.450
you Here we have this diagram
that shows up actually a lot

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.675
when you're taking the SAT.

00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:34.510
I'll show you why.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.110
This is a very common
thing you'll see.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.335
A line like that.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.790
A line like that.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.986
And then they connect it here.

00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:50.465
Now let's read the problem.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.560
I already have suspicion what
they're going to ask.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.080
So this is a, b, c, d, and e.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.390
They tell us this is
perpendicular.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.910
This is perpendicular.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.090
This is x.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.020
This is y.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:18.190
In the figure above, ae and cd
are each particular to ce.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.450
Fair enough.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:26.920
If x is equal to y, the length
of ab is 4, and the length of

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.460
bd is 8, what is the
length of ce?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.250
So we're trying to figure out--
let me draw ce, let's

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.860
have our gold in a different
color-- we're trying to figure

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.950
out this line right there.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.700
And one thing I didn't write,
they told us x is equal to y,

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.700
so immediately that should
hit a trigger.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.510
x is equal to y and this is a
90-degree angle, so we know

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:56.490
that x plus y plus 90 is equal
to 180, or that x plus y is

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.300
equal to 90.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.960
And if they're equal to each
other, x must equal y, which

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.310
equals 45 degrees, right?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.510
So this is 45, this is 45, and
if y is 45, what is this angle

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.240
going to be?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.280
Well it's opposite to y, so this
will also be 45 degrees.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.760
And this is a right angle too,
so 45 plus 90 plus this angle

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.800
has to equal 180, so what's
this angle going to be?

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.270
Well, that's also going
to be 45 degrees.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.420
This also has to be a
45-45-90 triangle.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.010
If you ever see a triangle where
one of the angles is 90

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.650
and the other is 45, the other
one has to be 45 because they

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.530
add up to 180.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.199
And what we want to figure
out is this length here.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:39.330
So I'm going to show you a
little trick, and this trick--

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.190
well, it doesn't always work,
it's not really a trick, it's

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.800
just a visualization exercise,
really-- we say, we want to

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.750
figure out this length.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.690
Well that length, I'm going to
say-- I'm going to make the

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.250
claim, and I think you'll
believe this claim is the same

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.130
is this length, I'm essentially
creating a

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.920
rectangle-- is the same
as that length, right?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.750
So if we figure out this length,
we solve the problem,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.760
this light brown length.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.170
And we also know-- let
me draw the bottom--

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.610
do we know the length?

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.460
Actually, we don't even have
to know this bottom line.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.180
We don't know the length
of that bottom line.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.410
We need to figure
out this length.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.690
We know since this line is
parallel to this line.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.820
We know this is a
90-degree angle.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.740
Well, do we know
the hypotenuse?

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.280
Sure.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.120
The hypotenuse is 4 plus 8,
it's this big red line.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.880
And let me draw the hypotenuse
in a different color.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.090
The hypotenuse, right here,
that's the hypotenuse.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.790
Actually, I'm running out of
time, so I'm going to continue

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.490
this in the next video.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.740
