so right now it's it's really early

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:07.939
so right now it's it's really early
 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.860
so right now it's it's really early
crude technology and it is impossible to

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870
crude technology and it is impossible to
 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.949
crude technology and it is impossible to
fully capture the full human experience

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959

we can't yet inhabit someone else's body

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490
we can't yet inhabit someone else's body
 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.330
we can't yet inhabit someone else's body
we can't take a perspective from behind

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340
we can't take a perspective from behind
 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.429
we can't take a perspective from behind
their eyes we can get very close to that

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439
their eyes we can get very close to that
 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.759
their eyes we can get very close to that
but right now it's still a your head is

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769
but right now it's still a your head is
 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.609
but right now it's still a your head is
in the VR world and nothing else you're

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
in the VR world and nothing else you're
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.070
in the VR world and nothing else you're
able to look around but as we get more

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080
able to look around but as we get more
 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.560

hand tracking body tracking your body

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570
hand tracking body tracking your body
 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.440
hand tracking body tracking your body
will start to feel like it's in VR so

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450
will start to feel like it's in VR so
 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.790
will start to feel like it's in VR so
then how do we get to the point where we

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800
then how do we get to the point where we
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.860
then how do we get to the point where we
can actually inhabit someone else's view

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870
can actually inhabit someone else's view
 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.650
can actually inhabit someone else's view
or a different species or a different

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660
or a different species or a different
 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.880
or a different species or a different
plant or even a solar system things that

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890
plant or even a solar system things that
 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.430
plant or even a solar system things that
were just not possible so I think right

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440
were just not possible so I think right
 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.670
were just not possible so I think right
now there is this limitation in just the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680
now there is this limitation in just the
 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.619
now there is this limitation in just the
amount of throughput of pixels that you

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629
amount of throughput of pixels that you
 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.389
amount of throughput of pixels that you
can display on the screen we know we

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399
can display on the screen we know we
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.660
can display on the screen we know we
need probably a hundred x the amount of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670
need probably a hundred x the amount of
 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.330
need probably a hundred x the amount of
data flowing through our optic nerves to

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340
data flowing through our optic nerves to
 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.850
data flowing through our optic nerves to
get closer to how much information we're

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
get closer to how much information we're
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.140
get closer to how much information we're
taking in with our eyes in the real

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150
taking in with our eyes in the real
 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.780
taking in with our eyes in the real
world now we know that the audio has to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790
world now we know that the audio has to
 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.960
world now we know that the audio has to
be far more fluid and far more tracked

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970
be far more fluid and far more tracked
 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.940
be far more fluid and far more tracked
to how we're moving our heads to have

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
to how we're moving our heads to have
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.179
to how we're moving our heads to have
that accurate spatial soundscape but

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189
that accurate spatial soundscape but
 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.859
that accurate spatial soundscape but
then you know even if all of those

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869
then you know even if all of those
 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.749
then you know even if all of those
things are real even if you're wearing a

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759
things are real even if you're wearing a
 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.450
things are real even if you're wearing a
full haptic suit and the touch was right

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
full haptic suit and the touch was right
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
full haptic suit and the touch was right
and the smell was right and maybe there

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
and the smell was right and maybe there
 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.859

was a way to do taste you're not

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869
was a way to do taste you're not
 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.010
was a way to do taste you're not
actually feeling the emotion of someone

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
actually feeling the emotion of someone
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.960
actually feeling the emotion of someone
else that's not something that you can

else that's not something that you can
 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.130
else that's not something that you can
inject but you can invoke it and this is

back to our natural ability to empathize
and you can look across species of

and you can look across species of
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.289
and you can look across species of
different animals and they exhibit

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299
different animals and they exhibit
 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.090
different animals and they exhibit
empathy it's something that's not unique

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100
empathy it's something that's not unique
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.340
empathy it's something that's not unique
to us and it's something that you know

we can foster and cultivate we can train
we can improve it or we can be trained

we can improve it or we can be trained

we can improve it or we can be trained
not to use it we can be cold competitive

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229
not to use it we can be cold competitive
 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.620
not to use it we can be cold competitive
but there is this ability and it's

but there is this ability and it's

we're able to put ourselves in
 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.770
we're able to put ourselves in
situations that require us to resonate

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
situations that require us to resonate
 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.840
situations that require us to resonate
emotionally with someone else and then
