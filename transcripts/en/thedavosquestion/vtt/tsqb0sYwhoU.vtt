Olivier: Hello YouTube, I'm Olivier Piou,
CEO of Gemalto, here in Davos.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.089
Actually in regarding the state of the Economy,
I'm much more bullish than many of the doom

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.970
and gloom around.
I believe that all the doom and gloom is lead

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.160
by mostly a happy few.
In fact, the economy which is you know all

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.930
of us working in the field, whether we are
in the [inaudible] or [inaudible].

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.020
Whether we are in large countries, we are
not that much touched by the explosion of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.890
hedge funds or so.
So yes there is a tough time to come in, but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.260
we should not fall into the fear of the crisis.
It will hit us, but it's not gonna hit as

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.390
many of us, and I see it as intense, but short.
