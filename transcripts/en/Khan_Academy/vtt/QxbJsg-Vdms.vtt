00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.720
Let's take the
derivative with respect

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.570
to x of x to the n
plus 1-th power over n

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.460
plus 1 plus some constant c.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.210
And we're going to
assume here, because we

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.420
want this expression
to be defined,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.490
we're going to assume that
n does not equal negative 1.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.740
If it equaled negative
1, we'd be dividing by 0,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.724
and we haven't defined
what that means.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.140
So let's take the
derivative here.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.500
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, the derivative of x

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.800
to the n plus 1
over n plus 1, we

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.120
can just use the
power rule over here.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.580
So our exponent is n plus 1.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.360
We can bring it out front.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.870
So it's going to be n
plus 1 times x to the-- I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.160
want to use that same color.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.260
Colors are the hard part--
times x to the-- instead of n

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.944
plus 1, we subtract
1 from the exponent.

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:55.110
This is just the power rule.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.790
So n plus 1 minus
1 is going to be n.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.970
And then we can't forget that we
were dividing by this n plus 1.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.629
So we have divided by n plus 1.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.600
And then we have plus c.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.300
The derivative of a constant
with respect to x-- a constant

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.050
does not change as x
changes, so it is just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.250
going to be 0, so plus 0.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.740
And since n is not
equal to negative 1,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.860
we know that this is
going to be defined.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.630
This is just going to
be something divided

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810
by itself, which is
just going to be 1.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.420
And this whole thing
simplifies to x to the n.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.170
So the derivative of
this thing-- and this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.140
is a very general terms--
is equal to x to the n.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.390
So given that, what is
the antiderivative-- let

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.050
me switch colors here.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:48.230
What is the antiderivative
of x to the n?

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.090
And remember, this
is just the kind

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.619
of strange-looking
notation we use.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.160
It'll make more sense when we
start doing definite integrals.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.120
But what is the
antiderivative of x to the n?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120
And we could say the
antiderivative with respect

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.590
to x, if we want to.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.255
And another way of calling this
is the indefinite integral.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.090
Well, we know this
is saying x to the n

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.752
is the derivative of what?

00:02:11.752 --> 00:02:12.960
Well, we just figured it out.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.120
It's the derivative
of this thing,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.911
and we've written it
in very general terms.

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.580
We're actually encapsulating
multiple constants here.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670
We could have x to
the n plus 1 over n

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.300
plus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus
2, plus pi, plus a billion.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.140
So this is going to be equal
to x to the n plus 1 over n

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.110
plus 1 plus c.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.920
So this is pretty powerful.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.920
You can kind of view this
as the reverse power rule.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.560
And it applies
for any n, as long

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.500
as n does not equal negative 1.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.750
Let me make that very clear.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.590
n does not equal negative 1.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.310
Once again, this thing
would be undefined

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.120
if n were equal to negative 1.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.720
So let's do a couple
of examples just

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.050
to apply this-- you could
call it the reverse power

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.330
rule if you want, or
the anti-power rule.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.730
So let's take the antiderivative
of x to the fifth power.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.574
What is the antiderivative
of x to the fifth?

00:03:13.574 --> 00:03:15.240
Well, all we have to
say is, well, look,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.950
the 5 is equal to the n.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.610
We just have to increment
the exponent by 1.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.280
So this is going to be equal
to x to the 5 plus 1 power.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.772
And then we divide
by that same value.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.980
Whatever the exponent was
when you increment it by 1,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.229
we divide by that same
value, divided by 5 plus 1.

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.770
And of course, we
want to encapsulate

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.810
all of the possible
antiderivatives,

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.770
so you put the c
right over there.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.380
So this is going to be equal to
x to the sixth over 6 plus c.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.210
And you can verify.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.370
Take the derivative of
this using the power rule,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.830
you indeed get x to the fifth.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.560
Let's try another one.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.010
Let's try-- now
we'll do it in blue.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.540
Let's try the antiderivative
of-- let's make it interesting.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.290
Let's make it 5 times x to
the negative 2 power dx.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.710
So how would we evaluate this?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.290
Well, one simplification
you can do--

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.420
and I haven't rigorously
proven it to you just yet--

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.180
but we know that scalars
can go in and out

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.804
of the derivative operator when
you're multiplying by a scalar.

00:04:18.804 --> 00:04:23.140
So this is, indeed, equal to
5 times the antiderivative

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.605
of x to the negative
2 power, dx.

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.710
And now we can just use,
I guess we could call it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.960
this anti-power rule,
so this is going

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.840
to be equal to 5 times x to
the negative 2 power plus 1

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.310
over the negative 2 power plus
1 plus some constant right

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.320
over here.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.010
And then we can rewrite this as
5 times negative 2 power plus 1

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.340
is x to the negative 1
over negative 2 plus 1

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.330
is negative 1,
plus some constant.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.570
And this is equal to 5 times
negative x to the negative 1

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.540
plus some constant.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.110
And then if we want, we
can distribute the 5.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.820
So this is equal to negative
5x to the negative 1.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.340
Now, we could write plus
5 times some constant,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.460
but this is just an
arbitrary constant.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.102
So this is still just
an arbitrary constant.

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:22.560
So maybe we could
[INAUDIBLE] this.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.809
If you want it to show that
it's a different constant,

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.370
you could say this
is c1, c1, c1.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.210
You multiply 5 times c1,
you get another constant.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.304
We could just call that c,
which is equal to 5 times c1.

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:35.220
But there you have it.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.640
Negative 5x to the
negative 1 plus c.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.190
And once again, all of these,
try to evaluate the derivative,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.550
and you will see that you
get this business, right over

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.100
there.
