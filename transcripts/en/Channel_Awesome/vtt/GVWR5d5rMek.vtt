00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.440
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.780
Having done this for 10 years now, you realize that over time, different things become nostalgic.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.700
That's why I'm staring off this Nostalgiaween by asking the question...

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.220
Is this a thing?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.360
I-I-Is this--

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.700
It's a thing.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.400
In 2004, Cartoon Network premiered an hour-long special called The Scary Godmother,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.800
based on the popular kids' book by Jill Thompson.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.980
And that's all I know about it.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.620
But you millennials kept shoving it in my face, I had no choice but to review it!

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.100
I have no idea if this is remembered fondly, not fondly, or caused flame wars tearing families apart.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.160
A strange part of me hopes for the latter.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.800
All I know is that people really want me to review it, so that's what I'm gonna do.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm going into this completely blind with no clue what to expect.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.000
So let's...

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200
pun about the special I haven't seen yet here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.100
This is Scary Godmother.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.760
As the credits roll, we open to an egg-shaped moon.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.700
*gun cocks* 
I'm opening fire if this is a Howard the Duck spinoff!

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.900
And we see the film has an... interesting style, to say the least.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.720
OK, am I the only one who thought her boobs were about to shoot me?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.300
She moved like the T-1000's nipples were gonna open fire.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.940
*gun shots*

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.680
DAAAH!

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.200
Yeah, by this point, you're probably thinking, "It's so nice they finally did a kid-friendly version of the Walking Dead games."

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.520
But this does create an immediate problem.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.280
And actually, it CAN be compared to the Walking Dead games.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.960
Both are adaptations of drawn works,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.880
which they're trying to combine with computer animation, while still trying to simulate hand-drawn lines.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.500
I suppose this can work. I mean, it's worked OK in other projects.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.960
But here's the problem.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.040
Walking Dead knew the characters in the foreground had to have black lines, and the backgrounds had to be smooth and blurred,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.540
a tradition done for years so characters in the foreground are the focus.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600
But here, the CHARACTERS are the ones who are smooth and blurred and the backgrounds have the lines.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.380
Because of this, everybody looks like the Sunday Afternoon painting,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.200
like they're demanding a movement for..... movement.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.800
It's a little odd to say the least.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.500
Katie: Daryl, are you a piece of candy?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.920
Daryl: Yeah! Cool, huh?

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.240
NC: Kid, you're scary just the way you are.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.100
Your sunken-in dot eyes are gonna haunt my nightmares.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.780
This is Katie and Daryl.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.740
They're waiting on their friend Bert to show up to go trick-or-treating.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.400
Daryl: Got enough room in your trunk for all the candy we'll get?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.660
DO YOU HAVE-

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.580
Bert: Lemme roll down the window.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.280
Ah, that's better.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.440
Daryl: Sweet ride!

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.240
NC: Lame joke and weird segue, but sweet ride!

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.240
Last but not least, their friend Jimmy shows up.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.540
Jimmy: Speak of the devil, and the devil shall appear!

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.580
RAWR!

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.620
Daryl and Bert: Cool!

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.700
NC: (as Daryl) That almost made me grow irises in my pupils!

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.500
God, early CGI is scary!

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.860
Jimmy's forced to bring his cousin Hannah along, who--

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.480
AAAH!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.000
FULLY-DEVELOPED EYES!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.800
ABOMINATION ON THIS WORLD!!

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.700
Jimmy: We become monsters, surging forth and--

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.600
Hannah: AAAH!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.200
Jimmy: AAH!

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.320
Hannah: Monsters!

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.340
NC: Oh, no, you turned Hannah into a malfunctioning Chuck E. Cheese animatronic!

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.800
Jimmy: What the heck were you shining that dumb thing around for?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.820
Daryl: Flashback?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.060
Bert: Flashback.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.580
Daryl: Are you anxious to get outside with all the monsters, pumpkin?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.240
NC: Huh?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.600
Katie: We both know Katie will look out for her.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.020
Daryl: I trust that Daryl.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.680
Katie and Daryl: Don't worry, pumpkin!

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.380
NC: I have...

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.620
no frame of reference to what you're doing now.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.040
You're parents?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.960
How does this work?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.760
Jimmy: Ding-dong.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.400
Katie: Katie will protect you from the monsters.
Daryl: Daryl will protect you from the monsters.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.820
Hannah: Monsters?!

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.400
Jimmy: Ding-dong!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.980
Ding-dong!

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.140
DING-DONG, ALREADY!!

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.560
NC: C'mon, it's Party Quirks.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.420
Answer the door so Colin can perform!

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.240
Katie: Don't worry, honey.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.300
If you get frightened, Jimmy's promised to take care of you.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.060
Hannah: OK, Mommy.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.780
Bye!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.680
Hey, Jimmy, wait up!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520
NC: Why are you cutting back to me like I should have a joke?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.940
I don't even know what the hell just happened!

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.040
Jimmy: OK, here's the plan.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.600
We're gonna ditch Hannah.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.580
All: *gasp*

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.320
NC: The devil takes many forms!

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.060
Jimmy: We'll scare her and she'll run home and we can do what we want, OK?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.380
Daryl: Well, she is kinda slow.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.500
NC: We did convince her we were her parents,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.320
and she might still be under that assumption.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.100
They agree to scare her by forcing her to go inside a house they say is haunted.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.200
Hannah: Anyone?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.860
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.760
NC: D'ABUDUBUD'AAH!

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.220
Hannah (slow-mo): AAAAAAAAAAA--

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.140
NC: Why does the animation in this always move like it wants to eat me?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.080
Hannah (slower): AAAAA--

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.820
NC: AGAHGAHAD'AAH!!

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.360
Hannah: *crying*

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.640
But the Scary Godmother arrives to raise her spirits.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.040
With that freaky entrance, all she's gonna raise is my blood pressure.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.460
Scary Godmother: Boohoo!

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.320
*fake crying*

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.980
Hannah: Why are...

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.760
Why are you crying?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.200
NC: (as SG) Because I turned down Magic School Bus to be in this.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.940
I totally could've been Miss Frizzle!

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.640
SG: I like the sound of "booing".

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.440
Boo-hoo-hoo.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.460
*laughs*

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.500
NC: She takes her on an adorable kidnapping to her home, apparently in another dimension.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.000
SG: There we go!

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.340
What do you think?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.000
NC: (as Hannah) It's whimsically...

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.600
(normal) ...similar to everyplace else?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.560
She introduces Hannah to her broom-mate, Skully,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.180
presumably voiced by John Waters.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.560
Skully: Oh, my, Scary Godmother!

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.440
Sorry to be so late, but I just had to get these old bones bleached for the party.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.420
NC: I'm just kidding.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.200
John Waters WISHES he could be in something this kitsch!

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.860
Skully: It is the spookiest phantom fest in the whole realm!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.160
Everyone'll be there.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.800
It's practically a who's boo of monsters! *chuckles*

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.140
NC: (as Skully) Just putting it out there, guys:

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.080
"BOO" is like half of our jokes.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.240
Skully: Boo are you?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.260
SG: Hannah, this is Mr. Pettibone.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.480
He's our official skeleton in the closet.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.220
NC: PFFFFFHT!

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.500
Skully: I work in the closets of all the old houses, keeping their secrets--

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.920
NC: YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! YOU KNOW *EXACTLY* WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.260
Hannah: Does everyone have a skeleton in their closet?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.280
Skully: Almost everyone, little miss.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.880
NC: (as Skully) The ones who are brave enough to experiment!

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.100
Skully: When it comes to Halloween night, I love nothing more than to roll the bones at a good party!

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.500
NC: (as Skully) "Roll the bones" will have a COMPLETELY different meaning when you get older!

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.720
(normal) There are so many of these jokes, guys!

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.240
NC: The Godmother uses her incredible magic to make the place even MORE...

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.900
...mildly impressive...

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.460
...as guests begin to show up.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.300
Oh, and if there's any doubt it's THAT kind of party,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.020
just take a look at guest #1.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.840
Harry: Where are those wonderful smells emanating from?

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.220
The goody plate, I believe.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.720
OW!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.080
Skully: NO! Down, boy!

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.820
No more until everyone else shows up.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.400
Harry: Ooh, you'll be lucky if I don't bury your femur in the backyard, you scoundrel!

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.880
NC: And they said they couldn't bring Will and Grace back.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.500
So the werewolf confuses Hannah for an actress from one of his favorite shows.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.300
It's...

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.640
...as funny as that sentence I just said.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.100
SG: This is not Ophelia Saint--

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.740
SG: This is not Ophelia Saint--
Harry: Oh, I am such a huge fan of the show.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.720
Harry: Oh, I am such a huge fan of the show.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.180
I must know every single line from every single episode!

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.140
NC: GAH!

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.520
Why does everyone come up to the camera like they're Slenderman?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.500
*creepy static*

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.020
Except in this one, you don't die; you're instead given a short about how to make cracker sandwiches.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.100
Because that's the next logical step to take in this story!

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.040
The Voldemort family show up and almost confuse who the appetizers are for, and...

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.700
are.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.420
SG: Help yourselves to the food.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.720
*HISS*

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.160
Hannah: Scary Godmother!

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.140
SG: Oh, no!

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.880
This is my FRIEND!

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.200
Vampires: Oh!

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.100
NC: How adorable!

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.580
Why don't you befriend one of the people who was gonna devour you?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.140
Orson: Are you a real human?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.880
Hannah: Yeah, but... you're just a kid.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.100
Orson: So are you!

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.360
Hannah: Do you go to school?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.760
Orson: Sure, night school.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.420
NC: Do these kids have their own solar system?

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.140
What's with the orbiting around them?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.920
The party continues, as the werewolf seems to chat too much, annoying the vampires.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.580
Count Maxwell: Look deeply into my eyes.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.400
Harry: Okay!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.340
Cound Maxwell: Cease your chattering and sleep.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.500
Harry: Sleep?

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.900
On an empty stomach?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.400
But I--

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.360
NC: Oh, good God. He broke his neck.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.260
*neck crack*

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.620
NC: While also seeing Slenderman.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.440
*creepy static*

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.400
Actually, the vampire just puts him to sleep.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.780
However, Hannah is dead awake at the reveal of their next guest.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.760
Hannah: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.740
Bug-a-Boo: If I start scaring kids after hours, I'm gonna put in for overtime.
Hannah: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.020
NC: (as Bug-a-Boo) I'd join the pterodactyls from Flintstones in turning to the right and saying a joke to nobody.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.660
(normal) She learns to get used to him, though, as the kids, back at the house,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.820
are waiting really too friggin' long to not realize something is up!

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.280
What do you expect when this is how they entertain themselves?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.180
Bert: Door is ajar.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.900
Door is ajar.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.380
Door is ajar.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.320
Jimmy: Will you STOP THAT?!

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.360
Bert: Please fasten your safety belts.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.880
NC: I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's tasted toilet water.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.440
Jimmy: Why isn't she screaming yet?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.980
Hannah: *scream of delight*

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.460
NC: Oh! It's because she's turning into Annabelle.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.340
At this point, nothing would surprise me.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.740
Daryl: NOW what are we gonna do?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.820
We've practically missed Halloween.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.920
NC: (as Daryl) I mean, what are we supposed to do? Go in and get her?!

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.360
Who wrote us?

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.600
(normal) But we have no time for that.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.560
We have to vote on who we think should be the leader of the group!

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.220
Jimmy: Who wants Bert for leader?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.400
NC: Okay, Ridley Scott's Alien would be even creepier if that was the face.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.660
Daryl: That's one vote for everyone.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.120
Bert: I demand a recount!

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.040
Daryl: That's still one vote for everyone.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.960
Bert: Recount!

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.620
Daryl: That's one vote for everyone.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.580
Bert and Jimmy: Recount!

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.560
Daryl: That's one vote for everyone!

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.200
Bert and Jimmy: Recount!

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.620
NC: Okay, looks like we're gonna be here for a while, folks.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.560
I'm gonna go grab a beer.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.720
I suggest you do the same.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:17.780
♪ *NC theme* ♪

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.100

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.460
NC: Oh!

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.400
That was good.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.660
Anyway, where were we?

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.300
Bert and Jimmy: Recount!

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.500
NC: Abraca-fast-forward!

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.340
So, after that essential arguing, they decide to just sit around and do nothing.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.400
You sure we're not watching American politics?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.040
Back at the party, all sorts of amazing things are happening,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.060
like the vampires talk about anxiety,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.440
the werewolf overeats,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.960
and they decide to order pizza!

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.960
They sure are putting the "dead" in dead party, aren't they?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.980
Harry: I'll phone this in.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.300
NC: Like you haven't already?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.880
Let's go check on the unlikely possibility that there's more interesting conversations with the kids.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.160
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House!

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.020
Bert: We're gonna be in so much trouble.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.840
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.960
NC: You just said that.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.400
Katie: What if she never comes out?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.820
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.520
NC: Are you TRYING to drive us insane?!

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.080
Jimmy: Would you stop it?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.420
NC: No, please don't interrupt him!

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.720
I'm pretty sure he was gonna say something about Hannah, the Spook House, and the believability of her being in there!

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.760
NC: How'd it go again?

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.240
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.280
NC: YEAH, THAT'S IT!
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.160
Daryl: I can't believe you left Hannah in the Spook House.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.040
It goes great with the multiple rock-paper-scissors AND multiple shoutings of "recount"!

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.380
All that's missing is Doctor Strange coming out saying he wants to bargain!

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.980
What is your goal, you time pocket of madness?!

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.960
Daryl, Katie and Bert: *panicking*

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.460
*triple smack*

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.520
Jimmy: Have you all gone crazy?!

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.740
NC: Is there a limit to how many times I can say yes?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.920
This better be followed by a funny moment, or I'm gonna shove a candy apple up somebody's rectum.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.840
SG: $200 in pizza?

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.100
Delivery Skeleton: Of course, you could of...

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.540
(demonic) SIGNED FOR IT.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.800
SG: Uh... no.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.500
NC: You got lucky.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.320
Looking for money to pay for the pizza,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.920
they sneak up on Bug-a-Boo to see if he sat on any money in a sequence I know can't be taken any wrong way.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.100
Bug-a-Boo: Oh!

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.500
*laughing*

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.940
NC: Someone's been to too many of Skully's parties.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.420
Count Maxwell: So other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the show?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.220
*crickets chirping*

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.760
NC: Strange enough that there's a Lincoln assassination joke in this,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.340
but to have that classic followed up by crickets?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.720
Ain't none of you know good comedy!

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.440
Hey, Dracula!

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.100
Tell your version of "The Aristocrats"!

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.220
After making friends with everyone,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.400
Hannah and the monsters decide to go back home and get revenge on the kids that left her.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.680
Vampires: *hiss*

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.680

Gang: *screaming*

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:03.880
*smack*

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.820
NC: Wow, not very often you see a room with six fireplaces.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.500
No wonder nobody lives in this place! The fire codes are shit!

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.100
Hannah pretends to save them, though, as the monsters act like they're afraid of her light.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.260
SG: Here, Hannah.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.900
Hannah: Will I ever see you again?

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.240
NC: (as SG) Only in the scars of your repressed memories.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.100
So that was The Scary Godmother. I...

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.140
...can see why people remember it.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.600
It's pretty awkward, clumsy and all over the place, but...

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.260
...then again, it's clearly meant for little kids.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:39.200
There is enough creativity in the ideas and some of the designs that, I guess, it's innocent enough.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.580
Definitely won't hold any adults or older kids' attention, but for younger children, it's totally fine.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.800
Not a classic, but a serviceable little special to show tiny ones on Halloween.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.000
Take it for what it's worth.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.140
I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.240

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.840
*sigh*

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.640
It's been a very painful month for a lot of people.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.200
Uh, as you can probably guess, once more I don't need to show any clips, because.....

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.400
you've seen all the terrible things that are happening in Puerto Rico.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.680
Uh, you know that they need so much help right now,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.920
and I know the past couple... Charity Shoutouts, I haven't needed to show any clips,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.540
because, like I said, just... Mother Nature has really been brutal, and, uh, so many people are suffering for it.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.760
So... definitely... go check out the link below, and see if you have anything you can give,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.640
because these people really, really need it.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.840
And just so much devastation is happening down there to so many good people, and it's just not deserved.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:32.020
So if you can definitely go click on the link, even the smallest amount can go a long way.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.540
So definitely go take a look and see what you can do.

Thank you so much again.
