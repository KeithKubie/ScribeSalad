00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.900
 Now that we have covered the main factors of immunology 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.840
 What I would like to do 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.060
 In this video, a summary of these factors is worked up 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.510
 I showed the interaction between these immune factors 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.650
 That person or person we have been exposed to 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.770
 B cells, which I always draw in blue 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.550
 What distinguishes these B cells is 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 Its walls or membranes associated with antibody antibodies, where 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 Each B cell whose wall is connected to its modified (assigned) 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.770
 So this B cell will be so 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 If you want to draw another B cell here, I will draw 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.440
 The replaced part is slightly different color 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.780
 Therefore, different B cells will respond 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 For different antibodies 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.640
 Which enters the device 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:05.590
 The B cell becomes effective 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.445
 When linked 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.370
 The pathogenic factor in the existing receptor 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.863
 On the wall of the B cell 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.890
 But this is not the end of the story
