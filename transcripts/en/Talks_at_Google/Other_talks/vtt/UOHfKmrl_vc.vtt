&gt;&gt;Hi everyone, and thanks again for coming
to another Authors@Google

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.870
event from the San Francisco office.
Today we're very pleased to welcome Stephen

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.260
Elliot to San Francisco.
Stephen's a novelist.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.700
He's written seven books, one of which includes
his most recent book,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.519
"The Adderall Diaries," which he'll be talking
about today.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.310
His novel "Happy Baby" was the finalist for
the New York Public Library's Young Lion Award,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.600
as well as Best Book of the Year in Salon.com,
Newsday, Chicago Newcity, the Journal News,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.739
and the Village Voice.
Stephen's writing has been featured in Esquire,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.850
the New York Times, the
Believer, GQ, Best American Non-Required Reading

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.030
for 2005 and 2007.
Best American Erotica and the Best Sex Writing

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.640
in 2006.
He is -- he was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.739
Stanford University, and is
a member of the San Francisco Writers' Grotto.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.080
And he's also the editor of the Rumpus.
Please welcome Stephen Elliot.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.649
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: I wonder -- I wonder if it's
possible to convince

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.480
people to move up a little bit.
And, like, sit over here, maybe.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.530
So we can have a little more of a conversation
going on.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.750
[PAUSE]
I thought -- so I'll talk a little bit about

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.880
my book "The Adderall
Diaries," which you all get for free.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.790
Which I think is just -- it takes so much
pressure off of me.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.900
I've been on this crazy book tour.
I've been in 33 cities, and I did this thing.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.490
You guys can copy this if you want for your
marketing strategy.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
I let anybody that wanted to read a copy of
the book get an advanced

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.000
copy for free.
They just had to forward it within a week

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.410
to the next reader.
So 400 people signed up for that.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.900
The early reviews are really strong, and I
was encouraged to do a

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.760
bigger book tour.
And -- but I didn't want to, really.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.862
I mean, because it's my 7th book.
And I know what it's like to show up in a

00:02:04.862 --> 00:02:09.970
small town, and do a reading
in the nice local bookstore to ten people,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.420
and then sleep in a crappy
hotel.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.740
And it's just very lonely.
And it can be soul crushing even.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.780
So instead I sent a note to those 400 people,
and I said I would do a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.610
reading in their home.
Anybody who wanted me to do a reading in their

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.930
home, I would come, and
I would sleep on their couch.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.610
And I would read to their friends.
And they would have to promise to get 20 people.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.319
And so that's what I've been doing.
I've been crossing the country reading to

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.250
groups of 20 people,
generally none of whom have heard of me.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.700
Because it's like the person that's invited
me to their home has heard of me and read

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.600
the book --
It's not somebody I know but it's somebody

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.511
that read the book.
And I'm just reading to their friends.

00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.080
Their friends are just coming to a party at
the house, and they tend

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.300
to stay until one in the morning -- cause
nobody leaves a reading in a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.670
home.
It's a party, kind of.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.271
And I think, I'll never have stage fright
again, you know?

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:05.830
Cause I'm selling books like Tupperware to
people I've never met.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.420
And I'm stuck there.
I can't leave.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.500
I got to sleep on their couch.
And so, to read to a audience of people that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.050
already has the book.
And I don't have to sell you the book.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.100
Well, I'd like to convince you to read it,
and maybe get an extra copy

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.700
to give as a Christmas present.
But I feel like the pressure is kind of off.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.820
So this is a story that in a way, there is
actually an intersection

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:38.080
with Google in a way.
Because, the book -- I'll give a brief description.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.590
I had had, like, writer's block for a year
and a half, two years.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.420
And I've always written.
I've written since I was like 10-years old.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.480
And I would write to communicate.
I used to write poems.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.180
When I was literally 11-years old, I had poems
wallpapering my room.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.690
I was in this, you know -- my mother was dying.
It was a very abusive home.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.790
And then, eventually the State took custody
of me.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.160
And I was in group homes, and I would just
write poems and stories all

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.010
the time.
And I've always written to communicate.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.790
And then I got this really bad case of writer's
block which I think was

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.410
partly, was in part because I had started
making a living as a writer.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.039
Which was -- and so now those expectations.
And I don't know how to do that.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.620
It wasn't something I had ever set out to
do.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.249
So I just started, after a year, two years,
I went back on Adderall

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:33.949
which I had taken when I was younger.
You guys know what Adderall is?

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.130
It's like ritalin.
It's an ADD medication.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.229
It's basically pure amphetamine but we prescribe
it to young children.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.700
And I just started documenting going back
on Adderall.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:53.639
Right about that time, Sean Sturgeon confessed
to eight and a half

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.419
murders.
How many people here know who Sean Sturgeon

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.480
is?
See, you don't know who he is because there

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.210
was a gag order.
I'm going to tell you, Sean Sturgeon is best

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.839
friends with Hans Reiser,
who was on trial for murdering his wife Nina

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:19.059
Reiser.
Hans Reiser created a file system for Linux,

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:24.719
which he, in fact, came to
Google and did one of these presentations

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:32.439
about his file system.
And so that's the intersection with Google

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.250
and the file system.
Have you heard of the Hans Reiser trial?

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.229
That was a giant trial, right?
Wired blogged it.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:48.819
So Nina left Hans for Sean.
And they couldn't find the body.

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:55.379
And Sean confessed to eight and a half murders.
And so, so you would think that he would be

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:56.629
a suspect.
And, of course, he was.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:02.849
He was investigated pretty extensively.
And there was a gag order on that so that

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.190
the Chronicle couldn't write
about it.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.819
One second.
And then, Sean and I had -- our lives had

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.779
overlapped quite a bit.
We knew a lot of people in common.

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:21.569
And in 1999, I'd done a bondage photo shoot
in his apartment which he

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:27.689
had rented out to professional dominatrices
as dungeon space.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:33.069
And I won't even go into all the details.
But, our lives, we had, you know, really overlapped

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.009
quite a bit.
And so I started looking into that.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:42.539
And that led me to the Hans Reiser trial.
And that's the book, kind of.

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.159
But there's quite a bit more, actually.
Turns out in 200 pages you can fit a lot.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.159
You have a question?

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:50.599
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what's a half a murder?

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.669
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: Half a murder?
Well, originally, I thought he didn't know

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.319
if the person was dead.
But when I actually got the confessions -- when

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:05.229
I got the entire
investigation into Sean Sturgeon, it turns

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:11.129
out the half murder is --
was that he didn't know if she was dead when

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.460
he found her or if he
killed her.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.229
So it's the first murder, when he was very
young.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.210
So, that's -- so Sean Sturgeon was kind of
the untold story.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.379
Ultimately this book, though, you know, it's
not about Sean Sturgeon.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:33.869
And it's not really about Hans Reiser, either.
It's really there is a full, the full Hans

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:37.990
Reiser story is in this book
and there is a full true crime book within

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.719
The Adderall Diaries.
But really it's a memoir.

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:46.189
And more specifically it's really a book about
writing and being a writer.

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:52.129
And the file system turns out to be a really
potent metaphor.

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:56.789
Because the file system is really the most
human part of the computer.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.870
It's the identity of the computer.
Cause it's how the computer organizes its

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.789
memories.
And that's who we are.

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:08.569
You know, we're a series of memories and interpretations
of those

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:14.080
memories.
So I thought I'll read just -- I'll read kind

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.719
of that part, maybe,
where I first find out about Sean's confession.

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:21.889
And I'm going to read, I'll read one short
section.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:25.619
Then we could do some Q&amp;A if you guys have
any questions.

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:30.009
And then I'll read another section and then
we can do a little more

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:36.419
Q&amp;A.
So this section should take about eight minutes.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.800
The morning the after the fight, I get a call
from Josh, a staff writer

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.160
at Wired magazine.
He's working on a profile of Hans Reiser,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.380
a brilliant computer
programmer accused of killing his estranged

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.410
wife.
I helped Josh track down Hans' former best

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:58.250
friend, Sean Sturgeon.
Sean and I have several girlfriends in common,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.440
and I once did a bondage
photo shoot in his apartment when he wasn't

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.720
home.
When I say girlfriends, I don't mean that

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.970
we were engaged with the same
women just that we knew, we had girls who

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.649
were friends.
Legally, since this is being videotaped I

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:17.899
should be clear about this.
I don't remember ever meeting him.

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:23.380
But our paths have crossed so many times it
almost doesn't make sense.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.970
Josh's calling to say he found out something
incredible about the case.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:35.139
Your guy Sean just confessed to eight murders,
maybe nine.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:40.240
Why maybe nine?
He isn't sure if one of the victims is dead.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.100
Josh says Sean's not under arrest and he's
refusing to tell the

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.160
district attorney the names of the people
he killed.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.360
Sean told Josh that he confessed to D.A. because
he's a born again

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.170
Christian and thought the jury would want
to know.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.980
It seemed the right thing to do or rather,
he posited the question --

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.529
don't you think the jury would want to know?
But then he said Hans knew about his murders

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:07.800
and he was confessing in
order to beat Hans to the punch.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.100
Maybe he confessed for both reasons.
Or maybe he confessed for reasons that had

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.190
nothing to do with Reiser or
the jury.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.790
He denied having anything to do with Hans'
wife disappearance.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:26.290
He told Josh give me some Sodium Pentothal
or any truth serum, put a

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.110
little bit of Ecstasy in there and ask me
if I've killed Nina.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.450
I have never been a threat to her.
Josh told the police and the district attorney

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.120
that his victims had
physically and sexually abused him and his

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.920
sister in the East Bay
commune where they were raised.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:49.139
He claimed he hadn't killed anyone since 1996.
The commune interested me.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:53.330
I know the places where adults come in conflict,
or -- I know the

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.730
places where the adults come in contact with
unsupervised children.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.680
Between 14 and 18, I was in five different
state-funded childcare

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.529
facilities including three group homes, a
mental hospital, and a

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:08.300
temporary youth shelter that stuffed 30 children
into each room.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.040
In those places, you can never tell who to
trust.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.850
When I'm done talking to Josh, I feel like
I'm waiting for something.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.690
The group homes were a long time ago.
It's still morning, and I put a pot of water

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.009
on the stove.
I call Josh back and ask him for Sean's phone

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:28.440
number.
If Sean committed eight murders, it's a huge

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.639
story.
I think, here is a man willing to wait eight

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:37.650
years, willing to wait
years, to get revenge on the people who stole

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.100
his childhood.
I think of In Cold Blood and the Executioner's

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.949
Song.
Two of my favorite books, both set around

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:48.410
spectacular murders and
written by novelists.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:53.230
I know people who have known Sean for more
than a decade.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.689
I have the inside track, and there's something
else about the case.

00:11:56.689 --> 00:12:01.970
Nina Reiser's body was never found.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:06.139
I don't know if Sean will talk to me.
If he did kill eight people, surely the police

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:08.589
would have arrested him
by now.

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:12.899
And why isn't he a suspect in the disappearance
of Nina Reiser?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:17.339
After calling Sean and leaving a message I
bicycled through the city

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:22.490
down Market, toward the Castro, my right pant
leg rolled up so as not

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:28.079
to get caught in the chain.
My bicycle is my prize possession, an old

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:33.329
Peugeot I picked up for $150 nine years ago.
I live a spare existence.

00:12:33.329 --> 00:12:36.290
I haven't owned a car since I first got to
this city.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.420
I cut right past the Gay and Lesbian Center,
the Three Dollar Bill

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.420
Cafe.
Something is tugging on me.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.709
I had heard of Nina's murder.
But never the full story.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:50.600
I'd heard about Sean and how Nina's disappearance
crushed him.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.170
He took to bed, paralyzed with grief.
He was in love with his best friend's wife.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.920
It was all just passing information.
But eight murders?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.990
Revenge killings?
Eight murders isn't revenge.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:10.069
Eight murders is a serial killer.
I go to the park to meet a girl I know.

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:13.769
Someone who has taken a habit of coming to
my readings.

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:17.600
She's engaged and lives with her fiance between
the Marina and Russian

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.320
Hill.
I've only seen her once before and she explained

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.939
their relationship.
It was simple.

00:13:23.939 --> 00:13:30.850
He was monogamous and believed in monogamy.
She cheated on him and always would.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.939
She arrives --
It's very San Francisco, I think.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:39.569
She arrives wearing a black dress and sandals.
Her skin is so pale all I can think of is

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.999
milk.
I don't think of my complicity in her unfaithfulness.

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:45.199
I don't want to.
I don't love her.

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:49.490
She's just someone I know.
I wait as she walks across the grass in her

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.319
sandals.
A man stops her and asks if she is willing

00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:54.879
to be in one of his
paintings.

00:13:54.879 --> 00:14:00.050
She talks with him for a moment.
Her head turned his way, her body pointing

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.399
toward me.
He doesn't have any paint.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:07.019
He wears dark, heavy clothes, his belongings
bound in garbage bags

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:10.550
around him.
The sun is brilliant and the colorful houses

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.819
are brightly lit along the
hills.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:17.040
On some days, the fog catches on their drainpipes
like cotton, but

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.529
today it's easy to see why people want to
live here.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:26.949
Easy to see San Francisco for the gentle paradise
it is.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:32.649
We lie in the grass with my shirt pulled up.
I forget all about the De La Hoya's fight

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:34.089
and Sean Sturgeon's
confession.

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:37.480
I ask her to pinch my nipple and she does.
But it isn't enough.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.810
I asked her to do it harder and soon there
is blood everywhere.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.610
There are people nearby but they don't seem
to notice.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.170
For most of it, she keeps her hand over my
mouth and I close my eyes

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.180
and drift away.
It's okay, she says.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.629
That's only half the day.
There's a barbecue and then a reading.

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.480
And then a party.
There's always a party.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.120
I dance with a girl.
How do you know Eric, I ask between songs.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.160
I don't, she says, my boyfriend knows him.
I dance better after that.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.780
It's still a weekend, after all.
It's still San Francisco.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.999
Everything is beautiful.
Really, it seems perfect.

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:16.249
The DJ looks like Napoleon Dynamite and spins
pop songs from the 80s on

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.680
vinyl.
I'm 35 years old.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.269
The woman I'm dancing with has curly black
hair and moves with steady

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:25.499
grace, her silk dress rolling in waves down
her arms.

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:29.600
I feel loose and fine.
I take five dollars from another writer who

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.720
put his money inexplicably
on De La Hoya.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.050
Always bet on youth, I tell him.
It's one in the morning.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.329
I don't imagine anything can ever go wrong.

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:43.129
So that's -- that's that section.
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:52.050
I keep a little timepiece over here so I know
where we're at.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.310
Questions on anything?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:01.589
&gt;&gt; I'm curious in general how much of this
book is -- is it all

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:06.249
nonfiction or is any of it artistic liberty?

00:16:06.249 --> 00:16:13.499
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: No.
Well it's all nonfiction.

00:16:13.499 --> 00:16:20.980
I don't take artistic liberty.
Let me read the disclaimer, how about that.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.200
There's a disclaimer.
You know, a book, when you write a -- you

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.810
know, a memoir is an exercise
in kind of a radical honesty, you know.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:38.720
You have to be willing to, like, explore yourself
and really question

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.329
your own motivations.
If you're really trying to write and create

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:45.129
a work of art you shouldn't
know where you're going.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:49.740
If you know the answers already, you know,
then why bother?

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.949
Why bother writing it?
So you find out things.

00:16:54.949 --> 00:17:02.519
But of course, you know, when people -- people
in the same room having

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.459
the same experience will remember them -- these
things differently.

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:11.790
You know a lot of the book concerns my father.
And, you know, I had left home very young

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.620
and we were at odds over what
had happened.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.760
You know, he would leave bad reviews of my
books on Amazon.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.990
We had a toxic, toxic relationship.
There's a copy of one of those reviews in

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.970
the book.
Cause I would write books set in group homes.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:30.550
And that would make him look bad.
And, you know, I remembered being an abused

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.450
child and leaving home.
He had a memory of a spoiled son who could

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.020
have come home anytime he
wanted.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:42.360
So ultimately I had to -- I had to accept
that his memories were valid,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.380
you know.
They're valid because it takes -- to lie requires

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.820
intent.
You know you can't, you have to, you can't

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.550
accidentally lie.
You can be wrong.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:57.210
But the rule of a memoir is you can't intentionally
lie.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:03.630
But -- there's this idea of a truth, you know,
it's very fluid.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.730
You know, do you remember that?
Is that your interpretation?

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:15.880
I would never present, like, a false conclusion.
Like, for example, there's a fair amount of

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.920
the book that's dealing with these romantic
relationships where I'm unable to achieve

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.011
a solid,
stable romantic relationship.

00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:30.990
And it would work so well narratively, if
I just finished the book with

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.950
and then, you know, I met a nice girl we moved
in together and we

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.411
figured it out.
But that's not life, you know.

00:18:36.411 --> 00:18:41.770
Things don't wrap up that easily.
I know someone who did a memoir like that.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.300
And now the book's coming out a year later,
and she's already broken up

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.570
with the guy.
You know, you don't want to do that.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.940
So that's what I mean by like a radical, kind
of, a radical honesty.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.630
You have to be open to things but here's the
disclaimer.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.990
This is a work of nonfiction.
Situations may have appeared in other works

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.840
in different forms and
slightly -- and significantly different context.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.960
Characters are not conflated.
So characters are not combined into one character.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.142
Events are sometimes presented out of sequence
but timelines are not

00:19:11.142 --> 00:19:14.500
intentionally altered.
Many names and details have been changed to

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.140
protect identities.
So that's -- you know, that's really significant,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.050
of course.
Much is based on my own memories and is faithful

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.320
to my recollections
but only a fool mistakes memory for fact,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.870
you know.
One more thing about honesty, you know, I

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.410
think of it as, like, you
know when you you're in your early 20s, and

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.740
you break up --
You have this relationship and it ends because

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.990
that person lied to you
or because you lied to them.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.821
I mean everybody had that relationship in
their early 20s.

00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.090
Either you were the liar or you were lied
to.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:52.150
But then later you realize that nobody lied
to anybody.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.190
You didn't, you just didn't know yourself
well enough to be honest.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.150
You didn't know yourself well enough to present
what you wanted and

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.720
ask for it.
And so the other person felt lied to because

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.440
they thought you had
hidden your desires but actually you just

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.220
didn't have the necessary
self-knowledge.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.360
And that's the thing about the memoir.
It's not about -- it's not about just not

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.880
lying, you know.
It's more about finding out these things,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.630
knowing yourself well enough
to be honest.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.540
I mean that's the challenge of the memoir.
That's was a long answer.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.571
But there you have it.
Any other questions?

00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:27.570
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.050
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: I did read The Night of the
Gun by David Carr.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.900
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]
[PAUSE]

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:44.060
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: It's really interesting.
The thing about The Night of the Gun by David

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.670
Carr, this memoir that came out last year.
This comes out a lot.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:52.130
This really fun and interesting memoir.
And I loved it.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.890
He interviews all of his friends.
And basically uses their quotes to tell his

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.131
story.
The problem is The Night of the Gun -- and

00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:03.100
this is not David Carr's
fault, but it's everybody else's fault.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.090
People say, "This is the new memoir.
This is how you write something true."

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.530
But it's not more true.
In fact, it's less true.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.710
I mean, nobody remembers your life better
than you do.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.770
And if you interview all of your friends and
use their quotes you could

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:25.210
create anything out of that.
Your friends actually -- my friends don't

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.940
remember me as a coward.
You know, I have to admit to being a coward

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.580
to doing the wrong --
You know, your friends don't think of you

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.920
that way.
You know, if I want I could interview all

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:45.550
my friends and present this
very happy and, you know, strong person.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.180
I could, I could present you with an entirely
different person all

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.330
through quotes.
And I've done a -- I've done a series of interviews

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.320
with my friends.
I mean, it's good to interview people and

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.510
they spark it.
I had been doing this project called on oral

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.520
history of myself where I
interview at length people that I grew up

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.220
with, with a lot of them
because it was group homes.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.550
So some of the places I was in it was like
30 guys to a room.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.110
And I interview them.
The stories they remember, you know, they

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.160
remember us getting in fights
together like back to back like Batman and

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.520
Robin.
You know, people do not -- your memories are

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.840
more true for your
experience than their memories are.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.820
You know, and the author really has to be
the one taking the hard look.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.860
Nobody else was paying as much attention to
you as you were paying to

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.170
yourself.
You know, so it's not, it's just not more

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.060
true.
It's an incredibly compelling book and really

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.770
well written.
But I don't think that that's a good model

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.710
in terms of like a more true
memoir.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.470
Cause it's not more true.
But it's super fun to read.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:57.110
It's extremely well-written, you know.
Any other questions?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:05.230
Okay.
Maybe I'll -- see how much time I have.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.582
Maybe I'll just read one more section cause
this section will take

00:23:09.582 --> 00:23:12.610
about 12 minutes.
And then we can -- well, maybe I'll read two.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:18.350
We can do some more questions after this.
But this -- this is from the verdict which

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.120
is not the end of the book
by a long shot.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.300
So don't worry about that.
Because ultimately the book is about a lot

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.551
more than the Hans Reiser
trial.

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:33.750
You're too late, a woman tells me, on the
first floor of the

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.090
courthouse.
It's one of the producers from 20/20.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.490
She's pregnant with twins and she's waiting
near the information desk.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.380
Oh, again, this is like 12 minutes I said
already?

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:49.570
I like to -- so everybody can kind of -- expectations.
She hoping to catch some jurors on their way

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.590
out.
I bolt up the stairs and emerge from the 5th

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.100
floor stairwell into a
scrim of boom mikes and tripods.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.160
The vestibule is packed to the walls with
local and national media

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.550
outlets.
In the short hallway to the restroom, the

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.660
video techs are replaying the
verdict on the double monitor.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.300
The on-air talent are already relaying their
stories back to the

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.880
viewing audience, the cameraman wrangling
long coils of electrical

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.890
cord.
I crouched beneath the water fountains near

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.460
the machine where the
professionals re-dub Beta tapes.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.360
And there are agreements already in place
between broadcasting

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.290
companies for pool cameras.
The producers are whispering trying to keep

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.922
secrets from each other.
The union crews hustle to stay busy and earn

00:24:35.922 --> 00:24:39.200
a spot on the next job.
I'm thankful for their monitors.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.480
Two small screens sitting on top of the series
of beams with wheels

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.650
full of media decks, cassettes popping out
like toaster waffles.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:51.200
It's the first time Goodman has allowed cameras
in his courtroom.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.560
One of the -- one in the front row of the
gallery, another from the

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.180
witness stand staring at all the participants.
I ignore what's going on around me and focus

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.600
instead on the screen.
Inside courtroom nine, every seat is taken

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.170
and a large crowd stands
back near the doors.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.220
The bailiffs make no move to clear people
who were enable to find

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.390
seats.
Hans, DuBois, and Hora sit at the long table

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.590
in the center.
DuBois is sad.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.750
His cheeks seeming to slide from his jaw.
Eyes drawn and bewildered.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:29.040
He knows the jury is coming back too soon.
Hans looks like he was yanked out of bed,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.530
the top button undone on his
shirt.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.580
His thick red tie hanging loosely from his
collar, begging to be

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.370
tightened.
He leans toward DuBois, whispering in his

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:44.440
ear as the jury files behind
them, settling into two rows of seats out

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.510
of view of the cameras facing
the accused.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:53.360
Juror Number One is chosen as the foreman.
I remember him listening closely during Cory's

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.040
testimony nodding and
encouraging the boy smiling thoughtfully as

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.950
the child squirmed
uncomfortably on the stand.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.700
He gives the bailiff a note, which the bailiff
then walks over to Judge

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.190
Goodman.
The Judge opens the envelope, reads it, hands

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.250
it back to the bailiff.
The bailiff returns the note to the foreman.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.880
Does that -- does that represent your true
and final verdict, Goodman

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.260
asks.
Each jurors says yes in their turn.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.540
Murder in the first degree, premeditated with
malice.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:34.721
[PAUSE]
Bailiff, remove Mr. Reiser, remove Mr. Reiser

00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:39.420
from the courtroom.
I shift from one leg to another while watching.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.330
There's commotion behind me, heels clicking
rapidly against the

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.820
linoleum.
But on the screen is the court is stunned

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:52.250
silent.
"I've been the best father I know how," Hans

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.720
says.
He has more to say but he doesn't get a chance.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.980
The bailiff taps him on the shoulder, grips
his arm at the elbow and

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.780
wrist, pulls him from the room.
He will no longer be granted the courtesy

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.240
of the accused.
The holding cell door closes in front of Hans,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.240
his mouth still open.
The Judge thanks the jury for their service.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.830
The camera focuses on Paul Hora leaning back
of the table, folding his hands together.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:26.200
DuBois shuffles a folder under a briefcase.
I watched the verdict again but now from another

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.470
angle.
The view from the witness stand, each juror

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.160
answers affirmatively.
This case has aged DuBois.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.280
He's a highly regarded defense attorney.
And I've come to like him immensely even if

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.650
I never believe a word he
says.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.700
The camera drops to an empty trash bin beneath
the table, a bag folded

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.010
loosely around its rim, then rises again to
his face.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.440
Then Hans -- Hans looks stunned as the clerk
reads,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.880
"We the jury find the defendant guilty of
murder on or about September 3, 2006, in the

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:06.080
County of Alameda, Hans Reiser did, and with
malice, murder Nina Reiser."

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:12.280
"I've been the best father I know how."
The bailiff stands ready behind Hans, taps

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.420
him on the shoulder, leads
him forcefully from the room.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.560
Can you rewind, I say.
Play it again.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.500
There are press conferences.
DuBois promises appeals.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.270
Hora says justice has been served.
The jurors slip out a side door.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.560
Late in the afternoon, the building is mostly
empty.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.400
I look in on courtroom nine.
Boxes of tape, documents, and displays sit

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.240
at the front of the room.
The jury hardly requested any of it and now

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.840
it will have to be stored
somewhere.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.410
The transcripts of phone calls Hans made to
his mother, and pleading

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.200
voice mails left for Nina, the photographs
of Nina and the children,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:52.760
and her blood sprayed across the beam.
Swabs, DNA lab results, recordings, videos,

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.480
maps charting Hans' routes
through the East Bay as he tried to evade

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.720
the police.
Receipts for a water pump, for books about

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.540
murder, testimony from
social workers, doctors, financial records,

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.830
everything that went into
the story Paul Hora wrote for the jury having

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:14.450
served its purpose.
I meet a friend near the courthouse.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.270
She's a professor of political science at
Berkley.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:21.240
We drive south and find a restaurant in a
residential district nestled

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.060
between the hills and the freeway leading
onto the bridge.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.630
I have a beer.
And another.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.520
I tell her what Hans said.
His last words before he was led away.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.490
He said, "I've been the best father that I
know how."

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:42.810
"By killing their mother," she asks.
"It was if he was talking to me," I say.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.940
"Does he know you're writing a book?"
"I doubt it."

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.990
Hillary Clinton is on the television above
the bar the scroll runs

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.630
below her chin repeating an earlier statement
about what would happen

00:29:54.630 --> 00:30:00.360
to Iran if Israel were attacked.
She says, "Iran would be obliterated."

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.400
It's nearing the end the Democratic primaries.
And it occurs to me that for the last five

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.570
and a half months, I have
hardly thought about anything except Hans

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.240
Reiser.
I haven't been following the news or playing

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.530
cards for more than two
years I went to my friend's house every Sunday

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.910
night to watch
television.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.370
But during the trial, my friend had a baby
and we stopped doing that.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:29.100
I saw the baby once and held her awkwardly.
Terrified I'd drop her as she made circles

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.610
with her tiny mouth.
She was a colicky baby but recently she stopped

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.450
crying.
The trial is over.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:41.440
"You seem excited," my friend says.
We're outside on the sidewalk near an ice

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.290
cream shop and a closed down
bookstore.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:49.780
There are lots of lights and teenagers everywhere.
In the morning, I'm back in court, mildly

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.870
hung over.
Hans is there but doesn't get to say anything.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:01.610
The Judge scheduled the sentencing.
Murder one is a mandatory 25 years to life.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:07.960
DuBois asks for some words with his client.
The two men lean toward each other like lovers.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:13.080
They pat each other's arms whispering.
Hans spreads his fingers over DuBois' shoulder

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.210
reassuring him until
Hans is taken from the room and returned to

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.640
his cell.
"What now?" I say to one of the reporters.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.810
"I'm so glad to be done with this bullshit,"
he replies.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.891
When Hans said, "I've been the best father
that I know how," he meant

00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:34.400
that he did for his children, for specifically
for his son .

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.790
I remember his testimony, the thing the jury
absolutely had to know was

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:44.360
that Nina didn't love Cory after the divorce.
He interrupted his own lawyer to say that

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.810
when Nina informed him she
was leaving, she also switched her affections

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.960
from Cory to Lila.
Hans said it was important to understand that

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.650
Nina changed this way.
Otherwise it would seem like he was contradicting

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.010
himself and nothing
would add up.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:03.810
None of us knew when he was talking about.
I shook my head and whispered to one of the

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.640
journalists, "What is he
referring to?"

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.350
"He's gone off the rails," he whispered back.
But we were wrong.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:17.250
We were ignoring something consequential.
The lattice of justifications a murder assembles

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.440
as he builds toward
the crime.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:26.640
In one of the key pieces of evidence, the
wiretap phone call to his

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.900
mother three weeks after Nina was murdered,
Hans said she came up with

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.571
these illness for Cory because she hated me.
Cory understands that his mother wants him

00:32:33.571 --> 00:32:36.510
to be sick and doesn't
really like him on some deep, conflicted level.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:41.330
Hans sounded tired in that phone call, depressed,
explaining to his

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:46.910
mother that Nina was killing his son.
On Friday September 1st, the last day -- the

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.770
last weekday before he
killed Nina, Hans called District Supervisor

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.660
Gail Steele.
He wanted to know what she thought of his

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.120
proposal to overhaul the
child welfare system.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.460
Hans was certain the Supervisor would take
his proposal seriously.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.980
He had donated $2,000 to her campaign.
But after calling six times that week, four

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.550
times that day, he never
called her again.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.410
The bureaucracy would not bend to his will,
so he took care of the

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:19.010
problem himself.
He did it to save his son.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:23.590
Except he didn't.
Nina had been with Hans for five years.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.950
She knew Hans better than anybody.
And she left him for his only friend.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:31.750
This is the moment, Hans told the jury, when
she ceased loving their

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.930
son.
In fact, it's the moment when Hans realizes

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.330
Nina doesn't love him and
maybe she never did.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:44.030
His mind went searching for a reason.
Surely she understood he was a famous computer

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.280
programmer.
Her rejection wasn't consistent with the identity

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.980
he had built for
himself.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.100
He had to reorganize the data.
It was too much to take and he gave it to

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.880
his son to carry.
What Hans said, "I've been the best father

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:02.900
that I knew how," he meant,
"I killed the mother to save the boy."

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.370
When I asked my father why he moved while
I was sleeping on the

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.610
streets, he said I was a drug addict so he
abandoned me for the good of

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.960
the family.
That was the story he had put together, the

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.530
opposite of the story I had
put together about being an abused child.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.080
But some large part of me hadn't wanted things
to work out.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.880
Even then, I despised him for screaming.
I disapproved of the way he led his life.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.649
He never hit me until after I left home and
brought shame on him.

00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:34.909
I rejected my father.
There was only my father and my sister.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:38.290
And my sister would be in college soon.
My grandparents were dead.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.310
My mother's family was in England.
And my father moved and wouldn't tell me where

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:46.290
he went.
The family my father left me for didn't exist.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.790
He was referring to the family he didn't have
yet.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.880
The family coming soon.
The family hoped for or not.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.820
He was referring to himself.
All systems of domination create stories of

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.130
their own benevolence.
The Imperialists arrived to tame the savage.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:07.260
We tie the noose around Saddam Hussein's neck,
place a bag over his

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.000
head, the floor swings open beneath his feet,
and his dead body hangs

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.410
in the gallows.
I was traveling in 2004 with President Bush

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.980
three days after the
pictures were published of Abu Ghraib.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:26.550
He stood near third base in the Little League
stadium, except right in

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.540
the middle of his speech he slid in one extra
sentence.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.630
He said, "Thanks to our actions, Saddam's
torture chambers have been

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.340
closed."
"Did he just say what I think he said?" I

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.370
asked the reporter next to
me.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.040
The crowd cheered.
They had no idea he was saying this for the

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.560
first time.
They thought it was part of the speech.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.580
It was the official response to evidence to
the contrary.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.260
Hans Reiser killed Nina because she rejected
him but he will never know

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.330
that.
Something so selfish is beyond knowing.

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.450
My father abandoned me to the streets because
I had no forgiveness in

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:07.140
me.
I was 11, 12, 13, 14, and I sat in judgment

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.970
of my father.
So he left me sleeping in some hallway and

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.010
got a new house.
Those people in that stadium were not concerned

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.130
with the picture of
solider giving a thumbs up next to the body

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.490
of a man packed in ice,
beaten to death by American soldiers.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.180
We were taking our revenge.
Revenge for what?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.490
They rejected us, that's what.
We respond with the violent indignation of

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.540
colonizers.
We understand the world by how we retrieve

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.110
memories.
Reorder information in the stories to justify

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.440
how we feel.
"Thanks to our actions, Saddam's torture chambers

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.970
are now closed."
"I did it for the good of the family."

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.460
"I've been the best father that I know how."

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.060
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:57.820
The rest of the book is funny.
Any more questions about memoir writing or

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.010
Hans Reiser or -- yes?

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:04.070
[INAUDIBLE SPEAKER]

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:15.380
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: Well, that's complicated.
So the question is do I tell people in my

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:19.620
life that I'm going to write
about them prior to writing about them.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.190
There's several different situations to think
about here.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:27.870
All right.
So the first I'm meeting someone I don't know

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.240
like Sean Sturgeon.
Right, I meet him when I contact Sean Sturgeon

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.980
it's as a writer who is
considering writing about him.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.480
I don't know for sure but you know I'm completely
upfront.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.430
I'm not, like, we know some people in common.
You want to get pizza?

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.240
I'm like, I'm a writer and I'm considering
 -- I'm looking into this

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.210
topic.
So I'm always open, right?

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.900
Now -- but then, so that's someone you don't
know.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.600
But then you're really asking about the people
you do know.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.080
The problem there is I don't know if I'm going
to write something until

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.550
later, right?
I have an intense -- something happens with

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.890
a friend or a girlfriend,
you know, that's a better example.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.740
Where you have an intense emotional situation
that's really defining

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.590
and important to you, and then you end up
writing about it.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:31.170
So my basic -- I can't ask, you know, can
I write about this because I

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.220
don't know I'm going to write about it until
I've already written it.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.230
90 percent of what I think I might write,
I don't write.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:44.140
So there's not even -- why even ask permission?
Because you'd be asking for permission for

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.680
all these things that I'm
not going to write anyway.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:54.400
So then you write it.
My rule, my lines, you know, are that I would

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.630
change that person's
identity so that they would not be recognizable

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:04.530
to their employer or to
their friends, for example, you know.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.550
That's my line.
Like, when you're a writer you have to come

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.010
up with your own lines.
You're responsible for your actions.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.510
So you have to say I can live with this.
It's not defensible.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:18.790
I'm not saying this is okay or not okay.
People have a right to be upset about being

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:23.260
written about.
I mean unless your explicitly contacted by

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.570
a writer looking to write
about you, and you spoke to that person, in

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.400
which you have no right to
be upset.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.320
And that's most people, actually.
I'll give you another situation.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:39.950
I had coffee one time with a girl, a good
friend, and she told me this

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:44.950
story.
She's a professional dominatrix and a client

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.820
came to see her who looked
just like her father, and she had a very bad

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.070
relationship with her
father.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:56.880
And I end up -- and then so, she saw him for
a year and then just one

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.820
day just beat the hell out of him.
And of course at that point , he wants her

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.750
all the time
But she didn't want to see him again after

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.930
that.
She was disturbed by the situation and never

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:12.540
saw him again.
I ended up writing like a 12,000 word essay

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.820
structured around that
story.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.140
I didn't know -- when she's telling me this
story, I didn't know I was

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.440
going to write it down, that it was going
to impact -- but it just

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.210
stayed with me and eventually I wrote it out.
I felt that that was her story.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.680
She wasn't -- she was having dinner or coffee
with me as a friend not a

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.440
journalist.
She didn't know I was thinking about writing

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.020
about her.
I didn't either.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.360
So I asked her permission.
Now if I'm part of the story I don't need

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.750
permission, in my opinion.
That's just my -- this is only opinions.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:47.619
This is all gray area.
But if it's someone else's story, and I can't

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:50.110
really change it
significantly but I have to present it the

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:54.300
way they told it, I wanted
her permission to use it.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.480
Well, she would like to see the piece.
So I showed her the piece and she said she

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.540
was okay.
I mean, I don't name her or anything like

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.420
that.
But if she would not have been okay, I wouldn't

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:07.480
have published it.
Because I felt that that was her story.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.111
But it's not necessarily, you know, dating
a writer, you know, is a

00:41:12.111 --> 00:41:16.020
dangerous thing.
You know, cause writers tend to use their

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:22.470
life in their work.
I would never give someone a promise that

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.510
I would not write about them.
I would promise that I would change their

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.610
identity.
But I would never promise someone that I'm

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.740
never going to write about
our experiences together.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.271
I can't promise that.
Any more questions?

00:41:34.271 --> 00:41:40.320
Yes?

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:52.430
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

00:41:52.430 --> 00:42:08.121
STEPHEN ELLIOTT: So the question is about
what include, what to leave

00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:15.280
out and writing style.
You know, Elmore Leonard said writing is just

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.920
about cutting out the
boring parts.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.530
And so that's the main thing, right?
Whenever you're writing, you have a certain

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.700
amount of tension.
And it's like a bank account.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.860
You build up tension because people are waiting
for some kind of

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.290
conclusion.
They have questions in their minds.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:34.340
Someone is following somebody else, things
like that.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.070
Or in a memoir, you know, they're with you
on this quest.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.040
You're searching for things, you know, there's
this tension.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.560
And when you're in the editing process, and
you're rereading -- I mean,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.100
I have hundreds of drafts of this book and
anything I write.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:56.340
I compulsively rewrite everything, every book.
So if I read something 30, 40, 50 times and

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.260
around the 50th time I'm
reading something, I find myself, like, skipping

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.360
over a paragraph, I
know I have to cut that paragraph.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.240
Because if I'm not looking forward to reading
that paragraph or it

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.540
bores me, then it has to go.
And that's the process of writing.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.560
The process of writing is rewriting.
So you continually --

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.270
I mean, this book would be a thousand pages.
It's a very heavily edited book.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.990
So you come to terms of what you have in the
bank.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.690
You know, how much of the reader's attention
you think you have.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:32.230
Now, my reader, I know my reader's attention
because my reader likes

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.630
the same books I like.
You know, I'm trying to write my favorite

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.840
book.
And the people that like to read what I like,

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.869
I'm trying to write their
favorite book.

00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:44.780
I'm not trying to write a book for a soccer
mom in Tennessee.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.490
I mean, if we're similar, that's great.
But I'm not trying to target a demographic

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.350
that I don't consider myself
a part of or that I look down on.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:57.330
A lot of times people talk about, like, writing
for an audience and --

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.350
and they're really talking about writing for
someone that they don't

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.160
think highly of.
They're talking about targeting people that

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.290
they don't respect.
And I don't do that at all.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.881
So my audience, you know, I think of my audience
as smart and with a

00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:13.780
short attention span.
But intellectual, but wants to be challenged

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.900
a little bit.
And that's the audience I'm writing for.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.580
I want -- my only goal is to write their favorite
book, you know.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:25.390
So that's -- that's kind of the answer to
that answer, I think.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.981
That make sense?
And is that a good time to end it on?

00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.510
We're going to end it on that question.
And I'm going to have a Google lunch now.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.380
So we can continue talking over Google lunch,
if you want.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.550
Thanks for coming out, everybody.
