00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.910
Olympians have been bending (and occasionally
breaking) the rules in an effort to give themselves

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.060
an edge over the competition since the games
began.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.180
Despite this, the International Olympic Committee
(IOC) only started testing for performance

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.699
enhancing substances in 1968, and only seem
to have really started taking the issue seriously

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.760
in the 1990s.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.660
As for the 1968 Games, despite that a large
percentage of Olympians are thought to have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.610
been using performance enhancing drugs, they
only managed to catch and disqualify one guy.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.350
What dangerous substance did he take to get
himself disqualified?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.559
He drank two beers before an event, resulting
in him becoming the first person to be disqualified

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.210
for “doping”.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.840
To really drive home how ingrained using performance
enhancers is in Olympic culture, and to highlight

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.780
how endemic is was before the IOC began to
crack down on it recently, ancient Olympians

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.509
were known to drink “potions” containing
mysterious, often exotic herbs, or even ground

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.979
up animal testicles, in the belief that doing
so would give them an edge.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.149
Much like the athletes that wear colored tape
or more recently the use of cupping therapy,

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.159
it didn’t really matter if the thing actually
helped them- only that they thought it did.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.359
Although there were no specific rules against
using performance enhancing substances back

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.460
then, there were rules in place against the
use of magic to “curse” or otherwise unnerve

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.460
an opponent.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.600
In other words- in the ancient Olympics, you
were free to use anything you wished to improve

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.659
your own performance, but you weren’t allowed
to try and negatively impact the performance

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.659
of others.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.289
As far as we can tell, this didn’t actually
stop people from doing such things.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.210
When the Olympic Games were revived in the
19th century, athletes were similarly open

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.579
to having various substances put into their
bodies if it had even a small chance at giving

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.890
them the ability to perform citius, altius,
fortius.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.729
For example, Thomas Hicks, the winner of the
1904 Olympic Marathon was given doses of strychnine

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.220
and shots of brandy in the middle of the race
by his trainers in full view of gathered crowds

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220
and officials.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.640
At the time, strychnine was used in small
doses as a performance enhancing drug.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.750
Anything but small doses would, of course,
kill the athlete via asphyxiation due to paralysis

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.230
of the respiratory muscles.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.140
However, if the dose wasn’t too large, strychnine
was believed to provide a performance boost

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.510
via the muscle spasms it relatively quickly
induces.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.390
They gave Hicks three doses during the race…

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.200
This was only part of the way in which his
trainers almost killed him.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.500
You see, while his trainers were willing to
give him, essentially, rat poison and brandy,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.560
they refused to give him any water despite
the sweltering Missouri summer heat.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.011
By the end of the race, Hicks was delusional
and had to more or less be carried to and

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.420
over the finish line as he was too weak to
remain upright on his own.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.480
He immediately passed out upon finishing and
the doctor was unable to revive him for almost

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.170
a full hour.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.850
Despite not being able to finish the race
without help, he was nevertheless declared

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.850
the victor.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.710
And if you thought that being carried over
the finish line made for a questionable victory,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.120
Hicks only won after it emerged that the first
person to finish, Fred Lorz, had traversed

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.700
most of the course by car.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.710
You see, due to the amazingly bad conditions
in the race, Lorz decided to quit and hitched

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.690
a ride back to the starting point.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.240
When he exited the car and subsequently jogged
back into view of the spectators, everyone

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.750
just assumed he’d ran the whole thing, so
he went along with it.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.250
Eventually his automotive adventure came to
light, at which point he claimed his pretending

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.970
he ran had all been a joke.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.290
Back to doping in the Olympics.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.570
The IOC didn’t officially ban certain dangerous
performance enhancing substances until the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.400
late 1960s, and even then, it took the death
of an athlete to jar them into taking a stand.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.780
That athlete was a cyclist competing in the
1960 games on behalf of Denmark called Knud

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.050
Enemark Jensen.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.020
He collapsed and subsequently died in the
middle of a race, with it widely reported

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.470
that the cause of his collapse was that he’d
been given a cocktail of drugs, including

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.020
Roniacol, by his trainer beforehand.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.621
Of course, it should also be noted that at
the time it was 108° F (42° C) out and what

00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.780
actually happened was that Jensen succumbed
to heat stroke and then fractured his skull

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.460
after falling off his bike- the official cause
of death was brain injury resultant from his

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.460
fractured skull.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.180
Although it was ultimately determined that
drugs probably didn’t have anything to do

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.990
with Jensen’s death, the IOC was shaken
enough by the media backlash to decide to

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.080
ban, at least officially (more on this in
a bit), certain substances starting in the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080
1968 Games.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.980
Although testing was in effect during the
1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.499
no athlete is known to have been caught with
a performance enhancing drug in their system.

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.879
The same couldn’t be said for that year’s
summer games.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.539
(At the time the Winter and Summer Olympics
occurred in the same year) During those Olympics,

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.490
as mentioned, Swedish athlete Hans-Gunnar
Liljenwall was found to have alcohol in his

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.490
system.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.889
Though alcohol may seem like the exact opposite
of a dangerous performance enhancing drug

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.330
given that it dulls the senses, clouds judgement,
and is otherwise pretty safe in moderation,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.710
in the right quantities, there was, and still
is, a popular idea that it gives one an advantage.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.710
How?

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.490
The hypothesis goes that in skill based games
that rely more on muscle memory than things

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.560
like reaction times- games like darts, billiards
and even target shooting- alcohol could, perhaps,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.849
potentially improve performance in individuals
prone to stress or “overthinking“.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.830
Whether actually helpful or not, in Liljenwall’s
case, he was trying to use the alcohol for

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.380
this very purpose and so drank two beers before
a shooting event to steady his nerves, and

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.380
hopefully hands.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.169
After his urine was found to contain alcohol,
Liljenwall was disqualified and was ordered

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.659
to return the bronze pentathlon medal he’d
won while under the influence.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.620
Not stopping there, the rest of Sweden’s
pentathletes were also forced to hand back

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.770
their medals for Liljenwall’s mistake.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.050
What makes Liljenwall’s disqualification
even more bizarre is that, seemingly, little

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.000
was actually being done to stop anyone else
from using performance enhancing drugs.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.229
You see, they only used urine tests during
the 1968 games out of fear that blood tests

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.219
could potentially spread infection or cause
some sort of injury to the athletes.

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.110
Although today urine tests are fairly comprehensive
and accurate for many things, back then the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.759
science was still in its infancy and the chemists
performing the tests were only looking for

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.610
a very specific set of substances, mostly
“hard drugs” like cocaine and heroin,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.909
but not steroids.

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.259
In fact, in 1969, an American weightlifter
responded to being asked about the recent

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.849
ban on amphetamine use by defiantly saying,
“What ban?”

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.449
He went on to explain that he and his fellow
athletes had all used a new drug recently

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.249
developed in West Germany that couldn’t
be detected during the previous Olympic games,

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.009
openly bragging: “When they get a test for
that one, we’ll find something else.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:40.900
It’s like cops and robbers.”

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.319
Beyond some using undetectable drugs, others
would use a catheter to fill their bladder

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.099
with someone else’s urine directly before
testing.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.729
Women had another trick up their, well…
not sleeves… in the use of a condom filled

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.430
with clean urine cleverly hidden inside the
vagina.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.259
Because the IOC was only testing urine and
the tests were fairly inaccurate and not very

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.710
sensitive on the whole, more low-tech methods
of avoiding detection included drinking a

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.900
lot of water to dilute results beyond the
capabilities of the testing of the age to

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.930
detect anything in, or simply rejecting the
test results for various reasons.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.509
For instance, in a non-Olympic event at the
1970 Weightlifting World Championship in Ohio,

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.870
all three medalists were found to have banned
substances in their urine.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.159
Despite this, they were allowed to keep their
winning medals.

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.159
Why?

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:24.030
Due to systemic issues with testing procedures,
with some athletes even managing to get around

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.400
being tested at all, including the guys who
came in fourth, fifth and sixth place at this

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.419
event, there was no way to ensure the medals
would definitely go to someone who hadn’t

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:33.419
cheated.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:36.830
Given that the orginisation knew well that
pretty much all of the top lifters were using

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.590
drugs, they reasoned the winner should probably
just be the best of the cheaters.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.169
This same problem plagued the Olympics as
well.

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:46.879
Dr. Robert Voy, formerly in charge of drug
testing for the U.S. Olympic Committee, noted

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:50.990
that, beyond inherent problems with the accuracy
of the tests, complete lack of quality control

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.319
in the samples, and inconsistent procedures
from test to test, because the tests were

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.999
so easily fooled, those in charge of the drug
testing resorted to “a less libelous approach

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:04.569
to testing called ‘sink testing,’ used
to prevent false positive reporting and legal

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:05.569
challenges.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.599
This now nonexistent method meant all samples
were collected but either were not tested

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:11.669
or were simply poured down the drain.”

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:16.419
Dr. Voy went on to state, “The athletes
knew better than anyone that the drug testing

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:17.900
posed little threat to them.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.860
They scoffed at testing notices and went right
on with their routine drug use with little

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.000
fear of detection.”

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.780
In fact, one survey of track and field athletes
from seven different nations in the 1972 Olympics

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.539
revealed that a whopping 61% of them admitted
to using steroids before those games.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.880
The actual number of track athletes using
is thought to have been higher as presumably

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.729
not everyone taking steroids would be so keen
on admitting it, even in an informal survey.

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:47.750
The reason they could be so flippant, particularly
about using steroids was that, while drugs

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.550
like alcohol, heroin, and cocaine were being
tested for, as previously mentioned, at this

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.660
points steroids were not.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.480
On top of that, even if they tested positive
for substances that were being tested for,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.680
they could simply say their sample wasn’t
handled or tested right, which may well have

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
been true.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.190
Other excuses included things like- if they’d
been using heroin, they could say they’d

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:14.389
been eating poppy seed muffins, and even could
be publicly seen doing so to back their story.

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:24.681
(And yes, that is really a thing, even today
It would not be until the late 1980s when

00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:30.190
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson stunned the
world by setting a new world record- 9.79

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.630
seconds- in the 100m sprint, and subsequently
had his medal stripped three days later after

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.630
testing positive for stanozolol, that the
public began to wake up to the problem.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.410
Beyond Johnson, there was evidence that six
of the eight sprinters in that race were likely

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.820
using steroids.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.339
This was a problem in the sport that famed
Olympian Carl Lewis (who finished 9.92 seconds

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:53.860
in that sprint) raged against in the media
before the 1988 games, noting “There are

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.550
gold medalists at this meet who are on drugs,
that [100 metres] race will be looked at for

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.150
many years, for more reasons than one.”

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.310
Funny enough, Johnson’s trainer, Charlie
Francis, would later come out and say the

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.970
fact that Johnson tested positive for stanozolol
just showed the flaws in the Olympic testing

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.970
procedures.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.410
You see, Johnson was actually taking the steroid
furazabol, as he didn’t like the way stanozolol

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.480
made him feel.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.279
Francis also claimed that at the time all
the top athletes in the sport were taking

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.279
steroids.

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:26.120
In support of Francis’ assertions, in a
recent CBC documentary, Ben Johnson: A Hero

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.120
Disgraced, a former IOC official revealed
that approximately 80% of the track and field

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.670
athletes in the 1988 Games showed significant
signs of long-term steroid abuse.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.959
Not only that, but 20 actually tested positive
but were nevertheless cleared for the Games

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.410
by the IOC.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.720
It has been claimed that the reason the IOC
was so keen on allowing these athletes to

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.260
compete was due to pressure from NBC who didn’t
want the games to “collapse in scandal”.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.790
They were also supposedly refusing to pay
the IOC owed funds and threatening to withdraw

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.810
broadcasting the Olympics that year if such
a thing happened before the Games.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.920
The media frenzy that surrounded Johnson’s
rapid downfall, along with the public becoming

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.160
aware of the widespread use of steroids in
the Olympics, resulted in the IOC finally

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.639
putting significant effort into ending performance
enhancing drug use among Olympics athletes.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:17.760
In the end, when one’s very livelihood is
on the line and said individual has such a

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.259
small window of opportunity for success, from
the original Olympics to modern times, athletes

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:29.290
have always sought to gain any advantage whatsoever
they can find, even today often resorting

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.630
to pseudoscience like colored tape or cupping
therapy.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.850
Unfortunately for those that play within the
rules, for some, ignoring them for the chance

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.709
of a podium and the financial windfall that
comes with it is sometimes seen as worth the

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:45.380
risk of getting caught.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.430
The aforementioned idea that alcohol can improve
performance in sporting events is jokingly

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.040
called the “Optimal Altered State Theory”.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.170
It basically posits that every person has
an optimal state of drunkenness at which they’re

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.079
able to perform better at certain tasks than
they would while sober.

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:04.070
As you might imagine, there is little in the
way of hard evidence supporting this hypothesis,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:22.560
but who doesn’t know someone who has claimed,
“I play better when I’m drunk!”
