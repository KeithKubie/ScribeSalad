00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.990
&gt;&gt; I think and believe that the abstention
of Barack Obama will influence the results

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.820
of all the work we are doing towards the [inaudible]
situation. The US is a very important player

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.090
in this area because it's a country that really
has a lot to give to the world and it's a

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.390
country where we look always when we need
to solve the problems that we have. So I think

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.680
that the Obama administration has a big contribution
to give to all of us in terms of this situation.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.350
But I also think that we need to give them
time. They need to settle, to analyze the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.720
situation because my prospective does not
look only to the short term. Only to the mandate

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.600
that they have with the country. They should
look in terms of long term vision because

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.640
their responsibility does not end with the
mandate that they have now. Their responsibilities

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.450
could seed, to plan for the future because
some of the results will be seen only some

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.390
years from now. Because we should not ask
them to have any of the results. It is not

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.701
possible. The situation is very difficult.
They inherit a very difficult situation in

00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:31.020
terms of financing, special financing situation,
demonstration. So we need to understand and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.159
we need to believe and to help really to achieve
the results we are foreseeing for our caucus.
