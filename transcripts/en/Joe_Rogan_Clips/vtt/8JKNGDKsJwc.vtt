1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
You know,
recover in between trips.
Um,

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.060
there isn't this pressure to be where people are getting their heads blown off

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:06.721
every single time.

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.960
In the last film I did was about Yemen and we spent a week on the front lines

5
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.500
with the various fighting groups and got the usual crazy fighting footage.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
But the powerful staff was a woman who had her leg blown off by an airstrike in

7
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.050
an IDP camp and a miserable IDP camp where the Saudis Nimrod,

8
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:23.370
he's a claiming lit,
providing people with everything they need.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.020
And then at the end,

10
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.920
a child malnutrition clinic right on the front line where a nurse just just

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.920
begged all parties to end this war.
And she was,

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.520
she was literally on the front line surrounded by a minefield,

13
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.570
couldn't get doctors,

14
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.530
couldn't get supplies at a few dozen kids in this clinic that she was just

15
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.610
managing to keep alive.
You know,

16
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.480
these wailing and Macy babies with their rib cages,
caged,
caved in.

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.950
Um,
and you know,
the reason you do this or to cover the effects of war,

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.770
it's not to get crazy for Tj of explosions and shoot outs.

19
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.540
It's the effect of war on civilians.

20
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
So maybe the answer is to do that and not feel this pressure to,
to,

21
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.600
to just get the crazy fighting footage all the time.
In our country,

22
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.370
Yemen is in many ways mostly synonymous for drone attacks.

23
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.330
Drone strikes is when we think about Yemen,

24
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:16.020
we think about the drone strikes that we hear about on wedding parties.

25
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.030
The accident or the,
the,

26
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.780
the number of people that are accidentally killed a civilian casualty rate is

27
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.770
some preposterous number.
Yeah.
I mean,

28
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.720
no one knows because you can't check out most of these areas,

29
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.120
but it's in the tens of thousands at least.
And it's,

30
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.100
the percentage is also preposterous.
It's far more than 50%.
Right?
Yeah.

31
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:36.090
I mean it's,
it's airstrikes.
Yeah.
So it used to be us drone strikes on,

32
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.950
on al Qaeda that's mix now at Saudi Mrr,

33
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:43.050
t airstrikes and um,
with,
with us assistance.
I mean,

34
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:45.930
we were until recently refueling the plane,
supplying the plane,

35
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.400
supplying the weapons.
But yeah,
they've hit weddings,
funerals,
that,
schools,

36
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.270
hospitals.
Um,
and I don't think that's,
that's by accident.

37
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810
I think they're taking an approach to Yemen that,

38
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.920
that we need to crush the opposition.

39
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.190
I'm not take out the military leaders and you can't,

40
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.790
there's no movement in history that's been crushed by force that never works.

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020
Choose Christ.
When you're over there,

42
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:14.580
what does it feel like in Yemen as opposed to Afghanistan or other places?

43
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.710
Um,
Yemen,
the actual fighting is much more low intensity.

44
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.500
It's fairly small groups of guys at some distance just lobbing shells,

45
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.870
each other.
And there's,
you know,

46
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:29.160
there's snipers and there are gunfights but it's not as big scalers as Iraq or

47
00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:33.690
Afghanistan.
But there were a regular air strikes that are killing civilians.
Um,

48
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.220
and while the two sides are fighting this,

49
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:41.040
this slow and bloody war,
um,

50
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.750
the infrastructure is being destroyed and the civilians are unable to get basic

51
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:49.260
food and medicine.
That,
that's the really shocking thing there.
And also,
I mean,

52
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.830
I knew that,
that the coalition is,
it's called,
you know,
the,
the,

53
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:55.350
the fighting groups backed by a Saudi Arabia and UAE were American backed.

54
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.650
But you see American stuff everywhere.
I mean,
m wraps,
you know,

55
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.220
these million dollar bombproof trucks.

56
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.770
I've only ever seen American soldiers and marines driving in Iraq and

57
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.460
Afghanistan.
You see them everywhere there.
Um,

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.970
and that's a real surprise to see that.
Wow.

59
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
How did Yemen become this area that's so synonymous with drone strikes?

60
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.850
Like why did we approach Yemen differently than any other part of the world in

61
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:23.470
terms of the,
the,
the allocation of drone strikes there in terms of numbers?

62
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.340
I don't know.
I mean,

63
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:28.060
I think for a while the only thing the US was doing in Yemen was drone strikes

64
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.010
against al Qaeda.
Um,

65
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.350
but I don't know if there had been more drone strikes in Yemen than,

66
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.680
than elsewhere.
I mean that's where we killed an American citizen,
right.

67
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.150
That which got lots of headlines,
right on purpose with no trial.

68
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.390
They just sued to say we'll do it was because he,
uh,
joined isis.

69
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.800
Is that what it was for out?
Cause yeah,
it was a,

70
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:48.920
was a very well known and popular,
um,
you know,
uh,

71
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.710
online presence and rallying people to,
to,
to fight.
But the air strikes in,

72
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.550
in,
in Yemen,
uh,
um,
you know,
and,
and you know,
with,

73
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.190
with us weapons are that,
that's,
that that's what's really killing people and,

74
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.180
and meeting that people can't get,

75
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.050
get food and aid there because you just can't move things around there.
Um,

76
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.480
whatever came out of that guy getting killed,
they,
they basically,

77
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:18.430
no one was punished for it.
I mean,
he's an American citizen.
He was,
I mean,

78
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.660
if it was in America,

79
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.920
if somehow or another this guy was in the suburbs of Chicago and they launched a

80
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.250
jar,
a drone strike on them,
it would be front page news and it'd be a real issue.

81
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:31.510
But the fact it was in Yemen,
I mean,
again,

82
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:36.070
the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan is that now we're killing guys like him with

83
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.460
drone strikes or special forces raids here and there.

84
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.620
And it's happening almost in secret.

85
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:45.960
And no one's saying this appears to be illegal.
I mean,
some people are,
you know,

86
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.240
you can,
you know,
which media outlets you can go to to read about this.

87
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.120
But I think most people are thinking if that's,

88
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.880
if that's the alternative to invasion.
Yeah.

89
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.630
And trillions of dollars and American soldiers coming back with no legs for a

90
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.990
wall.
We don't understand Brian.
I think a lot of people are willing to accept it.

91
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.170
I don't agree with it.
But that seems to be what's happening now.
No,

92
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.010
I think you're right.
Um,
the,

93
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.180
the other thing about that is with a lot of these,

94
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.400
even though it does seem to be illegal,

95
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.640
people sort of shrug their shoulders and then no one pursues it and then it just

96
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:19.960
kind of goes away.
Yeah.
But there's some stories that for whatever reason,

97
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.940
like Jamal Shogi did not go away and still still out there.

98
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.941
Like it was so egregious and so crazy that this guy walks into the embassy and

99
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.710
just never comes out.
And they're like,
I don't know what happened.

100
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.520
And then slowly you start getting a different story.

101
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:38.290
And then apparently there's leaked,

102
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.390
there's audio and perhaps even video of his murder that ordered,
by the way,

103
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:47.120
by someone who was hanging out with Jared Krishna afterwards,
um,

104
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.330
with apparently no mention of,
of,
of what happened.
