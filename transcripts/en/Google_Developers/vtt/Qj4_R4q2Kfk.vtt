SHABIH RIZVI: My
name is Shabih Rizvi.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm on the Google Play
Business Development Team.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.830
And I get to work with a
lot of great app developers.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.850
And I'll be OK.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.100
Thank you.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.170
And three of those guys
are actually here today.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.260
So I thought it'd be really
nice for you guys see here

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.970
from these guys
about what they've

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.434
done on Google Play,
what's worked for them,

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.100
and then hopefully,
we'll save some time

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.290
at the end for some questions.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.220
So with that, Mel,
maybe you could

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.900
tell us a little more about
your background, the company

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.490
that you guys work for, and
where you guys are based.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.490
MEL KIRK: Hey, everyone.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.040
Mel Kirk.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.280
I work with Zen Studios.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.570
We are based in
Budapest, Hungary.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.180
We have offices here
in northern California.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.830
We're a game developer.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.250
We develop across console,
PC, and mobile and recently,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.060
in the couple years,
heavily into mobile.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.530
And I guess the work we're
best known for Pinball titles

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.050
but very recently a game
called Castle Storm,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.510
which we can successfully
used the Google beta

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.081
program to help grow user
base prior to launch and then

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:04.580
launch.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.570
So something I'm
really excited about

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.611
and happy to talk with
you guys about that today.

00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:12.690
SHABIH RIZVI: Introduce
yourself as well.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.231
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
Yes, so hey guys.

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.450
Brendan here from Soundwave, one
of the founders of Soundwave.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.240
We're based out
of Dublin, Ireland

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.030
and we're just
setting up an office

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.595
here now in that San Fran,
as well, which we're excited

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:24.770
about.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.310
So Soundwave is a mobile app.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.000
We've got some cool
technology in it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.110
that allows you to identify all
the songs that they're playing

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.850
across all the various different
music services and music apps.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.130
So anytime you play a song,
it'll then sync that song

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.400
to your Soundwave profile
and then your friends

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.280
can find and follow you and see
what music you're listening to.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.571
So you can check out what
your buddies are listening to

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.960
on Spotify or YouTube, or
iTunes, or anywhere else.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560
So we have a team of
10 based in Dublin,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.697
Ireland and we've been using
the community, the G+ community,

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:58.780
and the Alpha Beta, all
that extensively, as well.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.427
So happy to chat
about that, too.

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:03.510
FREDERIC DELLA FAILLE: Hi.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.960
I'm Fred from Frontback.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.850
I'm Belgian and we
just won the game.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.610
Five minutes ago, I guess.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.690
So I have at photo
app called Frontback.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.960
We basically use both
cameras of your phone.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.970
I got this idea that summer and
it sounds really, really stupid

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.910
but actually, we
discover along the way

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.450
that it's much more than
a photo and a selfie.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.980
It's what you see
and how you feel.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.210
And the selfie's really
about sharing your feelings

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.084
through your friends.

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:35.010
I love to say that your
friend doesn't really

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.426
care about what
you eat, they want

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:40.770
to see if you are well,
if you look happy.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.960
And we recently
launched on Android.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.604
Thanks to Shabih again,
that's the best thing that

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.020
happened to us,
is being connected

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.442
with Shabih came to our
office multiple times.

00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:57.900
He introduced us to the good
people at Google and so.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.350
Yeah, after-- one thing
that we try to fight

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.960
is the [INAUDIBLE], so we
don't try to create buzz.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.470
We released the app without
telling anyone for a week,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.640
just to see the bug, just
to see real user, not just

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.760
your mom that really
loves what you do,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.380
having people who
hates what you do.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.030
And so together with Shabih,
that's how we launched.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.922
And we are super focused so.

00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:26.380
SHABIH RIZVI: So, Fred I'll
leave it with you for a second.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.280
Could you share a little
bit about the back story

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680
and then there was an
idea that came along.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.729
So, could you share just
like two minutes of--?

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.270
FREDERIC DELLA
FAILLE: Yeah, so some.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.340
I was graffiti artist so all
my life is about creativity

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.150
and I tried to build
something, a communication

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.300
platform on the web to share
multiparty [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.870
And we got traction in a browser
but we raise money with VCs

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.040
based on the consumer.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.490
And we had to find
something on the mobile

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.440
and we tried not to share
multiple photos where

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.660
you can change the colors,
typeface, and personalize

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.780
your multiple photos that
you share on social media.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.290
It really didn't
took off as expected.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.360
So we were running out
of money two weeks left

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.140
and that's not for the drama,
that's really what happened.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.660
Two weeks left of money, I
should have stopped everything

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.420
and raised more money at
that time but I didn't.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.800
And so, I had this simple idea
of this front and back photo

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.650
that I share on
Checkthis, which is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.010
the name of the other platform.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.990
And my friends in Belgium say,
"Fred, you look super tired."

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.760
Because this is really
what the content was about.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.860
It's not about building
a beautiful app,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.730
it's about having something
that people could actually use.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.920
And now for the first
time, I got the use cases

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.950
of these two photos.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.620
So my co-founder came
in Brooklyn last year.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.380
And I told Melvin, we are
going to stop everything.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.370
Don't tell our
investors but I think

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.950
we're going to build something.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.350
And we did it in four weeks.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.070
We released this app iOS first.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.620
We released this app and we got
100,000 download in a month.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.510
And so obviously
the investors who

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.620
didn't wanted to put more money
were like my new friend again.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.120
And so, yeah.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.550
That's a little bit our story.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.660
SHABIH RIZVI: Great, thank you.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.410
Brendan, one of the things that
I was really happy with you

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.600
guys is-- and I've put other
developers in touch with you--

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.030
this is about Alpha Beta.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.010
Could you talk a little bit more
about how guys have use that,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.020
how you built your
community, and how

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.590
you continue to use that today?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.048
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
Yeah, for sure.

00:05:27.048 --> 00:05:29.890
And so, before we
launched anything,

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.120
we actually started reaching
out to the existing just G+

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.085
communities, when we had
literally sketches on paper,

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:39.210
when we had paper prototypes,
when we had anything.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.410
And we just dropping in little
messages into the Android

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.070
Design G+ communities and
Android Dev G+ communities

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.100
and just getting feedback as if
our product existed before we

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.392
even built it.

00:05:51.392 --> 00:05:52.850
So we're just in
there, hanging out

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.580
in all these different
communities, just saying,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.080
"What do you think
about this type of app?

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.480
And what do you think about
these types of designs."

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.150
And for every niche area that we
wanted more feedback on, there

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.190
was an existing community
inside in G+ with hundreds

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.820
of thousands of active people
just crying out for content

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.680
to talk and share
about and to critique.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.299
See, we reach out
to those guys and we

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:14.590
started building this really
great following every time

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.080
we put up a post.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.930
We get a lot of traction on it.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.540
And we decided from there to
build our own community inside

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.040
G+.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.460
We set up a Soundwave
testing community,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.810
invited in all the
kind of the people

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.837
that we've been engaged with in
the other existing communities.

00:06:30.837 --> 00:06:33.420
We tried to make it exclusive
so that only people that we knew

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.336
who were actually going
to actively contribute

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:36.387
could get in.

00:06:36.387 --> 00:06:37.970
And then from there,
building on that.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.940
We really-- when the
Alpha Beta Store came out,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.270
we connected that up with
our existing community.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.160
And then everything
that we do, get

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.100
through all of that
community first.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.500
These guys are vicious but
in a really positive way.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.710
They find everything, more
than we possibly could.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.050
As a result of that, we
rolled all of our QAs

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.000
is pretty much done
by our community.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.450
And they find everything that
we could possibly imagine.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.000
And then from there, after
we have a clean build,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.990
then that's when we
push it live afterwards.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.030
But it's for us-- it's
an invaluable resource.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.360
It's like an extra
couple of hundred people

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.370
that we feel like they're
an extra team member.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.580
We talk to them every day, so.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.962
SHABIH RIZVI: Awesome.

00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:17.420
Mel, you had mention
that, as well.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.510
It'd be great to get a game
developer's perspective on how

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.860
was it, how you guys
set it up, and how

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.655
you plan on using
it moving forward.

00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:25.780
MEL KIRK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.130
We, too, set up with G+, as
terms of people being able

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.110
to access the APK,
login to our group.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.610
Coming from a console and PC
background, PR in core games

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.440
is very important part
of promoting your game.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.210
So we took a lot of
the same approach.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.970
And we literally
announced the game

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.011
and announced the beta
was live at the same time.

00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:51.350
And we had a links straight
to the G+ group just made this

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.880
an open invitation.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.010
And a lot of the press
actually posted that

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.860
and they thought it
was really novel idea.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.560
Early access games have been
taking off on the PC side

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.670
so to them, I think, it was an
interesting approach on mobile.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.350
So this first run of
PR coverage actually

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.390
generated quite a bit
of just awareness.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.060
And so day one, we were
hoping to get 1,000 people

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.390
during the course of the beta.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.290
In day one, we had 1,000 people.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.330
And by day three, we had 3,000.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.200
And then by the time we were
done, we end up with 10,000.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.640
But what was really
great about it

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.220
was the amount of data
and feedback that we got.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.372
A lot of times when you
launch your game, your app, it

00:08:30.372 --> 00:08:31.830
takes a certain
level of investment

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.495
to get your first round of data.

00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:35.620
And then you got to analyze
that and you figure out

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.450
what the heck is going on in
your game and if you monetizing

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.690
and how to optimize.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.000
So we got through all of
that but prior to launch.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.340
And we were able to launch
with a much better game

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.000
in our hands.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.500
We knew our players who were
having a hard time in the game,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.250
where they were dropping off.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.020
We knew which
countries were going

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.500
to be more prone to advertising.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.880
And so we needed to have
better fill rate for ads

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.030
and find better
partners in advertising.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.630
We found out where bugs were.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.880
We have a large QA
team, 25 people on QA.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.030
But this army of 10,000 players
are finding bugs for us.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.690
We were able utilize
word of mouth

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.700
and just build a
community around it

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.009
and have other people
talking about the game

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.800
with their friends.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.470
So, overall a great experience.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.571
We're going to launch
every game this way

00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.570
on mobile going forward.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.670
There's no question about it.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.910
A lot of potential there.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.090
SHABIH RIZVI: Great, awesome.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.400
Fred, if we could bug you again.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.760
I know your company
focuses a lot on community.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.590
And I think a lot of that
also has to do with growth.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.310
And we were just having a
conversation about-- Fred

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.370
and I were talking about in
the early stages of a company,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.670
and as you're first getting
your app into the store,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.950
he was talking about how
important it is to community.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.330
Could you talk a
little bit about what

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.871
you think is so important about
that, how you guys have built

00:09:52.871 --> 00:09:55.070
your community out, and
what you think about

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.846
as you continue to grow that?

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.470
FREDERIC DELLA FAILLE:
Thank you, yeah.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.810
I think for us,
community's everything.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.860
Just an example is
most of the employee

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.190
actually were poor user.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.370
And that's first,
something very important.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.340
And we have makeup and mask
and costume at the office

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.090
because we interact with the
community when there is a body,

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.700
we interact.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.200
And so we really focus on a
small number of people who

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.230
totally get . it
and who generally--

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.870
I never know how to say
this word in English.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.840
Anyway, I'm going to
choose another one.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.920
But people who deeply
love and get it.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.784
And I think, just a
few hundred is enough.

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:36.200
And that's what
we did on Android.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.340
We didn't wanted to have our
friends playing with the beta

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.050
just to have this beta.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.870
This upcoming project,
we wanted people

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.270
who really want to take photo.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.410
and using it.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.710
And so, all our focus
is on community.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.260
We rent an office, which is a
live-and-walk space so we have

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.340
bedrooms and office and we spend
a lot of time with the user.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.220
They stop by and we have
barbecue with the user.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.570
So after this
moment, they really

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.660
have something-- they
got a moment with us

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.970
and I think that that
makes a difference.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.970
SHABIH RIZVI: Very cool.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.180
Thank you.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.699
Brendan.

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.740
Love to hear your thoughts
on community, as well.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.617
So we talked about
the app community,

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:20.950
getting people to test your app.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.283
But you've got a whole other
set of your business, which

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:27.777
is interacting with musicians,
getting fans on board.

00:11:27.777 --> 00:11:30.110
Could you talk a little bit
about how you build that out

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.960
and maybe some of the
artists that you guys

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.850
have worked with over time?

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.720
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
Yeah, for sure.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.470
I just thought that
was really interesting

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.862
that you said that you had
people in the office as well.

00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:39.570
Because that's something
that we've done.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.830
We got an open door policy where
once every two weeks, anyone

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.922
can just walk in and
hang out with us.

00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:47.130
I think people were actually
really kind of surprised

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.460
by that because I thought
everybody was doing that,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.910
but they're for sure not.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.859
And so yeah, we have that.

00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:56.400
We make a strong effort to have
a physical community, as well

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.470
as having the online community.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.400
One thing might be
worth touching on we

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.820
actually have a Brand
Ambassador Program which

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.530
grew out of our community.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.580
So we had some people that
were in the community,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.550
giving feedback that really
liked what we're doing so much

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.630
they asked is there a formal way
that they could get involved.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.580
As a result of that, we now
have 50 brand ambassadors.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.750
50 brand ambassadors
in 50 countries.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.190
And all these guys are actively
doing community outreach,

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.300
PR outreach, artist outreach.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.882
And it's how we're actually
on-boarding a lot of artists.

00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:29.340
And so musicians
and artists really

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.654
like using Soundwave because
when they download it,

00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:33.820
when they then listen to
music on Spotify or YouTube

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.470
or anywhere else on
iTunes, they're instantly

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.770
showing their fans what
they're actually listening to.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.391
And as we started growing in
all these different countries

00:12:41.391 --> 00:12:43.890
and we started getting brand
ambassadors in those countries,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.723
they'd start saying
"well, hey why don't you

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:46.550
get this artist on.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.380
I love this guy.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.380
He's huge in Tokyo.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.592
He's huge in Thailand."

00:12:50.592 --> 00:12:52.300
And it was actually
through our community

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.591
that we started really growing.

00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.610
So we've done no formal
marketing on Soundwave to date

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.069
and yet we're in 190 countries.

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.860
That's all just through
the community, just

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.040
sharing to other people, and
onboarding local artists,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.300
local PR, local community
ambassadors all around them.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.160
So there's just little
mini hubs everywhere

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.720
that are sharing and spreading
the word of Soundwave.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.224
And that's-- we owe our
community 100&amp;% for that.

00:13:15.224 --> 00:13:16.140
SHABIH RIZVI: Awesome.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.765
What are some of the
things you guys do

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:20.675
to promote new applications
that you guys have built?

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:23.530
Do you guys do cross
promotions of your games?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.305
How do you guys
think about that?

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.180
MEL KIRK: There's a lot
of things that we do.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.060
We also cross promote
with other developers.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.606
Like Vector Unit, they
make a game called Rip Tide

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:35.980
and they're good
friends of ours.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.410
And we just talk to
each other and said

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.740
it'd be really nice if we
had a network of developers

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.010
that we could get together
with and literally just share

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.940
traffic and drive traffic
when a new app is launching.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.220
And so we tried it together
and it was really great.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.600
And we just said "OK, we'll
give you 25,000 clicks."

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.960
And so we reciprocated and
we were driving traffic

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.400
to each other's games.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.720
It costs you nothing to do.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.870
And if you have friends,
other developers,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.650
I'd highly recommend
working together.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.990
To this date, Zen has not been a
single dime on user acquisition

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:13.020
yet our Pinball titles are
roughly 50 million installs

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.670
across iOS and Android.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.831
Castle Storm, we just
launched in early May.

00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.580
And we're roughly,
we're a few million in.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.075
We're just getting started.

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:22.450
Hearing what these guys are
talking about with community,

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.370
in letting people access your
game or your application,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.590
and be open with them,
let them see who you are,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.340
and to have a really
special relationship,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.815
you're going to get a lot
more than you think out

00:14:31.815 --> 00:14:32.860
of these people.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.840
And working together with
a development community,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.780
working on your
PR, your message,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.470
finding people who are really
into your game, your app,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.970
and who will talk
about it publicly.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.540
They've got an audience, engage
them on a very personal level

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.120
and get people talking.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.254
It goes a long way.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.170
SHABIH RIZVI: Awesome.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.544
Maybe we can keep
things with you

00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:54.020
and talk a little bit
about monetization.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.490
What forms of monetization do
you guys use with the games

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.010
that you guys have?

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.760
What models have you
guys experimented with?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.540
And then, would you have any
recommendations for the group

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.290
that's here on how to
figure out monetization?

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.360
It'll vary by developer.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.640
MEL KIRK: We've done paid.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.600
We've done a free app
with in-app purchasing.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.810
And just recently, we've
done a free download,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.100
in-app purchasing
plus advertising.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.000
And for us, all
three have worked.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.890
But I got to say, the most
exciting and the most promising

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.310
is this hybrid approach
with in-app purchasing

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.080
and advertising.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.560
We will essentially
allow you to buy the game

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.500
for a certain price, which
turns off ads and gives you

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.040
a certain level of virtual
currency on a weekly basis.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.790
And when we introduce
new content,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.065
you do have the ability
to use your currency

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.440
but it's probably
not going to be

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.980
enough to fully unlock
that new content.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.590
And then ads.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.180
There's incentivized and
there's non-incentivizd.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.270
So I'm getting money for every
user that comes in the game.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.420
And there's no bad user
for me at that point

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.050
or no non-monetarizing
user which

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.220
I know everyone's always
looking for quality users.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.680
I say that really
look at that approach.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.050
There's certain countries,
like Russia, for example,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.550
they don't spend very
much money at all on IAPs

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.280
but they'll watch
ads all day long.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.556
And we're finding, we have
several ad partners in Russia

00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:17.180
like Ad Colony does
really, really good

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.480
fill there and a few others.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.350
And we're doing really
well on ads in Russia.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.220
IAPs, so we try to be very fair.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.750
We're not trying
to nickel and dime.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.480
Our most popular
transaction in game

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.230
is a $4.99 transaction,
which you buy the game,

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.660
you don't see
anymore advertising

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.880
and you get a certain
amount of currency.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.359
So our relationship with
players is very important.

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:40.900
We don't try to
monetize until you've

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.430
spent on a 15, 20
minutes in the game.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.430
We want to know what
the game is about,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.150
see the quality to
the work we've put in,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.150
start to ask you, "Hey, are
you ready to spend some money?"

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.660
No.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.326
And slowly it gets a
little more painful

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.596
until you've got to decide,
OK, I'm watching ads

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:55.845
or I'm going spend some money.

00:16:55.845 --> 00:16:56.678
SHABIH RIZVI: Great.

00:16:56.678 --> 00:16:58.130
Thank you.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.190
Brendan, can you share
thoughts on monetizing music?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.000
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
Yeah, for sure.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.770
So we've some revenue
models in place already.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.140
Just traditional
affiliate program.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.997
So as people
discover tracks, they

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:13.910
can purchase them
through Soundwave.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.190
And then we have deals in place
to get some of that rev share.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.079
What we're really excited
about is-- we actually

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.730
have the unique position that
we are the only ones that

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.960
understand across all platforms,
all devices, all players,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.434
and all apps what
somebody's listening to,

00:17:28.434 --> 00:17:29.600
especially for native plays.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.680
So if you listen to music
on the iPad or the iPhone

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.780
or the native music player
on your Android device,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.157
we can actually track
all that as well.

00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:37.740
And we're in a unique
position that we

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.646
can turn on the light
over the music industry

00:17:39.646 --> 00:17:42.270
and let the music industry know
who's listening to what, where,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.191
and when.

00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:45.690
And that's an avenue that we're
kind of exploring right now,

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.340
just really allowing
the industry

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.870
to understand a lot of people
are listening to this artist

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.370
or a lot of people are listening
to this artist in this area

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.710
or at this time.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.810
Really understand
trends as they emerge,

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.120
as opposed to six months
or a year after the fact

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.670
after they occur.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.950
So we like to think
that we're replacing

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.390
the old model of sending
guys out on the street

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.780
to try and find new artists
and discover new guys by being

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.980
in every globe and
bar in the world

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.980
by having this app that's
actually in real time,

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.550
checking out what people
are listening to instead.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.455
So for us going
forward, it's definitely

00:18:16.455 --> 00:18:19.450
just that understanding
of what's being played.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.670
SHABIH RIZVI: Awesome.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.197
Fred, do you have thoughts
on maybe down the line?

00:18:23.197 --> 00:18:25.530
But I'm sure you guys have
thought about it a little bit

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.762
and talked about it within--

00:18:27.762 --> 00:18:29.220
FREDERIC DELLA
FAILLE: We obviously

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.830
are a venture-backed company
so they bet on the future.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.360
We are 11 months old
so it's super early.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.810
But what I know and what I see
is we have brands in the feed.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.060
People are sharing
simple moments of life.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.640
And so, we have
unique content and I

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:51.830
think that's something that's
like a good opportunity.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.689
SHABIH RIZVI: Awesome.

00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.980
I think we'll start to close
things out and give people

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.000
a chance to ask questions.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.480
Two last questions.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.530
One, what are some of
your favorite apps?

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:07.130
FREDERIC DELLA FAILLE: Sunrise.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.640
The calendar app.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.090
I really love this guy.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.630
I love the app and they
just released on desktop.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.170
So it makes.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.180
Really nice.

00:19:19.164 --> 00:19:20.830
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
For design purposes,

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.360
I definitely think
Flipboard and Pintrest are

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.170
two of my-- they're useful but
they're also really well built

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.070
on Android, for sure.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.111
And designed really well.

00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:32.857
So they're two that
we look to constantly.

00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:34.440
MEL KIRK: I still
play a lot of games.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.640
Ridiculous Fishing, if
you haven't seen that,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.200
you got to play that.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.300
And Monument Valley--
really, really great game.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.970
Those two are--
still play those.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.402
Ans Pitfall, the endless
runner from the classic days.

00:19:46.402 --> 00:19:47.110
Yeah, definitely.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.580
SHABIH RIZVI: Nice.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.080
Cool.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.110
So and then one last
question for everyone.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.590
If there's folks in the
audience that new to Android,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.550
new to Google Play, would
there be any one or two

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.450
bits of advice you'd
give them as they

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.000
consider building
on Android and Play.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.660
MEL KIRK: I would say-- well,
from the game developer's

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.180
perspective, build
for the masses.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.680
Build something
that a lot of people

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.790
are going to want to
play and something that

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.760
is easy to understand within
those first few moments.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.110
And Google, the nice thing
about Google and Android

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.420
is that you guys are so open.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.580
So I've never had a problem
getting a hold of anybody here.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.082
So be persistent
and find somebody

00:20:34.082 --> 00:20:36.540
to talk to because I'm sure
when you pique their interests,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.460
they're definitely going
to help you out, so.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.293
And I really appreciate
that about you guys.

00:20:40.293 --> 00:20:42.160
So thank you very much.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.785
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL: I'd say get
your [INAUDIBLE] business card.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.930
FREDERIC DELLA FAILLE: No.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.330
So I'm a designer and I was
super impressed by actually

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.040
engineers that understand
design on Android.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.380
It's much more closer and
trusting your engineers

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.730
is-- I mean, that's a
big surprise for me.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.579
SHABIH RIZVI: Great.

00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:09.870
So questions for the panelists?

00:21:12.207 --> 00:21:13.040
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.200
I'm wondering if any of
you guys are utilizing

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.450
in-app subscriptions and
I'm interested in what

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.296
price points are working for
you and what your churn rate is?

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:21.920
How many people have
successfully renew

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.600
subscriptions that have
bought it for the first month?

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.070
MEL KIRK: We haven't done
anything with subscriptions

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.630
yet.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.740
We've thought about
it, especially

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.906
with our Pinball game, which
we're releasing content

00:21:32.906 --> 00:21:34.823
for very frequently and
with a lot of branded,

00:21:34.823 --> 00:21:37.072
like mass market type of
brands were people could just

00:21:37.072 --> 00:21:39.750
play a monthly fee and know
that their new Pinball table is

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.090
going to show up x on x date.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.980
The challenge is from a
development standpoint,

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.842
delivering the content
on time, every time.

00:21:46.842 --> 00:21:48.300
As soon as you mess
that up, people

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.120
aren't going to trust you
and they're going to be mad.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.730
So can you deliver the content?

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.800
I think that's what's holding
a company like ours back.

00:21:57.961 --> 00:21:59.210
AUDIENCE: This is for Brendan.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.620
Like how do you guys manage
the release schedule?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.720
So we've been thinking
about having a beta channel

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.201
and we use it one way of
deploying it to a private beta

00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:10.200
before we we were ready
to show it to the world.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.790
And then we march the branch
back into the main channel.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.100
How do you manage to make sure
that the releases are always

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.270
in sync and getting
out to the people?

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.990
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL: I mean
for us, it's pretty seamless.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.069
I mean you just--

00:22:28.069 --> 00:22:28.860
AUDIENCE: A weekly?

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.360
Or monthly?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.568
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL: Oh, yeah.

00:22:30.568 --> 00:22:31.930
So we change, right?

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.071
So when we started, we've been
out for just under a year,

00:22:35.071 --> 00:22:35.570
right now.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.990
And when we started,
we stayed awake

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.781
and pushed our new
updates every two weeks.

00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:41.995
So we're just fast, fast,
fast iterations, little bugs

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:42.870
that we were finding.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.869
Then when we hit our
groove, we slowed that down

00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:47.070
and we started
waiting six weeks.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.910
And we're in a four to
six week cycle right now.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.430
For this current
cycle, we actually

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.280
haven't done a push in
a about three months

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.910
because there's a
huge release coming.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.780
So for now, everybody's
just in on the beta

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.080
and giving feedback.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.370
We changed our time
frames on that.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
you said you didn't

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.310
use even a dime
to acquire users.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:16.400
What do you think were the keys
that you used to acquire users

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.120
without even making an ad?

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.292
Or what did you do?

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:24.750
MEL KIRK: Well, I
would say there's

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.430
two different experiences
at this point.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.270
One, on the Pinball
side, when you

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.740
have a license like
Star Wars or Marvel,

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.840
you work with them and
it's not like anything's

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.530
written in a contract.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.230
We're going to do x, x, and
x for you for marketing.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.670
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.253
going to work with
them on some level.

00:23:38.253 --> 00:23:41.010
You get access to their
communities, their personality,

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.940
so there's a lot of marketing
that'll drive installs there.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.230
But also, our PR
outreach is very good.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.970
We're in touch with all the
editors from the big sites,

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.740
even just tech-focused sites.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.870
They're constantly writing
about Zen Studios and our games.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.570
And then recently,
on Castle Storm,

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.570
we cross promoted with
our existing users

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.640
on other-- on the Pinball side,
working with other developers.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.720
And then working with guys
like, say for example, nVidia.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.210
We support their
a higher end Tegra

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.890
and so we're on the front of
whatever it is they're doing.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.497
We're working with Android and
getting featured placements.

00:24:14.497 --> 00:24:15.830
And that's going to drive a ton.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.890
If you get that,
that's the holy grail.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.000
So all those different things
combined drive installs

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.650
and allows us to spend
money on different.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.977
FREDERIC DELLA FAILLE:
For us as consumers,

00:24:28.977 --> 00:24:30.810
it's really friends of
friends in real life.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.250
So having the dealer focus
on the delight of the user,

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.149
making them happy,
using the product,

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:37.440
he's going to bring his friend.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.682
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL: For us,
it's the product itself.

00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:45.140
As people want to know what
their friends are listening to,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.350
they'll share the
app to their friends

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.920
so that the whole thing is just
inherently viral in itself,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.753
the way it's set up.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.980
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about-- it's

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.074
related to piracy in that I've
uploaded apps to Google Play

00:24:59.074 --> 00:25:00.615
and then they get
pirated and they're

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:05.690
on another app stores in
other countries within days.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.540
Obviously, in-app purchases
don't work in those other app

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.531
stores and sometimes
the ads don't work.

00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:13.280
So I'm just wondering
if you have any best

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.100
practices on how
you deal with that.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.482
SHABIH RIZVI: So actually,
we talk on the side.

00:25:19.482 --> 00:25:20.940
I don't think the
panelists will be

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.240
able to comment on
that, specifically.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.334
That's totally fine.

00:25:24.334 --> 00:25:25.000
Other questions?

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.240
AUDIENCE: So this
is related for you

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.360
guys who have thousands of
users in your beta program.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.060
Do you have any concerns
with confidentiality?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.480
Are you concerned
that people are

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.670
going to leak
screenshots of your app

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.030
out to the public ahead of time?

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.189
Is that a concern for you guys?

00:25:45.189 --> 00:25:46.980
BRENDAN O'DRISCOLL:
We've been pretty open.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.510
We've asked them not to do
it and they've not done it.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.810
Yeah, so.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.551
I don't know if it's
something that you'd

00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:56.300
be worried about you'd
probably might have

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.480
to take particular precautions.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.795
But for us, it's
always just been

00:25:58.795 --> 00:26:00.711
we've been pretty trusting
with the community.

00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:03.770
And no, I don't think there's
anything too sensitive

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.020
that we're working on anyway
that if it did happen,

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.710
we'd probably spin it in
a positive light anyway.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.232
So not for us but
maybe for the others.

00:26:11.232 --> 00:26:12.690
MEL KIRK: We
actually-- this sounds

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.861
funny-- we encourage
them to take screenshots

00:26:14.861 --> 00:26:16.110
and then to share and to talk.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.409
We went into beta when we
were ready for the game

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:20.950
to be out in the opening and
for everybody to see everything.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.970
FREDERIC DELLA
FAILLE: And one thing

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.610
that we discovered in Asia
and particularly in Japan,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.770
actually, they really
take screenshots and blog

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.340
about the updates, the beta.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.280
And I think that's just
validation that what we do

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.040
is important for them.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:42.270
But I guess it's also, how close
you are to the release date.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.680
If no one can move as fast as
you do, doesn't really matter.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.230
AUDIENCE: One last question.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.265
You said that you use ads.

00:26:53.265 --> 00:26:56.200
Do you use AdMob or
some other network

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.430
to promote ads, to get ads?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.040
MEL KIRK: We're using
several networks.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.540
And they each have the ability
to serve various markets.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.600
So Ad Colony, I think everybody
here probably Ad Colony there.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.300
They can serve
everywhere really well

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.780
and there's others that serve
more niche type of country

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.780
in smaller markets and
they're selling directly.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.670
So they actually can
fill the ad call.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.540
AdMob, massive reach
so we have several

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.839
implemented and
working with a lot.

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.630
SHABIH RIZVI: Cool.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.846
We have time for one last
question if anyone has one?

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:32.910
All right, if not, then
thank you panelists.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.780
And they'll still be around.
