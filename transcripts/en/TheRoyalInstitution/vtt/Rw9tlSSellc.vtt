00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.010
The first law of thermodynamics, the one which
says that the total amount of energy is fixed,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.139
that energy can't be created or destroyed,

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.209
Sometimes people say that that law states
that there's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.920
That energy is a little bit like money in
a bank account.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.230
You can always account for it, that there
is a ledger

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.640
where you can add or subtract and you can
keep track of the energy.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.400
There's a beautiful example of this from Richard
Feynman

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.340
where he tries to explain how energy works.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.480
And he says it's a little bit like a child
that has a set of twenty eight wooden blocks

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.420
that he uses as toys.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.300
And every day his mum comes in and she counts
the blocks when she puts them back into their box

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.680
And every day she finds that there's 28.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.590
One day she finds that there's 26.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.649
And so she reasons that they must be somewhere,
so what she starts doing is looking around,

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.789
and she looks behind the bed and sure enough
a couple blocks have ended up there.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.420
Another day she's looking for these blocks
and she only finds 15 or something,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.890
So she looks out the window and sure enough
there are the remaining blocks.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.240
And in many ways, this is very much the same
kind of thing.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240
Provided you look hard enough, you'll always
find that energy somewhere.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.220
So Feynman has this idea where the child says

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.800
"No no no, you're not allowed to look in that box!"

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.810
And his mom says "What do you mean I can't
look?"

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.810
"No no no you can't!"

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.229
The child screams.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.840
What she does is she weighs the box.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
She weighs the box over and over again, every
day she weighs it.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.420
And what she notices is a pattern.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.200
Sometimes it weighs a little bit more, sometimes
it weighs a little bit less.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.440
But then she begins to understand what the
pattern is

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.040
for how many blocks are actually inside the box.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.520
So you don't necessarily actually need to
see the blocks, you might be able to infer

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.690
them in cunning ways.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:05.530
In this sense, there's this idea that you
don't really ever know how much there is in total

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.579
but you're constantly seeing differences,
you're seeing changes.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.650
And we've just become very very clever at
inferring it.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.760
And so one of the things is that this fundamental
rule is something

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.340
that in science keeps us very safe.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.270
And whenever that rule is broken, you smell
a rat.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:29.180
There's a snake oil salesman somewhere who's
trying to pull a fast one on you.
