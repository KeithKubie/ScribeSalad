to download contain the data from the
 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.290
to download contain the data from the
internet then we have to buffer this

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300
internet then we have to buffer this
 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.290
internet then we have to buffer this
data until we really need it and once we

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300

extract audio and and video samples out

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310
extract audio and and video samples out
 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.500
extract audio and and video samples out
of the container when we have those

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
samples those audio and those video
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.940
samples those audio and those video
samples they are still encoded so we

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950
samples they are still encoded so we
 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.220
samples they are still encoded so we
can't really render those so we need the

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230
can't really render those so we need the
 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.760
can't really render those so we need the
media codecs API to decode those samples

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770
media codecs API to decode those samples
 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.220
media codecs API to decode those samples
and once we have those samples in the

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230
and once we have those samples in the
 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.680
and once we have those samples in the
decoded way we can render those with

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690
decoded way we can render those with
 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.190
decoded way we can render those with
Android in a case of video we only have

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200
Android in a case of video we only have
 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.310
Android in a case of video we only have
to pass a surface to the codecs API and

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
to pass a surface to the codecs API and
 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.040
to pass a surface to the codecs API and
the codecs API itself then does the

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050
the codecs API itself then does the
 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.430
the codecs API itself then does the
rendering on this surface in case of

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440
rendering on this surface in case of
 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.190
rendering on this surface in case of
audio files the result of tossing these

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200
audio files the result of tossing these
 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.950
audio files the result of tossing these
encoded frames is or PCM frames so PCM

trails which we then can play by using
 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.530
trails which we then can play by using
the audio track so that's what is what

decide to duplicate this framework

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:10.279

decide to duplicate this framework
sample source and to do all these tasks

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250
sample source and to do all these tasks
 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.110

in exoplayer itself so the diagram which

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120
in exoplayer itself so the diagram which
 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.730
in exoplayer itself so the diagram which
we have seen before now looks like this

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740
we have seen before now looks like this
 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.040
we have seen before now looks like this
so all those green tufts are moved into

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050
so all those green tufts are moved into
 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.399
so all those green tufts are moved into
the EXA players are moved into the apk

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:27.409
the EXA players are moved into the apk
 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.129
the EXA players are moved into the apk
and that's why we now can customize the

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139
and that's why we now can customize the
 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.129
and that's why we now can customize the
behavior of those tasks so if you want

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:33.139
behavior of those tasks so if you want
 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.409
behavior of those tasks so if you want
for example to use another network stack

you can use another net a network stack
 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.439
you can use another net a network stack
by using a custom data source you can

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449
by using a custom data source you can
 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.129
by using a custom data source you can
influence buffering and you can even

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:44.139
influence buffering and you can even
 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.740
influence buffering and you can even
support other containers other video or

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:47.750

audio containers which are not supported
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.179
audio containers which are not supported
by the framework so by moving those

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:52.189
by the framework so by moving those
 

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:55.629

good bandwidth and so you may want to

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.290
good bandwidth and so you may want to
 

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.830

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.060
the other components those arrays
highlight this pattern little bit so we

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.070
highlight this pattern little bit so we
 

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.030
highlight this pattern little bit so we
create one component and inject it into

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.040
create one component and inject it into
 

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.760
create one component and inject it into
the other component to get a chain of

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:57.770
the other component to get a chain of
 

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.980
the other component to get a chain of
those components so once we have this

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:02.990
those components so once we have this
 

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.440
those components so once we have this
audio renderer or this track rendered

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:05.450
audio renderer or this track rendered
 

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.860
audio renderer or this track rendered
for audio we need to kind of register

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:08.870
for audio we need to kind of register
 

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.070
for audio we need to kind of register
those renders in the exoplayer itself so

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080
those renders in the exoplayer itself so
 

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.790
those renders in the exoplayer itself so
we create area of track renders assign

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:15.800
we create area of track renders assign
 

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.490
we create area of track renders assign
the audio renders to one of the position

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:18.500
the audio renders to one of the position
 

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.340
the audio renders to one of the position
of those of this array and then we pass

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:21.350
of those of this array and then we pass
 

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:30.450
of those of this array and then we pass
it to the own renders method

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:30.460
 

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.290
so this was what we need to do for doing

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.300
so this was what we need to do for doing
 

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.690
so this was what we need to do for doing
all your playback for video playback as

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:36.700
all your playback for video playback as
 

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.990
all your playback for video playback as
already said we have some other type of

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000
already said we have some other type of
 

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.510
already said we have some other type of
data there is not only only audio there

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520
data there is not only only audio there
 

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.300
data there is not only only audio there
is also video data and eventually you

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.310
is also video data and eventually you
 

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.270
is also video data and eventually you
want to render text subtitles or club or

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:48.280
want to render text subtitles or club or
 

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.110
want to render text subtitles or club or
closed captions as well so again we need

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120
closed captions as well so again we need
 

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.760
closed captions as well so again we need
three of those chains of dependent

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:55.770
three of those chains of dependent
 

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.650
three of those chains of dependent
components so we need a tractor under

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:58.660
components so we need a tractor under
 

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.840
components so we need a tractor under
the tractor and Rodan needs a sample

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:00.850
the tractor and Rodan needs a sample
 

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.270
the tractor and Rodan needs a sample
source each sample source again needs a

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.280
source each sample source again needs a
 

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.580
source each sample source again needs a
data source which in the end needs a

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:05.590
data source which in the end needs a
 

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.470
data source which in the end needs a
bandwidth meter if you want to do

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480
bandwidth meter if you want to do
 

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.450
bandwidth meter if you want to do
adaptive adaptive playback so let me be

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:12.460
adaptive adaptive playback so let me be
 

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.370
adaptive adaptive playback so let me be
clear again you don't have to provide

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.380
clear again you don't have to provide
 

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.490
clear again you don't have to provide
your own implementation each component

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:17.500
your own implementation each component
 

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.980
your own implementation each component
has a default implementation provided by

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:19.990
has a default implementation provided by
 

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.800
has a default implementation provided by
the exoplayer library you can kind of

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:22.810
the exoplayer library you can kind of
 

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.160
the exoplayer library you can kind of
wire up your renders as you want so

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:26.170
wire up your renders as you want so
 

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.980
wire up your renders as you want so
there is no need to really implement

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:28.990
there is no need to really implement
 

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.610
there is no need to really implement
these things if you don't have specific

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620
these things if you don't have specific
 

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.500
these things if you don't have specific
requirements you can just use it as the

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:34.510
requirements you can just use it as the
 

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:41.529
requirements you can just use it as the
demo application does demonstrate

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:41.539
 

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:44.139
besides these track renderer components

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:44.149
besides these track renderer components
 

00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:45.789
besides these track renderer components
there are a couple of UI components

00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799
there are a couple of UI components
 

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.490
there are a couple of UI components
available as well so these components

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:48.500
available as well so these components
 

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.919
available as well so these components
are not really mandatory but they are

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:50.929
are not really mandatory but they are
 

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.019
are not really mandatory but they are
very convenient to use there is for

00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:53.029
very convenient to use there is for
 

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:55.659
very convenient to use there is for
example this aspect ratio frame layout

00:23:55.659 --> 00:23:55.669
example this aspect ratio frame layout
 

00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:58.659
example this aspect ratio frame layout
it's a layout which make sure that the

00:23:58.659 --> 00:23:58.669
it's a layout which make sure that the
 

00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:00.519
it's a layout which make sure that the
surface view on which the video is

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:00.529
surface view on which the video is
 

00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:03.190
surface view on which the video is
rendered is always resized nicely so if

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200
rendered is always resized nicely so if
 

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.710
rendered is always resized nicely so if
a user for example changes the

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720
a user for example changes the
 

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.870
a user for example changes the
orientation of a mobile device you have

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880
orientation of a mobile device you have
 

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.639
orientation of a mobile device you have
to resize the surface view too to match

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:12.649
to resize the surface view too to match
 

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:17.470
to resize the surface view too to match
the size of the of the viewport another

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480
the size of the of the viewport another
 

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.600
the size of the of the viewport another
another component is at the very bottom

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:19.610
another component is at the very bottom
 

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.450
another component is at the very bottom
it's the subtitle layout again this

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:22.460
it's the subtitle layout again this
 

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.180
it's the subtitle layout again this
subtitle layer is in the end optional to

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:25.190
subtitle layer is in the end optional to
 

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.299
subtitle layer is in the end optional to
use but if you want to render text or

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:28.309
use but if you want to render text or
 

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:31.090
use but if you want to render text or
closed captions or subtitles it's very

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:31.100
closed captions or subtitles it's very
 

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.340
closed captions or subtitles it's very
convenient to use it's the same size as

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:33.350
convenient to use it's the same size as
 

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.940
convenient to use it's the same size as
the entire layout or the surface few

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:36.950
the entire layout or the surface few
 

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.669
the entire layout or the surface few
hairs and it's kind of a a layer above

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679
hairs and it's kind of a a layer above
 

00:24:39.679 --> 00:24:42.250
hairs and it's kind of a a layer above
the video on which exoplayer can render

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.260
the video on which exoplayer can render
 

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:49.280
the video on which exoplayer can render
those subtitles

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:49.290
 

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.140
so there's a lot of going on we have

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.150
so there's a lot of going on we have
 

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.060
so there's a lot of going on we have
seen that you have to download download

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.070
seen that you have to download download
 

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.400
seen that you have to download download
data we have to buffer data we have to

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:55.410
data we have to buffer data we have to
 

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.620
data we have to buffer data we have to
extract data out of the containers and

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:57.630
extract data out of the containers and
 

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.280
extract data out of the containers and
in the end we have to render this data

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:00.290
in the end we have to render this data
 

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.560
in the end we have to render this data
to a surface or to the audio track so

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:03.570
to a surface or to the audio track so
 

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.020
to a surface or to the audio track so
there is a lot of lot is going on in

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.030
there is a lot of lot is going on in
 

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.630
there is a lot of lot is going on in
this video player in you if you want to

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640
this video player in you if you want to
 

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.340
this video player in you if you want to
be aware of what is going on you can

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:10.350
be aware of what is going on you can
 

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.830
be aware of what is going on you can
implement some listeners and then

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840
implement some listeners and then
 

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.860
implement some listeners and then
register those listeners so on a high

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:15.870
register those listeners so on a high
 

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.690
register those listeners so on a high
level there is the extra player top

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700
level there is the extra player top
 

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.770
level there is the extra player top
listener this is a listener which

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:20.780
listener this is a listener which
 

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.620
listener this is a listener which
notifies you about the high level state

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:24.630
notifies you about the high level state
 

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.630
notifies you about the high level state
of the player so when you start the

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640
of the player so when you start the
 

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.760
of the player so when you start the
player is in an idle state and that it

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:28.770
player is in an idle state and that it
 

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.640
player is in an idle state and that it
transitions to a buffering stage so we

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:31.650
transitions to a buffering stage so we
 

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.980
transitions to a buffering stage so we
have to start downloading data and as

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:33.990
have to start downloading data and as
 

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.990
have to start downloading data and as
soon as there is enough data we can

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000
soon as there is enough data we can
 

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.490
soon as there is enough data we can
start playback if you want to give some

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:39.500
start playback if you want to give some
 

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.140
start playback if you want to give some
signals to your user are now the player

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.150
signals to your user are now the player
 

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.789
signals to your user are now the player
is buffering there is not enough data

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799
is buffering there is not enough data
 

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:46.220
is buffering there is not enough data
available you can just implement such a

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.230
available you can just implement such a
 

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.919
available you can just implement such a
listener and listen to those state

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:48.929
listener and listen to those state
 

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:52.030
listener and listen to those state
transitions

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.040
 

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.180
besides this high level without it high

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:56.190
besides this high level without it high
 

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.520
besides this high level without it high
level events there are a couple of low

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:58.530
level events there are a couple of low
 

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.409
level events there are a couple of low
level events so there are many of those

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419
level events so there are many of those
 

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.750
level events so there are many of those
components which you have to wire up and

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760
components which you have to wire up and
 

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.210
components which you have to wire up and
each of those components has an event

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220
each of those components has an event
 

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.220
each of those components has an event
listener so we see here that the demo

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:07.230
listener so we see here that the demo
 

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.210
listener so we see here that the demo
player this snippet again is out of the

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.220
player this snippet again is out of the
 

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.220
player this snippet again is out of the
exoplayer Pro check it is from the it's

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.230
exoplayer Pro check it is from the it's
 

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.010
exoplayer Pro check it is from the it's
from the demo player application of

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020
from the demo player application of
 

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.760
from the demo player application of
exoplayer it implements each four it

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:19.770
exoplayer it implements each four it
 

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.919
exoplayer it implements each four it
implements an event listener for each of

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:21.929
implements an event listener for each of
 

00:26:21.929 --> 00:26:24.140
implements an event listener for each of
those components so whatever is going on

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.150
those components so whatever is going on
 

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.880
those components so whatever is going on
in one of those components your

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:25.890
in one of those components your
 

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.220
in one of those components your
application is aware of what is going on

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.230
application is aware of what is going on
 

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.370
application is aware of what is going on
and you can act upon this transition

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380
and you can act upon this transition
 

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:40.969
and you can act upon this transition
these stage twenty transitions

00:26:40.969 --> 00:26:40.979
 

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:44.560
so

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:44.570
 

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.900
let's have a look at the architecture or

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:46.910
let's have a look at the architecture or
 

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.990
let's have a look at the architecture or
design we now have seen that there are

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000
design we now have seen that there are
 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.630
design we now have seen that there are
many such components which are dependent

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640
many such components which are dependent
 

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.760
many such components which are dependent
on each other so let's have a look at

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:54.770
on each other so let's have a look at
 

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.810
on each other so let's have a look at
the diagram this is a diagram of the

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:58.820
the diagram this is a diagram of the
 

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.450
the diagram this is a diagram of the
component model or the object model

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:01.460
component model or the object model
 

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.850
component model or the object model
which is required to do traditional

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:03.860
which is required to do traditional
 

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.430
which is required to do traditional
media playback traditional media

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440

adaptive playback so there is one single

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640
adaptive playback so there is one single
 

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.180
adaptive playback so there is one single

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.190
container file sitting on a server on
 

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.520
container file sitting on a server on
the internet somewhere and we need to

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:18.530
the internet somewhere and we need to
 

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.919
the internet somewhere and we need to
download this container and then we need

00:27:20.919 --> 00:27:20.929
download this container and then we need
 

00:27:20.929 --> 00:27:23.260
download this container and then we need
to extract data out of this container

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.270
to extract data out of this container
 

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.380
to extract data out of this container
that's exactly what what we need for

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:26.390
that's exactly what what we need for
 

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.190
that's exactly what what we need for
such for such traditional media playback

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200
such for such traditional media playback
 

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.799
such for such traditional media playback
is again we need to tract render we have

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:32.809
is again we need to tract render we have
 

00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:35.169

extractor sample source these extract of

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:58.370
extractor sample source these extract of
 

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.000
extractor sample source these extract of
sample source uses an extractor in this

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.010
sample source uses an extractor in this
 

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.880
sample source uses an extractor in this
case it's an mp4 extractor which knows

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:03.890
case it's an mp4 extractor which knows
 

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.640
case it's an mp4 extractor which knows
how to extract audio and video data out

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:06.650
how to extract audio and video data out
 

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.640
how to extract audio and video data out
of this mp4 container then passes the

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:09.650
of this mp4 container then passes the
 

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.710
of this mp4 container then passes the
sample to the extractor sample source

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720
sample to the extractor sample source
 

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.560
sample to the extractor sample source
which again causes it to the tract

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:14.570
which again causes it to the tract
 

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:19.330
which again causes it to the tract
renders for rendering so if you want to

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:19.340
renders for rendering so if you want to
 

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.000
renders for rendering so if you want to
support some kind of a custom container

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.010
support some kind of a custom container
 

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.620
support some kind of a custom container
format maybe you invented a super

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:23.630
format maybe you invented a super
 

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.140
format maybe you invented a super
efficient container format for video you

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:26.150
efficient container format for video you
 

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.570
efficient container format for video you
can just create your own extractor

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:28.580
can just create your own extractor
 

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.480
can just create your own extractor
register this rec tractor extractor with

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:31.490
register this rec tractor extractor with
 

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.030
register this rec tractor extractor with
the extractor sample source and then you

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.040
the extractor sample source and then you
 

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.669
the extractor sample source and then you
can support this new kind of container

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:36.679
can support this new kind of container
 

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.250
can support this new kind of container
maybe you have some kind of content

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:39.260
maybe you have some kind of content
 

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.710
maybe you have some kind of content
protection in built into the container

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720
protection in built into the container
 

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.310
protection in built into the container
if you have such in invented such

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320
if you have such in invented such
 

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.560
if you have such in invented such
container you can also kind of plug-in

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:47.570
container you can also kind of plug-in
 

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.150
container you can also kind of plug-in
these container formats with X player

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.160
these container formats with X player
 

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.100

and in the end at the very left we see

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.110
and in the end at the very left we see
 

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.620
and in the end at the very left we see
the default URI data source again this

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:56.630
the default URI data source again this
 

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:57.310
the default URI data source again this
is an implement

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320
is an implement
 

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.080
is an implement
creation of the data source the

00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.090
creation of the data source the
 

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.259
creation of the data source the
extractor sample source relied on and if

00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:02.269
extractor sample source relied on and if
 

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:04.740
extractor sample source relied on and if
you want to for example support

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:04.750
you want to for example support
 

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.169
you want to for example support
proprietary Network protocol you can

00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:08.179
proprietary Network protocol you can
 

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.539
proprietary Network protocol you can
implement your own data source here to

00:29:10.539 --> 00:29:10.549
implement your own data source here to
 

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:18.690
implement your own data source here to
support those protocols

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:18.700
 

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.779
so the next diagram shows the same

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:21.789
so the next diagram shows the same
 

00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:24.359
so the next diagram shows the same

object model for adaptive media play the
 

00:29:24.369 --> 00:29:29.159
object model for adaptive media play the
difference here is that we did the video

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:29.169
difference here is that we did the video
 

00:29:29.169 --> 00:29:32.849

you can only replace this tiny component

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.070
you can only replace this tiny component
 

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.909
you can only replace this tiny component
of the adaptive our way to not store

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919
of the adaptive our way to not store
 

00:31:08.919 --> 00:31:10.889
of the adaptive our way to not store
with the lowest quality but maybe with a

00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:10.899
with the lowest quality but maybe with a
 

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:13.680
with the lowest quality but maybe with a
medium quality and then replace this

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:13.690
medium quality and then replace this
 

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.009
medium quality and then replace this
component when you wire up those object

00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:17.019
component when you wire up those object
 

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:19.259
component when you wire up those object
this object model so you really have

00:31:19.259 --> 00:31:19.269
this object model so you really have
 

00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:22.349
this object model so you really have
just to replace this tiny piece of this

00:31:22.349 --> 00:31:22.359
just to replace this tiny piece of this
 

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:25.379
just to replace this tiny piece of this
object model create provide your custom

00:31:25.379 --> 00:31:25.389
object model create provide your custom
 

00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:28.169
object model create provide your custom
implementation and then in the end they

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:28.179
implementation and then in the end they
 

00:31:28.179 --> 00:31:30.389
implementation and then in the end they
work together nicely with the default

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399
work together nicely with the default
 

00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:31.250

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:38.860
 

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.610
so yeah you may say yeah but that's a

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:41.620
so yeah you may say yeah but that's a
 

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.529
so yeah you may say yeah but that's a
really a complex thing to wire up all

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:43.539
really a complex thing to wire up all
 

00:31:43.539 --> 00:31:45.480
really a complex thing to wire up all
these components right if I use media

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.490
these components right if I use media
 

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.759
these components right if I use media
player just have two lines of code and

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:47.769
player just have two lines of code and
 

00:31:47.769 --> 00:31:49.799
player just have two lines of code and
it starts playback and yeah that's true

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:49.809
it starts playback and yeah that's true
 

00:31:49.809 --> 00:31:52.649
it starts playback and yeah that's true
this flexibility or this ability to

00:31:52.649 --> 00:31:52.659
this flexibility or this ability to
 

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:54.930
this flexibility or this ability to
customize things comes with a price of

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:54.940
customize things comes with a price of
 

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.130
customize things comes with a price of
this added complexity but the good news

00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.140
this added complexity but the good news
 

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.889
this added complexity but the good news
is an extra player provides some

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:01.899
is an extra player provides some
 

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:04.620
is an extra player provides some
templates to wire up these objects

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:04.630
templates to wire up these objects
 

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.899
templates to wire up these objects
together there are templates for -

smooth streaming and HLS for example and
 

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.720
smooth streaming and HLS for example and
we have for example the - Randall

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:12.730
we have for example the - Randall
 

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.080

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:03.340
adaptive playback it's again for
 

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.720
adaptive playback it's again for
traditional media playback and it's

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:06.730
traditional media playback and it's
 

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.610
traditional media playback and it's
pretty much the same it's not that

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:08.620
pretty much the same it's not that
 

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.560
pretty much the same it's not that
complicated we have seen the diagram

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:10.570
complicated we have seen the diagram
 

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.080
complicated we have seen the diagram
there are less components which work

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:13.090
there are less components which work
 

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.850
there are less components which work
together but if you want to do

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:14.860
together but if you want to do

to do that you can copy the source code

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:33.570
to do that you can copy the source code
 

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.550
to do that you can copy the source code
into your apk or you can build a library

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560
into your apk or you can build a library
 

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.220
into your apk or you can build a library
and then put the library in your IDE but

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.230
and then put the library in your IDE but
 

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.230
and then put the library in your IDE but
the easiest way is just use a great

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240
the easiest way is just use a great
 

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.620

about the same but at runtime we have
 

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:49.400
about the same but at runtime we have
more more ways to kind of replace

maybe we can talk offline about it and

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:41.790
maybe we can talk offline about it and
 

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:48.230
maybe we can talk offline about it and
then I can ask the team yeah I guess one

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240
then I can ask the team yeah I guess one
 

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.510
then I can ask the team yeah I guess one
question that the exoplayer does the

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520
question that the exoplayer does the
 

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.640
question that the exoplayer does the
exoplayer have the capability to extract

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:52.650
exoplayer have the capability to extract
 

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:57.800
exoplayer have the capability to extract
metadata from the video and display from

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:57.810
metadata from the video and display from
 

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.840
metadata from the video and display from
what to what format let's see if your

00:40:59.840 --> 00:40:59.850
what to what format let's see if your
 

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.820
what to what format let's see if your
video source has some metadata or

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:01.830
video source has some metadata or
 

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.890
video source has some metadata or
building to it like a big four-part 10

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:03.900
building to it like a big four-part 10
 

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.930
building to it like a big four-part 10
you have on the packet headers you can

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940
you have on the packet headers you can
 

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.140
you have on the packet headers you can
put metadata on that does the exoplayer

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.150
put metadata on that does the exoplayer
 

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.700
put metadata on that does the exoplayer
have the framework to extract that

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:10.710
have the framework to extract that
 

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.830
have the framework to extract that
metadata and overlay it on the video

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:12.840
metadata and overlay it on the video
 

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.260
metadata and overlay it on the video
good question I don't know for and

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:15.270
good question I don't know for and
 

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.810
good question I don't know for and
before I know for example for HLS we are

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820
before I know for example for HLS we are
 

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.960
before I know for example for HLS we are
extracting the id3 tags and then you are

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:20.970
extracting the id3 tags and then you are
 

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.610
extracting the id3 tags and then you are
able to kind of get the information

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:22.620
able to kind of get the information
 

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.020
able to kind of get the information
companies tagged yeah that's different

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.030
companies tagged yeah that's different
 

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.700
companies tagged yeah that's different
from the closed caption that that

mean we looked at the developer guide

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:33.360
mean we looked at the developer guide
 

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.850
mean we looked at the developer guide
that I didn't see any references to the

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:34.860
that I didn't see any references to the
 

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.160
that I didn't see any references to the
metadata yeah I'm not sure maybe I'll

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.170
metadata yeah I'm not sure maybe I'll
 

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.380
metadata yeah I'm not sure maybe I'll
let us check offline and tell me I can

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:39.390
let us check offline and tell me I can
 

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:50.150

have to use one of those DRM

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380
have to use one of those DRM
 

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.830
have to use one of those DRM
technologies which are available on the

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:27.840
technologies which are available on the
 

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.780
technologies which are available on the
devices because they need the keys to be

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:29.790
devices because they need the keys to be
 

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.230
devices because they need the keys to be
in the hardware and so I think the
