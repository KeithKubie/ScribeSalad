00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.960
For this project I’m going to show you how
to make your own fire resistant rocket wadding,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.180
at home. This specially treated material prevents
your parachutes from melting during the ejection

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.230
charge, which is a must-have, if you actually
plan on getting your rocket back, in one piece.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.209
But rather than dropping fistfuls of money
on commercial recovery wadding, save your

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.769
cash and make your own, with a pinch of household
baking soda.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
For this project we’re going to need a roll
of paper towels, a box of pure baking soda, and a little bit of water.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.460
Chances are you already have a box somewhere
around the house, and if you look on the side,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.180
you’ll see that all baking soda is, is Sodium
Bicarbonate.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.370
When Sodium Bicarbonate is heated up, it releases
CO2 gas. And you may remember that Carbon

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.590
Dioxide, puts out fires, which is exactly
what we want.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.880
Let’s get busy making our fire-retarding
solution by adding 1 Teaspoon of baking soda, to 1/4 cup of water.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.280
Give it a good stir for around 10-20 seconds,
then just let it sit for a bit, until everything settles down.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.970
When the water turns clear again it’ll be
a super-saturated solution, and you might

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.500
see a little white powder at the bottom of
the glass.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.090
We don’t need that, so carefully pour the
clear liquid into another bowl slowly enough,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.729
that it leaves the undissolved powder behind.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.829
Now all you need to do is find a single sheet
of paper-towel and toss it into the bowl for about 30 seconds.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.969
Flip it over and double-check the liquid’s
soaked all the way through, and if it has,

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.380
then find a place where you can hang the wet
paper towel for a few hours to drip-dry. Preferably

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.420
at room temperature, or warmer.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.659
This amount of solution should be enough to
treat two full-size paper towels, and will

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.549
take somewhere between 4 - 24 hours to dry
out completely.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.619
Now check this out. If your paper towel is
2-ply like mine, you can grab one of the corners,

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109
and pull the two layers apart.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.990
Just like that, you’ve got twice as much
wadding, with hardly any extra effort.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.319
To finish up, simply layer the sheets together,
and cut them into squares roughly the same

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.920
size, as a square of toilet paper. And that’s
it.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
You just made 36 squares of fire-resistant
recovery wadding, for a few minutes of effort,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.709
and a pinch of baking soda.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.779
The best part is, you can make your batches
as big as you want, and it’ll only cost

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.939
you a few pennies. Which is way better than
the price you’ll pay at the hobby stores.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.759
Now just for fun, I went ahead and bought
some commercial wadding as well, so we could

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.639
open the packs up and see how they compare.

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.169
Commercial wadding kinds of look like flattened
rolls of toilet paper, and funny enough, it’s

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:09.390
even perforated to tear into little squares
as well.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.099
The packaging says the “material protects
recovery systems from hot ejection gasses”

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.030
so let’s see what they do, when we touch
them with a flame.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.459
Surprisingly, the sheet actually catches fire
and burns up in just a few seconds.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.980
Let’s compare that to the make-shift wadding
we just made, with baking soda.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.200
You can see it scorches the fabric and turns
it black, as expected, but the tissue doesn’t

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.939
actually catch fire, and won’t sustain a
flame. Instead, it just smolders slowly until

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.519
all the wadding is spent, or until the Carbon
Dioxide chokes out the embers.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.400
Now baking soda isn’t the only option for
rocket wadding. In-fact, there are all kinds

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.829
of other fire-resistant materials all around
you, perfect for the job.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.909
I just pulled a couple handfuls of cellulose
insulation out of the attic of my house, and

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.540
flame-testing this material, you can see it
doesn’t catch fire at all, and surprisingly, it won’t even smolder.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.269
Attic insulation is another cheap and easily
accessible option, and is the same stuff I

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.060
used for capping the ejection charges of my
“Screw-Lock” Sugar Motors in a previous

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.379
project. Look for how to make those from scratch
in another project video.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.930
Now just for fun, I got a 4 pack of toilet
paper rolls from the dollar store, and placed

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.590
each one in a container, filled with the baking
soda solution.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.150
A good rule of thumb for mixing your solution
is that for every 1/4 cup of water, add 1 Teaspoon of baking soda.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.670
And if you let your toilet paper roll soak
for a minute, it’ll expand enough that you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.659
can reach in and pull out the cardboard tube
with hardly any effort at all.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.069
Now to make sure the paper soaks up the solution
evenly, try putting a lid on your container

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.980
and flipping the whole thing upside down for
about a minute.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.999
Save the excess liquid so you can re-use it
with your with other rolls, then go ahead

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.640
and lay the sopping wet roll on a plate, where
it can air-dry for a couple of weeks.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.040
You could speed the process by putting it
in the oven on low heat, but that’ll increase

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.440
your energy costs, and might convert it into
Sodium Carbonate, which will make the wadding a little less effective.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.180
After about 4 weeks of patiently waiting,
you can see my roll has dried out completely.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.049
And if you look closely, you might be able
to see how the outer layer has crusted over

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.049
with baking soda crystals. Which isn’t really
a good thing, but watch this.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.019
If we simply peel off the crusty outer layer,
we’re instantly left with a soft and smooth interior.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.790
Impressively, this homemade material looks
and feels a lot like the name brand stuff

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.579
from the hobby store, and even tears into
smalls sheets the exact same way.

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.069
The difference is, our homemade version seems
to be a lot more resistant to open flames,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.080
and is only a fraction, of a fraction, of
a fraction of the price.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.290
Now if you’re planning to use homemade recovery
wadding for the “Randomizer” Rocket, made

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.360
in another video, I recommend using 6 sheets
of wadding per launch.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.100
Push the first 4 sheets into the rocket body,
one at a time, then wrap 2 more sheets around

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.860
the bottom of the parachute bundle, and nestle
it gently on top of the others.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.760
Tuck any of the loose elastic cording into
the nose-cone, then push it into position on top of the rocket.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.630
Your recovery system is now protected and
ready to spring into action, so it can safely

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.640
bring your rocket back, for another flight.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.950
And by the way, if you want to go green and
help minimize your impact on the environment,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.660
try using a head of lettuce for parachute
wadding instead.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.340
The moisture in lettuce leaves make them a
surprisingly effective alternative, and the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.360
best part is, they’re bio-degradable.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.970
Well now you know how to use ordinary household
baking soda, to make a bundle of flame-proof

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.010
recovery wadding that’s 300 times cheaper
to make yourself.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.250
That’s it for now. If you liked this project,
perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
