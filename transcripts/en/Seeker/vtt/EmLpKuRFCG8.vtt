00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.340
Imagine you could fly.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.229
Now imagine giving that up.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:05.880
WHY would you ever do that?!

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.629
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.740
Ostriches, emus, kiwis, penguins… one thing
these birds all have in common is that they

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.800
can’t fly.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.300
A non-flying bird feels like an oxymoron,
but the maybe most surprising thing about

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.800
these creatures is that they all once flew.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
They all evolved not to fly.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.530
At one point scientists thought that maybe
some of the birds living today evolved from

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.430
flightless ancestors.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
More specifically they thought this about
ratites - a diverse group of large, flightless

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.660
avians which includes ostriches, emus, and
moas.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.829
This has since been proven wrong . Thanks
to DNA studies, we now know that all of today’s

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.740
flightless birds came from ancestors that
flew, but they all independently evolved to

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.790
lose their ability to fly.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.690
And they did this all around the world.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.830
Penguins in Antarctica, steamer ducks in South
America, emus in Australia, kiwis in New Zealand,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.430
and ostriches in Africa.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.449
It’s astounding to think that given such
different environments all these varied bird

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.530
populations would go through the same type
of evolution- or convergent evolution to be

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.530
exact.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
But why would the evolution of flight loss
happen over and over again?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.680
Well, two possible explanations largely influenced
by Darwinian theory, are that changes in the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.840
environment either decreased pressure for
flying, or increased pressure to develop another

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
trait.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.710
This means that nature slowly selected for
certain traits over others, and along the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.729
way, took away some birds’ ability to fly.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.119
To illustrate how increased environmental
pressures for traits other than flying work

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.729
in practice, let’s dive into the biomechanical
explanation.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.900
In a study published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, researchers

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.729
studied different types of flying and wing-propelled
diving seabirds.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.760
By analyzing energy costs and morphology,
they found that as a bird’s functional ability

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.170
to be a good diver increases, its ability
to fly decreases - eventually to a point where

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.090
flying ceases to be possible.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.299
A larger body and short wings may help seabirds
dive and swim better and thereby help them

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.670
get more food for example, but this body type
makes taking off more difficult.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.480
In other words, penguins may have lost their
ability to fly because evolving to be better

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.000
swimmers provided a greater advantage than
flying - and the two abilities required a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
trade-off..

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.140
You can’t be both a great flier and swimmer.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.150
So, the environment puts pressure on birds
to evolve certain abilities at the expense

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.560
of others, but a lack environmental pressures
can also lead to change.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.840
If the environment doesn’t strongly require
a bird to fly, the bird may lose this ability

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.860
over time.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.060
For example, in a study published in the journal
Evolution, researchers argue that steamer

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.620
ducks eventually lost their ability to fly
in part because their South American coastal

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.500
environment was suitable to live in year round.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.530
The birds did not have a need to migrate,
and thus had little selective pressure to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.700
fly.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
Another example of diminished selective pressures
is when the dinosaurs went extinct.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.090
During this period, birds were left without
predators… so without the need to fly away

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.709
from hungry t-rex’s, the birds evolved other
qualities - the ostrich for example became

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.989
huge and better suited for running rather
than flying.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.560
This lack of predation in the environment
helps explain why so many flightless birds

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.670
are found on islands that were isolated for
extended periods of time.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.680
Why use up energy to fly when you can just
strut around?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.350
Now, these changes happened slowly over time
through natural selection, but I’d be remiss

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.129
if I didn’t also mention that you and I
and all humans are also making birds flightless

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.310
- and very quickly - through artificial selection.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.099
Our turkeys and chickens would look very different
if we weren’t breeding them to be large

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.849
and meaty for our consumption - So big that
they can no longer fly like their ancestors

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:43.849
once did.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.489
Still, while we certainly have a hand in their
flightlessness, today’s flightless birds

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.519
evolved to be this way.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.000
Which, in some cases might be good.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.269
Could you imagine how terrifying a flying
ostrich would be?

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.450
On a kind of related note, evolutionary change
doesn’t just affect living creatures - it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.069
also affects the technology we use every day.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.930

evolved since before the Internet, check out

What trait would you be thrilled to evolve
or evolve out of?

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:28.939
I’d kill for a Is there something you would
trade in for something else?
