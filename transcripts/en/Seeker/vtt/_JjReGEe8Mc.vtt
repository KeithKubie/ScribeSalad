00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.939
Politicians do seem to give off a slimy feel.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.060
Everything about them is polished and tailored
to try to get my vote.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.540
It’s kind of gross.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.490
And yet, I still vote for them.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.970
From the way they look, the way they sound,
to the words they choose.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.300
Politicians and their staffs carefully craft
their speeches and appearance to invoke emotion

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.170
in their constituents.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.829
Emotion plays a huge role in who we will vote
for.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.750
A study published in the journal Psychological
Review found that often, our moral judgements

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.450
aren’t the result of reasoning but of quick,
automatic, intuitive feelings.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.230
And politicians can use this to their advantage.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.370
They often get your vote by evoking some strong
emotion in you.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.110
Emotion tends to call people to action more
than reasoning, and unfortunately, the emotions

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.790
political candidates often invoke are anxiety
or fear.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.610
A study published in the journal Political
Psychology, found that anxiety tends to influence

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.590
our political views, especially towards certain
groups.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.759
For example, anxiety may make some people
remember negative experiences with immigrants

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.640
making them more likely to vote for a candidate
who advocates tighter immigration policies.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.999
Plus, anxiety causes people to see ambiguous
information in a more negative and threatening

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.999
light.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:22.270
And by invoking fear, politicians can rally
people around specific causes and create stronger

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.299
allegiances with those we consider like us.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.179
Even more than what politicians say, is how
they say it.

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.090
They might change the way they talk.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.240
A study published in PLOS One found a deeper
voice correlates with the idea that the politician

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.939
is stronger, more competent, and older.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.970
But deeper voices only benefit politicians
in specific instances.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.499
For example, a study published in the journal
Political Psychology looked at the 2012 U.S

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:53.209
House elections, and found if a politician's
voice was deeper and their opponent was a

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.179
female, they were less likely to win; especially
if they were male.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.859
The researchers think that a lower voice might
seem too aggressive, in that case.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.990
But it’s not just the language politicians
use, and the pitch of their voice, it’s

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.159
their body language too.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.750
Politicians need to project an image of calmness
and surety.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.110
They use “positive body language” like
keeping gestures below shoulder level and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.660
steadying their hands.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.460
According to Don Khoury, a nonverbal communication
consultant: if politicians sway or fidget

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.810
too much, this gives off vibes of arrogance,
insincerity, or low confidence, which turns

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.250
off voters.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.069
Some researchers even believe they can predict
election results on body language alone.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.670
And looks do go a long way.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.800
A study published in the journal Science found
that voters often judge the character of a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.780
political candidate based entirely on their
visual appearance, which can have huge impacts

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.000
on elections.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.549
So politicians try to appear as attractive
as possible, especially if they’re a woman,

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.010
because studies show that not only do people
prefer better looking politicians, they actually

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.700
get more media coverage.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.730
And a study published in the journal Social
Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience found

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.540
that a negatively received image, like if
they appeared threatening, was far more detrimental

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.780
to their campaign than being attractive was
helpful.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.099
So much of what we feel about politicians
and politics is so... subconscious.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.390
Your feelings are decided before you even
know it.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.360
But maybe once we start to become more aware
of political tactics, we can use our cool

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:54.930
reasoning instead of our fiery emotions to
pick the next president.
