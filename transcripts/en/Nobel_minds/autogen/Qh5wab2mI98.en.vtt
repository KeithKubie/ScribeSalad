earlier Adam we were both sort of super

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710
earlier Adam we were both sort of super
 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.420
earlier Adam we were both sort of super
achievers and we knew that when we were

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430
achievers and we knew that when we were
 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.980
achievers and we knew that when we were
trying to meld these two careers

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990
trying to meld these two careers
 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.140
trying to meld these two careers
together that we had to agree that we

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150
together that we had to agree that we
 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.409
together that we had to agree that we
would in a certain sense sacrifice our

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
would in a certain sense sacrifice our
 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.040
would in a certain sense sacrifice our
individual identities to this joint

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050
individual identities to this joint
 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.040
individual identities to this joint
effort and now that was the hardest part

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.860
because you know invitations would come

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870
because you know invitations would come
 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.259
because you know invitations would come
in and you know to give this honor

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269
in and you know to give this honor
 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.629
in and you know to give this honor
lecture that on election for many many

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:49.639
lecture that on election for many many
 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:55.539
lecture that on election for many many
years we rotated them just just one

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549
years we rotated them just just one
 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.129
years we rotated them just just one
after the other no matter who got the

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:57.139
after the other no matter who got the
 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.439
after the other no matter who got the
invitation we would rotate them or we

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449
invitation we would rotate them or we
 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.669
invitation we would rotate them or we
would get to liver joint lectures now I

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679
would get to liver joint lectures now I
 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.279
would get to liver joint lectures now I
think we're at the end where we're sort

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289
think we're at the end where we're sort
 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.069
think we're at the end where we're sort
of getting separate invitations like the

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079
of getting separate invitations like the
 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.690
of getting separate invitations like the
one to the symposium that you ran but

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700
one to the symposium that you ran but
 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.370
one to the symposium that you ran but
but in the beginning it was tough

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380
but in the beginning it was tough
 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.800
but in the beginning it was tough
especially because Joe had more of a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810
especially because Joe had more of a
 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.190
especially because Joe had more of a
reputation than I did he had published

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200
reputation than I did he had published
 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.709
reputation than I did he had published
an important paper on cholesterol and

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719
an important paper on cholesterol and
 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.590
an important paper on cholesterol and
heart attacks when he was in Seattle as

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
heart attacks when he was in Seattle as
 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.319
heart attacks when he was in Seattle as
a geneticist so he was already known in

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329
a geneticist so he was already known in
 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.749
a geneticist so he was already known in
the field of in the heart disease field

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759
the field of in the heart disease field
 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.840
the field of in the heart disease field
and I was not known at all so I think it

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850
and I was not known at all so I think it
 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.880
and I was not known at all so I think it
was very important that and if you look

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
was very important that and if you look
 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.459
was very important that and if you look
back at all of our early papers we just

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469
back at all of our early papers we just
 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.830
back at all of our early papers we just
totally rotated first authors and last

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840
totally rotated first authors and last
 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.669
totally rotated first authors and last
authors you know and that's hard for a

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679
authors you know and that's hard for a
 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.440
authors you know and that's hard for a
lot of people I think that's where most

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
lot of people I think that's where most
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.050
lot of people I think that's where most
partnerships come apart because you know

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
partnerships come apart because you know
 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.580
partnerships come apart because you know
they fight for credit or four or four

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590
they fight for credit or four or four
 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.569
they fight for credit or four or four
you know applause I mean one thing I

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
you know applause I mean one thing I
 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.440
you know applause I mean one thing I
think Joe and I share is that you know

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450
think Joe and I share is that you know
 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.929
think Joe and I share is that you know
again it sounds self-serving but but we

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939
again it sounds self-serving but but we
 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.300
again it sounds self-serving but but we
really can we really do our experiments

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
really can we really do our experiments
 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.620
really can we really do our experiments
for

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630
for
 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.500
for
our own internal satisfaction and not

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
our own internal satisfaction and not
 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.770
our own internal satisfaction and not
for external applause I think it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780
for external applause I think it's
 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.020
for external applause I think it's
really I feel so sorry for some

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
really I feel so sorry for some
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.760
really I feel so sorry for some
scientists I know are really great

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
scientists I know are really great
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.000
scientists I know are really great
scientists but they judge their progress

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
scientists but they judge their progress
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.590
scientists but they judge their progress
by you know how many papers they publish

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600
by you know how many papers they publish
 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.870
by you know how many papers they publish
in high-profile journals or how many

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
in high-profile journals or how many
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.090
in high-profile journals or how many
invitations they get or what people say

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100
invitations they get or what people say
 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.270
invitations they get or what people say
about them they're trying to impress

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280
about them they're trying to impress
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640
about them they're trying to impress
somebody else and one nice thing about

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650
somebody else and one nice thing about
 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.860
somebody else and one nice thing about
having a partnership is you I'd only

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
having a partnership is you I'd only
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.600
having a partnership is you I'd only
have one person to impress and that's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610
have one person to impress and that's
 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.340
have one person to impress and that's
him and I think it's vice versa so so it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350
him and I think it's vice versa so so it
 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.140
him and I think it's vice versa so so it
frees us up from from some of those

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
frees us up from from some of those
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.950
frees us up from from some of those
pressures so the two always tell people

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960
pressures so the two always tell people
 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.790
pressures so the two always tell people
that ask about partnership said to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800
that ask about partnership said to
 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.870
that ask about partnership said to
occupational diseases of long-term

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880
occupational diseases of long-term
 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.970
occupational diseases of long-term
collaborations like we have one is on

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
collaborations like we have one is on
 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.940
collaborations like we have one is on
astigmatism if you don't see eye to eye

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
astigmatism if you don't see eye to eye
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.400
astigmatism if you don't see eye to eye
on the big picture then you're in

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410
on the big picture then you're in
 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.750
on the big picture then you're in
trouble okay that's one thing we do

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
trouble okay that's one thing we do
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.220
trouble okay that's one thing we do
argue about details but we definitely

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
argue about details but we definitely
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.480
argue about details but we definitely
pretty much agree on the big picture in

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490
pretty much agree on the big picture in
 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.450
pretty much agree on the big picture in
like I'll tell a fellow to do an

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460
like I'll tell a fellow to do an
 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.670
like I'll tell a fellow to do an
experiment when it has advice a certain

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680
experiment when it has advice a certain
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.040
experiment when it has advice a certain
way and Michael suggest another way and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050
way and Michael suggest another way and
 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.170
way and Michael suggest another way and
the smart ones will do it both ways and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180
the smart ones will do it both ways and
 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.900
the smart ones will do it both ways and
then probably the world works and they

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
then probably the world works and they
 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.060
then probably the world works and they
come out with a better way but and then

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
come out with a better way but and then
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.770
come out with a better way but and then
the second one is ego Titus which mike

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
the second one is ego Titus which mike
 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.220
the second one is ego Titus which mike
was referring to if you try to take

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230
was referring to if you try to take
 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.210
was referring to if you try to take
credit with between the two of us and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220
credit with between the two of us and
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.400
credit with between the two of us and
and say I'd thought about this and you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
and say I'd thought about this and you
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.320
and say I'd thought about this and you
didn't and so for them something one of

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330
didn't and so for them something one of
 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.480
didn't and so for them something one of
us will have a bruised ego so that's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490
us will have a bruised ego so that's
 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.970
us will have a bruised ego so that's
what we've boarded that sort of problem

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980
what we've boarded that sort of problem
 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.070
what we've boarded that sort of problem
and the fellows and students learned if

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080
and the fellows and students learned if
 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.990
and the fellows and students learned if
they try to play one of us off on the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
they try to play one of us off on the
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.180
they try to play one of us off on the
other doesn't work so that they learned

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
other doesn't work so that they learned
 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.290
other doesn't work so that they learned
that fairly fast

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300
 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.360
you
