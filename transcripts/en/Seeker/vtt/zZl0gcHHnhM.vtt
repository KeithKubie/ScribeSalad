00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.080
Hey guys, Trace here today on World AIDS Day
for a DNews Short.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.750
AIDS is an incurable disease that occurs when
the human immunodeficiency virus has overwhelmed

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.750
the immune system.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.420
AIDS is a syndrome, a condition… while HIV
is the virus that causes it.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.349
There’s no known cure for HIV...yet.

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.829
But in a new study, researchers from the National
Institutes of Health identified an antibody

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.699
that can neutralize 98 percent of the 181
HIV strains they tested!

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.780
That's right, an antibody that can win the
fight 98 percent of the time!

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.850
This is HUGE news.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.730
HIV is a vicious virus that attacks T cells,
which protect the immune system from infections.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.120
Without proper treatment, the body’s T cell
count goes down.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.860
If it drops below 200 T cells per cubic millimeter
of blood, HIV develops into AIDS.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.980
But the researchers at the NIH think the antibody
they found can help neutralize HIV, and therefore

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.530
prevent future cases of AIDS.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.720
Quick refresher, antibodies are made by the
immune system.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.020
They are proteins that defend against dangerous
substances in the body called antigens.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.749
The antibody these researchers found is called
N6 and it fights against HIV.

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:13.749
(Go N6!)

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:18.090
HIV is one of the fastest evolving organisms
known to man.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259
One single virus can reproduce billions of
replicas in one day!

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.750
And since the copies are made so quickly,
HIV can adapt when it senses a threat and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.869
we’ve struggled to find an antibody that
can effectively respond to it… until N6!

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.430
N6 keeps up with the mutations by attaching
itself to the parts of the virus that rarely

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.180
change (rather than the parts that morph),
and neutralizing the virus.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.179
By doing this, N6 prohibits the HIV from latching
on to immune cells and attacking them, which

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.889
is what can cause HIV to develop into AIDS
.

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.749
This discovery is especially exciting because
researchers think N6 could be the key to creating

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.539
an HIV prevention vaccine and effective treatment
for the currently incurable condition.
