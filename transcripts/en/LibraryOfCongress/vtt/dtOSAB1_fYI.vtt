00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 position:72%
From the Library of Congress in Washington, DC


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000 position:73%
Anyway where I’m going to try and [inaudible]as
best I can since you’re not going to be

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.600
able to have them in front of you.


00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.220 position:80%
We’re going to begin sort of slowly kind of talking
a bit about the providence of this new acquisition.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.940 position:78%
It was originally called the Codex Quetzalecatzin.


00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.570 position:58%
We’re changing that name to the Mapa.


00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.370 position:67%
Some Codex is a little bit of a misnomer as
far as this codex, or mapa, is concerned.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.800 position:81%
It’s a single sheet as opposed to a book
and we’re gonna go with the word Mapa Quetzalecatzin

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.170
as opposed to codex.


00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.030 position:72%
The Library acquired this codex, or mapa,
just a few months ago from a private collector

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.030
in France.


00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.820 position:66%
And if you haven’t seen it, you can pull
it up on the Library’s website, the actual

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.990 position:77%
image of it while we’re talking here to
actually be able to magnify some of the sections.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.240 position:70%
So what is in front of you here is the actual
Codex as it exists right now -- there are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.890 position:67%
a couple parts of it that have been cut off
through its lifetime.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.340 position:69%
I believe it came from around 1570 and 1593.


00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.060 position:75%
And so, it is one of the rare surviving pre-1600
pictorial or manuscripts that have survived

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.780
from Mexico and Central America.


00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.730 position:78%
The crux? of the manuscript is really interesting.


00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.990 position:64%
An artifact is a really something part of
the manuscript’s history.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.770 position:64%
It was originally owned, we believe, by a
man named Alfredo Chavero.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.980 position:75%
And he was a Mexican poet, archeologist, sort
of the first people to collect Mexican folktales

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.980 position:69%
and some of the Nahua folk and Nahua poetry.


00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.670 position:77%
He donated another codex that he owned, which
is the Chavero Codex Huexotzinco, to the National

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.730
Museum of Mexico in 1906.


00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.320 position:75%
And we aren’t really sure exactly why this
particular codex did not also go to the National

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.790
Museum of Mexico at that time.


00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.350 position:75%
Instead, it was purchased by a man named Weetman
Dickinson Peerson.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.700 position:64%
And he was the First Viscount of Cowdray.


00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.260 position:72%
And he was down in Mexico at that time working
on the Tehuantepec Railroad.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.520 position:75%
When Chavero died in 1906, he actually purchased
Chavero’s entire collection and brought

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.640
it back to England with him.


00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.920 position:67%
At some point in the intervening years from
1906 to 1939 it was actually purchased by

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.130
William Randolph Hearst.


00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.250 position:75%
William Randolph Hearst, of course, has other
things here at the Library that he owned before,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.270 position:67%
which -- something like the Jefferson Bible
– which is often used for inaugurations,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.560 position:69%
used to be owned by William Randolph Hearst.


00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.770 position:73%
By 1939, The Mapa was actually purchased by
Charles Ratton, and he was a collector, gallery

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.390
owner in Paris.


00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.350
He sdfa in African tribal art.


00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.240 position:66%
He was one of the first people to actually
see African indigenous art as an art form.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.490 position:69%
He created some of the early shows at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art on tribal art and

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.760
soul tribal art also.


00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.800 position:69%
He was friends with many of the Surrealists
during this period and had a group of people

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.890
surrank him in Paris at the time.


00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.670 position:67%
His partner, Guy Ladriere, became a partner
with Ratton after the war, the World War.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:58.260 position:64%
With Ratton’s death in 1986 the Codex was
sent to Guy Ladriere.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.980 position:69%
And it is from Guy Ladriere that we actually
purchased the Codex itself just a few months

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.680
ago.


00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.450 position:69%
The Codex is, of course, it’s a Nahua codex.


00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.820 position:63%
It’s written in Nahua hieroglyphic text.


00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.210 position:66%
It takes its name from the person pictured
here who is Lord-11 Quetzalecatzin who was

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:31.090 position:73%
a nobleman, landowner in the 1450s/1460s in
the area that is kind of pictured in the Codex.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.060 position:70%
The Codex is really divided up into two parts
and we’ll talk a little bit about that in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060
just a little while.


00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.820 position:70%
But the Codex is composed of both a map on
one side and the genealogy of the family that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.990 position:73%
is going to descend from Lord11 Quetzalecatzin.


00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.130 position:66%
It is – there’s forms of text on the map
and we’ll --on the manuscript -- and we’ll

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.100
talk a little bit more about this.


00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.280
It is composed Nahua hieroglyphics.


00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.620 position:69%
For instance, the Nahua glyph for water that
we see prominently in the figure and to the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.950 position:66%
right, that is the actual glyph for water
coming out of the mountain home of Lord-11

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.770
Quetzalecatzin.


00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.520 position:77%
The piece you see in front of you, all on
here you will see that Nahua has been transcribed

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.450
into Roman script.


00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.240 position:75%
One of the great things about this particular
codex is that the script is very, very readable.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.520 position:70%
But the genealogical part has not been worked
out at this point and we’ll talk a little

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.370
more about that in just a bit.


00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:50.260 position:80%
The Codex, as I said, is divided up into several
parts and the left side of the Mapa is a genealogy.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.970 position:67%
And it’s a genealogy of a particular family
that is named the Domp DeLeon family.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.750 position:67%
And the whole family descends down from the
Lord-11 Quetzalecatzin all the way down to

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.090
the last member, who died in 1593.


00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.700 position:67%
1593 is actually written in Arabic numerals
on the manuscript itself.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.330 position:69%
The genealogy is composed, of course, of the
images of the various members of the family

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.580 position:69%
who are named in both the Nahua hieroglyphic
text and in the Roman transcription.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.690 position:64%
And what we ought to see is the numerical
colindrix?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.870 position:64%
associated with the years of their reign.


00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.880 position:70%
One of the interesting things about the Codex
is it talks about the people who are here

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.940 position:78%
not as rulers, as overseers of property, Overseers
of the rural farmers.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.060 position:70%
We are seeing a group of noble landlords here
who are making this document, at least as

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.580 position:75%
it appears to us now, as a quasi-legal document.


00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.540 position:69%
Scholars who study manuscripts like this,
like Elizabeth Boone hill, for example, have

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.480 position:72%
talked about these manuscripts acquiring this,
sort of, quasi-legal status in the late 16th

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.480
century.


00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.020 position:67%
Basically, it was a time when a lot of the
noble rights and privileges and titles were

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.580
being called into question??


00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.680 position:70%
So, the manuscript kind of reasserts some
of the powers of the noblemen during a period

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.340
when they were very much at risk.


00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:39.630 position:70%
We should concentrate our time this afternoon
on looking on the map side as opposed to the

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.300
genealogical side.


00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:48.840 position:70%
The map side is really interesting because
a lot of the place names that we find on the,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.310 position:63%
map itself and on the manuscript itself.


00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.740 position:78%
There’s a lot of really interesting hieroglyphics.


00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.810 position:78%
There’s a lot of interesting phonetic compliments,
which I’ll talk about in just a bit, and

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:07.250 position:70%
also just a lot of ethnobotanical information
that the manuscript kind of puts forward.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.680 position:64%
Now when we [inaudible] a manuscript like
this, it’s not a single person.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.800 position:77%
It’s not just me as the curator of the collection
who’s involved.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.550 position:66%
It requires a real team of people and our
conservators, people like Betsy Haude? and

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.700 position:66%
Silvia Albro who specialize in manuscripts
like this, and some of our science people,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.900 position:66%
Finla France?, Megan Wilson?, did a lot of
work basically verifying that what we were

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.920 position:73%
looking at was actually the Mapa Quetzalecatzin
from this date.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.500 position:66%
And so I just wanted to mention that this
was really a team effort and it’s not just

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.750 position:67%
a single person who’s acquiring these for
the Library and it’s important for everyone

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.800
to kind of realize that.


00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.240 position:69%
We can see that some of the things that show
this is the genealogy of the people in the

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.310
family.


00:08:54.310 --> 00:09:01.560 position:75%
You can see the name written there: Domp Deleon,
and the pictures of the various family members

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.780 position:63%
who are in fact named on the manuscript.


00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:15.560 position:73%
Now, outside there are probably, at least
from a graphic standpoint and form a linguistic

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.530 position:75%
standpoint, an extremely interesting manuscript.


00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.210 position:67%
This is just a portion of some of the hills
that we see.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:28.630 position:69%
These are actually portraying hills and I’ll
show you why that is in just a moment.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.800 position:69%
We can see here the Nahua glyph for that and
these sort of, schematic representations of

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.650
hills and landscape.


00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:43.600 position:70%
And that manuscript is both an ethnobotanical
document it is also an actual map and we’ll

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.030 position:66%
go into a little bit about what that looks
like in just a couple of minutes.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:55.430 position:77%
Now if we start looking at some of the place
names, the most common words on the map basically

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.690
form themselves like this.


00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:04.270 position:75%
We can see here that we have the Nahua place
name, which is written on the map, and basically

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.490 position:58%
we see this little image of a flower.


00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:16.310 position:70%
And this flower is the Nahua word for the
Plumeria rubra, which is a tiny little flower

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.870
but it is a phonetic complement.


00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:24.090 position:66%
Basically, it is allowing the person who’s
reading the map to actually pronounce the

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.940
similarities in the two words.


00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.340 position:75%
So, a lot of the place names on this utilized
ethnobotanical information in order to construct

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.720 position:69%
these phonetic compliments along through the
toponyms.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:45.420 position:77%
For a little bit more explicit this is one,
for instance, we have, basically the translations

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.430
is a hill built with red agave.


00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:56.290 position:69%
And the red agave plant, which I show here,
basically the Nahua name kind of sounds like

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.290
this.


00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.160 position:64%
And this is a typical way that these kind
of things are going to be formed.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:09.000 position:64%
So we really see the the hill and then we
see the agave plant representing the word

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.230
for the hill filled with red agave.


00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:17.020 position:69%
There are several people who worked on some
of the the glyphic break downs here and some

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.980 position:72%
of the linguistic breakdowns and the toponyms.


00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.340 position:66%
I, Myself have been working on them at the
same time as an independent scholar named

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:33.080 position:86%
Matthew McGath who sent me some of his interpretations,
some of which were better? than the ones that

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080
I were working on.


00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.780 position:72%
So I just want to give him credit for actually
working through some of these at the same

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.000
time I was.


00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.500 position:67%
But it is typical [inaudible] if we can see
a Nahua word broken down like this.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:53.610 position:61%
So we see “Tepe” for hill, “tiauh”
for red, “me” for the agave plant, “yoh

00:11:53.610 --> 00:12:00.520 position:64%
“ is the suffix and basically this entire
word is “the hill filled with red agave.”

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.410 position:70%
Other place names are a little more difficult
to figure out what they are.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:13.890 position:72%
This one for instance, is actually the Nahua
word for a certain bromeliad species of plant.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.060 position:70%
I’m not really sure what the actual bromeliad
is at this point, I can only get it down to

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.740
the generic name.


00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.250 position:67%
And we’ll talk about some of the sources
that have kind of allowed me to get at what

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:31.920 position:70%
these names actually mean and what the actual
plants that are being talked about on the

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920
map are.


00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:40.780 position:84%
But these are all place names, these are all
toponyms which are reflecting a certain ethnobotanical

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:47.180 position:72%
or df botanical naming of certain plants which
are very common in the region.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.130 position:75%
We all know that the codex also has some varying
glyphic work.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:59.540 position:69%
For instance here is the glyph for stone and
we also see [inaudible].

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.400 position:66%
This kind of thing that occurs on the map.


00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.190 position:70%
Also I just want to point out that these kind
of things, especially the stone and several

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:14.500 position:86%
other glyphs of this type occur in other ethnobotanical
manuscripts, other manuscripts that have an

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.050
ethnobotanical import.


00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:25.420 position:72%
This is the *name* manuscript it is an early
Nahua manuscript which vaguely shows medicinal

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.980
plants used throughout the region.


00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.850 position:69%
And you’ll see that some of the root systems
in fact, have stone glyphs in them.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.840 position:66%
So these plants, these particular kinds of
plants, grow in rocky soil.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:47.400 position:66%
And so we see the same kind of information
being portrayed on the Codex itself.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.890 position:86%
The sources for this kind of information,
this sort of decipherment of these, this ethnobotanical

00:13:53.890 --> 00:14:02.450 position:75%
information, one of our best sources is Bernardo
de Sahagun’s History of New Spain.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:07.070 position:78%
And Sahagun was a very interesting anthropologist.


00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:13.250 position:75%
He sent out different kinds of surveys to
the Nahua people in the area and got information

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.250
back.


00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:21.340 position:70%
And basically, he listed customs and his work
is an enchiconpidaia of sort of Aztec and

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.510
Nahua customs.


00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:28.850 position:64%
One of the most interesting parts of that
is really the botanical manuscripts which

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.740 position:73%
he, and the botanical names which he collected.


00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:37.470 position:67%
Some of the sadfaf from the manuscript that
are talking about sdfa are identical with

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.950
those found in Sahagun.


00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.110 position:63%
Here I’ve got actually some of the stuff
on the agave plant.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.480 position:69%
We saw the hill filled with red agave on the
manuscript.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:55.690 position:67%
Our manuscript, we believe, dates between
1570 and 1593 so it is contemporaneous with

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.440
Sahagun’s work.


00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.290 position:67%
And some of the plants are pictured kind of
in the same way.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:10.960 position:77%
Sahagun writes a great deal on the agave plants
and many of the plants that are on the manuscript

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.320
itself.


00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.730 position:73%
He talked about the agave as being an extremely
important plant to the Nahua.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:25.510 position:70%
He talks about a certain white wine is the
way he says I, but obviously a fermented kind

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.440 position:64%
of beverage was added to various kinds of
medicine.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.890 position:72%
And the agave plant features quite prominently
on the Mapa Quetzalecatzin.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:42.700 position:69%
Another thing for this kind of information
is just go to Hernandez’s Plants and Animals

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.710 position:67%
and Minerals of New Spain: A New History of
Plants and Animals.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.660 position:67%
Hernandez is an extremely important source,
he is writing in Latin.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.350 position:72%
Manuscripts, in fact, were not published until
after his death.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:04.360 position:67%
They were actually published by the Society
of Linksdfa, which Galileo was a member of,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.420 position:63%
and they were published in Rome in 1651.


00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.840 position:72%
The book is an amazing compendium of botanical
information.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:18.220 position:67%
It’s unfortunately never been translated
into English, it is written in Latin and in

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.230
Nahua.


00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:26.170 position:67%
There are some extremely interesting events
that Hernandez talks about.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:32.190 position:83%
One that I’ll point out is that the Ololiúqui
here, which is one of the great Aztec hallucinogenics

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.260
and was one of the most mysterious?


00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.950 position:73%
plant for a very long time until it was finally
identified as a morning glory in the 1960s.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:44.670 position:84%
And it sort of set of the sort of 1960s hallucinogenic
craze.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:50.500 position:72%
It was indemnified by a botanist named Richard
Evans Schultes . And so, even though we have

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.070 position:67%
this beautiful picture of the plant, no one
could actually identify what it was until

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.300
a much later period.


00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.270 position:70%
Hernandez talks about several different types
of agave.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:08.840 position:67%
The way it’s talked about on the Codex it’s
filled with the [inaudible] and that is the

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.170 position:67%
root of the whole series of different kinds
of plants.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:19.100 position:70%
Several of which are talked about on the Mapa
Quetzalecatzin.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.770 position:78%
On the Codex there are a number of other different
kinds of place names.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:30.930 position:69%
Here we have the Nahua word for Valley of
the Lizards and beautiful leaf pictured with

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.680
a lizard on it.


00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.530 position:63%
And so there’s a lot of place names like
this.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.320
Here we have Hummingbird Hill.


00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:45.930 position:64%
You can see the hummer here and the Nahua
word for hummingbird above it.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.660 position:69%
Some of the place name are a little bit more
interesting or a little bit stranger.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:58.740 position:67%
We have the Pueblo Tetelln which is “among
the mounds” and you can see very faded here

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.370
– here is the actual Nahua word.


00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.850
You can see these mounds.


00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.550 position:77%
And I’m not sure if these slayed prisoners
have something to do with the mounds or something

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.850
to do with the river.


00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:15.210 position:67%
So it’s an extremely interesting place name
that we find on the Codex.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.670 position:64%
One of the most prominent features in the
map is Atoyac River.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.270 position:66%
And this is the river that runs the length
of the Codex.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:31.550 position:72%
And we know it’s the Atoyac River because
in fact, we are told that again, on the Codex.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:39.560 position:75%
And there’s a few things that are not indigenous
on the Mapa itself.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:45.180 position:64%
There’s a couple of churches on the which
just – on the map.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.060 position:64%
And, those two churches -- there’s one on
the very top, if you’re looking at a full

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.450 position:59%
figure, and there’s one at the bottom.


00:18:52.450 --> 00:19:00.390 position:66%
They are actually in fact named with their
Nahua names and we can identify what these

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.490
two churches are.


00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:07.730 position:69%
This is the second one, there’s just a very
light bit of text right here which you can’t

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.980 position:77%
read, but under imaging we were about to actually
read what this text is.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:20.700 position:73%
And so, we can actually construct where it
is, in fact, that this map is actually showing.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.370 position:67%
And although we can’t trace what are the
Hill of Red Agave or what the Lizard Valley

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:32.450 position:77%
is we can see, in fact, that this is the location
if the northernmost church, which still survives,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:38.980 position:75%
which is the Church of Todos Santos in Ecatepec,
and then we have the Church of Santa Cruz.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.540 position:69%
And these two churches still exist and this
is -- the actual Mapa is oriented toward the

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.670 position:67%
northeast so the top is, in fact – or the
northwest, the top is towards the, this top

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.020 position:66%
is actually should be oriented towards the
northwest.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:59.430 position:64%
And really, the area that we’re talking
about now, most of the Codex, most of the

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:08.210 position:64%
genealogical parts that we see talk about
these particular rulers not as rulers but

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.080
really as keepers.


00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.780 position:64%
And talking about them as people who keep
the land or who rent out the land.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:25.630 position:72%
And so, we’re really seeing a group of people
who are renting out, or sdfa obviously, pieces

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:32.110 position:67%
of the territory from the northernmost part
here, north of Mexico City, to a little bit

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.490
south of Puebla.


00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.240 position:69%
And I’m not really sure what the attachments
to each of the -- either of the particular

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.340 position:64%
places is, we see a lot of imagery on the
Codex of the wind god.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.190 position:70%
There’s a small lake on the Codex put onto
the left hand side which says it’s the source

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.190
of the winds.


00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:57.950 position:64%
The Atoyac River, by the way, flows right
through the valley here, so the Codex, or

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:03.520 position:67%
the Mapa, is actually showing the river and
this particular piece of land.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.480 position:67%
So it’s a fairly interesting mapa from the
point that we can actually figure out where

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:16.680 position:72%
the territory is quite easily because of those
two (post)colonial Spanish churches that exist

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.060
on the map itself.


00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:26.140 position:70%
Now, maps like this are interesting primary
source documents, not only for what they show

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:35.140 position:81%
us about the Nahua culture, but also for what
they say about how the maps are in fact constructed.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.910 position:64%
And what we found on our particular codex
here is that the pigment’s that are used,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:48.140 position:78%
at least the red and the blue, the blue is
Maya blue, which is indigo mixed with a particular

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:55.420 position:70%
kind of clay, and the red is Cochineal, which
is the extract of a scale insect that lives

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.740 position:61%
on a particular kind of cactus locally.


00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:07.180 position:75%
So some of that information is quite interesting
in relating it to the actual practice of making

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.610
these kinds of manuscripts.


00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:17.160 position:69%
This manuscript has the interesting problem,
or the interesting [inaudible] is actually

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:23.420 position:77%
on European paper, so multiple pieces of European
paper kind of glued together as opposed to

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:30.030 position:75%
the traditional amatwa paper that we would
see in some of the other codexes at the Library.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:36.960 position:75%
Those Oztoipac Lands Map, which will be the
subject of the next webinar, and the Huexotzinco

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:43.670 position:72%
Codex are bsoth on indigenous paper as opposed
to this particular codex that we’re dealing

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.670
with here.


00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:54.870 position:70%
Now, some things that we can hope for in the
future on research on this codex, it has been

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:01.840 position:72%
in private hands for more than a hundred years
and has not been that accessible to scholars

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.360
around the world.


00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.400 position:69%
The Library Of Congress obtained the final
[inaudible] of the Codex which was completed

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.110 position:66%
in late last year, in late November, early
December.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.710 position:70%
And the Library has in fact scanned the Codex
immediately.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.450 position:77%
The Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, actually
participated in the scanning of the manuscript

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.950 position:56%
and we put it up online immediately.


00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:32.360 position:70%
So all of the high-resolution digital images
of the Codex are out there for anyone to look

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:39.230 position:66%
at or study and we’re hoping that people
will grab onto that and we will be able to

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.830 position:69%
get a lot more information on the history
of the Codex and the genealogy of the family

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.680 position:61%
and really what the Codex was made for.


00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:55.860 position:67%
One of the opening questions in the history
of this particular manuscript is “for what

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.160
purpose was it actually made?”


00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.980 position:67%
And we’re looking forward to all of you
out there who are interested and all of the

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:10.790 position:63%
scholars of Nahua who might listen in to
With that, I’ll just say that there’s

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.660
a couple of new webinars coming.


00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:21.880 position:67%
For these webinars, you can see the date in
front of you.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:31.360 position:69%
One is on April 11th, one on May 9th and I
can open it up for questions and we can have

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.600
a discussion.


00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.610 position:66%
Thanks so much John that was wonderful and
fascinating.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.760 position:66%
If there’s any questions that you have in
the chat, we have some questions about the

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.720 position:63%
size, should I put the dimensions there.


00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.280 position:67%
And as to the ethnobotanical work, the link
is there.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:57.230 position:91%
But if there are any others, by all means, please add them
in the chat

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.230 position:97%
This has been a presentation of the Library of Congress. Visit us at loc.gov
