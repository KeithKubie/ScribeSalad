We said earlier that the square root of the number n is just a number that when

00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.568
multiplied by itself, gives us n. Let's pick a real number to make this more

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:15.081
concrete for ourselves, though. Right now, I am feeling 3. 3 is the number that

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:20.075
I want to use right now. But what number times itself gives us 3? Well, we just

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:24.595
said that was the whole point of square roots. So clearly, the square root of 3

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:29.270
times the square root of 3 equals 3. But this is interesting. The square root of

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.775
3 times the square root of 3 is just the square root of 3 squared. So, what does

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:38.270
this mean for square roots in terms of exponents? What if I wanted to rewrite

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:44.703
this as 3 to some power, all of that squared, equals 3. What number belongs in

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:45.432
this box?
