00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:09.550
(gentle piano music)

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.388
- [Announcer] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:13.764
Bipedal,

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:14.945
naked,

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:16.112
large-brained.

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.676
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:25.893
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:29.263
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.346
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.897
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:37.504
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.587
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.029
We shape the future

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:45.529
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.191
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.358
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:58.206
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.289
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:32.722
(energetic electronic music)

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.199
- So yes, I'm gonna talk to you,

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.280
primarily I'm gonna start with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040
a discussion about what fear is,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.207
because my views on this have
crystallized in recent years.

00:01:57.207 --> 00:02:00.525
And if you know anything about what I do,

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.637
you probably don't really know what I do,

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:06.804
because it's been misrepresented
quite a bit over the years.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.995
So, fear, I think most of us will agree,

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:15.944
is an awareness that there's
a threat to well-being

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:17.790
that's present or imminent.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.572
And this can be in the form

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.903
of these kinds of
biological or social cues

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:25.575
that have the potential to cause us harm.

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:28.429
And when we encounter these
kinds of threatening events,

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.644
a lot of things happen
in our brains and bodies

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:34.219
that some of them are
recognizable by others.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.727
And that's how we judge someone else

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.057
as being fearful or anxious.

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:40.160
But others are more internal,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.910
and we can only judge in ourselves

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.160
in terms of body responses.

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.903
Of course, we can
measure these objectively

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:49.007
if we hook a person up

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.945
to some sort of physiological recording.

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:54.871
But the most important part of fear

00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.141
is the internal awareness
that you're in danger.

00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:02.771
Now, the traditional view
of how this comes about,

00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.714
and I'm partly responsible for this,

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:09.560
is that this part of the
brain called the amygdala,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.042
which you heard about a bit
earlier, is a fear center.

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:18.125
That is a view that is
widely cast in the culture

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:21.911
and in the scientific circles as well.

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.502
The idea is that the
threat in the outside world

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:26.864
is processed by sensory systems.

00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:28.392
That reaches the amygdala.

00:03:28.392 --> 00:03:30.248
It arouses the state of fear.

00:03:30.248 --> 00:03:31.959
And fear causes these behavioral

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.267
and physiological responses.

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.188
Now, when I talked about fear

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:38.671
as being involved in the amygdala,

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.882
which I've done for almost 30 years now,

00:03:41.882 --> 00:03:44.296
the idea was that what
the amygdala was doing

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:49.054
was processing implicitly,
or non-consciously, threats,

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:51.213
and that the conscious experience of fear

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:53.322
was coming about through
a different mechanism,

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:56.085
which I proposed was in the neocortex.

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:58.266
And I'll describe that a bit later.

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:02.433
But what carried forth in the
scientific and lay culture

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:07.711
is that I said that
fear is in the amygdala.

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:09.870
And I think that this is wrong.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.560
And that's what I want to help clarify

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.103
as we move forward today.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:14.266
So, what's wrong with the idea?

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:17.816
Well, the idea is based on
two kinds of observations.

00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:20.983
One is that when a person or an animal

00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:25.777
has some problem with their amygdala,

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:28.138
they no longer respond to threats

00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:30.605
in a way that you can measure,

00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:33.495
like behaviorally or physiologically.

00:04:33.495 --> 00:04:36.745
And secondly, when an animal or a human

00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:42.278
is exposed to a threat, activity
increases in the amygdala.

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:44.220
So these two things kind of suggest

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.365
that the amygdala is processing threats.

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:47.875
And that has led to the conclusion

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:50.939
that the amygdala is the source of fear.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.986
But that I link is a leap
that's too far to make.

00:04:53.986 --> 00:04:57.020
So why is that a leap that's too far?

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.970
Well, behavioral and
physiological responses

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.964
don't always correlate

00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:05.058
with subjectively-reported
experiences of fear.

00:05:05.058 --> 00:05:08.092
Medications that are used
to treat fear and anxiety

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:10.397
are more likely to change
behavioral responses

00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:12.482
like avoidance or timidity

00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:15.666
and physiological
responses like hyperarousal

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:18.064
than the subjective feeling of fear.

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:20.700
And, as a result of point two there,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.002
all of the major drug companies

00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:24.222
are pulling out of the anti-fear,

00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:26.444
anti-anxiety medication business,

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:30.141
because they view the results of efforts

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:34.758
to develop new and better
treatments as a failure.

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:37.157
They don't consider a reduction

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:39.460
in behavior and physiology a success,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.067
because the patient doesn't
feel less fearful or anxious.

00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:45.024
So the therapist is disappointed.

00:05:45.024 --> 00:05:46.569
The patient is disappointed.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.878
And the drug companies are disappointed.

00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:49.711
(audience laughs)

00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:51.039
So, number three.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.046
Threats elicit amygdala activity

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:55.175
in behavioral and physiological responses

00:05:55.175 --> 00:05:57.108
in the absence of subjective awareness

00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:58.890
that the stimulus exists,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.429
as in Nick Humphrey's famous
blindsight situations.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.768
In humans rather than monkeys, though.

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:07.964
And without any feeling of fear.

00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:10.782
So this can be done through
studies of blindsight,

00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:12.564
but also through studies

00:06:12.564 --> 00:06:17.198
of so-called subliminal
presentations of stimuli,

00:06:17.198 --> 00:06:19.166
where stimuli are presented very briefly

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:21.765
or masked by some other kind of stimulus.

00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:22.873
The stimulus is present.

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:24.274
It's a threat.

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:26.414
The person doesn't feel fear.

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:28.615
And yet the amygdala is still activated,

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:30.714
and the responses are still expressed.

00:06:30.714 --> 00:06:34.281
Fear is not the cause of those responses.

00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.114
And finally, damage to
the amygdala in a human

00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:41.566
eliminates the behavioral
and physiological responses,

00:06:41.566 --> 00:06:44.523
but not subjective feelings of fear.

00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:46.496
So all of this to me suggests

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:48.530
that fear is not coming
out of the amygdala,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.649
but someplace else.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.811
So, we'll put an X through
this fear circuit view.

00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:58.978
And first we want to redefine
what the amygdala does.

00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:01.915
I think one way to describe it

00:07:01.915 --> 00:07:04.882
that is semantically more neutral

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:08.215
and doesn't imply that fear is emerging,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.095
bubbling up out of the amygdala,

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:14.093
is to simply call it a
defensive survival circuit.

00:07:14.093 --> 00:07:16.454
Every animal has to detect
and respond to danger,

00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:18.530
as we heard about birds being able

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.720
to detect and respond to danger.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.051
And I was happy to hear that
fear didn't come up there.

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:27.557
It was described as responses
to danger and threat.

00:07:27.557 --> 00:07:29.773
So every animal from a worm to a human

00:07:29.773 --> 00:07:32.027
has to be able to detect
and respond to danger

00:07:32.027 --> 00:07:33.337
in order to stay alive.

00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:36.720
Even bacterial cells have to
detect and respond to danger.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.146
So detecting, responding to danger

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.571
has nothing to do with psychology.

00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:43.730
It's there to keep the organism alive.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.466
And if you have some kind of psychology

00:07:45.466 --> 00:07:47.532
because of the kind of brain you have,

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:49.575
then you become aware
that you're in danger

00:07:49.575 --> 00:07:51.572
and you experience fear.

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:54.934
So, threats activate a
defensive survival circuit

00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:57.909
that non-consciously
controls defensive responses.

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:59.062
And humans have inherited

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.869
this defensive survival
circuit from animals,

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:05.313
but not the conscious experience of fear.

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:07.174
So, if the amygdala is
not the source of fear,

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:08.632
how does it come about?

00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:09.465
I have to say,

00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:11.135
it comes about like any
other conscious experience.

00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:13.623
Now, we might argue about
how that comes about.

00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:15.078
And there are some experts in the room

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.157
that may not agree with me.

00:08:16.157 --> 00:08:18.490
But my own position is that,

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:21.084
once we understand consciousness,

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:23.976
we'll get an understanding
of emotions for free.

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:24.809
(audience laughs)

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:28.021
So, my shot at it is something like this,

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:31.313
which is an idea that really started

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:35.456
when I was doing split-brain
work in the 1970s

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.088
as a graduate student.

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:37.999
And I won't go into that.

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:39.802
But the idea is that,

00:08:39.802 --> 00:08:42.271
and I proposed this model in 1984,

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.906
before I did any research on fear itself.

00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:47.372
But the basic idea is that the
threat comes into the brain

00:08:47.372 --> 00:08:50.088
and it's processed through
different kinds of channels.

00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:52.121
There are connections from sensory systems

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.399
into this defensive survival circuit

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.941
that control these behavioral
and physiological responses,

00:08:57.941 --> 00:09:00.339
and then two cortical areas

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.534
where you have processes like
attention and working memory

00:09:03.534 --> 00:09:06.902
that can put things together
and hold them in mind.

00:09:06.902 --> 00:09:11.409
And one of the things that can
be added into working memory

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:14.819
is the fact that this defensive
survival circuit is active

00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:17.451
and that you're getting feedback
from the body and so forth.

00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:20.602
And all of this kind of
coalesces in the mind

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.199
to make fear a cognitive event,

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:26.501
not an innate feeling inherited
from animal ancestors.

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:27.537
So, I'm not saying

00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:30.180
that animals have no
conscious experiences,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.571
no subjective experiences
of fear or anxiety

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.924
or anything like that.

00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:35.848
But if they do, they're
probably very different

00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:39.015
from the kinds of experiences we have.

00:09:41.909 --> 00:09:45.653
Well, so why is this
kind of theory needed?

00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:47.198
For one reason,

00:09:47.198 --> 00:09:50.188
fear doesn't have an exclusive
contract with the amygdala,

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:52.090
which is generally thought to be

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.294
a kind of predatory defense system.

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.281
We can be afraid.

00:09:56.281 --> 00:09:58.984
We can have fear from starvation,

00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:02.705
dehydration, hypothermia,
reproductive isolation,

00:10:02.705 --> 00:10:05.467
each of which depends on
other survival circuits.

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:09.031
So the key is not that
the amygdala is activated,

00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:11.420
but that you have some kind of activity

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.344
that threatens your existence

00:10:13.344 --> 00:10:16.301
or potentially causes you harm.

00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:18.911
So what we feel depends
on what kinds of signals

00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:21.050
are being processed in working memory,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.546
including signals from survival circuits,

00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:26.506
but other signals as well.

00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:30.377
So, rather than having a
kind of subcortical circuit,

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:32.719
one for each kind of basic emotion,

00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:35.917
I propose that the cortical cognitive

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:39.748
higher-order representation of information

00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:42.403
accounts for emotional and
non-emotional experiences

00:10:42.403 --> 00:10:44.335
in one kind of basic system.

00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:46.661
And I won't have time to
go into any of the evidence

00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.111
for all of this right now,

00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:52.625
but I'd like to make
analogize it by explaining

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:54.838
how you make soup, which you all know.

00:10:54.838 --> 00:10:57.211
You take water, onions, garlic, carrots,

00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.155
all kinds of ingredients,
put them into the pot.

00:11:00.155 --> 00:11:02.696
And none of these are soup ingredients.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.622
They're things that exist in nature

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.411
that when combined in a
certain way make soup.

00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:09.884
And I think emotions
are like this as well.

00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.756
We have lots of things in our brain

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:13.252
that are there for various reasons,

00:11:13.252 --> 00:11:15.732
like sensory processing,
survival circuits,

00:11:15.732 --> 00:11:17.223
brain arousal, body feedback,

00:11:17.223 --> 00:11:20.165
attention, semantic
memory, episodic memory,

00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:22.415
implicit fear schema, monitoring,

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.932
awareness that you are in
danger, interpretation.

00:11:24.932 --> 00:11:28.064
Most of these have nothing
to do with fear or emotion.

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:30.671
They're simply things that exist

00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:33.921
to allow you to accomplish other goals.

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:38.927
So when you put them
together in a particular way,

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:40.598
fear is what results.

00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:44.040
Now, this kind of re-schematizes all this.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.126
On the left side of the diagram,

00:11:46.126 --> 00:11:47.607
we have things that would be contributing

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:50.817
to regular, old conscious
experience, non-emotional states.

00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.842
And on the right side,
there are ingredients

00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:56.519
that begin to tilt it in a
kind of emotional direction.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:01.440
And you can see the survival
circuit multiplicity there

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.734
that can generate activity
that will help tilt it

00:12:04.734 --> 00:12:06.739
in one way or the other.

00:12:06.739 --> 00:12:10.761
But there are a couple of
important things on this

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:12.064
I want to point out.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:15.563
On the two sides of the
vertical line there,

00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:17.822
self schema and emotion schema.

00:12:17.822 --> 00:12:20.710
I think these are both very important.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.389
Unless you have an awareness

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:25.929
that the danger is happening to you,

00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:28.653
there's no fear or any
other kind of emotion.

00:12:28.653 --> 00:12:30.733
In order to be emotional,

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:32.490
you have to realize that it's you

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.407
that is experiencing the situation.

00:12:36.638 --> 00:12:39.018
A threat might cause you to
respond in a certain way,

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:41.357
but if you don't know that
it's happening to you,

00:12:41.357 --> 00:12:42.857
you're not afraid.

00:12:44.586 --> 00:12:45.419
Now, you might say,

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:47.927
"Well, I can be afraid or
worried about my children

00:12:47.927 --> 00:12:48.851
"if I see them in danger."

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.038
But your children are, in
effect, part of who you are.

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.080
As are the, William James says,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.793
"A man's yacht is part of who he is."

00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:57.626
(audience laughs)

00:12:57.626 --> 00:13:01.793
So, I think, I would be very
unhappy if I lost my guitar,

00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:06.634
because it is such an
important part of who I am.

00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:08.680
So I think self schema are very important,

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.476
but also emotion schema.

00:13:10.476 --> 00:13:14.682
As the child begins to grow
up and experience the world

00:13:14.682 --> 00:13:17.216
and come across dangerous situations,

00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:18.639
they're told what danger is.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:20.584
They may experience danger themselves.

00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:23.010
They observe it on TV and in movies.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.549
They build up these schemas
about what danger is

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:27.153
and when fear occurs

00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:30.969
so that when you have
these kinds of schema,

00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:34.529
it's very easy to pattern
complete the entire representation

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:38.182
of what fear is with just a
few, or maybe even one, element.

00:13:38.182 --> 00:13:40.771
If a threat is present,
you're probably moving

00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:43.780
towards a cognitive pattern completion

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.014
that the situation is one in
which you're feeling fear.

00:13:47.014 --> 00:13:49.126
Add in the fact that
escape is not possible

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:51.470
and that your heart is
beating fast and so forth,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.690
and bingo you've got the whole closed up.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.734
So, the idea that emotions are
cognitively assembled states

00:13:57.734 --> 00:14:00.357
made by the information
available to working memory

00:14:00.357 --> 00:14:03.496
is related to Levi-Strauss's
notion of bricolage.

00:14:03.496 --> 00:14:06.572
In French, this means
to put things together

00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:08.862
from items that happen to be available.

00:14:08.862 --> 00:14:10.582
He emphasized the importance
of the individual,

00:14:10.582 --> 00:14:11.596
the bricoleur,

00:14:11.596 --> 00:14:14.957
and the social context in
the construction process.

00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:18.558
Others note that maybe
persons, objects, contexts,

00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:20.310
the sequence and fabric of everyday life

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.758
are the medium through which
emotions come into being,

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:25.703
a day-to-day kind of emotional bricolage.

00:14:25.703 --> 00:14:27.376
In the brain, working
memory can be thought of

00:14:27.376 --> 00:14:28.640
as the bricoleur,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.559
and the content of emotional
consciousness as the bricolage.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.195
So, if emotions are
cognitive events in circuits

00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:38.483
that differ in significant ways
in humans and other animals,

00:14:38.483 --> 00:14:40.360
including other primates,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.882
then emotions we experience,

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:43.833
including emotions related to death,

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:47.465
may be unique and unparalleled
in the animal kingdom.

00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:50.011
Add language and culture
to the emotional equation,

00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:51.770
and the case strengthens.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.708
So, animals may have
subjective experiences

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:56.183
but can't have the kinds
of experiences we have.

00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:59.052
Or at least that's how I think about it.

00:14:59.052 --> 00:15:01.968
So, second part of my title is

00:15:01.968 --> 00:15:03.968
Is Fear of Death a Fear?

00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:07.928
Fear, formally defined, is the awareness

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:10.534
that a threat to your
well-being is present.

00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:12.702
Anxiety is the expectation or worry

00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:15.853
that your well-being may be
compromised in the future.

00:15:15.853 --> 00:15:19.730
Many situations described as
fears are really anxieties.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.536
But fear and anxiety are
really conjoined twins.

00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:25.164
Even in a clear case of bodily threat,

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:28.090
fear quickly morphs into
worry about the future.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.374
A snake at your feet causes you to freeze

00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:32.453
and feel fear of bodily harm.

00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:35.305
But that's soon complemented,
if not overtaken,

00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:37.978
by worries about what will
happen if you're bitten.

00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:39.455
Will you die?

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.534
Will you get to the
emergency room in time?

00:15:41.534 --> 00:15:44.091
Will they have antidote and so forth?

00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:45.544
And death is always in the future,

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:49.711
so it's a worry, or an
anxiety, rather than a fear.

00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:53.003
Fear and anxiety are products
of the same cortical system

00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:54.496
in my theory.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:56.699
But different subcortical
circuits are part

00:15:56.699 --> 00:16:00.039
of what makes fear and anxiety different.

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:01.581
Specifically, subcortical circuits

00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:04.788
underlying the processing and
control of bodily responses

00:16:04.788 --> 00:16:07.088
related to immediate or certain threats

00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:10.871
versus future and uncertain
threats are different.

00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:14.258
In the case of the
immediately present threat,

00:16:14.258 --> 00:16:16.155
the amygdala is very important.

00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:18.507
In the case of a future
threat, an area called

00:16:18.507 --> 00:16:22.086
the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis is important.

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:26.363
Now, the bed nucleus
has become for anxiety

00:16:26.363 --> 00:16:28.863
what the amygdala is for fear.

00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:32.467
It's been viewed as the source of anxiety.

00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:33.546
But it's not.

00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:36.794
Like the amygdala, it detects
and responds to threats,

00:16:36.794 --> 00:16:38.817
in this case, threats in the future.

00:16:38.817 --> 00:16:41.806
Fear and anxiety are the
cognitive interpretation

00:16:41.806 --> 00:16:45.227
that these things are happening.

00:16:45.227 --> 00:16:48.297
So, why does it matter
what we call these things?

00:16:48.297 --> 00:16:49.130
First of all,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.378
why does it matter what
we call fear and anxiety?

00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:53.183
Why can't we just use one word

00:16:53.183 --> 00:16:57.177
or maybe just even use
them interchangeably?

00:16:57.177 --> 00:17:01.177
For one reason, the
problems that afflict people

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:06.240
that have these conditions
need to be treated differently

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.799
if the threat is a worry about the future

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:12.691
as opposed to a kind of oversensitivity

00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:15.152
to immediately present stimuli.

00:17:15.152 --> 00:17:19.922
But in the case of fear of
death, or anxiety about death,

00:17:19.922 --> 00:17:22.531
the imprecision in scientific terminology,

00:17:22.531 --> 00:17:25.375
while a constant problem,

00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:29.122
it can easily be avoided by
being clear about the language.

00:17:29.122 --> 00:17:32.990
So, in treating someone, say,
who is obsessed with death,

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.524
or in designing treatments
that might help people

00:17:36.524 --> 00:17:37.808
who are at the end of life

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:41.808
and needing to not be
quite as anxious about it,

00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:44.446
thinking of these things

00:17:44.446 --> 00:17:46.990
in terms of what's going on in the brain

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.199
can actually be more constructive

00:17:49.199 --> 00:17:52.768
than simply assuming that it
all happens in the same way.

00:17:52.768 --> 00:17:55.498
And that's my two cents
about fear of death.

00:17:55.498 --> 00:17:56.331
Thank you.

00:17:56.331 --> 00:17:58.671
(audience applauds)

00:17:58.671 --> 00:17:59.979
- Well, thank you very much.

00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:02.709
And I'd like to thank the organizers

00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:05.783
and say how glad I am to be here

00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:10.063
and participating in this
very interesting symposium,

00:18:10.063 --> 00:18:12.737
and indeed to have the opportunity

00:18:12.737 --> 00:18:15.404
of discussing together a problem

00:18:16.674 --> 00:18:18.696
which we all, sooner or later,

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:21.738
will have to come to terms with.

00:18:21.738 --> 00:18:25.112
And that is indeed an interesting point.

00:18:25.112 --> 00:18:29.279
So I'd like to start with
just a couple of quotations.

00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:32.773
This from Wittgenstein.

00:18:33.963 --> 00:18:37.610
And it makes an important point, I think,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.027
that we are talking of death,

00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:44.601
but death is a concept.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.511
Obviously, there are individual deaths,

00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:50.742
or there are dead bodies, dead people,

00:18:50.742 --> 00:18:54.701
that we may or may not
come into contact with.

00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:56.907
But death is a concept.

00:18:56.907 --> 00:19:00.831
And, as humans, we may in the modern world

00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:02.812
not witness many deaths.

00:19:02.812 --> 00:19:04.839
But from the earliest times,

00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:07.586
homonins and humans have experienced

00:19:07.586 --> 00:19:09.413
the deaths of relatives.

00:19:09.413 --> 00:19:12.136
So the condition of being dead

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:15.166
will have been a familiar concept,

00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:19.333
at least as soon as human
language could find a word for it,

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:23.635
namely the adjective "dead".

00:19:23.635 --> 00:19:26.548
But I think it is
crucial to the discussion

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:30.215
to realize that without
the concept of death

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.973
and, indeed, without a language

00:19:36.973 --> 00:19:39.275
which could find a word for it,

00:19:39.275 --> 00:19:42.971
then it's not possible to
communicate about death.

00:19:42.971 --> 00:19:47.138
And it's not possible to have
a shared concept of death.

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:50.667
And so, the awareness of death

00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:55.784
as a general phenomenon is very much,

00:19:55.784 --> 00:20:00.185
and when that came to be
in evolutionary terms,

00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:03.486
is very much associated with the question

00:20:03.486 --> 00:20:05.986
of when human language emerged

00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:09.778
in a sufficiently sophisticated form

00:20:09.778 --> 00:20:13.611
that one could have an
abstract noun, "death",

00:20:16.499 --> 00:20:19.276
or an abstract adjective, "dead",

00:20:19.276 --> 00:20:23.034
which could give a word to the concept.

00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:27.193
And so I suspect that
when we're discussing

00:20:27.193 --> 00:20:29.732
when did the awareness of death

00:20:29.732 --> 00:20:32.315
become a reality for humankind,

00:20:34.677 --> 00:20:38.496
the answer is when
language had been developed

00:20:38.496 --> 00:20:40.329
to find a word for it.

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:43.535
It's worth mentioning also,

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:44.818
it's interesting perhaps,

00:20:44.818 --> 00:20:46.235
that Epicurus had

00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:51.526
a similar concept to Wittgenstein's,

00:20:52.491 --> 00:20:55.165
and a couple of thousand years earlier.

00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:59.332
But, as archeologists, we don't
encounter death very often.

00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:05.175
And indeed we don't even
encounter dead bodies very often.

00:21:06.302 --> 00:21:10.483
As archeologists, we more
often encounter burials.

00:21:10.483 --> 00:21:11.907
That is to say,

00:21:11.907 --> 00:21:16.104
dead persons that have
been inhumed deliberately.

00:21:16.104 --> 00:21:20.833
And it's unusual for archeologists
to discover dead people.

00:21:20.833 --> 00:21:25.429
And so it's worth looking,
reminding ourselves,

00:21:25.429 --> 00:21:28.997
of these extraordinary
images of moments of death

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:32.091
found at Pompeii and Herculaneum.

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:36.005
And the archeologists who found cavities

00:21:36.005 --> 00:21:37.588
in the volcanic ash

00:21:39.057 --> 00:21:42.689
and poured plaster of
Paris into these cavities

00:21:42.689 --> 00:21:45.862
were able to get these
extraordinary images

00:21:45.862 --> 00:21:49.550
of death, if you like,
of the moment of death

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.520
of a kind which is exceedingly unusual

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.437
in archeological terms.

00:21:56.787 --> 00:22:00.954
The business of burial is
often very much associated,

00:22:02.457 --> 00:22:05.474
or at any rate in later times,

00:22:05.474 --> 00:22:09.037
with notions of what is to follow,

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:11.776
whether or not there is an afterlife.

00:22:11.776 --> 00:22:15.443
And that is why I've
given my talk the title

00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:19.908
of the Archeology of Immortality.

00:22:19.908 --> 00:22:24.075
And this slide is from the
Capuchin Cemetery in Palermo.

00:22:25.473 --> 00:22:29.704
And of course the Capuchin
monks were very much aware

00:22:29.704 --> 00:22:32.597
that there would be a day of resurrection.

00:22:32.597 --> 00:22:36.735
And so this is now the
Capuchin Cemetery in Rome,

00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:40.913
where we see these
extraordinarily elaborate

00:22:40.913 --> 00:22:44.413
and sometimes very decorative figurations,

00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:49.313
which I think to us today,
to most of us today,

00:22:49.313 --> 00:22:51.260
perhaps because we don't very often

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.609
see skeletons or dead bodies.

00:22:53.609 --> 00:22:55.794
In the modern world,
that's in the mortuary,

00:22:55.794 --> 00:22:57.300
which we don't visit.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.382
And it's in the cemetery, but
you don't see the dead body

00:23:00.382 --> 00:23:04.549
in most Christian burials,
and indeed in many faiths,

00:23:05.739 --> 00:23:09.075
so that we are very much
insulated from death.

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:13.242
And these are perhaps rather
shocking images for us.

00:23:14.187 --> 00:23:17.020
And we find the apparent frivolity

00:23:18.578 --> 00:23:21.986
which you encounter in the Capuchin Chapel

00:23:21.986 --> 00:23:24.362
perhaps a little unseemly.

00:23:24.362 --> 00:23:27.127
But it's worth remembering,

00:23:27.127 --> 00:23:30.148
and I think we should pause and recognize,

00:23:30.148 --> 00:23:31.714
that we live in the Americas

00:23:31.714 --> 00:23:34.084
or in Europe or in western Asia,

00:23:34.084 --> 00:23:36.407
in a society today dominated

00:23:36.407 --> 00:23:38.614
by two or perhaps three religions,

00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:42.582
which hold that the supreme
deity, God or Allah,

00:23:42.582 --> 00:23:46.749
promises that life after
death will be the destiny

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:49.685
for those who believe.

00:23:49.685 --> 00:23:52.506
And so I take you to the Sistine Chapel

00:23:52.506 --> 00:23:55.173
to Michelangelo's Last Judgment.

00:23:56.055 --> 00:23:58.860
And there will be many people here today

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.637
who follow some version
of the Christian faith

00:24:01.637 --> 00:24:05.592
so well expressed by Michelangelo
for the Church of Rome

00:24:05.592 --> 00:24:07.847
in his vision of the Last Judgment,

00:24:07.847 --> 00:24:10.882
where the blessed and
the damned are judged

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:13.998
on the basis of their conduct during life

00:24:13.998 --> 00:24:18.002
and sent accordingly to
their ultimate destinations,

00:24:18.002 --> 00:24:21.222
their two ultimate destinations.

00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:25.139
And it is a convention
in the scientific world,

00:24:26.492 --> 00:24:30.069
which is particularly
inappropriate for this occasion,

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:32.582
that we don't discuss faith very much.

00:24:32.582 --> 00:24:34.957
Maybe there are symposia on faith,

00:24:34.957 --> 00:24:37.443
but they tend to, or they can, degenerate

00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:41.382
into alternative expressions
of personal faith.

00:24:41.382 --> 00:24:45.786
And so it's an irony really
that we are here today

00:24:45.786 --> 00:24:48.662
discussing awareness of death,

00:24:48.662 --> 00:24:50.495
but the belief systems

00:24:53.737 --> 00:24:56.417
which determine to some extent

00:24:56.417 --> 00:24:59.834
what a number of us will feel about death

00:25:00.962 --> 00:25:02.901
are not openly expressed.

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.336
And I think that's worth saying,

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.715
because underlying all the discussions

00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:09.899
is that some of us here are believers,

00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:12.510
perhaps of those two or three religions

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.079
which predominate in the western world.

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:18.526
And others of us are not believers

00:25:18.526 --> 00:25:20.982
and are agnotics or atheists

00:25:20.982 --> 00:25:22.625
and, therefore, inevitably have

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.686
a very different approach to death.

00:25:24.686 --> 00:25:28.861
And many agnostics or
atheists will not believe

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:32.813
in the existence of the
human being after death,

00:25:32.813 --> 00:25:35.003
although of course some may.

00:25:35.003 --> 00:25:36.482
And obviously I don't have time

00:25:36.482 --> 00:25:39.503
to talk about the Buddhist
faith on this occasion.

00:25:39.503 --> 00:25:43.503
So I move right on to the
earliest accumulations

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:48.391
of human bones, which may
or may not be burials.

00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:52.329
This is the Sima de los Huesos in Spain,

00:25:52.329 --> 00:25:56.250
which is early hominins,
early Neanderthals probably,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.893
around 400,000 years ago,

00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:02.810
which were tipped into
these pits, these caves,

00:26:04.835 --> 00:26:07.061
and presumably deliberately so,

00:26:07.061 --> 00:26:09.073
though that is not certain.

00:26:09.073 --> 00:26:12.139
But they don't really constitute burials

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:13.753
in a deliberate sense.

00:26:13.753 --> 00:26:18.543
And the first human burials
are archaic hominins.

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:20.960
This is from Skhul in Jordan.

00:26:22.129 --> 00:26:26.506
And that is something
like 100,000 years ago.

00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:29.536
These are archaic hominins,

00:26:29.536 --> 00:26:30.421
of humans,

00:26:30.421 --> 00:26:33.588
following the slide we saw
in the last presentation,

00:26:33.588 --> 00:26:35.338
who have left Africa.

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:41.466
And with these burials, we do
find sometimes other objects,

00:26:44.027 --> 00:26:46.777
sometimes a bone signifying meat.

00:26:47.777 --> 00:26:50.944
Not a human bone, but a bone of mutton

00:26:52.594 --> 00:26:54.279
or something like that.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:58.515
And so, that is certainly
a deliberate burial,

00:26:58.515 --> 00:27:01.407
which is certainly signifying
awareness of death.

00:27:01.407 --> 00:27:04.621
You can't come about
having a deliberate burial

00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:06.805
without some awareness of death.

00:27:06.805 --> 00:27:10.411
But it doesn't necessarily
signify an afterlife.

00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:14.578
And this is one of the first
sites in European Romania

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:18.970
where we find deliberate burials.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.229
You do, of course, have
Neanderthal burials,

00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:23.879
for instance at the Shanidar Cave,

00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:27.629
something like 40 or
more thousand years ago.

00:27:29.069 --> 00:27:32.420
But it's not until the
upper Paleolithic period,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.003
until the arrival of
Homo sapiens in Europe

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:41.462
that we find deliberate
burials of this kind,

00:27:41.462 --> 00:27:43.379
this very striking body

00:27:46.085 --> 00:27:48.168
inhumed with a headdress,

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:52.173
which comes from the site of Sunghir.

00:27:53.724 --> 00:27:56.656
And this is another such burial.

00:27:56.656 --> 00:28:00.476
This is around 28,000 years ago in Russia.

00:28:00.476 --> 00:28:03.980
But, although it's impressive,
it's important to understand

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.793
that it's clearly recognizing death.

00:28:05.793 --> 00:28:09.938
It's a formal burial, but
not yet in a cemetery.

00:28:09.938 --> 00:28:11.579
It's a formal burial,

00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:14.930
and so that indicates something,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.036
but not necessarily a suggestion

00:28:17.036 --> 00:28:19.255
of awareness in the afterlife.

00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:22.825
This is a similar burial from
the site of Arene Candide

00:28:22.825 --> 00:28:24.342
in northern Italy.

00:28:24.342 --> 00:28:27.258
And here now is one of
the first cemeteries,

00:28:27.258 --> 00:28:29.661
a number of burials grouped together.

00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:34.076
And you find these at the
very dawn of sedentism,

00:28:34.076 --> 00:28:38.199
just before the
domestication of agriculture

00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:41.804
is fully achieved in the Natufian period

00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:45.971
in Palestine and in western
Asia around 12,000 BC.

00:28:47.663 --> 00:28:49.762
And here is another of these sites

00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:51.845
where we find a cemetery.

00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:57.886
And clearly a cemetery is a
different response to death.

00:28:57.886 --> 00:29:00.553
It's a place specifically chosen

00:29:01.398 --> 00:29:04.796
for the formal disposal of the dead.

00:29:04.796 --> 00:29:06.774
And here is another such example

00:29:06.774 --> 00:29:10.524
from an early site in
Jordan about 15,000 BC.

00:29:11.621 --> 00:29:15.584
And it's at Jericho in the
pre-pottery Neolithic A period

00:29:15.584 --> 00:29:18.811
that you find these
remarkable plastered skulls.

00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:22.228
And these are one of
the most striking finds

00:29:22.228 --> 00:29:26.145
that one has where death
is being responded to.

00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:32.398
And it's possible that this relates

00:29:33.417 --> 00:29:35.098
to a belief in the afterlife.

00:29:35.098 --> 00:29:37.692
But it's also just as possible

00:29:37.692 --> 00:29:38.820
that it relates to a belief

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.598
in the significance of the ancestors.

00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:43.803
Whether or not the ancestors are presumed

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:46.095
to be still living in some sense,

00:29:46.095 --> 00:29:49.928
it is the ancestors who
give often one's right

00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:56.124
to inhabit the land, the territory
which one inhabits today.

00:29:56.124 --> 00:29:59.333
And so this, moving on very
rapidly to northern Europe,

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.770
to the Orkney Islands,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.957
this is a site I excavated myself,

00:30:03.957 --> 00:30:08.124
of Quanterness in Orkney, where
you see a constructed tomb,

00:30:09.313 --> 00:30:11.551
a very handsomely constructed tomb.

00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:13.576
Here is a reconstruction of it.

00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:15.951
And this is a place of collective burial.

00:30:15.951 --> 00:30:18.213
And collective burial
is another phenomenon

00:30:18.213 --> 00:30:21.342
where the bones or the
bodies of a community

00:30:21.342 --> 00:30:22.796
are together buried.

00:30:22.796 --> 00:30:25.906
And that is an important point.

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:29.869
It is when you come to ranked societies

00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:31.207
that you find burials

00:30:31.207 --> 00:30:33.833
with very strikingly wealthy grave goods.

00:30:33.833 --> 00:30:37.754
And here is one of the jade
burials of the Liangzhu culture

00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:39.837
around 3,300 BC in China.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.990
And here is another of these jade burials

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.285
of the same period, also in China.

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:51.662
And there's something special
about the material of jade,

00:30:51.662 --> 00:30:56.308
just as there is special
about the material gold,

00:30:56.308 --> 00:31:00.441
which one finds here in the
earliest occurrence of gold

00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.443
in the world at Varna,

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:04.443
something like 4,500 BC.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.390
And the inclusion of these materials

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.979
doesn't necessarily indicate
a belief in the afterlife.

00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:18.019
But there is with the
purity and survival of gold

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:21.035
and the purity and survival of jade

00:31:21.035 --> 00:31:23.497
something which certainly in later times

00:31:23.497 --> 00:31:25.718
is associated with immortality.

00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:29.274
And I think there's a
possibility that this is the time

00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:34.193
that immortality first enters
the archeological record,

00:31:34.193 --> 00:31:36.637
as it were, in these rich burials.

00:31:36.637 --> 00:31:40.387
This is another burial
from Varna in Bulgaria

00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:42.754
around 4,500 BC.

00:31:44.294 --> 00:31:47.507
But it is with the
arrival of state societies

00:31:47.507 --> 00:31:51.270
and with the arrival
of a belief in deities,

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.483
in transcendent deities,

00:31:53.483 --> 00:31:57.751
that you certainly find
a systematic belief

00:31:57.751 --> 00:31:59.448
in the afterlife.

00:31:59.448 --> 00:32:03.229
And deities, of course,
are by definition immortal.

00:32:03.229 --> 00:32:06.650
And you find deities in
the archeological record,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.762
it may be argued,

00:32:07.762 --> 00:32:11.792
for the first time in state
societies such as ancient Egypt.

00:32:11.792 --> 00:32:13.479
So here you see the pyramids.

00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:17.228
Here you see the
wonderful gold sarcophagus

00:32:17.228 --> 00:32:19.159
from the tomb of Tutankhamun.

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:21.738
And we know a great deal
about Egyptian beliefs.

00:32:21.738 --> 00:32:24.555
And here from the Book of the Dead

00:32:24.555 --> 00:32:28.722
is the weighing of the soul of
the deceased in the balance.

00:32:30.376 --> 00:32:32.959
And if the soul of the deceased

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:35.995
was sufficiently free from sin

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:39.292
as to be sufficiently light in weight,

00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:41.500
then the deceased would be accepted

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.505
into a favorable afterlife.

00:32:44.505 --> 00:32:46.922
And so, it's in China, again,

00:32:48.929 --> 00:32:50.727
with the Shang dynasty,

00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:54.147
that you find these
enormously rich burials

00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:57.147
and with the first bronzes in China.

00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:00.052
And these are of great abundance.

00:33:00.052 --> 00:33:02.469
And it's also in Meso-America

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:05.771
that with the development
of state society,

00:33:05.771 --> 00:33:07.728
for instance with the Maya,

00:33:07.728 --> 00:33:10.443
that you find very elaborate burials,

00:33:10.443 --> 00:33:15.170
which do clearly involve
the belief of an afterlife,

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:16.487
at least for the ruler.

00:33:16.487 --> 00:33:19.707
And this is the Tomb of the
Inscriptions at Palenque.

00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:22.785
And here is the wonderful tomb slab

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:25.452
of the deceased person of Pakal.

00:33:27.987 --> 00:33:29.817
And here is Pakal himself

00:33:29.817 --> 00:33:32.354
being taken down into the underworld.

00:33:32.354 --> 00:33:35.771
This is around 603 before the Common Era.

00:33:38.209 --> 00:33:40.675
And here is the contents of his tomb,

00:33:40.675 --> 00:33:43.287
including this wonderful jade mask.

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.113
And there is the jade mask.

00:33:45.113 --> 00:33:49.013
And it's interesting to compare
that with the jade masks,

00:33:49.013 --> 00:33:51.248
which in China are used

00:33:51.248 --> 00:33:54.915
to surround the body
of the deceased person.

00:33:57.664 --> 00:33:58.957
That was Liu Sheng.

00:33:58.957 --> 00:34:03.599
And this is the burial
suit of Princess Dou Wan,

00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:05.766
who was buried around 113,

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:11.296
or died 113 before the Common Era.

00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:15.436
In Europe, it's the necropoles,

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:18.702
the cities of the dead,

00:34:18.702 --> 00:34:21.489
of the Etruscans which give
the most wonderful example.

00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.957
Here is Cerveteri.

00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:26.724
Here is the Sarcophagus of
the Spouses from Cerveteri.

00:34:26.724 --> 00:34:30.170
And it's there that we find
the wonderful painted tombs.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.894
Here is the Tomb of the Leopards.

00:34:31.894 --> 00:34:35.318
And this is a funeral banquet,
or certainly a banquet.

00:34:35.318 --> 00:34:39.485
The deceased person reclining
with relatives and friends

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:44.626
and being served on as Roman
banquets were transacted.

00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:47.080
And here is a very beautiful wall painting

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.879
from the Tomb of the Baron around 500 BC.

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:54.566
And this too is Tarquinia around 500 BC

00:34:54.566 --> 00:34:56.611
from the Tomb of the Baron.

00:34:56.611 --> 00:35:00.418
And here is one of the
most delightful depictions

00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:03.297
of music and dance from the ancient world,

00:35:03.297 --> 00:35:05.297
likewise of that period.

00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:10.687
And so we obviously find
in the ancient world

00:35:12.062 --> 00:35:13.592
wonderful representations.

00:35:13.592 --> 00:35:16.701
Here is the goddess Athena in mourning

00:35:16.701 --> 00:35:20.483
at the grave stele of a deceased youth.

00:35:20.483 --> 00:35:24.044
And here is one of the
most delightful series

00:35:24.044 --> 00:35:26.731
of paintings of deceased persons,

00:35:26.731 --> 00:35:30.898
which you find on the mummy
coverings in the Fayum.

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:35.207
And they have a wonderful vivacity,

00:35:35.207 --> 00:35:38.659
but they're commemorating
a deceased person

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:41.350
for whom a belief in the afterlife

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.100
was probably a doctrinal reality.

00:35:45.283 --> 00:35:47.803
And then you have the grandiose.

00:35:47.803 --> 00:35:50.636
This is from the Tomb of Mausolus,

00:35:53.468 --> 00:35:56.622
from whom we have the term mausoleum,

00:35:56.622 --> 00:36:00.720
meaning a grandiloquent
commemorative tomb usually.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.014
And this is the funeral
effigy of Mausolus,

00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:06.148
which is now in the British Museum.

00:36:06.148 --> 00:36:10.315
And here is a reconstruction
of the Tomb of Mausolus

00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:14.511
as it would have been in western Anatolia,

00:36:14.511 --> 00:36:16.726
Halicarnassus in Anatolia.

00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:18.084
And here in Rome

00:36:18.084 --> 00:36:21.417
is the great monumental tomb of Hadrian,

00:36:25.657 --> 00:36:29.155
which is today the Castel San Angelo.

00:36:29.155 --> 00:36:33.008
And here is a reconstruction
of how it may have looked.

00:36:33.008 --> 00:36:37.875
And this is obviously the
notion of death of an emperor

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:39.792
as a significant event.

00:36:41.252 --> 00:36:45.060
And of course the emperors
of Rome were deified.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.971
And so, on their death it was presumed

00:36:48.971 --> 00:36:52.500
that they went on to live an eternal life.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.698
Indeed, the later emperors

00:36:54.698 --> 00:36:59.000
were already regarded as
divine before their death,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.021
so there was not trouble about that.

00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.207
And here is Hadrian indeed.

00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:06.682
And so, just to come to the conclusion,

00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:10.349
obviously we continue
to use grave monuments

00:37:12.938 --> 00:37:16.688
as a suitable locus for
celebrating the dead.

00:37:18.833 --> 00:37:22.492
And this is the tomb
of Giuliano de' Medici

00:37:22.492 --> 00:37:25.910
from the Medici Chapel in Florence.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.108
This is again Michelangelo,

00:37:28.108 --> 00:37:32.424
Michelangelo now as sculptor
rather than as painter.

00:37:32.424 --> 00:37:36.907
And here, as you'll
recognize, is the Kremlin.

00:37:36.907 --> 00:37:40.128
And here in similar guise is Lenin,

00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:43.576
still immortalized and embalmed.

00:37:43.576 --> 00:37:48.434
As you'll remember, Stalin was
put beside him for a while,

00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:50.330
but then perhaps was simply interred

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.488
very wisely subsequently.

00:37:52.488 --> 00:37:56.285
But Lenin still continues to rule supreme.

00:37:56.285 --> 00:38:00.310
And my last image is from the Taj Mahal,

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.977
this lovely memorial

00:38:04.653 --> 00:38:06.736
to the bride of the shah,

00:38:11.095 --> 00:38:13.762
dating from the 17th century AD.

00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:19.074
So, some notions of
immortality do continue.

00:38:21.448 --> 00:38:22.850
But, of course,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.767
immortality is usually
part of a belief system,

00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:33.114
which involves, in the
modern world certainly,

00:38:34.338 --> 00:38:37.838
a faith, whether it's Christian or Muslim,

00:38:41.161 --> 00:38:42.852
or indeed Buddhist faith.

00:38:42.852 --> 00:38:46.734
But I haven't had time to
discuss the Buddhist notion

00:38:46.734 --> 00:38:48.815
of transubstantiation,

00:38:48.815 --> 00:38:52.698
how the soul can move from
one individual on death

00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:54.449
to another individual.

00:38:54.449 --> 00:38:59.157
And that of course is a
different concept of immortality.

00:38:59.157 --> 00:39:01.462
But, as I said right at the beginning,

00:39:01.462 --> 00:39:05.692
I think the awareness
of death simply depends

00:39:05.692 --> 00:39:07.794
on having a word for death.

00:39:07.794 --> 00:39:11.997
And I would say that when
we developed as humans

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:14.830
an awareness of death as a concept

00:39:16.012 --> 00:39:20.825
must be very much when we
developed the linguistic capacity.

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:24.558
And that linguistic capacity
is usually associated

00:39:24.558 --> 00:39:26.967
with our own species Homo sapiens,

00:39:26.967 --> 00:39:31.016
as indeed was very well
documented by the last speaker

00:39:31.016 --> 00:39:32.016
with his map

00:39:34.462 --> 00:39:38.212
of the Out of Africa
expansion of our species

00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:42.222
something like 60,000 years ago.

00:39:42.222 --> 00:39:46.214
So that, I think, gives
a very brief synopsis

00:39:46.214 --> 00:39:49.689
of the concept of
immortality for humankind.

00:39:49.689 --> 00:39:50.522
Thank you very much.

00:39:50.522 --> 00:39:53.522
(audience applauds)

00:39:54.376 --> 00:39:58.367
- So, before I start, let me
explain the general approach

00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:03.238
that I'm taking to the theme
of this symposium today.

00:40:03.238 --> 00:40:06.373
As an anthropologist,
my first port of call

00:40:06.373 --> 00:40:09.841
for addressing any
question about human beings

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:13.120
has to be the place where
I've done field work.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.591
This is because, while all
human beings are confronted

00:40:16.591 --> 00:40:19.255
by the same fundamental questions

00:40:19.255 --> 00:40:22.878
and approach them through the
same fundamental capacities

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:26.502
that are afforded by
their minds and bodies,

00:40:26.502 --> 00:40:29.548
they always bring to the
task of framing the questions

00:40:29.548 --> 00:40:31.435
and finding the answers

00:40:31.435 --> 00:40:32.921
tools that are specific

00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:35.102
to the historical and cultural context

00:40:35.102 --> 00:40:38.112
in which they live and die.

00:40:38.112 --> 00:40:41.158
And to talk sensibly
about the human beings,

00:40:41.158 --> 00:40:43.367
their questions and answers,

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:46.772
one has to know this context well.

00:40:46.772 --> 00:40:50.119
So, let me take you to Betania,

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:53.833
a small fishing village on
the west coast of Madagascar.

00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:56.077
The inhabitants are fishing folk

00:40:56.077 --> 00:41:00.464
who describe themselves as
Vezo, People of the Sea.

00:41:00.464 --> 00:41:02.068
This is where I've done field work

00:41:02.068 --> 00:41:05.189
on and off for the past 30 years.

00:41:05.189 --> 00:41:08.629
During this time, I've
seen babies being born,

00:41:08.629 --> 00:41:10.719
children grow into adults,

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:13.608
adults age into wise elders,

00:41:13.608 --> 00:41:16.215
and lots of people of all ages die

00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:18.939
and been buried in the village cemetery.

00:41:18.939 --> 00:41:20.882
In Betania, when someone dies,

00:41:20.882 --> 00:41:23.612
the whole village springs into action.

00:41:23.612 --> 00:41:26.759
Depending on the age and
the status of the deceased,

00:41:26.759 --> 00:41:30.926
the funerary proceedings last
between one and four days.

00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:34.387
Each day, villagers are expected to attend

00:41:34.387 --> 00:41:36.950
two communal meals and a vigil.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.429
As you can imagine, organizing such events

00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:43.881
is a huge undertaking
for the bereaved family.

00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.068
And while a few individuals are in charge

00:41:46.068 --> 00:41:47.808
of preparing the corpse

00:41:47.808 --> 00:41:49.315
and of dealing with the deceased's

00:41:49.315 --> 00:41:52.577
closest and most distressed relatives,

00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:54.476
the vast majority of family members

00:41:54.476 --> 00:41:57.814
will be busy dealing with other things.

00:41:57.814 --> 00:42:00.935
Their first task is to
formally announce the death

00:42:00.935 --> 00:42:03.701
to everyone who has a right to be told.

00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:07.339
A young boy is sent to all
the households in the village.

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:10.756
All the youths are dispatched
to more distant locations.

00:42:10.756 --> 00:42:13.470
A text is delivered to the radio station

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.138
in the nearest town,

00:42:15.138 --> 00:42:17.422
a text which announces who has died

00:42:17.422 --> 00:42:19.878
and lists all the names of the all people

00:42:19.878 --> 00:42:22.271
the death has been announced to.

00:42:22.271 --> 00:42:26.624
Meanwhile, money is urgently
collected from family members.

00:42:26.624 --> 00:42:27.917
The money is needed to buy

00:42:27.917 --> 00:42:31.531
the vast quantities of rice
and meat for the communal meals

00:42:31.531 --> 00:42:34.099
and the rum and coffee for the vigils.

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:36.827
It is important that the
crowds are not let down,

00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:41.420
for example, by serving them
beans or fish instead of meat,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.160
or by running out of rum
halfway through the night.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.707
(audience laughs)

00:42:45.707 --> 00:42:50.428
It is shameful, mahamenatse,
to fail to pull it off,

00:42:50.428 --> 00:42:53.286
not only because this shows
that the most immediate family

00:42:53.286 --> 00:42:56.790
doesn't have the necessary resources,

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.083
but also, and perhaps most importantly,

00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:01.951
because it shows that they
don't have enough relations

00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:04.025
willing to help them out.

00:43:04.025 --> 00:43:05.789
In fact, everyone in attendance

00:43:05.789 --> 00:43:09.364
is supposed to make a
monetary contribution.

00:43:09.364 --> 00:43:13.209
As the crowds assemble, the
elders of the bereaved family

00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:16.768
set themselves up in one of their houses.

00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:19.509
There, they receive representatives

00:43:19.509 --> 00:43:21.575
of each of the village households

00:43:21.575 --> 00:43:25.126
and those visitors who have
come from further afield.

00:43:25.126 --> 00:43:28.696
After a certain amount of
highly-formalized exchanges,

00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:30.829
the visitors produce an envelope

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:34.996
while insisting that it's
nothing big, just a little thing.

00:43:36.152 --> 00:43:39.123
The envelope is accepted by the elders,

00:43:39.123 --> 00:43:42.995
who insist that it's not
small but a big thing.

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:46.272
After some more back and
forth, the visitors leave,

00:43:46.272 --> 00:43:49.514
the envelope is opened, the money counted,

00:43:49.514 --> 00:43:54.190
and the amount carefully written
down in a special notebook.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.551
The visitors will have
done the same at their end,

00:43:57.551 --> 00:43:59.529
consulting their notebooks

00:43:59.529 --> 00:44:01.577
to find out how much the head received

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:03.091
from the bereaved family

00:44:03.091 --> 00:44:05.241
last time they themselves had the funeral

00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:07.051
(audience laughs)

00:44:07.051 --> 00:44:10.865
and noting down the amounts
they're now contributing.

00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:14.456
In this way, over time, people ensure

00:44:14.456 --> 00:44:18.155
that they reciprocate the
contributions they have received,

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:21.591
thus maintaining good
relations and not losing face.

00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:24.631
This kind of reciprocation
doesn't always work,

00:44:24.631 --> 00:44:26.992
but it's always closely monitored.

00:44:26.992 --> 00:44:30.756
Such and such a family has
brought less than expected.

00:44:30.756 --> 00:44:32.461
Is it because they're really struggling,

00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.859
or because they're trying to slight us?

00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:37.621
Another family has brought much more.

00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:39.153
Are they just being generous,

00:44:39.153 --> 00:44:40.788
or are they testing us to see

00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:44.752
whether we can match their
contribution in the future?

00:44:44.752 --> 00:44:47.276
Now, the reason I am
mentioning all of this,

00:44:47.276 --> 00:44:49.389
the announcing, the
collecting, the giving,

00:44:49.389 --> 00:44:51.930
the receiving, the writing down,

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.784
is that these are the activities
that dominate the funeral.

00:44:55.784 --> 00:45:00.475
Of course, funerals wouldn't
happen if there was no death.

00:45:00.475 --> 00:45:02.205
But the point I wish to stress

00:45:02.205 --> 00:45:04.844
is that for the vast majority of people,

00:45:04.844 --> 00:45:07.290
the deceased is actually quite peripheral

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.123
(audience laughs)

00:45:08.123 --> 00:45:12.044
to their experience and preoccupations.

00:45:12.044 --> 00:45:15.620
The same applies to their
emotional experience.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.280
Of course, there are close family members

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.191
who are highly distressed
and grief-stricken.

00:45:22.191 --> 00:45:24.058
But for most participants,

00:45:24.058 --> 00:45:26.535
funerals elicit rather different emotions,

00:45:26.535 --> 00:45:30.702
ranging from plain boredom to
alcohol-induced exhilaration

00:45:31.853 --> 00:45:33.972
to sexual arousal.

00:45:33.972 --> 00:45:36.859
This last one applies especially to youths

00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:39.439
who find in funerals
the welcome opportunity

00:45:39.439 --> 00:45:41.786
to meet visitors from distant villages,

00:45:41.786 --> 00:45:45.654
who, with any luck, are not
genealogically related to them

00:45:45.654 --> 00:45:47.886
and are thus permissible sexual partners.

00:45:47.886 --> 00:45:51.786
Indeed, it's well known that
many long-lasting marriages

00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:54.275
started at the edges of a vigil.

00:45:54.275 --> 00:45:55.959
(audience laughs)

00:45:55.959 --> 00:45:59.143
Now, to put all this into context,

00:45:59.143 --> 00:46:01.931
consider that, save for
the crowds that gather

00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:04.960
for the much rarer construction of tombs,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.607
events which are planned in
advance and are announced

00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:12.099
and therefore are better attended,

00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:15.393
funerals are the largest
gatherings of people

00:46:15.393 --> 00:46:17.556
that villagers participate in.

00:46:17.556 --> 00:46:21.801
And they're events which give
them a firsthand experience

00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:25.593
of the large-scale social
system to which they belong.

00:46:25.593 --> 00:46:28.321
Here are these hundreds of other people.

00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:29.837
And here we are,

00:46:29.837 --> 00:46:34.458
my parents, my children,
my siblings, my in-laws,

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:38.458
just one node of this
vast network of relations.

00:46:40.138 --> 00:46:42.796
And while funerals give people a snapshot

00:46:42.796 --> 00:46:45.146
of the existing social landscape,

00:46:45.146 --> 00:46:47.526
they're also occasions for acting on it

00:46:47.526 --> 00:46:49.172
and changing its shape.

00:46:49.172 --> 00:46:52.490
For example, by extending or withdrawing

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.480
the announcement of the death.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:58.658
By succeeding or failing
to put on a good funeral.

00:46:58.658 --> 00:47:02.566
By giving a small or a large
or a balanced contribution.

00:47:02.566 --> 00:47:04.928
And most literally, by having sex,

00:47:04.928 --> 00:47:08.457
which has the potential of
adding new life to the mix.

00:47:08.457 --> 00:47:11.004
You will have noticed
that quite deliberately

00:47:11.004 --> 00:47:13.797
I've led you away from the deceased

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:16.695
and the raw emotions that surround death.

00:47:16.695 --> 00:47:19.830
I've done so to dispel the
common-sense assumption

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.783
that funerals are centrally
about death and grief

00:47:23.783 --> 00:47:26.631
and to stress the point
that they are instead

00:47:26.631 --> 00:47:29.429
largely about the gathering of crowds,

00:47:29.429 --> 00:47:32.676
the expectations and
obligations that people have,

00:47:32.676 --> 00:47:35.587
the appraisal and manipulation
of the social relations

00:47:35.587 --> 00:47:37.448
in which they live.

00:47:37.448 --> 00:47:41.615
Still, there is a dead body
at the center of it all,

00:47:42.712 --> 00:47:45.034
a body that is fast decomposing

00:47:45.034 --> 00:47:49.393
and that sooner or later must
be removed from the village,

00:47:49.393 --> 00:47:53.823
taken to the cemetery,
and placed inside a tomb,

00:47:53.823 --> 00:47:57.067
one of the many large enclosures

00:47:57.067 --> 00:47:59.728
that are scattered around the sand dunes.

00:47:59.728 --> 00:48:01.503
Once the body is buried,

00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:04.736
an elder gives an explanatory speech

00:48:04.736 --> 00:48:09.190
informing the other dead
of what has just happened.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.398
He will then state that
the deceased has arrived

00:48:12.398 --> 00:48:16.054
at the place where he is, plasy misy azy,

00:48:16.054 --> 00:48:18.251
that nothing more is left to be done,

00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:21.748
and that the crowd should
now disperse and go home.

00:48:21.748 --> 00:48:24.081
The place where he or she is

00:48:24.992 --> 00:48:27.380
is a misleadingly simple expression,

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.393
which in fact captures key aspects

00:48:30.393 --> 00:48:34.560
of the existential transformation
brought about by death.

00:48:35.461 --> 00:48:38.341
First note that this is not an expression

00:48:38.341 --> 00:48:42.042
that is used to refer to the
journeys of living people.

00:48:42.042 --> 00:48:44.459
Living people arrive here and there.

00:48:44.459 --> 00:48:48.088
But they don't arrive at
the place where they are.

00:48:48.088 --> 00:48:48.921
This makes sense,

00:48:48.921 --> 00:48:51.413
because living people
are always on the move.

00:48:51.413 --> 00:48:54.944
They leave, they arrive,
and then they move on.

00:48:54.944 --> 00:48:58.175
Dead people, by contrast,
arrive inside their tombs,

00:48:58.175 --> 00:49:00.118
and there they stay.

00:49:00.118 --> 00:49:02.729
Second, the expression
draws attention to the fact

00:49:02.729 --> 00:49:06.888
that the deceased arrives
at that specific place.

00:49:06.888 --> 00:49:09.040
This tomb, not another one.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.614
The choice of tomb is a
highly contentious affair.

00:49:12.614 --> 00:49:14.007
This is because,

00:49:14.007 --> 00:49:16.603
as people often told me
by way of explanation,

00:49:16.603 --> 00:49:19.639
we can't cut up corpses into pieces.

00:49:19.639 --> 00:49:23.154
In other words, the
deceased cannot be buried

00:49:23.154 --> 00:49:25.700
in more than one tomb.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.187
In theory, the choice of burial

00:49:28.187 --> 00:49:30.324
is determined by strict rules,

00:49:30.324 --> 00:49:34.182
which say that children's
bones belong to their mother,

00:49:34.182 --> 00:49:38.226
unless the father acquires
them through ritual means.

00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:40.442
In practice, lots of other factors

00:49:40.442 --> 00:49:43.090
can feed into the final decision.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.324
But the point is that,

00:49:44.324 --> 00:49:47.166
when the decision is made, it is final.

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:50.306
The other point I want
to get across is this.

00:49:50.306 --> 00:49:54.016
By placing the dead in
the place where they are,

00:49:54.016 --> 00:49:56.810
the living create a radically
different social system

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:00.521
to the one they experience
when they are alive.

00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:03.086
A system that lacks movement.

00:50:03.086 --> 00:50:06.136
The dead arrive once and for all.

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:09.430
A system that is not open to negotiation.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.740
The dead are either here or there.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.686
A system of social relations

00:50:13.686 --> 00:50:16.469
that are no longer a work in progress.

00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:19.762
The dead are no longer
susceptible to the vagaries

00:50:19.762 --> 00:50:22.877
of personal success and
failures, likes and dislikes,

00:50:22.877 --> 00:50:26.081
distance and proximity, and so on.

00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:29.652
From this perspective, it's
not surprising that the tombs,

00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:32.256
which create these
alternative social systems,

00:50:32.256 --> 00:50:36.379
are the most solid and lasting
structures that people build.

00:50:36.379 --> 00:50:38.949
They used to be made of hard wood.

00:50:38.949 --> 00:50:42.096
But once cement became
available in the '60s,

00:50:42.096 --> 00:50:44.953
it soon became the material of choice,

00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:46.720
because, as people say,

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.616
it's harder, more durable, unmovable.

00:50:50.616 --> 00:50:53.546
Given the eerie stillness of corpses,

00:50:53.546 --> 00:50:56.109
it's also not surprising that humans,

00:50:56.109 --> 00:50:57.911
not just in Madagascar,

00:50:57.911 --> 00:51:00.311
imagine the transition from life to death

00:51:00.311 --> 00:51:04.440
as one that turns the movement
of life into immobility

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:07.571
and that removes the deceased
from the give and take

00:51:07.571 --> 00:51:10.533
of human interactions, as we've just seen.

00:51:10.533 --> 00:51:12.767
But humans, not just in Madagascar,

00:51:12.767 --> 00:51:15.419
seem also prone to imagine something

00:51:15.419 --> 00:51:17.632
a little more paradoxical,

00:51:17.632 --> 00:51:21.285
namely that the social
systems created through death

00:51:21.285 --> 00:51:23.498
are long lasting,

00:51:23.498 --> 00:51:27.665
that they transcend the now on,
now off temporality of life.

00:51:28.706 --> 00:51:30.780
For this to happen, however,

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.035
something has to give.

00:51:33.035 --> 00:51:36.728
To put it in the most general terms,

00:51:36.728 --> 00:51:39.712
the complexity of life has to be reduced.

00:51:39.712 --> 00:51:41.447
The make up of the living person

00:51:41.447 --> 00:51:44.003
has to be stripped down to its core.

00:51:44.003 --> 00:51:46.300
Its essence has to be distilled

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.522
out of its many entanglements.

00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:51.654
Only when this happens can
people begin to imagine

00:51:51.654 --> 00:51:55.080
that the present is just
a replica of the past

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.249
and that the future will
be replica of the present.

00:51:58.249 --> 00:52:00.513
In other words, they can
begin to imagine a system

00:52:00.513 --> 00:52:03.763
that defies the passage of time.

00:52:03.763 --> 00:52:05.327
I'm getting ahead of myself here,

00:52:05.327 --> 00:52:07.177
so let me give you a couple of examples

00:52:07.177 --> 00:52:10.594
to illustrate where I'm actually heading.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.822
First, to the Veso.

00:52:13.822 --> 00:52:16.436
The living, people say, have at least

00:52:16.436 --> 00:52:19.186
eight ancestral lines of descent,

00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:22.936
those of their eight great-grandparents.

00:52:22.936 --> 00:52:26.763
In fact, they would have more
if they could remember them.

00:52:26.763 --> 00:52:31.211
This means that in life,
each person is made up

00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:34.544
of at least eight known ancestral parts,

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.362
which are unique to that person,

00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:40.676
because only that person
and her full siblings

00:52:40.676 --> 00:52:44.969
share that exact combination
of ancestral sources.

00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:46.986
And so when that person dies,

00:52:46.986 --> 00:52:50.480
that unique combination
also comes to an end.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.127
But now imagine that
when that person dies,

00:52:53.127 --> 00:52:57.360
she's buried inside a tomb
which contains only individuals

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.463
who share one of her eight
ancestral lines of descent.

00:53:01.463 --> 00:53:04.481
In being placed there,
all of these individuals

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:08.474
had seven of their ancestral
lines stripped away,

00:53:08.474 --> 00:53:12.672
thus being reduced to that
one that they have in common.

00:53:12.672 --> 00:53:14.970
And so instead of being
unique combinations

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.349
that are here today and gone tomorrow,

00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:21.200
they all become a replica of one another,

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.502
a continuation of that
one line of ancestry.

00:53:24.502 --> 00:53:27.884
And so, in and through that,
people begin to imagine

00:53:27.884 --> 00:53:31.933
a social grouping, what Veso
call one kind of people,

00:53:31.933 --> 00:53:35.423
and anthropologists call
a unilineal descent group,

00:53:35.423 --> 00:53:38.124
which has continuity through time.

00:53:38.124 --> 00:53:40.061
Let me briefly turn to another example

00:53:40.061 --> 00:53:44.043
to explain why death in particular
is such a powerful moment

00:53:44.043 --> 00:53:47.573
for imagining this type of continuity.

00:53:47.573 --> 00:53:48.993
For this I draw on the work

00:53:48.993 --> 00:53:51.727
of anthropologist Martha Macintyre,

00:53:51.727 --> 00:53:54.030
who has worked on the island of Tubetube,

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.456
one of the many islands
in the Massim region

00:53:56.456 --> 00:53:57.697
of Papua New Guinea.

00:53:57.697 --> 00:54:00.742
Here, as in many other
places in this region,

00:54:00.742 --> 00:54:03.821
the social groupings
that last through time

00:54:03.821 --> 00:54:06.175
are named matrilineages,

00:54:06.175 --> 00:54:08.789
each made up of all the people

00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:12.956
who can trace descent through
women to same female forebear.

00:54:14.107 --> 00:54:17.449
People here have a folk
theory of the human body,

00:54:17.449 --> 00:54:21.616
which says that bones are
made up of mother's milk,

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.846
which in turn is passed
from mother to daughter

00:54:25.846 --> 00:54:27.410
down the generations.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:28.543
The bones, in other words,

00:54:28.543 --> 00:54:31.317
are quintessentially maternal substance,

00:54:31.317 --> 00:54:33.444
which is sourced all the way up

00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:36.273
to that founding female forebear.

00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:38.241
This means that, quite literally,

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:43.237
the members of the matrilineage
share the exact same bones.

00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:47.654
When it comes to bones,
they are one kind of people.

00:54:47.654 --> 00:54:52.389
Each person just a replica
of one another through time.

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:55.400
But you can see the
problem with this idea.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:59.725
Living people, kicking,
screaming, crawling babies

00:54:59.725 --> 00:55:01.975
are not made of just bones.

00:55:03.422 --> 00:55:07.589
To be viable persons, they
also need blood and flesh.

00:55:08.667 --> 00:55:12.549
This soft and wobbly stuff,
the folk theory goes,

00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:14.297
comes from the father.

00:55:14.297 --> 00:55:17.496
And because one's father belongs
to a different matrilineage

00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:19.121
from that of one's mother,

00:55:19.121 --> 00:55:21.865
the marriage would
otherwise be incestuous,

00:55:21.865 --> 00:55:26.652
the living person can only
ever be a mixed-up person,

00:55:26.652 --> 00:55:30.841
an idiosyncratic combination
of these maternal bones

00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:33.882
and those paternal blood and flesh.

00:55:33.882 --> 00:55:35.142
A combination which,

00:55:35.142 --> 00:55:38.630
like the eight ancestral
sources of the Veso,

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.875
is here today and gone tomorrow.

00:55:41.875 --> 00:55:44.875
However, death resolves the problem.

00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:48.953
Quite literally, the
process of decomposition

00:55:48.953 --> 00:55:51.305
gets rid of the paternal stuff,

00:55:51.305 --> 00:55:53.972
leaving just the maternal bones.

00:55:54.878 --> 00:55:59.007
In addition, funerals consist
of complex transactions

00:55:59.007 --> 00:56:03.118
in which goods that
represent flesh and blood

00:56:03.118 --> 00:56:07.187
are sent back to the family
of the father of the deceased,

00:56:07.187 --> 00:56:10.161
which originally
contributed to the person.

00:56:10.161 --> 00:56:14.888
In this way, funerals are
thought to de-conceive the person

00:56:14.888 --> 00:56:16.569
who has just died.

00:56:16.569 --> 00:56:18.508
As a result of all this,

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:20.480
the people of Tubetube come to imagine

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.303
the essence of their matrilineage,

00:56:23.303 --> 00:56:28.003
the bones in their pure
and unadulterated form,

00:56:28.003 --> 00:56:30.136
as lasting through time,

00:56:30.136 --> 00:56:34.249
originating in the ancestral
past and ready to be passed on

00:56:34.249 --> 00:56:36.385
to the next generation.

00:56:36.385 --> 00:56:40.909
This, then, is why death
is a source of celebration.

00:56:40.909 --> 00:56:44.296
Sure, people are born,
reproduce, age, and die.

00:56:44.296 --> 00:56:48.111
As individuals, they're here
today and gone tomorrow.

00:56:48.111 --> 00:56:49.998
But death lends itself,

00:56:49.998 --> 00:56:53.418
aided by a lot of ritual
and imaginative work,

00:56:53.418 --> 00:56:56.030
to the creations of
systems of social relations

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:58.036
between the dead and the living,

00:56:58.036 --> 00:57:00.055
between the living and the unborn,

00:57:00.055 --> 00:57:03.296
which are long-lasting,
defy the passage of time,

00:57:03.296 --> 00:57:05.920
and transcend death itself.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.004
Let me conclude with a reflection

00:57:08.004 --> 00:57:09.608
on the contemporary relevance

00:57:09.608 --> 00:57:11.685
of what I've presented you today,

00:57:11.685 --> 00:57:16.103
drawing on material from some
very far-off lands and people.

00:57:16.103 --> 00:57:19.918
The reflection is that there
is an obvious dark side

00:57:19.918 --> 00:57:21.613
to the celebration,

00:57:21.613 --> 00:57:24.175
a dark side which my Veso friends,

00:57:24.175 --> 00:57:27.942
I just state this without
having time to explain,

00:57:27.942 --> 00:57:30.635
have found ways of overcoming.

00:57:30.635 --> 00:57:32.938
But others have not.

00:57:32.938 --> 00:57:36.248
The dark side is that, as
you might have noticed,

00:57:36.248 --> 00:57:40.260
the process of creating
long-lasting social systems

00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:44.052
based on kinds of people
that are nicely sorted

00:57:44.052 --> 00:57:46.061
into separate tombs,

00:57:46.061 --> 00:57:50.616
or based on the recovery
of pure and pristine bones,

00:57:50.616 --> 00:57:53.882
gives rise to a kind of
essentialist thinking

00:57:53.882 --> 00:57:57.168
that can very quickly
turn into ethnic hatred,

00:57:57.168 --> 00:58:01.249
parochial nationalism,
and racial discrimination.

00:58:01.249 --> 00:58:05.195
So that instead of building
walls around the dead,

00:58:05.195 --> 00:58:08.894
we find walls sprouting up everywhere

00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:12.243
to divide people who are believed
to be essentially like us

00:58:12.243 --> 00:58:13.326
from people who are believed

00:58:13.326 --> 00:58:16.134
to be essentially different from us.

00:58:16.134 --> 00:58:19.243
And when this happens,
the celebration is over.

00:58:19.243 --> 00:58:20.390
Thank you.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:23.390
(audience applauds)

00:58:29.115 --> 00:58:32.865
(energetic electronic music)
