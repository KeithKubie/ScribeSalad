00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.400
You can only spend a certain of time practising getting the white in the pocket.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.760
So I thought I would design a game.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.820
And I have called the game Loop. 'Cause it's loop in stead of pool but different and also because it

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.239
is a loop. What I realize when I was
coming up with games

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.939
is to play it with a small number of
balls is much more fun

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.579
than with a large number of balls.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.299
you have a black, which I'll put there. 
You have two colours like this.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600
And you have the cue ball. It's a two-player game

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.039
and the aim is you gotta get a colour in and then you got to get the black in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.160
starting if you're cueing off, you put the cue ball

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.179
somewhere in the line between the black and here

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.010
and you got to say which ball is the one you're going to go for. So let's say I go for red.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.050
and then .... here we go.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.510
okay this is a hypothetical position. I got to get the red in the pocket

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.470
I can't hit the side here because the
black is in the way.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.040
And so what you need to do is I need to hit this red ball so it rebounds and goes in.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.820
How do I know where to hit it?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.380
Well, I can use the focus point because if I hit

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.520
the red in such a way that it goes in that direction

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.619
I know it's going to rebound and go in. So I need to hit the red ball

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.619
exactly in that way. 
So  I need to hit it like that.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.400
Because if it's coming from there

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.889
it will go in. I'll give it a try but I won't get it because I'm a really bad pool player.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.580
I guess I need to....

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.149
well, is it going to go in? It didn't work. When you get good at this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.649
when you understand how it works, that is have to do it, and I just opens up lots

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.040
of really fun patterns of play.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.180
Basically the trick is whenever you play

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.210
you've got to be thinking about this
dot and how things will happen if they

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.480
were coming from this dot. And that's kinda the axis you use to pot

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.860
all the balls. So you're trying to get the red ball in.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.740
I will get the red ball in. Once I've got the red ball in,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.460
I will then go for the black ball

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.200
I'll get the black ball in. Then the
moment the black ball is in the pocket

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
I have won. So I'm going to challenge
your nephew Jacob to a game of loop.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.600
I'm going for red.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.790
You need to go for the yellow. And the thing is

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.580
what you know is if you hit the yellow, so that the yellow goes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.750
exactly through here, you know it's going to rebound into there.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.980
But you need to, not only do you need to hit it in this direction

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.830
you need to hit it at just the right force

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.770
so not too hot, not too cold.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.330
Oh, Brilliant! That's really good.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.320
That was your first ever time you've hit it. With a bit of practice, you would get that in.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.840
Whooph. What you need to do now.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.650
You have to try and find a way of getting that in. If you hit

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.860
that yellow

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.480
as if it's coming from there

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.000
it's going to hit that 
and it should just go straight from there.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.030
What you see is that there is a tendency for the balls to start in the centre

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.090
and to go around. 
And so you also need to start to think about

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.120
trying to reposition the balls in the centre.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.140
But what I would try and do to get this in.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.299
Oooh, great shot!  So this is a snooker in loop and it's called a snoop.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.359
Yeah there's no way I'm going to be able to get this. I'm just going to move this to here.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.290
Oh! You need to hit the yellow ball

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.979
as if it's hit by the white ball coming
from the focus point

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.359
so, as if it's coming in this direction here. 
And then it'll hit it

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.270
and rebound there.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.190
Oh! Yes!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.460
So you need to -
- play it if white was coming there

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.699
but then it's going to hit that, isn't it?

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.220
Is that skill?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.400
I think that's actually the best shot in the history of loop.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.199
Yeah, well, seeing as there's 
only been one game of it so far.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.630
What happens if you pot the cue ball?

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.490
You lost. On the black you lost. 
I mean that's the rules of pool too, isn't it?

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.169
Then you've lost. That's a loss? 
Yeah, I think the black is the

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.220
the... the... that's happened in pool

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.080
It's a black ball game, but if someone pots the white they lose the game.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.159
I hit it too hard but I was on the money. 
- It was your rule. It was the rule you wanted.

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.259
It's true. I beat the inventor of loop.

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.879
Well done.
