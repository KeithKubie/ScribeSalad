00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:09.948
A famous Ancient Greek once said,

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:14.233
"Give me a place to stand,
and I shall move the Earth."

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:18.354
But this wasn't some wizard claiming to
perform impossible feats.

00:00:18.354 --> 00:00:20.779
It was the mathematician Archimedes

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.311
describing the fundamental principle
behind the lever.

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.216
The idea of a person moving such a huge
mass on their own

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.099
might sound like magic,

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.807
but chances are you've seen it
in your everyday life.

00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:37.588
One of the best examples is something
you might recognize

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:39.756
from a childhood playground:

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:42.399
a teeter-totter, or seesaw.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.339
Let's say you and a friend 
decide to hop on.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.350
If you both weigh about the same,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.569
you can totter back and forth
pretty easily.

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.011
But what happens if your 
friend weighs more?

00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:56.407
Suddenly, you're stuck up in the air.

00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:59.489
Fortunately, you probably know what to do.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.867
Just move back on the seesaw, 
and down you go.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.946
This may seem simple and intuitive,

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:10.292
but what you're actually doing is using a
lever to lift a weight

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:12.431
that would otherwise be too heavy.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:16.292
This lever is one type of what we call
simple machines,

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:20.931
basic devices that reduce the amount
of energy required for a task

00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:24.314
by cleverly applying the basic 
laws of physics.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:26.402
Let's take a look at how it works.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:30.272
Every lever consists of 
three main components:

00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:34.391
the effort arm, the resistance arm,
and the fulcrum.

00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:37.700
In this case, 
your weight is the effort force,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.257
while your friend's weight provides
the resistance force.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:45.359
What Archimedes learned was that there
is an important relationship

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.834
between the magnitudes of these forces
and their distances from the fulcrum.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:52.372
The lever is balanced when

00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:56.179
the product of the effort force
and the length of the effort arm

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.820
equals the product of the resistance force
and the length of the resistance arm.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.063
This relies on one of the 
basic laws of physics,

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:11.677
which states that work measured in joules
is equal to force applied over a distance.

00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:15.633
A lever can't reduce the amount of work 
needed to lift something,

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.275
but it does give you a trade-off.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:22.800
Increase the distance and 
you can apply less force.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.937
Rather than trying to lift 
an object directly,

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:29.689
the lever makes the job easier by 
dispersing its weight

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.057
across the entire length of the effort
and resistance arms.

00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:37.412
So if your friend weighs 
twice as much as you,

00:02:37.412 --> 00:02:42.469
you'd need to sit twice as far from the
center as him in order to lift him.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.154
By the same token, his little sister,
whose weight is only a quarter of yours,

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:51.283
could lift you by sitting four times
as far as you.

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:56.445
Seesaws may be fun, but the implications
and possible uses of levers

00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:59.179
get much more impressive than that.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.373
With a big enough lever, 
you can lift some pretty heavy things.

00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:07.871
A person weighing 150 pounds, 
or 68 kilograms,

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:13.650
could use a lever just 3.7 meters long
to balance a smart car,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.326
or a ten meter lever to lift 
a 2.5 ton stone block,

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:22.142
like the ones used to build
the Pyramids.

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:26.640
If you wanted to lift the Eiffel Tower,
your lever would have to be a bit longer,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.870
about 40.6 kilometers.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.504
And what about Archimedes' famous boast?

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:35.417
Sure, it's hypothetically possible.

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:39.771
The Earth weighs 6 x 10^24 kilograms,

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:45.172
and the Moon that's about 
384,400 kilometers away

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:47.456
would make a great fulcrum.

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.847
So all you'd need to lift the Earth

00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:54.239
is a lever with a length of about a
quadrillion light years,

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.621
1.5 billion times the distance to
the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.197
And of course a place to stand
so you can use it.

00:04:03.197 --> 00:04:05.293
So for such a simple machine,

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:08.407
the lever is capable of some pretty
amazing things.

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:12.332
And the basic elements of levers
and other simple machines

00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:15.842
are found all around us in the various
instruments and tools

00:04:15.842 --> 00:04:21.380
that we, and even some other animals,
use to increase our chances of survival,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.821
or just make our lives easier.

00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:27.435
After all, it's the mathematical 
principles behind these devices

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:29.526
that make the world go round.
