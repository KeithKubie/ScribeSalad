00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.340
Find the slope of the line
pictured on the graph.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.160
So the slope of a line is
defined to be rise over run.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:22.020
Or you could also view it as
change in y over change in x.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.450
And let me show you
what that means.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.120
So let's start at some
arbitrary point on this line,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.320
and they highlight
some of these points.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.570
So let's start at one of
these points right over here.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.020
So if we wanted to start one
of these points-- and let's

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.840
say we want to change our x
in the positive direction.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.220
So we want to go to the right.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.160
So let's say we want
to go from this point

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.360
to this point over here.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.830
How much do we
have to move in x?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.277
So if we want to move in x,
we have to go from this point

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:48.860
to this point.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.970
We're going from
negative 3 to 0.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.370
So our change in x-- and
this triangle, that's delta.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.580
That means "change in."

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.600
Our change in x is equal to 3.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.830
So what was our change in y when
our change in x is equal to 3?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.840
Well, when we moved from
this point to this point,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.370
our x-value changed by 3, but
what happened to our y-value?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.140
Well, our y-value went down.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.840
It went from positive
3 to positive 2.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.880
Our y-value went down by 1.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.350
So our change in y is
equal to negative 1.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.290
So we rose negative 1.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.570
We actually went down.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.430
So our rise is
negative 1 when our

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.890
run-- when our
change in x-- is 3.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.850
So change in y over change
in x is negative 1 over 3,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.710
or we could say that our
slope is negative 1/3.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.800
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.270
It is negative 1/3.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.980
And I want to show you that we
can do this with any two points

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.010
on the line.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.990
We could even go further
than 3 in the x-direction.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.190
So let's go the other way.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.690
Let's start at this
point right over

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.550
here and then move backwards
to this point over here,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.180
just to show you that we'll
still get the same result.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.780
So to go from this point to that
point, what is our change in x?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.870
So our change in x is
this right over here.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.260
Our change in x is that
distance right over there.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.120
We started at 3, and
we went to negative 3.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000
We went back 6.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840
Over here, our change in
x is equal to negative 6.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800
We're starting at
this point now.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.780
So over here our change
in x is negative 6.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.970
And then when our change
in x is negative 6, when

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.660
we start at this
point and we move 6

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.330
back, what is our change
of y to get to that point?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.570
Well, our y-value went from 1.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.290
That was our y-value
at this point.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.955
And then when we go back to
this point, our y-value is 3.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:53.650
So what did we do?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.160
We moved up by 2.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.775
Our change in y is equal to 2.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.890
Slope is change in y over
change in x, or rise over run.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.690
Change in y is just rise.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.580
Change in x is
just run, how much

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.480
you're moving in the
horizontal direction.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.240
So rise over run in this
example right over here

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.880
is going to be 2
over negative 6,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.229
which is the same
thing as negative 1/3.

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.770
And you could verify
it for yourself.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.228
Take any of these
two points, start

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:28.150
at one of these two
points, and figure out

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.870
what is the run to
get to the next point,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.130
and then what is the rise
to get the next point.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.149
And for any line, the
slope won't change.

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.940
Let me do it again.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.320
Over here, we had to move in the
positive 3 direction, so that

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.370
is our run.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.420
So this right here
is positive 3.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.100
That's our run.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.377
But what's our rise?

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:48.710
Well, we actually went down,
so we have a negative rise.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.270
Our rise is negative 1.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.420
So we have negative
1 as our rise.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.490
We went down.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.340
And our run was positive 3.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.345
So our slope here
is negative 1/3.
