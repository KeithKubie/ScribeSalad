Congress in Washington, D.C.

&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Joy Harjo and A.B.
Spellman could not be better suited

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.380
to be up here with me today.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.590
Both are claimed poets but both are
also uniquely connected to music.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.510
Joy Harjo performed for many years
with her band, Poetic Justice,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.360
and currently tours
with Aerodynamics.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.890
She has 5 CDs of music and poetry
including her most recent award

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.210
winning album of traditional fruit,
Red Dreams, A Trail Beyond Tears

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.290
and Winding Through the Milky Way,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.970
which won the Native
American music award

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.220
for best female artist
of the year in 2009.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.240
Harjo currently has a commission
from the Public Theatre of New York

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.390
to write, We Were There When
Jazz Was Invented, a musical play

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.580
that will restore southeastern
natives

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.950
to the American story
of blues and jazz.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.610
Speaking of jazz A.B. Spellman
is an expert in the form.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.280
He published his first book
of poems, The Beautiful Days,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.940
in 1964 by working as
a jazz music reviewer.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.620
In addition to writing reviews,
essays and poetry for Metronome,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.740
Down Beat and Rhythm Magazine,
he published Four Lives

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.720
in the Bepop Business in 1966.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.640 position:56%
In 1975, Spellman became director of
the Arts in Education Study Project

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.250
for the National Endowment for the
Arts where he worked until 2005.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.360
His service to the organization is
honored by the A.B. Spellman Award

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.990
for Jazz Advocacy bestowed
upon an individual

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.290
who has contributed significantly
to the appreciation, knowledge

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.950
and advancement of
the art form of jazz.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.740
Before we begin with the
readings and the performances

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.390
and then our conversation, I want

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.900
to give us just a little
bit of context.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.680
In the excellent reference
book of Poet's Glossary,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.790
Edward Hirsch writes, "Song was
originally inseparable from poetry.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.160
They were one in the same and
poems were meant to be chanted

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.500
and sung sustained
by oral tradition."

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.330
Poetry is still considered
song in many parts

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.260
of the world whether
it is presented with

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.640
or without musical accompaniment.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.550
The musical element is
so intrinsic to poetry

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.930
that one never forgets its origin
in musical expression in singing,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.270
chanting and recitation
to musical accompaniment.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.410
With that in mind please join me

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.510
in welcoming Joy Harjo
and A.B. Spellman.

&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: [Inaudible] It's good
to be here and especially to get

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:04.430
to present with A.B. Spellman,
who is one of the major ancestors

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.530
of poetry jazz and so on.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.050
I also want to acknowledge
Michael Harper, poet,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.380
whose poetry also led
me to poetry and jazz.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.980
I'm just going to start
with a piece called,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.620
We Were There When
Jazz Was Invented.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.800
I'm a member of the Mvskoke
Creek Nation from Oklahoma.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.180
Our people were moved from
the southeast from Alabama.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.060
The Mvskoke homelands were all over
the southeast, Florida, Georgia,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.640
Alabama, Tennessee
over into Mississippi,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.730
and the Mvskokian peoples were even
all the way through the southeast,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.490
and we were part of the origin
story of blues and jazz.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.880
We're often left out of the story.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.090 position:56%
We're often left out of the story of
American music, of American history.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.680
We've been essentially
disappeared from the narrative.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.560
And yet, when you go to our
ceremonial grounds, our dances,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.860
you can hear, you hear
it, there it is.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.920
And if you think of the origin
of jazz being Congo Square,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.730
where the African Peoples
came, got free on Sundays,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.110
Congo Square was a Mvskokian
tribal village and there it is.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.550
So, we were part of that story.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.820
This poem is for Jim Pepper
Henry, one of the first,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.120
and I just lost my read somewhere.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.390
Thank you.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.730
Jim Pepper Henry, a Mvskoke
Kaw, musician, played jazz

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.820
and he was playing standards and
working rock, mixing rock and jazz

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.390
and his band was one of the first
to do a fusion with beginnings.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.720
He was also part one of the
people who began the world jazz.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.290
He helped, one of the
originators of world music.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.450
Anyway I wrote this poem
as a tribute to him and one

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.920
of his most famous songs is
Wichiti Tai To from the song

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.290
that his grandfather taught him.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.950
So here I'll read the poem
and it's called We Were There

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.440
When Jazz Was Invented
because I'm working on a story

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.790
to include Native peoples, our
Native peoples in an origin story.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.850
Okay, Wichiti Tai To.

of them in the quaver of fish dreams

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.000

all, just the flash of the jump

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.940 position:56%
from a night rainbow, to an island
of fire and flowers-such a holy leap

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.420
between forgetting and jazz.

How long has it been
since I called you back?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.040
After Albuquerque with my
baby in diapers on my hip;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.940
it was a difficult birth, I
was just past girlhood slammed

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.240
into motherhood.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.740
What a bear.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.070
Beyond the door of my tongue
is a rail and I'm leaning

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.600
over to watch bears catch
salmon in their teeth.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.160
That realm isn't anywhere
near Los Angeles.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.170
If I dream it all back then I
reconstruct that song buried

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.730
in the muscle of urgency.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.760
I'm bereft in the lost
nation of debtors.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.670
Wey yo hey, wey yo hey yah hey.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.940
Pepper jumped and some of us
went with him to the stomp.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:58.510

back up into the sky, holy.

of our folly, drawn of ashes

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.500
around the hole of our undoing.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.040
Back there the ceremonial fire
was disassembled, broken and bare

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.260
like chordal breaks
forgetting to blossom.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.450
Around midnight, I turn my back

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.990
and watch prayers take
root beneath the moon.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.920
Not that dreams have anything
to do with it exactly.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.320
I get jumpy in the aftermath
of a disturbed music.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.480
I carried that baby up the
river giving birth to nothing

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.290
but the blues in buckskin and silk.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.090

bird have you chosen to follow

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.490

There has to be a saxophone
somewhere,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.530
some notes bear little
resemblance to the grown child.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.490
Now I've got to be dreaming.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.100

leap to your arms as you lean

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.030

hear the music hopping

poems that integrated music and,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.570
music and poetry and this poem
actually is more about music

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:09.350
as metaphor and so not much
to tell you about it except

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.250
that the weird words in the
second stanza are technical terms

It's called Groovin' Low.

Any hipsters in the room
will recognize this as a play

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.410

tune called Groovin' High.

more mellow these days:

roll but more of a cool foxtrot.

locks; I've learned to boogie

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.390
Between the self and
its song is the mind.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.300
Between the mind and
the song is the melody.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.270
Between the song and its
melody is the rhythm.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.450
Between the rhythm and
the melody is the mind.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.810
Between the mind and
its song is the word.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.710
Between the word and
the mind is the voice.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.270
Between the voice and
the word is the thought.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.830
Between the thought and
the voice is the self.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:31.790
Between the word and
the self is the shadow.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:37.040
Between the shadow and
the self is the light.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:46.050
Between the light and the word is
the music The song is the melody

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.910
in the word in the rhythm.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.990
The self holds the mind to the
word and the thought of the song.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.200
The voice in the song
sings the self to the mind.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.540
The light lights the shadow
of the voice and its melody.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:07.450
The rhythm moves the self
through the dimming night's song.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:13.740
The thought in the song is of
night's shadow without music.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:23.460
[ Applause ]

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.480
This poem I wrote in a
hotel room one night.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.250
Hotel rooms are good
places to write poems.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:35.240
It was in Boston I believe, and
I was listening to the radio

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:41.470
and on one station I heard some of
my favorite Johann Sebastian Bach.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:46.040
It was the keyboard
concerto in f minor

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.570
and then another station later
I turned to another station

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.870
and heard John Coltrane
playing Trane Slow Blues.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.730
The thing about these two poets,
these two musicians is that I

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.060
as a poet aspire to be good.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.640
I think if I write enough poems
maybe I'll stumble on a couple

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.330
of great ones somewhere, but
with people like Sebastian Bach

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.930
and John Coltrane you deal with
something greater than good,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.000
greater than great, you
deal with the sublime,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.680
which I can't even aspire to.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.540
I don't think that there are
five musicians on the planet

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.760 position:56%
at any given time who achieve that
state where it gets to be about more

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.860
than music, more than beauty,
more than power, more than truth.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.270
It's something where you feel
that you are absolutely changed

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.970
on levels that you cannot parce.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.270
So, this poem.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.920
Dear John Coltrane, dead
night has me writing poetry

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.510
in another hotel room.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.900
J.S. Bach is on the radio, the
keyboard concerto in f minor,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.090
the one you also hear
on oboe or violin.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:06.380
The largo second movement behings
and the book in my hand drops,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.890
the room fades, and I put my
reason down to trail the bach

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.880
of endless line along
this earthless path.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.060
Each note full and bright, a
brilliant footprint on the dark,

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.370 position:56%
through beauty, past knowledge and
into that state that shines too much

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.080
to be wisdom, is too
transparent to be art.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.290
I catch a fear of the place
where he will lower me

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.530
when this transporting
melody closes.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.790 position:56%
Then it closes on itself, dear John,

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.390
and I'm back at the
beginning better.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.100
Later different station,
cold room dimming,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.810
it's you, John, Trane Slow Blues.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.240
Now it's your line that
opens and opens and opens

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.050
and I'm flying that way again.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:10.200
Same sky, different
moon, this midnight globe

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.040
that toned those now lost
blue rooms where things

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.240
like jazz float the mind.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.230
This motion, the still and airless
propulsion I know as inner flight.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.580
This view the one I cannot
set with my eyes open.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.730
I hear the beginning approach

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.890
and I know the line I travel was a
horizon, the circle of the world.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.060
Another freedom flight to
another starting place.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:44.150
If I believed in heaven,
I would ask if you, J.C.,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.660
and Bach ever swap infinite
fours and jam the sound

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.570
that light makes going and
coming and if you exchange maps

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.800
to those exclusive
clouds you travel through.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.660
And do you give them names?

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.860
You asked for three
poems by other people?

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.160
All right.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.960
Thank you very much.

to take a second to get mic'd up

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.640

our conversation.

All right.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.170

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.470
Am I live?

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.900
Can you hear me?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.220
Now can you hear me?

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.880
You can hear me, okay.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.680
Thanks to you both for
contextualizing our conversation.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.810
Your readings made for
very interesting contrasts

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.250
in how poetry can engage with
music and specifically jazz,

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:49.750
and it made me think of these two
quotes I pulled from both of you.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.900
In an interview recently,
Mr. Spellman,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.920
you said I'm still a
two-dimensional page poet at heart.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.860
That would be interesting to
talk about that kind of realm

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.800
in relationship to music especially
when you're reading poems that are

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.390
so indebted to music as the theme.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.090
By contrast, Joy, you
say for me music gets

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.960
into the places that
words can't touch.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.090
When people ask me how do
you do both disciplines

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.320
by which you meant poetry and
song, I say I think of it as one

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.030
but it's almost like
having two lovers.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.690
So, I thought we'd begin by just
talking about for you, you know,

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.010
in terms of forming content
in terms of this relationship

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.410
between these two, these two forms

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.070
of expression how you
negotiate that.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.370
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Okay.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.670
I'm ready.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.850
Yeah, I was, I'm thinking what you
said about a person of the book,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.170
and when I first started writing
poetry, I always loved poetry

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.880
and I came to poetry through music.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.390
My mother used to write
songs and a lot of ballads,

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.340
she loved Nat King Cole,
and she also often played

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.540
with country swing musicians in
Tulsa, but I came to my education

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.860
in poetry in the US
educational systems

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.720
and then later Indian boarding
school and poetry was in a book.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.860
But then as I came
to being a poet, I,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.990
and I'm a Mvskoke person I went
looking for my people's poetry

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.820
and found out I'm related
distantly to Alexander Posey,

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.650 position:56%
a very well known Creek poet who was
writing and alive during the time

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.750
that blues and jazz, you know,
around the time of Buddy Bolding

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:37.800 position:56%
and so on, and but then I also went
back to I think where is our poetry?

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.550
Most of our poetry, most of the
world's poetry, isn't in books.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.140
It's part of, it's out of
reality, oral traditions.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.510
So I went home, you know, home
to the ceremonial grounds too

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:55.110
and there is where I heard it's
this incredible song poetry.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.750
A lot of it is announcement
and there's a form to it

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.800
and it's beautiful
and that inspired me.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.380
Sometimes it's called
meko hadjeda [phonetic]

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.890
or in my pronunciation is horrible,
but it's usually announcing,

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.950 position:56%
it's setting into place often poetry
does, you know, Coltrane is setting

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.760
into place a place where you can
actually can see, hear the divine,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.110
you know, he's talking to God.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.510
And so in what we're going to hear
we'll just play just not very much

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.810
of it, but you can hear Sherman
Franks who was very renowned

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:34.560
as a speaker who is calling,
talking about calling in leaders

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.320
from other ceremonial grounds
and talking to them about dances

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.720
and saying come in and sit down.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.320
And then there's a whole, you
know, calling in different grounds.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.680
So there's form, strict
form to all of this.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.500
So I would like you to
play the first it's called,

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.950
I think it's the very
first one, the top one.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.250
This is Sherman Franks.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:05.550
We'll just play a little
of it so you can hear it.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.870
No, the very first link.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:13.900
It's called Stomp Dance.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.200
I'm sorry.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:24.710
What? It's the very first one.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.510
Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:26:08.790
[ Speaking Native Language ]

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.500
Okay. Thank you.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.610
So that's just a little bit of
that form, that oratorical form,

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.990
that to me is beautiful,
and I'm learning Mvskoke,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.270
I don't know it well, but I
want to learn it well enough

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:27.530
so I can understand the form and
exactly how it's put together,

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.030
but it inspires me to hear that.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.650
And that is one form of
Mvskoke poetry, yeah.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.950
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Yeah,

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.430
I guess first of all there
are several factors involved

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:43.440
in my own inhibitions that
lead me on the page primarily,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.750
and that has to do with the fact
that I didn't come to poetry

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.560
from the tradition as you did.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.920
I came, I came to music
that way because I lived

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.040
in jazz my whole life and later
expanded my interest in music

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.630
as I left the south, but no,
it was, that was one world.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.000
And then when I became
more literate in college

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.950
when I started being exposed to a
wider range of artists or writers,

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:20.020
then that commitment to the
page was sort of structured

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.170
into my reflexive system.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:28.080
The poets that affected me
most in my formative years

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.970
in the 1950s were poets who were
very concerned with measure,

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.030
with [inaudible] were going to work

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:42.000
with whether the line broke
according to breath or according

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.660
to text and things like that.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.750
And that really was
my formative period.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:53.140
Now then when the movement began
among African Americans or got,

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.950
not when it began because it was
always there, but when it got to be

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.480 position:56%
so prominent among African American
people in the civil rights movements

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.410
and the struggles for human
rights and the anti-war movements

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.560
and the movements of people
with specific cultures when all

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.870
of that developed, starting
developing in the 60s,

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.120
I was caught rather off guard.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.650
And so I'm confronted with
things like meeting Malcolm X

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.220 position:56%
and telling him I'm a poet and him
asking me, well, what does that have

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.090
to do with what we're doing
and me saying, well, not much.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.390
[Laughter] And that hurt.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.970
That hurt a great deal.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.130
Now the younger poets
who came behind me,

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.370
the younger African American poets,
started from a different place

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.770
because by that time they were,
I mean I moved into the movement

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.660
as a form poet, but the younger
poets moved into the poetry

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.780
and the movement at the same time

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.450
and they took performance
very, very seriously.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.820
They were faced with reaching
audiences that were not people

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.230
who sat in small rooms
and discussed, you know,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.260
finite issues of aesthetics.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.420
They were trying to relate to
something that was happening

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.170
in the world that was
greater than them,

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.500
and this was very difficult for me.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.780
I never have been good
at writing topical poems.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.720
I've tried I don't know how
many times to write a poem

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.230 position:56%
about the killings on the streets of
young Black men and never been able

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.600
to succeed in pulling a poem off.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.750
I could write a great essay on
it, and I've written pieces on it,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.340
but I have never been
able to make a poem of it.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.120
And that's an ambition of mine.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:37.070
So, as goes to music, I have
moved in with musicians.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.900
Musicians have found music in
my poems and set them to music.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:51.400
And, in fact, I sent, I sent
a piece in do you have it?

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.190
It's called the Passion
for John Coltrane and Bach.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.490
You don't have it?

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.790
&gt;&gt; No, sir.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.090
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Okay.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.390
So, the composer named Jeff
Scott has set several of my poems

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.140
to music, and I read it with
them and that works quite well.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:11.150
It's a good piece that he wrote,
and I find myself now writing,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.400
I've just completed Legretto
[phonetic] on the Great Migration

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:21.790
where I could write for singers and
for musicians, but as of a matter

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:27.340 position:56%
of performing the way Joy
performs, I've read with Ann Halprin

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.000
in New York this spring and she's
working with her young nephew

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.950
who is an alto saxophonist.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:38.830
She's writing a lot of
her pages are sounds.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.340
I'm much, I'm just too
inhibited to do that.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.690
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I do though
wonder what it's like,

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.800
what it was like to hear that
piece performed, you know,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.720
what it was like to see
music attached to that piece.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.240
And, Joy, I'm wondering when
you write a poem that is printed

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.250
in your new book, what is
it like to read that poem

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.640
as opposed to performing that poem?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.770
Sort of the converse of what
I'm asking Mr. Spellman.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.380
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Well, for me the
thing is I read with the musicians

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.090 position:56%
and it's a piece for a wind quintet,
string quartet, jazz trio and me.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:18.730
And it's a pleasure
because I actually listen,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.430
I try to read into the music.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.460
It's not background music.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.400
I read into the composition
and it works quite well

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.890
and it gives a great
deal of satisfaction

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:34.380
and it's has had good response so.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.550
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Yeah, I started
out just reading my poems

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.970
and that one is the one I read.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:45.560
I haven't started trying to sing
it and, but it's very different.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.770
What I've discovered
is with Poetic Justice,

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.980
and I'm one of that
generation that I came

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.740
out of Native rights movements
part of the civil rights movements

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.610
and so I started writing poetry out
of response to what was going on.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.100
I'm terrible at occasional poems.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.120
I can't write on command either.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.490
I can't do it.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.850
I'm very, I can't do that, but
the poems, my poems started coming

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.930
out of the experience of young
Native women who weren't often,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.920
you know, we weren't
necessarily the speakers

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.410
but we were experiencing
what was going on.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.440 position:56%
So one of mine for Anna Mae Pictou
Aquash, Whose Spirit is Present Here

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.220
and in the Dappled Stars
(for we remember the story

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.010
and must tell again so we
may all live) is a poem

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:34.620
for Anna Mae Pictou Aquash and that
was the first song that I wrote,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.640
but I had the poem first and then
I started reading my poems to music

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.950
and working with a reggae artist
and then it moved into singing.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:47.850 position:56%
But then I found that when I started
writing poems to sing it's phrasing,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.940
the lines are phrasing,
they're like a horn riff,

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.590
you know, they're phrasing.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.220
And so that's how, you
know, it's all about rhythm.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.690
I think everything
goes back to rhythm.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.640
I think the world started
with rhythm.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.980
The big bang, it was somebody,
you know, there you go.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:10.230
It started with rhythm and so
that's, and so I started, you know,

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:15.370
I have to move to it, you
know, and it's on the page,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.700
you move to it on the page too.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.290
We all do, and I think when I
heard Linton Kwesi Johnson read

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.210
in the Netherlands
and I thought, whoa.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.280
And then I heard Jayne Cortez

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.610
and I thought there it
is, you know, there it is.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.910
It's, you know.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:34.810
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: I do think
that music does affect my poetry

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:38.540
because for one thing I
write with a lot of iambics.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.070
This is not a conscious
decision this just,

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.840
it's something I discovered
about myself that is,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.140
you know, there is rhythm.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.280
The line has to swing, the
line has to scan and --

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.580
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: -- swing and scan.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.880
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: It
has to, it has to do it.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.270
Even if they're not set
metric values in there.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:04.820
So, I think that's why this
proposal found the poems

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.300
to be worth writing a piece for.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.600
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.390
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Isn't the I am
kind of a back beat anyway?

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:13.690
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Yeah, it is.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.990
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: It is a back beat.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: So I just want to ask
one more question and then I'm going

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.980
to open it up for all
of you to ask questions,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.960
which is this is different
cultural space music

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.370
and poetry operates right
now in America what you think

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.880
that might say about
either the power of either

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.470
or if it's just a sort of
artificial construction?

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:36.890
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Sometimes I
think we're going back to that.

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:41.110
I've felt when I, you know, when
I, when I was at home and realized

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.800
that it's poetry, music
and dance are together

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.260
that I think naturally
they're together.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.090
They don't like to be apart.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.650
And I sometimes I see
watching culture evolve

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.360
from when I started writing in
the 70s to the kinds of poetry,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.000
slam poetry and even images
but and watching how all

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.820
of that has evolved, I think
maybe that's where it's headed

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.630
or maybe that's where we've always
been on some level is that we're,

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.340
you know, they want to be together.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.940
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: It's true you see
it more and more and more by poets

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:22.430
who are extremely musical and
whose, even if they're not working

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:27.000
with instruments their own
presentation is more musical.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.200 position:56%
I think that, and also you've got
to realize things like the influence

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.370
of hip hop on younger
people [inaudible],

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:36.320
which also like bridges
this whole thing.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:44.840 position:56%
So, anyway so I think, I think that,
yeah, there are pockets where poets

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:51.330
and poetry consumers sit in small
rooms and deal in the old ways,

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.860
but then there are lots
of, there are larger spaces

00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:00.030
which draw more people where music
and poetry do swing together.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.700
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: But even then
it's important the impeccability

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.360
of the word is important.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.660
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Yeah.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.030
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: You know even with
performance that word is just

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.920
as important as the
impeccability of the music.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.460
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Anybody
have any questions?

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.520
Can you just go up to the mic?

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.830
&gt;&gt; I'll kick it off.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.130
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thank you.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.430
&gt;&gt; Hi, Joy.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.310
It's really good to see you
again, and Mr. Spellman.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:31.250 position:56%
You were talking about poetry and
music I mean it's always been there.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.570
If you go to the Greek tragedies,
you know, the choruses and,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.870
you know, the poets in jazz
and hip hop and, you know,

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.530
that's what it's all about.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.250
I wonder if both of you could
comment on the influence

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:50.480
that Black African American
poetry in music has affected you

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.950 position:56%
in the Native spirit and vice
versa, if there's been any influence

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:57.010
of that in your production
or your writing?

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.650
Has there been any
cross pollination there.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.950
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Definitely.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.250
I think it's in America.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.060 position:56%
I think it was there at Congo Square
when our people were, you know,

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.360
I can see the whole scene.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.970
I mean it was, you know, I
think the African people then

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.820
like our tribes here
everybody knew their identity,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.330
still had their tribal identities
and so I can see what went on.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.080
It was a crossover too.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.570
It didn't just go one way.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.010
There is no one way land bridge
that Natives came across, you know.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.990
It doesn't, a healthy system,
cultural, social, it goes like,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.300
you know, it feeds each other.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.960
And so for me I think
of it beginning there

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.400
but when I first started
writing poetry as a student

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.950
at the University of New
Mexico, I went I thought tribal.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.060
Okay, who are the tribal
people writing?

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.590
I went over and started
looking at African poets

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:50.240
like Ocot Petit [phonetic] from
Uganda and I got to meet him,

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.960
but I started looking there to
looking for somebody contemporary

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.150
who was doing more poetry that
was probably closer related

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.530
to what I would think of as
Mvskoke poetry and then, of course,

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.040
a lot of the African,
African American poets,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.120
June Jordan, there's just so many.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.670
Ishmael Reed brought,
he helped start

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.160
that multicultural poetry movement.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.660
He brought a lot of us to New York
City in the late 70s and that's

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.140
when I heard Jayne Cortez and
something in her, you know,

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.690
and we had a friendship
through the years

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.410
and it was like there, you know.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.230
It opened up that door for me.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.270
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Yeah, well music

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.630
and poetry has been
there in the beginning.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:40.520
In fact, I've always thought
that prosody was an expression

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.060
of the root of music in poetry
that the poets needed a mnemonic

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:50.230
to be able to remember so they
had to develop forms to go with it

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.060 position:56%
and these forms were shaped by song.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.710
I've always thought
that's been the case,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.760
but among African American poets
the concern has always been there.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.560
Langston Hughes, for example, was
very much committed to having,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.890
to finding a jazz voice in the
poem and several of his poems

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:09.600
like The Weary Blues and so
forth are attempts to do that.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.670
He also worked early
with the musicians.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:17.390
In 1958, he had a gig at
the Village Vanguard working

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.980
with Phineas Newborn who was the
greatest jazz pianist you never

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:26.330
heard of and Charles Mingus
which wouldn't you like to have

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.690
that with you on the stage?

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.030
And so that's always been there.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:34.350
He also wrote with
Kurt Vile and so forth.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.630
So, that's always been
an element of the music.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.220
There's nothing new actually.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:46.170
It all was an expression of
tendencies that have been in art

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.360
from the beginning and so people

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.930
like Jayne Cortez was the
first musician I knew who,

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.560
first poet I knew who
traveled with a band.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.860
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Yeah.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.770
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: And I
thought that was great.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:02.160 position:56%
Mary Beraca did some great work with
musicians specifically Craig Harris.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.990
[Inaudible] who died much
too young was wonderful,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.600
was powerful with musicians.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.350
The difference is between this
work, the modern work and the work

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:22.510
of say the Beats was that you
would have when Robert Bly

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.140
or Kenneth Rexroth or those
guys were reading poems

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.740
with music they'd be at the stage
and be some guy plucking along

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.020
with them on the guitar, and
it would be like background.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.450
It really wouldn't be
very much integrated.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:40.960
The differences now is that it's
one thing, that it's one thing,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.910
and that's where the power is.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.480
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: You
have another question?

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.690
&gt;&gt; Hi. First off I really
enjoyed this presentation,

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:56.360
and I have two questions
for you, Mr. Spellman.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.080
My love for jazz brought
me into poetry

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.040
and you mentioned John Coltrane.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.480
The first time I heard Coltrane is
like even now it's like having an

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:14.350
out of body experience, and I
wanted to know when you started

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:19.320
out what jazz musicians
influenced you, touched you deeply

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.140
to write and can you tell me why?

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.510
And one more other question the
Miles Davis movie with Don Cheadle.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.930
I waited years to see
something like that.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.140
I was so totally disappointed.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.070 position:56%
I just wanted to know, I just wanted
to know what did you think of it?

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.320
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: Oh, man.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.670
[Laughter] Well, frankly
they blew it.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.970
There's some good things
in the movie.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.270
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Yeah.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.570
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: There's
some good things.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.870
Don Cheadle did a great job,

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.090
but there are too many
compromises I think that had

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:54.200
to be made to get the movie made.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.500
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Yeah.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.100
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: What's
his name, the British actor?

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.400
Something [inaudible].

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.610
Anyway his role was completely
artificial through much,

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.840
much of the movie and
had nothing to do

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.490
with anything Miles Davis ever did.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:13.490 position:56%
That was a story, there's a lot of
stories to be told about Miles Davis

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.310
and they told just a
small fraction of it.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.670
So, no, that was disappointing.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.590
It's hard to single out musicians
who, jazz musicians who affected me

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:27.770
because I mean I was so,
it was a real pleasure

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.270
to be immersed completely in music

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.950
and lower Manhattan
during the 1960s.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:37.590
That was a real, real pleasure
because the music was everywhere,

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.000
it was immediate, I knew the
musicians, and I could stop by,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.570
I could stop by their pads in
the afternoon and we'd sit there

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.990
and then they'd show me what
they were working on now.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.560
So that was, that was an immersion
that I wish everyone could have.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.360
There aren't any more
scenes like that today.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.380
So it's hard to single out people,
but Coltrane does stand out.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.760
Coltrane does stand out because
Coltrane's commitment was total.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.060
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Yeah.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.410
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: It was a
total complete commitment.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.800
Someone asked him what is
you want your music to do?

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.970
And he said I would like
to make people saints.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.270
And that's what he set out to do.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.540
He set out to change people.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:22.400
And so it was, that's how I
got into writing about music

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.910
because I would go to hear Trane,

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.070
I would leave there
dripping wet feeling

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:31.180 position:56%
like I had had my soul rinsed out
and then I'd read Down Beat magazine

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.800
and they'd say this is the worst
thing to happen to jazz ever.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.100
&gt;&gt; Joy Harjo: Oh, geez.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.400
&gt;&gt; A.B. Spellman: So I would
say either I can't hear

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.700
or these guys can't hear.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.380
So, I started writing
in defense of it so.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.680
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: We were
lucky enough to hear

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.020
from both A.B. Spellman
and Joy Harjo today.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.000
Thanks so much for
coming out and please go

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.510
to their book signings
and buy their books.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:54.010
