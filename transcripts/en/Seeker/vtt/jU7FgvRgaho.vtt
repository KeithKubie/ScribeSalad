00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.040
Eventually humans stop growing, I'm pretty
tall, but I'll never get any taller, only

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.090
shorter.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.150
Sharks?

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.140
They just keep.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.020
Getting.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.910
More.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.800
AWESOME.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.929
Earlier this month, photographers filmed the
largest great white shark ever spotted in

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:21.929
the wild.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.349
Most great whites normally grow 12 to 14 feet
long (3.6-4M), but this one, named Deep Blue,

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.259
was 20 feet long (6M)!

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.430
The director of a non-profit that supports
Pacific marine species, like these sharks,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.710
says seeing one so large means hope for these
animals.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.800
Sharks live a long time, 73 years, and a 2014
paper in Marine &amp; Freshwater Research found

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.370
sharks can take 23 to 33 years to reach full
maturity.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.940
Human size is set from birth.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.440
We grow until we reach a genetically pre-determined
size and then we stop.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.760
As we go through puberty, our body begins
to make sex hormones like estrogen -- both

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.030
men and women produce estrogen, women just
have more.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.530
Estrogen ultimately makes the growth plates
of our bones fuse, stopping growth forever.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.999
But that doesn't happen in sharks -- they'll
keep growing after maturity until they die,

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.200
just more slowly.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.240
Based on her size, Deep Blue is probably 50
years old; bigger sharks means humans ain't

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240
killing them.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.509
Plus, they can breed for longer and age naturally.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.319
Sharks aren't unique in this ability though,
corals, lizards, snakes, and amphibians all

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.940
grow continuously until they die -- all these
animals are "indeterminate growers," and they're

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.170
frickin' awesome.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.289
Kangaroos and wallabies, slowly get bigger
as they age, until they're killed or die of

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.289
disease.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.770
The Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine can live
for thousands of years, growing all the time.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.560
A 2001 study of one tree found it hadn't had
a significant mutation in its pollen or seeds

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.840
over 4700 years.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.590
At some point, the trees stop getting taller,
but continue to thicken at the trunk as long

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.420
as they have the resources.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.740
Continuous growing is inextricably dovetailed
with aging.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.359
Tortoises will keep getting larger, but super
slowly, and their internal organs suffer little

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.130
mutation over time.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.200
The bristlecone pine does the same and simply
does not mutate over time.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Why?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.710
We’re not really sure.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.830
So even though sharks may live 70-plus years,
they WILL age and die naturally.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.010
Some animals, like tortoises for example,
have what is called "Negligible Senescence,"

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.840
i.e. they don't appear to age at all; evolution
didn't program a natural limit to their lives.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.790
With humans, tiny tails on our genes called
telomeres seem to be key to dictating a biological

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.780
end to our lives -- we've talked about this
in other DNews videos, If you were a subscriber,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.780
you'd know that.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.420
Some sharks, turtles, whales, and fish have
all identified as Negligibly Senescent and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.950
many grow forever.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.260
A Rougheye Rockfish was caught, and by looking
at it's growth periods -- like rings on a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.480
tree -- they found it was 205 years old.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480
Just hanging out.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.070
Lobsters will continue growing until preyed
upon or killed from disease, reproductive

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.770
competition or habitat destruction.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.410
One 20 pound (9kg) specimen was found which
is believed to be 140 years old and another

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.750
was caught in 1926 weighing 51.5 lbs… how
old was it?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.750
No idea.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.750
They didn't save it.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.750
They ate it.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.390
Presumably with delicious, delicious butter.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.140
By studying animals with indeterminate growth
and negligible senescence we've learned a

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.080
lot about the aging process, but also about
how resources can affect periods of growth.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.770
Imagine if the longer we lived the more we
grew!

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.710
My 90-year-old grandma be huge!

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.350
I dunno, I kind of like being able to wear
the same shirts for 15 years or more…

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.490
Would you want to keep getting taller?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.770
If we hadn't killed them, many of these animals
would still be around, just like the rhinoceros.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.670
But unlike the giant kangaroo or super-lobster,
there's a crazy plan to save the rhino using

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.670
3D printing.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:04:02.100
