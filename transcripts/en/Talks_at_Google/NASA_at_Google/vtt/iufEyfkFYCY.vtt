CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.370
My name's Chris DiBona.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.920
I look after some space
stuff here at Google--

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.210
I mean, I'm sort of, kind of a
relationship guy with Ames.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.810
And we're pleased and honored
today to have Dr. Worden with

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.740
us from Ames.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.340
Are you-- what's the title
there, Grand Poobah?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.585
Emperor Liege?

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.240
Or what's the title they
have for you at Ames?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.330
S. PETE WORDEN: Unindicted
co-conspirator.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.390
CHRIS DIBONA: Unindicted
co-conspirator.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.660
Not a bad day in Washington,
yeah.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980
So Pete leads NASA Ames Center,
our next-door neighbor

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.570
and our landlord there
for our space there.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.170
And thank you so much
for coming over--

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.665
or having us there but
then coming over

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:46.890
and visiting us today.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.790
Pete has a very long history
both with space and working

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.700
for our country and moving
science forward, which is how

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.360
I got to meet him in
the first place.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.530
Your career goes back 20
years in the Air Force?

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.060
S. PETE WORDEN: 29.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.820
CHRIS DIBONA: 29 years
in the Air Force.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.430
And then short--

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.020
S. PETE WORDEN: 29 years,
three weeks, two days.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.315
CHRIS DIBONA: Really?

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.235
You can count it off?

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.600
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.910
CHRIS DIBONA: And when you were
in the Air Force, you

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.600
worked for the Air Force
Space Command.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.960
S. PETE WORDEN: For part
of my assignment, yeah.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.680
CHRIS DIBONA: So I've always
been interested in this about

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.920
you, but also about the
relationship between NASA and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.360
the Air Force.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.060
Because there was a lot of
tension at the time around the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.700
Shuttle program, around other
things, wasn't there?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.600
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
NASA had--

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.140
CHRIS DIBONA: This is weird
because you're at NASA.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.755
S. PETE WORDEN: NASA has a
long history, and the Air

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.005
Force an even longer history.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.010
In the 1950s, many in the Air
Force began to understand

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.010
space was pretty important,
even in the early '50s.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.852
And the ICBM program was--

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:51.460
they probably don't like me
calling it, but they were

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.510
space weapons.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.790
And so they developed ICBMs.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.160
And about the same time, the
country got very interested in

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.430
space programs in general.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.280
And then 1957, when the Soviets
surprised us with

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.320
Sputnik, there was a lot of
turmoil about what we were

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.840
going to do.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.700
And there were really
two options.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.380
One was to have the military
run the space program and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.130
expand greatly to do satellites
and so forth.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.190
And then the other one was to
set up a civilian agency.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.710
And there was a lot of turmoil
back and forth.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.560
But President Eisenhower decided
that he wanted to have

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.410
the face to the world being
a civil space program.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.530
And it turns out I actually
worked very closely with NASA

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.860
in the national security space
program, although it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.620
important to understand there's
really two national

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.990
security space programs.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.130
There's the national security
space program that the Air

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.860
Force leads that has things like
the Global Positioning

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.050
System and communication
satellites, and then there's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.270
the other program, which I
couldn't even talk about until

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.150
about 10 years ago.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.640
But it's the National
Reconnaissance Office, one of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.010
those "no such agency"
organizations that do spy

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.270
satellites.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.815
CHRIS DIBONA: The story about
how the world found out about

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:15.560
the NRO was when they were
paying too much taxes on their

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.010
Fairfax buildings.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.090
And people are like, well, who
is this actually paying all

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.890
these taxes?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.550
Is this the government
paying taxes just so

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.420
it can remain secret?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.760
And then they got outed
because of that.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.400
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.630
Well, there was a lot
of different issues.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.730
But we've worked very
closely together

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.330
and sometimes competed.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.990
I think probably the really
interesting thing about the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.080
history is that the Apollo
program was really a surrogate

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.670
national security effort, that
the Soviets and the United

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.250
States sort of mutually decided
to compete in space,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.540
and it was a surrogate
for a hot war.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.180
It was part of the Cold War.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.250
And the issue was that whoever
won that basically scared the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.230
other one, to say that, look,
don't challenge us.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.560
Look what we can do.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.490
And it was a closely
run thing.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.110
But it turned out most
of the people that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.460
started NASA were military.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.690
And we still work very closely
with the military, although

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.950
there have been times--

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.050
probably the most interesting
one was the Space Shuttle.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.226
When it was developed, the
military decided it didn't

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.450
want anything to do with it.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.890
And it turned out one of my
predecessors as the director

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.560
of NASA Ames was Hans Mark, and
he was the Secretary of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.300
the Air Force.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.560
And he said, by golly, we're
going to rely on the Space

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.480
Shuttle, and so started to
convert the whole military

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.390
space program over to use
the Space Shuttle.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.020
And they picked military
astronauts, and there was a

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.790
huge launch complex at
Vandenberg Air Force Base that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.950
was for the Blue Shuttles.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.100
And then the--

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.590
CHRIS DIBONA: You should
have painted them blue.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.260
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
actually, we

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.490
were going to do that.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.640
CHRIS DIBONA: It
was too heavy.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.520
Was blue the heaviest color?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.070
S. PETE WORDEN: White is
kind of a NASA color.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.860
And blue is--

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.250
light blue, sky blue.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.300
But it turned out the Challenger
disaster occurred,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.785
and the Air Force said,
OK, that did it.

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:17.640
We want to use expendable
boosters, which probably was a

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.440
good idea not to put everything
in one-- but it's a

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.110
long history.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.130
And my boss, the NASA
administrator, Charlie Bolden,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.160
is a Marine general.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.440
Not all of us can be
Air Force people.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.320
CHRIS DIBONA: What rank did you
achieve in the Air Force?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.330
S. PETE WORDEN: I was
a brigadier general.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.760
CHRIS DIBONA: You were a
brigadier general, yeah.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.950
S. PETE WORDEN: Sometimes
called a baby general.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.500
It's one star.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.040
CHRIS DIBONA: A baby general?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.430
Just one star?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.160
Oh, just one star.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.590
Well, come on.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.260
S. PETE WORDEN: I found out
that nobody knows the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.080
difference between a brigadier
general and a lieutenant

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.460
general and a major general
and a full general, unless

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.390
you're in the military.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.210
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah,
I have no clue.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.780
How many-- is that a
star for every--

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.530
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.870
Full generals have four stars.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.475
CHRIS DIBONA: And isn't the
president like six stars?

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:53.610
Is that officially what he is?

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.390
S. PETE WORDEN: No, he's
just the boss.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.830
CHRIS DIBONA: He's
just the boss.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.640
Well, that's good.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.500
That's really interesting.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.095
I've just always found the
relationship to be an

00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:05.930
interesting thing to watch.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.420
So we have questions
from the audience.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.855
But I have many little
questions.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:13.780
So I'm going to hit a
couple other things.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.150
You and I have been
talking recently

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.090
about propulsion methods.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.250
And you had mentioned during
lunch today that you are

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.280
looking into a solar
sailer mission.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.080
Do you want to say anything
about that?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.510
S. PETE WORDEN: Sure.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.510
I think maybe if--

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.650
take just a minute to say--

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.920
CHRIS DIBONA: It's a little
far out there.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.770
S. PETE WORDEN: No, it's
not very far out.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.770
It's pretty cool.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.200
But--

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.180
CHRIS DIBONA: I meant
time-wise.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.660
S. PETE WORDEN: I like to think
that NASA does three

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.550
things, to kind of give
you an introduction.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.750
The first one, because I'm
a scientist, is science.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.460
And we basically are trying
to find out the

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.520
secrets of the universe.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.110
And there's two fundamental
ones.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.975
One is, how did the
universe begin,

00:06:55.975 --> 00:06:58.220
and what's its structure.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.690
And the other one is, how
did life begin, and

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.770
where else is it.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.410
And what's its future.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.060
And much of what we do is
around those topics.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.670
The second thing
NASA does is--

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.780
where a lot of the
controversy is--

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.890
our human space program.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.650
But I think we're on the verge
of humanity will expand in the

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.500
solar system this century, and
NASA and its partners around

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.900
the world are leading the way.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.070
The third one we probably
don't talk enough about.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.170
And it may be the most
important, is to make life

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.370
better here on Earth.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.110
And the first A in NASA
is Aeronautics.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.940
And we're going to have
to transition

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.850
sometime to green aviation.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.320
One of the big initiatives NASA
has is green aviation.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.830
At Ames, we're doing the next
generation air traffic control

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.970
system, so it affects
everybody.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.240
And the other one is really
studying the Earth and

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.780
understanding how climate
change affects us.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.190
Most of the data that we base
our climate change models on

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.970
is based on NASA data.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.500
But to get to the solar sail
issue is that it's really a

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.420
kind of cool concept.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.550
I grew up on "Star Trek" and
"Star Wars." As a military

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.210
guy, more "Star Wars,"
I guess.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:23.010
But I sort of thought we ought
to be building starships.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:29.680
And in fact, a few years ago,
we started a program between

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.550
DARPA and NASA.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.840
But it caused enough controversy
so DARPA and NASA

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.270
dropped it.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.059
But now the private sector
is picking it up,

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.620
which is really cool.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:44.110
But the technology is there in
the next 10, 20 years that we

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.270
can get access to near
interstellar space.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.310
And one of the cool ways to do
it was actually thought of--

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.350
CHRIS DIBONA: You mean
post the heliopause.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.340
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah, outside.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.600
So you're really in interstellar
space.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.920
--is, and I have to confess
this wasn't Ames work.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.420
It was actually done at Caltech
and JPL, just to

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.670
mention our competitor that we
love dearly, for the record.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.720
Just as you love Microsoft
and Facebook.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.530
CHRIS DIBONA: Love's an
interesting word.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.370
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah,
it certainly is.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.540
But it turns out if you're
going to get to near

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.720
interstellar space, you have
to get very high speeds.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.260
The highest speed object we have
are the Voyagers, which

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.620
are something like 18
kilometers a second.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.760
And the Voyager is like 120
astronomical units, which is

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.670
the distance between the
Earth and the sun.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.650
So it's just now getting close
to the boundary between what's

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.350
called the heliosphere, which is
where the sun dominates in

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.890
interstellar space.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.920
And it took 30 years or so.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.200
CHRIS DIBONA: [INAUDIBLE] how
people treat that, because

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.240
we've had like 10, 12
different headlines.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.480
We're exiting the
solar system.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.340
No, we're really doing it.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:51.460
S. PETE WORDEN: No, we're not.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.720
We're still kind of close.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.984
But we really want to
get a couple hundred

00:09:56.984 --> 00:09:59.340
kilometers a second.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.540
And that's possible,
but hard to do.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.920
But there was a concept about 20
years ago that said, let's

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.610
use a solar sail, just using
the pressure from photons.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.920
But the problem then is that
the satellites were kind of

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.910
big and heavy.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.000
So it was kind of
hard to do it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.540
But with the development of
these little micro, mini,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.330
nano-satellites, whatever you
want to call them, that weigh

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.660
grams, hundreds of grams,
maybe, a solar sail can

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.100
actually get you at high speeds
if you go close to the

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.880
sun, so like a tenth of the 10
million kilometers from the

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.960
sun, for example.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.810
And it's a little toasty, but
machines can handle that.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.720
And you do a couple passes by
that, and you might be able to

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.520
get a couple hundred kilometers
a second.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.300
So we're doing a little
bit of a study on

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.180
how we could do that.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.230
And we think it could
be fairly cheap.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.870
And there's a couple of
interesting places that you'd

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.420
like to get to.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.520
One of them is called the
gravitational lens point.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.690
The sun actually can act as a
lens, so that gravity bends

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.830
the light around it.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.780
And that's 600, 800 astronomical
units out.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.810
So if you could kind of align
things right, you could maybe

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.780
image planets around a
nearby star or image

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.130
the core of the galaxy.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:27.010
And so it's a really cool
concept, and I think it may be

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.190
the next step in
what we can do.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.180
So we're looking at how do you
get these really high speeds.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:40.550
But it's not too soon to start
thinking about true near

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.460
interstellar missions with--
we don't have to have

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.050
wormholes or other
exotic physics.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.005
This is--

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:48.020
not that those aren't cool.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.280
But--

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.582
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, but that's
not what we're seeing in the

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:52.050
next 15 years.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.640
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
I don't know.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.680
There's a guy at Johnson Space
Center that's actually working

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.700
on warp drives and so on.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.060
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, but isn't
that one of those things that

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.353
starts with, assuming you have
a wormhole handy, then you

00:12:05.353 --> 00:12:06.760
could-- you know, that
kind of thing.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.900
Or you have a negative mass.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.000
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, I guess
a lot of people--

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.320
NASA sometimes gets criticism
when we work on far out stuff.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.270
But that's our job.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.710
CHRIS DIBONA: It is.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.050
S. PETE WORDEN: It's reasonable
for an agency like

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.940
NASA to have a few people
that are really

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.930
looking at exotic stuff.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.650
And most of the stuff
is rubbish.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.856
But if somebody doesn't work
on it, you never know--

00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:31.470
CHRIS DIBONA: When rubbish
begins and facts--

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.660
S. PETE WORDEN: I mean, there's
a guy by the name of

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.660
Nikola Tesla that did a lot of
rubbish, but a few other

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.580
interesting things like
alternating current and other

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580
ideas everybody thought
was bad.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:51.395
And so I tend to refer to it
as fruitcake science, but

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:52.810
fruitcakes can be delicious.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.500
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, they can
be, especially if you put

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.110
enough bourbon in.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.410
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.930
CHRIS DIBONA: Or cognac.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.900
I don't know what you
put in fruitcake.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.790
So near interstellar space is
interesting, but what about

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.960
going to see the closest
other solar systems?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.670
If you had to game this, how
would you get there in the

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.570
next 30 years?

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.750
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
speed is--

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:14.520
CHRIS DIBONA: It's about
speed, right?

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.690
S. PETE WORDEN: It's
all about speed.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.710
And--

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.520
CHRIS DIBONA: And then
deceleration.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.710
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, initially
you just fly by.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:28.910
But I think by the end of the
century, we'll be looking at

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.140
things even on our
present course.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.390
One of the things I'm kind of
intrigued with, and since I'm

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.220
here at Google, you guys got
a lot of money, you say--

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.265
that if you have some extra,
we'd be happy to help.

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:43.940
But the--

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.770
CHRIS DIBONA: We just bought
[INAUDIBLE] theory, you know.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.000
S. PETE WORDEN: Let the
attorneys note that I wasn't

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.130
asking for any money.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.500
But one of the ideas we've got
about speed is supposing we

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.045
did a race, a space race that
you set a race track, say 1/10

00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.270
of an astronomical unit in from
the sun and 1/10 of an

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.730
astronomical unit out, and you
had a cup and let the private

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.320
sector compete.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.410
Whoever did that the fastest
every three or four

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.080
years gets this cup.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.680
I mean, people spend hundreds
of millions on

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.790
the America's Cup.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.540
And I think these kind
of things are

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.370
going to be a big deal.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:24.200
And all kidding aside, the
private sector is increasingly

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.500
important for our
space effort.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.110
Private sector space endeavors,
whether it's to

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.020
make money mining asteroids or
whether it's to do cool things

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.100
like get to interstellar space,
or just leave a legacy,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.460
is I think the next step.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.850
And a speed race is kind
of a neat idea that--

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:51.280
so OK, the first winner goes
30 kilometers a second.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.840
And you find after a while,
people are motivated to say, I

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.160
want to get up to a couple
thousand kilometers a second.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.060
That starts to give you the
ability to really think about

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.750
nearby stars in decades.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.950
Still a ways to go, but at some
point, the nearby stars

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.530
are an interesting target.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.730
Probably our first job as NASA
is to figure out what's there.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.500
And the next big thing that
NASA's going to do in science

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.870
is to see if we can image
planets like the Earth around

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.730
nearby stars.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.120
One of NASA's missions, which
Ames is lead for, is Kepler.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.180
And we're finding that
essentially every star in the

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.640
galaxy has planets.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.470
Probably 10%, 20% of them have
planets that are in the

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.860
habitable zone.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.040
A lot of those might
be Earth-sized.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.280
So that means a lot of these
nearby stars are likely to

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.140
have planets that at least what
we know would be in the

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.180
habitable zone about the
size of the Earth.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.210
So our next big step is
how do we image those.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.405
And the technology--

00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:01.526
CHRIS DIBONA: And
terraform them.

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:02.022
No, wait.

00:16:02.022 --> 00:16:02.920
S. PETE WORDEN: Yes.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.210
Well, actually, I'll tell
you, there is a way--

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.760
and I have to-- this
isn't my idea.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.260
You might have heard
of Craig Venter.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.650
He came up with this a few
years ago, said if you

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.660
actually wanted to send
something or go to those

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.490
places, it wouldn't be Captain
Kirk and the Enterprise, this

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.300
sort of 10,000 ton ship.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.760
He said, you might be able
to send a little box.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.410
And the--

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.900
CHRIS DIBONA: Put kudzu
in the box.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.540
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, it's
better than that.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.420
You actually beam it genetic
information.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.660
It then prints out the genetic--
the correct--

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.220
and uses the raw materials
to start life there.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.600
You could print out
humans or---

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.520
CHRIS DIBONA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.360
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah,
whatever you wanted.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.330
And I suspect that that may be
the way we'll spread to the

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.580
nearby stars.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.740
Of course, there might already
be life there that might have

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.230
a different point
of view, but--

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.730
CHRIS DIBONA: Whatever.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.359
S. PETE WORDEN: The little
box lands, and that's--

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:08.780
if you see a little box out in
the backyard, be suspicious.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.180
CHRIS DIBONA: Go ahead
and step on it.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.490
Along those lines, we've had,
I think, "we" meaning the

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.710
world through NASA's efforts,
we've had remarkable success

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.800
with the robotic missions.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.180
And I understand that a lot of
that's come out of Ames.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.160
How much would you say that--

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.040
I don't want to exaggerate.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.520
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
it's important to--

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.830
most of our science is
our robotic missions.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.350
And Ames certainly has played
a big role in that,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.300
particularly recently.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.550
But there's a lot of other
parts of NASA.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:51.280
Obviously, the biggest centers
for robotic missions are JPL

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.620
and Goddard Space
Flight Center.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.240
We've sort of focused at Ames on
small things, cheap things,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.750
which is good in this
fiscal environment.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.340
CHRIS DIBONA: You had a lot
of missions this year.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.110
I seem to remember you showing
me a poster, and it's like 32,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.890
I want to say.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.200
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah, there's
something like 20 to 30

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.220
satellites in the next year
that we're launching.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.100
Most of them are little
tiny ones.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.420
But let me talk about
robotics for--

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:20.910
the thing that Ames really
works on is autonomy.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.870
I don't want to use the word
artificial intelligence

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.390
because that sort of raises
scary things.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.380
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, people--
that's a loaded term.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.300
S. PETE WORDEN: But autonomy
is something.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.100
So a good bit of the autonomous
work, of how do we

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.360
program something to
be autonomous, is

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.240
based on Ames's work.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.380
So it may say JPL on the
outside, but it's got some

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.630
Ames on the inside.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.100
They might not admit
that, but It does.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.010
CHRIS DIBONA: Southern
California.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.870
S. PETE WORDEN: But this is
a really exciting area.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.440
And you mentioned the work we're
doing with Google on the

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.870
Quantum Artificial
Intelligence Lab.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.930
Now I didn't pick the AI part.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.760
CHRIS DIBONA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.670
S. PETE WORDEN: But we are
convinced that perhaps the

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.270
next step to autonomy is
a quantum computational

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.520
capability.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.980
And if I can--

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.870
and I'm probably going to get
this goofed up, but the

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.780
problem with a conventional
computer is that each time you

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.960
add a variable, you double
the size of the computer.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.680
So it's an exponential
function.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.010
So you get above 32,
33 variables, you

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.730
can't solve the problem.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.000
In principle, a quantum computer
is linear with the

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.870
number of variables and the
number of quantum bits.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.890
So you could have hundreds
of variables.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.760
Now say I want a robot to go
into a cave on Mars and look

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.280
for life, which is something
we would want to do.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.190
Inside caves on Mars, which we
know there's quite a few, is a

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.680
place that you might have
extant Martian life.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.300
Not likely to be other
than bacteria or

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.140
something like it, but--

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.850
CHRIS DIBONA: I'll take
what I can get.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.800
S. PETE WORDEN: You
never know.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.710
But you've never been in
a Martian cave before.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:13.030
And if you have a robot that you
want to send some place--

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.740
say if I want a robot
to open that door.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.270
That's 15, 20 variables.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.400
That's pretty straightforward.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.560
But if I want a robot to open
every door at Google, that's

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.790
hundreds of variables.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.220
So I can't solve that problem.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.840
CHRIS DIBONA: We call
them Nooglers.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.050
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.570
CHRIS DIBONA: Interns.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.620
S. PETE WORDEN: That's why
you have a card, because

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.770
you don't have to--

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.800
even a simple robot
can use a card.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.905
But the idea is it's
probably--

00:20:35.905 --> 00:20:38.690
a human brain handles thousands
of variables.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.900
We'd like to put some of that
capability in that robot to go

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.850
to a place that you wouldn't
send humans.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:49.340
And potentially, if you can get
a quantum computing device

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.170
that will operate at the
temperatures and compactly

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.210
enough, that may be the key to
us really exploring places

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.460
like Mars, other places
in the solar system.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:08.060
So we're quite excited about
the autonomy part of it and

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.010
that robots are going to
increasingly do more and more.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.030
Now, we still think they're
going to have a lot of

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.940
interface with humans.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:22.250
The robot's going to go hand
in claw with humans when we

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.550
expand into the solar system.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.860
But this is really where
I think the future is.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.850
CHRIS DIBONA: Have we ignored
the gas giants too much?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.920
S. PETE WORDEN: That's an
interesting question.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.485
CHRIS DIBONA: You like landing
on things, it seems.

00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:39.260
There's not much to land on.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.800
S. PETE WORDEN: No, you can
float around in the

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.110
atmosphere, though.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.680
You might have noticed
we had an airship

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.170
for a while at Ames.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.260
It's gone now.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.700
It's floating in Jupiter.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.860
But atmospheres are
very interesting.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:22:01.540
And there is some tenuous
information that suggests you

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.570
could have life in Venusian
atmosphere, for example, and

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.260
ideas that you could have
interesting chemistry and life

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.640
in perhaps gas giant
atmospheres.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.810
Very speculative, but we've
got to get in there.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.468
And--

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:18.640
CHRIS DIBONA: They're
a little toxic.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.370
S. PETE WORDEN: Well,
yeah, that's so.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:25.640
But there's not very many place
that aren't toxic, yes.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.300
So the idea of using actually
balloons and airships in some

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.320
of these atmospheres is
an interesting one.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.060
And the chemistry is
pretty exciting.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.360
So that's an area that's
a lot of interest in.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.460
But there's so many
cool places in the

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.240
solar system to go.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.990
My favorite is Titan.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.240
There's lakes on Titan.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.210
CHRIS DIBONA: Methane
lakes, right?

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.210
S. PETE WORDEN: Methane or
ethane, depending on your

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.240
preference.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.160
CHRIS DIBONA: I think Pete was
telling me about basically the

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.250
concept of water ice being so
hard, so frozen, that it

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.100
appears to be the land mass
for the methane lakes.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.840
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah, the rocks
on Titan are probably

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.590
ice, water ice.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.250
But there's rain that appears.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.610
It's ethane or methane rain.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.220
CHRIS DIBONA: No smoking.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.590
S. PETE WORDEN: What?

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.120
CHRIS DIBONA: No smoking.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.620
S. PETE WORDEN: No.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.200
Well, there's no oxygen,
as far as we know,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.710
so maybe it's fine.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.740
CHRIS DIBONA: You can try.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.660
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.280
Although the temperature
is kind of chilly.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.960
But you do have liquids,
and there's complicated

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.210
hydrocarbons.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.970
That's one of the more
interesting places in the

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.140
solar system to look for life.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.540
And it may be very
strange life.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.050
And to really understand
what's the range.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.270
But there are organisms on Earth
that are methanogenic

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.220
that have various interesting
chemistry.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.900
There are strange chemistry
going on on Titan that could

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.390
be explained by some
methanogenic life.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:14.280
So it's a good place to look,
but it's got lakes and

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.720
mountains and rain and so on.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.090
So kind of a whole ecosystem.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.475
And in fact, there was a
proposal that NASA I think is

00:24:21.475 --> 00:24:25.520
still considering to actually
send a boat to land on one of

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.630
these lakes.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.740
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, you had
a simulation of sorts

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.730
on how to do this.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.190
S. PETE WORDEN: And that's
pretty cool.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.350
Now being an Air Force guy,
that's really a Navy job.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.220
But I think--

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.500
CHRIS DIBONA: Mr. Bolden now.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.970
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah,
he's a Marine.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.180
It's a Department
of the Navy job.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:54.020
But the number of places to
look for life, even in the

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.260
solar system, we've just
begun to look.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.440
Mars is an obvious choice.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.680
There's clearly water
processes going

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.450
underneath the surface.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.250
You actually see with some of
the data we have that in

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.476
spring, you see water flowing
out from some of the glaciers.

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:12.830
I've mentioned the Venusian
atmosphere.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.215
In fact, we don't even know if
there's life in the upper

00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:17.400
Earth's atmosphere.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.080
It's very hard to sample.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.880
There's a moon of Jupiter,
Europa, that's a giant ocean.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.405
CHRIS DIBONA: That's
my favorite.

00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:27.230
That's because I read too
much science fiction.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.470
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.450
Well, there's an ice crust.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.950
You've got to get through
the ice somehow.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.250
CHRIS DIBONA: We have
Minnesotans you can--

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.630
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, they were
thinking about putting a

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.030
nuclear thing that
melts through.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.760
CHRIS DIBONA: Sure.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.210
S. PETE WORDEN: But
I kind of like--

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.720
CHRIS DIBONA: That's completely
reasonable.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.800
S. PETE WORDEN: You have
to remember, I'm an

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.820
Air Force guy again.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.950
I like the idea of taking an
asteroid and running it into

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.550
it and blowing a hole in it.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.130
And then you can go.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.350
CHRIS DIBONA: And it's
more organic.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.486
It's not really a nuclear
thing at that point.

00:25:53.486 --> 00:25:57.160
S. PETE WORDEN: Yes,
it's more sure.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.610
And then the water's right
there, and then--

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.550
CHRIS DIBONA: Hey, you might
get a cool splash.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.435
S. PETE WORDEN: That's
right, yes.

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.730
But seriously, impacts
are something--

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.100
CHRIS DIBONA: We learned a lot
from the Jupiter impacts of

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.230
the Shoemaker-Levy.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.660
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, and Ames's
mission a few years

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.040
ago, the Lunar Crater

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.920
Observing and Sensing Satellite.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.040
We ran the upper stage of the
booster into the lunar poles

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.790
and were able to prove that
there was large amounts of ice

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:30.290
and other volatiles so that if
you wanted to potentially have

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.420
a long term outpost on the moon,
that the resources are

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.760
there to support it.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.350
CHRIS DIBONA: As you get further
out from the sun, of

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.420
course, solar starts
breaking down.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.200
It's not a great source
of power.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.190
Are we moving back to RTGs?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.180
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, power
obviously in the outer solar

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.780
system is an issue.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.430
There's a couple different
approaches to it.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.910
One is that you just make
things very small and

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.140
efficient and get them
out there quickly.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.660
And I think the technology using
so-called CubeSats, that

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.660
are sort of 10 centimeters on a
side or maybe three of them

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.580
together or six of them, is
getting to the point that we

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:11.140
could actually send a mission
and we think use electric

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.490
propulsion and get out
to the outer solar

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.500
system fairly quickly.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:21.750
So you've got enough power
without having to use nuclear.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.490
But when you have bigger things,
they only feasible

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.450
power source in the outer
solar system is nuclear.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.270
And so it's been
quite an issue.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:39.050
The standard power sources are
the radioactive decay systems.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.210
They use plutonium.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.230
And in addition to being highly
radioactive, it's just

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.230
toxic in its own right.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.670
So it's something that has to be
handled very carefully, and

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.210
there's always concerns
about the launch.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.240
But we've developed the
protocols to do that.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.410
But during the Cold War,
we made a lot of--

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.060
CHRIS DIBONA: Allowances.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.840
S. PETE WORDEN: No, we made
a lot of nuclear devices.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.230
So one of the side products of
this was a lot of the isotopes

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.560
of plutonium we could
use for this.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.650
But one of the unfortunate
things about the end of the

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.500
Cold War from some people's
perspective is that we don't

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.230
have those byproducts anymore.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.500
So one of the things facing
NASA and the Department of

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.395
Energy is to restart the ability
to produce that.

00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:28.215
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, it's not
just those, but we've had some

00:28:28.215 --> 00:28:32.900
real problems sourcing medical
radioisotopes as well.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.080
S. PETE WORDEN: And I think this
is a broader social and

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.070
societal challenge is
that nuclear things

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.040
are scary to people.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.000
And that was one
of the bad side

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.260
effects of nuclear weapons.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.180
So I think it's clearly
something we have to identify.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.430
One of the ways to get highly
efficient propulsion for

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.740
humans is to use a nuclear
thermal rocket, where you use

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.300
a reactor to heat a propellant,
and you can get

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.160
two or three times the thrust
efficiency that you get out of

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.300
a chemical rocket.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.240
Or use a nuclear reactor in
the outer solar system.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.790
We have a lot of electric
power to

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.130
use an electric thruster.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.160
So those are challenges.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.440
And right now, they're
pretty expensive.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:22.500
And it's an area that I think
eventually, we will see

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.400
nuclear power being key
to a lot of activities

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.250
in the solar system.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.560
But fortunately, as long as
you're in the inner solar

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.980
system, the efficiency of a
solar system per unit weight

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.570
is actually more than
a nuclear system.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.500
So we think out to
Mars, we can use

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.270
solar electric systems.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:48.830
And in fact, NASA's newest
initiative is going to use

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.360
solar electric power
to actually

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.710
go move around asteroids.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.650
And I think it's an incredibly
cool thing.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.740
And everybody says, well, why
aren't we going back to the

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.570
moon or on to Mars?

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.460
Well, we are going to Mars.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.960
But in the meantime, rearranging
the inner solar

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.550
system is kind of
a neat thing.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:14.420
And asteroids are threats.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.160
But solar electric power
seems to be sufficient

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.030
to do a lot of that.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.790
So it's kind of a neat area.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.450
CHRIS DIBONA: If you can just
tell me briefly what you think

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.260
of the iodine plasma propulsion
systems proposed

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.050
out of University of Michigan.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.450
We've talked a bit about it, but
let's talk as if we hadn't

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.800
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.710
S. PETE WORDEN: One of the
important points is how do you

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.170
get a CubeSat-- and I'll get
to that in a second--

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.300
how do you get a CubeSat out--

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.090
we have a lot of CubeSats, these
little things in low

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.130
Earth orbit.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.500
And they're doing pretty
neat stuff.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.920
But how do you get them out
in the solar system?

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.250
You can use a chemical rocket,
but then the chemical rocket

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.142
is a lot bigger than them.

00:30:50.142 --> 00:30:52.300
Or you can use electric
propulsion, which is very

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.400
efficient, but the trouble
is that it's slow.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.840
So there are some ideas, and
one of the really cool ones

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:06.030
was to use iodine and to heat it
directly using an electric

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:12.110
system in a CubeSat that looks
like we can get a CubeSat

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:17.100
propulsion system that could get
us out even to the outer

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.100
parts of the solar system
in short order.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.060
There's a group at the
University of Michigan.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.410
There's a professor,
Ben Longmier,

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.770
who's working on that.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:30.950
And we're pretty excited about
it because it used to take

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.480
hundreds of millions or billions
to get anywhere

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.410
outside Earth orbit.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.920
But if you could have a CubeSat
that weighs 10 or 15

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.030
kilograms and get it to the
outer solar system in a year

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:49.600
or so, the CubeSat may cost $1
million or $2 million, that is

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.410
a revolutionary change that
says now the whole solar

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.500
system is easily and cheaply
accessible to scientists.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.510
So we're very excited
about it.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.010
It's ready for proof of
concept, we think.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.730
And it really is the key
to interplanetary

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.285
CubeSats, we think.

00:32:06.285 --> 00:32:06.900
CHRIS DIBONA: Go ahead.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.110
AUDIENCE: So a long time ago,
Ames worked on something

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.760
called the Ames hard suit.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.530
And I thought it was
pretty cool.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.590
I guess it was killed
for various reasons.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.300
Will we ever see anything
like that in the future?

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.930
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, one of
the critical issues now is

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.040
where do we go with humans.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:31.320
And Ames is still heavily
involved in human factors, and

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.490
we have some work on suits.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.530
Some of those concepts continue
to be developed by

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.940
NASA, mostly at the Johnson
Space Center.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.460
And I believe most of the
technology in that one is now

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.450
being pursued at the Johnson
Space Center.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.160
However, for the next--

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:54.080
probably until the 2030s, most
of NASA's work in deep space

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.705
will be with asteroids, maybe
the moons of Mars.

00:32:57.705 --> 00:33:01.720
In which case, the current suits
are probably sufficient.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.320
But I think that these ideas
like that, when we do operate

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.950
on a planetary surface in about
15 years, are going to

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.240
be critical to it.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.170
So the work continues.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:13.460
Our folks are involved in it.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:19.380
But it's not something that is
aggressively being pursued.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.820
AUDIENCE: Most of what you're
doing is more interesting than

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:27.040
99% of TV, except when you
watch it live on NASA TV,

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.020
which is as boring
as possible.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.010
So what do you do to make all
the exciting things you're

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.380
doing more of a spectator
sport to really

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.700
get America's attention?

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.010
S. PETE WORDEN: That's
a very good question.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:42.720
And basically, you folks at
Google do a lot to help us

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.940
with that by allowing people to
have virtual presence and

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.710
doing things like
Google Hangouts.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:58.020
That really gives folks the
opportunity to be there and be

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.690
involved in it.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.280
In fact, this week, we developed
something called a

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.930
space shop, which is kind of a
3D printer, additive, laser

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.139
manufacturing thing.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.230
There's a Google Hangout on
Friday, and there's about a

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.750
million young people we expect
to-- they're kind of Google

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.980
Hangout campers.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:25.500
And so I think that the
important point is to use this

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.510
new technology to let people
ride along with us, things

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.719
like Google Glass.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:35.360
And so it's just making use
of that technology.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.959
Of course, there's always
a lot of controversy.

00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:39.580
I learned the hard
way to be careful

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.830
about things like Twitter.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.578
Well, I will tell you.

00:34:46.578 --> 00:34:48.969
As you can tell, I was
an Air Force officer.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.800
But when we did LCROSS, when
we launched it, I was using

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.150
Twitter pretty regularly.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:58.280
And I had a few thousand
followers.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.790
It was pretty good
for a scientist.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.180
So I went to the final readiness
review, the launch

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.010
readiness review at Kennedy
Space Center.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:10.470
And this was the first time I
got to sit at the adult table,

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.600
which there's like 300 or 400
people in the room, and

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.680
there's this big wooden table,
and the actual people that

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.090
have primary to say, go.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.940
And so they launch
vehicles, go.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.140
Range, go, weather, so
on and so forth.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.270
And the primary payload was
the Goddard Space Flight

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.470
Center, go.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.615
And so I had the secondary.

00:35:30.615 --> 00:35:31.650
And they said Ames.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.820
And I said, Ames Research Center
is go for the first

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.810
precision bombing
run on the moon.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.710
And--

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.800
S. PETE WORDEN: So I got that
reaction, and so I said, well,

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.360
that's pretty cool.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.610
I'll put it on Twitter.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.700
That was a big mistake,
really big mistake.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.290
People put two and two
together to get 86.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.180
And they said, you know, he
used to be an Air Force

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.260
general and was involved with
some other lunar mission that

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.930
had rumors that it
had found aliens.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.510
And some of the astronauts
found aliens or said they

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.500
found aliens.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.960
And so they figured out, aha,
this is a secret CIA plot.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.060
There's an alien base on the
moon, and NASA has been

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.440
enlisted by the CIA
to bomb it.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.556
And so it was--

00:36:16.556 --> 00:36:19.230
and I told the scientists when
they complained, ah, nobody'll

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.940
pay any attention to that.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.720
CHRIS DIBONA: Nobody's going
to pay attention to this.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.940
S. PETE WORDEN: Of, course the
next call I got was from the

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.660
administrators that several
congressmen are quite upset

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.260
and want to have a hearing
about the--

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.920
by the way, LCROSS hit within
100 meters of its aim point.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.970
The aliens are gone.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.740
Everything's fine.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.690
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.860
I was going to add, the only
thing missing is the drama.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.500
It would have been worth
taxpayer dollars, in my

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.910
opinion, to have sent cameras in
advance to be on the ground

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.770
watching you hopefully
hit the ground.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.050
We should double the budget
of any mission to include

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:01.050
multiple HD live streams to
add some drama to it.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.950
S. PETE WORDEN: I love the idea
of doubling our budget.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:03.490
But it's--

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:06.546
CHRIS DIBONA: TV studios
on the moon.

00:37:06.546 --> 00:37:07.770
S. PETE WORDEN: That's right.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.000
I think it's a good point.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.330
We--

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.580
CHRIS DIBONA: It's a point.

00:37:14.574 --> 00:37:16.390
S. PETE WORDEN: Why don't you
send somebody with Google

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.640
Glass there to--

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:25.820
So I'm curious about what you
think the role of private

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.240
versus NASA will be in human
space exploration.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.350
I know companies like
Interplanetary Resources were

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.650
founded to send probes to go
out and collect resources.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.570
And it seems like the solar
system is opening up to

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.710
private industry.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.390
But do you ever think there'll
be a motive for private

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.176
companies to take over the human
exploration part or if

00:37:47.176 --> 00:37:48.510
that'll always be
NASA's domain?

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.280
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, I'm
interested that here at Google

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.370
you ask me that.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.920
On your website about five
years ago, there was an

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.100
advertisement for some company
called Virgle that was

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.010
recruiting people to
go to settle Mars.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.350
Now it turned out it was April
1, but it had a message from

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.090
Larry and Sergey.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.220
It had another one from
Richard Branson.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.350
It was kind of a cool thing.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.050
I'm not sure they were joking,
either, but that's--

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.830
but that really leads
to the point.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.360
CHRIS DIBONA: Might have been
a couple of years off.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.080
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah,
it might have been.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:24.290
But that NASA's job is to
develop technology, to be the

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:28.210
explorers and to go out and
find out what's there.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.990
But I think actually, if we're
talking about people

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.890
eventually living and settling
on Mars and other places,

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.140
that's almost undoubtedly
going to

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.570
be the private sector.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:41.010
And the cost of doing that
is beginning to go down.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:47.150
In fact, just yesterday, there
was a team meeting at Ames.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:52.900
There's a private endeavor
called Inspiration Mars, which

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:58.380
is Dennis Tito, who is himself
fairly wealthy, has set up

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.780
this program to send two
people to fly by Mars.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.500
About every 13, 15 years,
there's an alignment of the

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.960
planets that you can do what's
called a free return

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.460
trajectory.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.950
So you can send a capsule,
and it doesn't need any

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:12.375
propulsion.

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.600
It'll kind of boomerang
back to the Earth.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.310
And in 2018 is the next one.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.540
And so he's trying to do that.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.830
NASA is working with
them to help them.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.200
They have agreements
with three or

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.820
four of the NASA centers.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.820
And I think there's a good
chance that they'll do that.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.360
Now, they're not landing
on Mars.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.690
But the era when the private
sector can begin to do these

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:35.390
kinds of things is upon us,
and they are doing it.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.980
Their view is they want to send
one male, one female,

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.760
maybe a husband and wife,
to fly by Mars.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.350
I'll probably get in trouble for
this, but I have to tell a

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.570
little story my wife
said on that.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.420
She says, oh, I can
see it now.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.960
They're gone 501 days, which
is how long it takes.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.260
They'll open the capsule.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.790
The wife will get out, dazed and
confused, and not remember

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.720
anything, and the husband will
be dead by mysterious

00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.970
circumstances.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:02.566
But--

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:03.770
CHRIS DIBONA: Martians.

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.150
S. PETE WORDEN: But seriously, I
think that we're seeing more

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.995
and more interest in
the private sector.

00:40:09.995 --> 00:40:12.420
The private sector can go to
the space station now.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.700
You can get a ticket.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.650
There are people talking about
flybys around the moon.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.450
So I think a lot of folks in
this room will have an

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:27.110
opportunity in your lifetime
to consider private

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.500
expeditions, maybe even
settlement to missions to

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.570
places like Mars and lunar
poles and maybe other--

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.940
asteroids.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.130
AUDIENCE: Before we can go out
into the solar system or even

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.620
extra-solar, we still have to
get out of this blasted

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.740
gravity well.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.880
And over the years, we've heard
a variety of different

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.740
techniques, some alternative
techniques.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.400
And I was just curious to get
your opinion or NASA's

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:54.150
opinions, if those are any
different, on things like the

00:40:54.150 --> 00:41:01.120
railgun for inanimate stuff,
space tethers for elevators

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.340
for animate stuff, and of the
Skylon engine, a fairly recent

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.230
suggestion, a version of things
that have been tried

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.400
before, but that idea that a
space plane can actually take

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.330
off and land like normal
but get us into orbit.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.226
Are any of these viable?

00:41:17.226 --> 00:41:22.590
S. PETE WORDEN: I think a lot
of these ideas are viable.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.721
A lot of it had to wait for
technology to catch up.

00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:29.330
I personally, in my career, was
involved in the DCX Delta

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.540
Clipper program, which the idea
was to build a single

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.800
stage to orbit.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.150
It probably was premature.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:40.250
But I now see that SpaceX is
actually doing it, although so

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.790
far they've just duplicated
what we did 20 years ago.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.050
I want to add that 20th
anniversary of that flight is

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.300
next month.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.930
So things like the Skylon engine
is an area that NASA's

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.340
discussed with--

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.830
there's a British company doing
that, very exciting.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.590
So some of these technologies
look really interesting.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:09.290
One that we're working at Ames
is microwave thermal rockets

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:15.280
that, rather than carrying both
an oxidizer and a fuel,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.350
you just carry a propellant.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.540
You beam the energy,
using microwaves.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.840
That heats the propellant, and
it gives you, say, three times

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.920
the efficiency of a conventional
rocket engine.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.070
We have some funding from the
Defense Advanced Research

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.230
Projects Agency.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:35.100
We're going to be testing that
here in the next year.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.970
We're testing it in the US.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.660
Well, we've tested it
indoors here, but it

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.330
doesn't go very far--

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.770
fortunately.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.490
But we'll be testing that in
Southern California and

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:51.910
eventually in New Mexico, with
the Air Force support.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.385
So a lot of these things
look very promising.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.520
Transportation is hard.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.370
And the other side of this is,
can we just do conventional

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.950
rockets more efficiently?

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.400
And we're seeing the private
sector make great progress in

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.860
that, and not just
one company.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.440
Everybody talks about SpaceX,
which is a spectacular

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.660
success, but there are others
doing the same thing.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.820
So I think the same time we're
trying to make conventional

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.550
propulsion cheaper, some of
these other things that are

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.675
coming along--

00:43:23.675 --> 00:43:26.450
so the next 20 years are going
to be very exciting in

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.140
propulsion.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.790
I think you'll see some
real breakthroughs.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:32.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.670
So Dr. Worden, you talked about
making a space race for

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.360
speed to get people excited
about space.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.190
And I was wondering how you
balance this kind of

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:43.740
competition to get people
excited with collaboration, in

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.060
that there's a lot of
redundancies in technology

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.920
being developed by various
private sector and government.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.670
And I know, Mr. DiBona, you're
very involved with open

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.680
source, so I was wondering if
I could get your take on the

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.630
balance between collaboration
and competition.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:01.690
S. PETE WORDEN: Why don't I let
Chris answer that first?

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:05.470
CHRIS DIBONA: So one of the
things that I've tried to

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.760
encourage when I've had the
chance, with the federal

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.010
government here in the United
States as well as foreign

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.760
governments, is that when they
approach contracting

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.060
procurement, that they ensure
that knowledge is shared.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.210
Now the Defense Department has
had some good luck with this,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.705
especially around stealth and
the rest, basically forcing

00:44:21.705 --> 00:44:24.290
Northrop and Lockheed to give
each other each other's

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.110
secrets, as it were.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.820
But we seem to have moved away
from that in a way, which has

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.360
been too bad.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.450
I would really value your
thoughts on that.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.820
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, NASA and
its predecessor agency, the

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.800
National Advisory Committee on
Aeronautics, were really based

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.190
on free and open exchange of
information and publishing.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:47.360
I think an unfortunate trend
has been to put a lot of

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.670
restrictions.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.930
And some of them
are legitimate.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:54.170
There's legitimate concerns
about sensitive technologies.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.150
But I'm always a great advocate
of openness, openness

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.490
in information.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:03.130
So you want to let people that
want to do cool things have

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:06.390
access to all the information,
as much as you can.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.260
I think that--

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.820
I spent much of my career as a
Cold Warrior on the US side.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.330
And I think the reason the US
prevailed in that was because

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.800
we had an open society with open
exchange of information.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.010
So that it makes possible
the collaboration.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:27.100
And I think internationally,
that's even more so.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:31.290
On the other hand, people are
motivated by competition.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:40.440
So when you go see a sports
game, nobody's very interested

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.810
in both sides helping to get the
football in the end zone.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.840
Oh no, you run it in.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.090
No, please.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.810
The score is 8,000.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.840
So I think that we're
humans, and there's

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.170
a competitive spirit.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.510
So the key is balancing
these two things.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:06.950
And capitalism is a pretty good
system to do that, as

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:11.240
long as it's not
unconstrained.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.630
And I think that it's NASA's job
as a government agency to

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.460
make sure the information is
there for everybody to use,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.740
but within our own efforts, to
kind of make sure that the

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.960
competition doesn't become
destructive.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.330
I mean, there's always--

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.790
one of the big challenges of
NASA is that we compete for

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.780
especially smaller
science missions.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.460
There's an announcement of
opportunity, and OK, we want

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.080
to mention to study

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.140
astrophysics, and people compete.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.240
And NASA centers are
parts of that.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.610
I mentioned JPL and Goddard
and other places.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.820
We compete with them.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.640
Sometimes we team with them.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.010
But I think that's good, as long
as the competition is for

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:59.200
a specific item, and it's not
sort of like I'm going to

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.000
compete to the death
with those folks.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.680
And we have a big challenge now
within NASA is, what part

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.020
of our capability we preserve
for competition that might

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:17.070
actually be duplicative
across centers?

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.320
So I think there's a balance
there, and we do

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.130
pretty well at it.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:26.500
But I think in a societal sense,
I'm really with the

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.270
idea of open source,
open information.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:34.110
Everybody should have access
to the same information so

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.630
that they can compete
effectively

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:36.970
against each other.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.390
And a good competitor is
one that you want to

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.440
team with next time.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:46.550
I always find that if we're in a
competition at Ames, and one

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.420
of the other centers is on the
winning team, and I'm on the

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.950
losing team, I'm the first one
to want to go down there and

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.410
say to the director there,
can I buy you a drink?

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:55.890
Maybe we can work with
you next time.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.140
CHRIS DIBONA: Maybe you need
some help over there.

00:47:59.497 --> 00:48:02.320
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on where NASA is going with

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.510
heavy boost, large launchers.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:10.150
S. PETE WORDEN: I think there's
really the question,

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.160
and this is one we don't
have a good answer for.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.250
Is it better to have--

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.870
well, if you want to send a
human expedition to Mars,

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:21.270
that's going to be something.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.480
CHRIS DIBONA: Say you want
to send a human to Mars.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:29.070
S. PETE WORDEN: That's to land
on Mars and come back.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.070
That's an important point.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.780
That--

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.190
CHRIS DIBONA: 30,000 people
volunteering to go one-way.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:35.680
S. PETE WORDEN: People are going
to go one-way to Mars to

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.790
settle it at some point.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.680
But you need something that's
big, probably like at least

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.580
the size of the International
Space Station.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.170
So is it more cost effective to
launch a lot of things and

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:50.530
put it together in space or to
have a single big booster?

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.140
Historically, it's the bigger
booster is cheaper.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.180
So if I have a booster that's
twice as big, the per-kilogram

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.420
cost is lower than using
smaller ones.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.350
We don't know if that's always
going to stay that way.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.490
So what NASA's doing in our
internal efforts is we have

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.490
the space launch system.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.300
We are aiming at something
eventually over 100 tons.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:16.120
In fact, Congress says they
want 120 metric tons.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.840
Our first versions will
have less than that.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.550
So we're doing that.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.600
The private sector is
also looking at

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.510
larger and larger systems.

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.020
SpaceX has the Falcon
Heavy, which I

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.880
think is 60 or 70 tons.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.630
They also have something
that I think is called

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.260
the BFR, the Big--

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.995
I was told that stands
for Big Falcon--

00:49:39.995 --> 00:49:40.450
CHRIS DIBONA: Fantastic--

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.325
S. PETE WORDEN: --Rocket.

00:49:41.325 --> 00:49:43.700
Big Falcon Rocket.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.910
So that remains to be seen.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.100
At the same time, there may be
ideas that if you build a lot

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.090
of them, small ones will
be more efficient.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:58.180
So I don't have the answer.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.505
But right now, I'd probably
bet on the BFR.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.270
AUDIENCE: Could you walk
us through the day

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.270
of a NASA Ames director?

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.760
How do you divide your time, and
what are you most excited

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.410
or worried about?

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.660
CHRIS DIBONA: Do you like
bacon for breakfast?

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.840
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, I live on
Moffett Field, so I get an

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.280
extra 45 minutes sleep over
everybody else, so that's

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.070
always good.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:27.290
But NASA has 10 centers, and
our headquarters is in

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:31.960
Washington, DC, which
is where I want it.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.760
That's one of the coolest things
about Ames is we're the

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.010
farthest away from
the headquarters.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.260
CHRIS DIBONA: Visit the
dish and [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.780
S. PETE WORDEN: But that means
that they are at work at 5:00

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:41.920
AM my time.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.060
And so usually the first
hour or two is spent in

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:51.110
interactions with headquarters,
discussions with

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:54.430
one of the leaders about
why did you do that.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:51:00.750
But seriously, we're
a big agency.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:02.265
We have to deal a lot with--

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:10.460
I sort of mentioned, we have 550
board members or so, the

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.810
members of the House
and Senate.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.921
So there's a lot of interactions
that one does

00:51:13.921 --> 00:51:16.010
there and answering questions.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:18.720
And I know it's hard for anybody
to understand this,

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.190
but they don't all
agree sometimes.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.330
And it's sort of very strange.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:29.670
But I mean, there's a lot
of interactions there.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.730
Frankly, I have 2,500 people
working for me, and they're

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:36.630
all very creative, so that
means sometimes there are

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.880
issues that need to
be worked with.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:44.790
And I tell people I have 2,500
children, and I'm one of them.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.040
So it's--

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.470
trying to figure out
how we maximize the

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:54.320
opportunities there.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:59.530
But I usually spend a few hours
a day just interacting

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.780
with the really cool stuff
that's going on.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:09.760
Tomorrow, for example, all day
long is the mission readiness

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.400
review for LADEE, which is our
next lunar mission, launched

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.670
on September 6.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.940
And so that's a really
fun day.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.910
Now, it's fun unless somebody
says, excuse me, there's a

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.285
major problem in the
propulsion system.

00:52:21.285 --> 00:52:26.440
And then you kind of, oh, my
god, what do we do with that.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.040
So we spend a fair bit
of time with that.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.750
The other thing is, particularly
this time of

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.900
year, we have 800, 900
students at Ames.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.810
We have a bunch of
folks right here.

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.510
And I really enjoy interacting
with the

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.620
students, and I think it's--

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.490
so we try to spend a
fair bit of time.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:49.850
I spend a lot of time discussing
people's future,

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:54.660
discussing what's my
favorite wine.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.160
But--

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.610
CHRIS DIBONA: What is
your favorite wine?

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:58.990
S. PETE WORDEN: Whatever
somebody else is buying.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:05.970
But every day is different.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.430
But I gotta tell you, working
for NASA, and I hope this is

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.160
true for everybody, is you
really want to get up in the

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.840
morning and go in and work
because it's fun.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.090
We're doing cool stuff.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.610
I used to spend a lot
of time on airlines.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:23.275
And--

00:53:23.275 --> 00:53:23.990
CHRIS DIBONA: Aeronautics.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.060
S. PETE WORDEN: Yeah,
that's right.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.926
Well, one of the advantages.

00:53:27.926 --> 00:53:31.350
one of the actual positive
things about sequestration, is

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.280
that we've really cut travel.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.370
And we've started to use a lot
more virtual presence.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:46.140
For example, this morning, this
week, the week of the

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.560
20th of July is a significant
date for

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.630
NASA, the Apollo landing.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:53.020
And so we always have the
Lunar Science Forum.

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:57.260
And so we'd typically have 500,
600, 700 people at Ames.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.440
And this year, we decided
to save money.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.410
We're going to do
it virtually.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:04.110
So I spent the first hour
this morning on the

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:08.120
virtual global meetings.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.850
First time we've done that.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.850
And so that's kind of the wave
of the future, again.

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.720
You mentioned, how
do you do things.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.470
So every day is different.

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:20.410
CHRIS DIBONA: Sort of like
turning your own in-person

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:23.140
manned flight into a
robotic mission.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.520
S. PETE WORDEN: Exactly.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.767
CHRIS DIBONA: Where
you just send a

00:54:24.767 --> 00:54:28.140
little box with packets.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.380
S. PETE WORDEN: It's
important, though.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:35.020
Of course, you have to remember
that you're actually

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:39.510
here, being broadcast.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:44.480
Because there were a couple
incidents where we had NASA

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.730
employees that were
in their kitchens.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.610
CHRIS DIBONA: As long as they're
in their kitchens and

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:50.760
not their bathrooms.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.570
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, you could
sometimes hear whoosh in

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.460
the background.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:58.571
So there are downsides to
virtual presence, too.

00:54:58.571 --> 00:55:02.430
AUDIENCE: Where do you see
Silicon Valley and NASA Ames

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:05.690
with the privatization
of space?

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.965
S. PETE WORDEN: Well, it's clear
to me that privatization

00:55:08.965 --> 00:55:12.630
of space is happening, as I
mentioned earlier, and that

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:16.410
Silicon Valley is
powering that.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:19.260
I'm really proud that NASA has
a center in Silicon Valley,

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:22.170
and I think it's really
leading a lot of that.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.790
It's not the only place, but I
can't imagine a more exciting

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:30.110
place to be in the world than
Silicon Valley for anything.

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.310
And space is no different
from that.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:37.670
The sort of spirit of
entrepreneurship, you feel it

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:38.330
here at Google.

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:43.470
You feel it any place in the
valley or in San Francisco.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.720
And it's going to get
us to the stars.

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.700
And it really is that
public-private partnership.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.820
We're really proud of working
with not just Google but our

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.380
other partners here
in Silicon Valley.

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:59.620
And this is the future.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.660
You never know--

00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:04.135
what was it Yogi Berra says, the
thing about the future is

00:56:04.135 --> 00:56:05.720
you never know about
it or something?

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:10.090
And it's where things
are going to go.

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:14.520
But we're seeing a lot of the
private sector space efforts

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.960
really have their origin
here in Silicon Valley.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.270
Elon Musk was a Silicon Valley
entrepreneur, and a lot of the

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:26.420
other companies, I know of at
least a dozen space startups

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.920
here that are doing really well
and privatizing things.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.380
So I think there'll be
a Silicon Valley

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.310
on Mars soon someday.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:41.940
That'll be where they'll build
the interstellar starship.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.240
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks a lot for
coming over and being here.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.140
S. PETE WORDEN: Well thank you.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:51.545
