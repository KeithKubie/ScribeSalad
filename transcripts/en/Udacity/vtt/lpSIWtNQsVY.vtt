00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.560
let's start with some data point x.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.440
Now imagine a cubic box with sides h.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.030
And the point x inside it.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.630
We can write the volume of this box of side h, given by volume V equals h cubed.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.490
Now if we are in a D dimensional space the volume would

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.480
be h raised to the power of D.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.020
Let's define a function, K of u.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.040
The value of K equals 1 when all values of u

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.240
lies between minus half and half, or the absolute value of u is less than half.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.030
The value of K is 0 otherwise.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.720
This is, a D dimensional hypercube centered around zero.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.040
Now similarly, let's define the function K of x minus xn divided by h.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.110
This is equal to 1.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.120
If the point Xn is inside the box with side h, around X.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.210
And it's equal to 0, otherwise.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.890
In this case, we have made the variable u into X minus Xn over h.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.780
And we have centered the box around the point X instead of zero.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.810
Let's look through this a little bit more.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.220
Let us try to understand this expression a little bit further.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.050
Let's look at the first point, x 1.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.960
We form a box of side h around the point, x1.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.690
Now, the kernel evaluates to 1.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.880
Since the point x is inside this box.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.790
Let's look at x2.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.430
Similarly a box with side h around x2, contains the value of x.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.040
So the kernel evaluates to 1.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.270
Again, look at x3.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.940
The same case we have, a box of side h and x lies within this box.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.950
So we call the value of this function, the kernel function, as 1.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.720
In the case of x4, we have the box of side h,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.800
but the value of x lies outside this box.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280
We call the value of the kernel to be 0.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.360
As you may have guessed through this explanation,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.460
that this function that we have defined, is called a kernel function.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.400
In statistics, we use the kernel function in general, for many different cases.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.640
In this case, we're going to use it to estimate densities.
