Hi there, I'm Tucker Balch.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.350
I'm a professor at Georgia Tech and
I'm the instructor for this course.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.565
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Devpriya Dave,
a graduate student at Georgia Tech.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.562
You can call me Dev.

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:14.049
&gt;&gt; My original research was about
machine learning for robotics,

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.270
but in 2007 I became interested in using
these same algorithms for investing.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.240
Since that time I've shifted my
research and teaching towards finance.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.420
I also cofounded a financial technology
company called Lucena Research.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
&gt;&gt; I'm a graduate student who's
been working with Professor to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840
built up predictive system for
stock market.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.050
I'm also working on the software
to support this course.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.810
&gt;&gt; You're going to see a lot
of Dev in this course.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.230
She makes a lot of things
happen behind the scenes.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.680
Now Dev,
I'm thinking about buying Apple stock.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.330
Do you think I should do it?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.810
&gt;&gt; Mm, well,
it depends on a lot of factors.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.880
What are the other stocks
in your portfolio?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.750
What do you think will
predict stock prices?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.660
Also, how much risk do you
think you can take it on?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.190
&gt;&gt; So those are all good questions,
and Dev is exactly right.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.290
We need to consider all of those
things before we make an investment.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.102
Now in this course we're going
to cover a lot of these issues.

00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:11.483
We're going to show you how information
influences the movement of a stock

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:16.430
price, how to build software to analyze
and visualize these relationships, and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.450
details about how
the stock exchanges work.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.120
Finally, in the last section
of this course we're going to

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.610
show you how to build
machine learning algorithms

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.120
that you can use to build
real trading strategies.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.130
Now let's get started.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.720
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
