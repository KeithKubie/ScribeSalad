00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome to lesson three. In the last lesson, you've built

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.850
out your data model by connecting objects with relationships. Before

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.930
we talk about what you're going to do in this lesson,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.640
let's follow Samantha and Andy back to the music festival.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.910
&gt;&gt; So this festival was tons of fun but

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.310
clearly at its core, it was a big business.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We had to buy tickets to get in. We paid for

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.450
food. We bought a couple beers. We even paid to ride the Ferris Wheel.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.240
&gt;&gt; And some people were even paying to do arts and crafts.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.040
&gt;&gt; Music festival managers aren't just making

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.480
money, they have to spend it too.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.750
&gt;&gt; Right! They have to pay for the bands, they

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.980
have to pay the salary of their employees. Pay for equipment.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.440
&gt;&gt; So obviously, they're keeping track of all these revenues and costs.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.849
&gt;&gt; And these numbers are so important that

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:43.700
they probably want to understand them quickly and easily.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.570
&gt;&gt; And in Salesforce, that means

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.670
visualizations like charts, reports and dashboards.
