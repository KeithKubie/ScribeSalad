components world so over time there

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
components world so over time there
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.260
components world so over time there
fragment api's have kind of evolved and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
fragment api's have kind of evolved and
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240
fragment api's have kind of evolved and
as of the release of architecture

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
as of the release of architecture
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.410
as of the release of architecture
components a lot of people have been

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
components a lot of people have been
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.359

asking us questions like sir how do all

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
asking us questions like sir how do all
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070
asking us questions like sir how do all
these things fit together so hopefully

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
these things fit together so hopefully
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.300
these things fit together so hopefully
we'll be able to answer some of those

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
we'll be able to answer some of those
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299
we'll be able to answer some of those
questions today but first just a little

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
questions today but first just a little
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190
questions today but first just a little
bit of history like the fragment api's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
bit of history like the fragment api's
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.950

little bit more widespread availability

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
little bit more widespread availability
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.610
little bit more widespread availability
and really it kind of comes down to the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
and really it kind of comes down to the
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350
and really it kind of comes down to the
idea that at the very beginning

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
idea that at the very beginning
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910

everybody just kind of started with the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
everybody just kind of started with the
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380
everybody just kind of started with the
activity when you're writing an Android

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
activity when you're writing an Android
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840
activity when you're writing an Android
app it was kind of your main method with

app it was kind of your main method with
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.549
app it was kind of your main method with
a life cycle it's the entry point to

a life cycle it's the entry point to
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439
a life cycle it's the entry point to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
your view hierarchy where you do most of
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.590

your UI work it binds the view content

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
your UI work it binds the view content
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359
your UI work it binds the view content
from your app state or at least this is

where people tended to do it keep in

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
where people tended to do it keep in
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450
where people tended to do it keep in
mind that this was fairly early on in

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
mind that this was fairly early on in
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210
mind that this was fairly early on in
androids public lifecycle here everybody

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
androids public lifecycle here everybody
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340
androids public lifecycle here everybody
kind of had this habit of piling

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
kind of had this habit of piling
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690
kind of had this habit of piling
everything into one activity because

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
everything into one activity because
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100
everything into one activity because
apps were a lot more simple than they

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
apps were a lot more simple than they
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.550
apps were a lot more simple than they
are today and of course you listen to UI

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
are today and of course you listen to UI
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410
are today and of course you listen to UI
events and update that app state from

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
events and update that app state from
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.440
events and update that app state from
there as well so there are so many

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
there as well so there are so many
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.569
there as well so there are so many
incoming events it really kind of became

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
incoming events it really kind of became
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.310
incoming events it really kind of became
this plumbing exercise to try to break

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
this plumbing exercise to try to break
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.060
this plumbing exercise to try to break
it up yourself

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
it up yourself
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219
it up yourself
so people ended up with these very

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
so people ended up with these very
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.240
so people ended up with these very
monolithic activities and then something

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
monolithic activities and then something
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370
monolithic activities and then something
else happened to Android tablets kind of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
else happened to Android tablets kind of
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710
else happened to Android tablets kind of
became a thing so we kind of thought you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
became a thing so we kind of thought you
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.450
became a thing so we kind of thought you
know how do you make a tablet UI well

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
know how do you make a tablet UI well
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.910
know how do you make a tablet UI well
you take one phone UI you take another

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
you take one phone UI you take another
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859
you take one phone UI you take another
phone UI and you smack them together and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
phone UI and you smack them together and
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.300
phone UI and you smack them together and
you have a tablet UI right I mean what

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
you have a tablet UI right I mean what
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.899
you have a tablet UI right I mean what
could go wrong

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
could go wrong
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969
could go wrong
so we needed to answer this question of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
so we needed to answer this question of
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740
so we needed to answer this question of
how do I stick to phone you eyes

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
how do I stick to phone you eyes
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510
how do I stick to phone you eyes
together and make sure that it still

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
together and make sure that it still
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.780
together and make sure that it still
works on a phone and fragments were kind

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
works on a phone and fragments were kind
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.029
works on a phone and fragments were kind
of our answer to this question

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039
 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.520
so as an example here this approach

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
so as an example here this approach
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.960
so as an example here this approach
actually worked pretty well for some

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970
actually worked pretty well for some
 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.080
actually worked pretty well for some
applications Gmail is a great example so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090
applications Gmail is a great example so
 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.430
applications Gmail is a great example so
if you take a look here you have the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
if you take a look here you have the
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.699
if you take a look here you have the
list of conversations to your current

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
list of conversations to your current
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.990
list of conversations to your current
conversation that you're taking a look

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
conversation that you're taking a look
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.449
conversation that you're taking a look
at and there's not a whole lot of

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459
at and there's not a whole lot of
 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.370
at and there's not a whole lot of
difference here between the the phone

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380
difference here between the the phone
 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.870
difference here between the the phone
version that you drill into versus

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880
version that you drill into versus
 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.220
version that you drill into versus
something that you can show side by side

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230
something that you can show side by side
 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.670
something that you can show side by side
in the two pane UI so fragments were

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
in the two pane UI so fragments were
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.470
in the two pane UI so fragments were
really designed to make sure that you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480
really designed to make sure that you
 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150
really designed to make sure that you
could do one thing and that was to allow

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160
could do one thing and that was to allow
 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.040
could do one thing and that was to allow
splitting up these huge activity classes

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
splitting up these huge activity classes
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.920
splitting up these huge activity classes
this was something that again we were

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
this was something that again we were
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.390
this was something that again we were
seeing the pain that developers were

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400
seeing the pain that developers were
 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.920
seeing the pain that developers were
feeling that their activity classes were

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930
feeling that their activity classes were
 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.020
feeling that their activity classes were
getting really big and hard to manage so

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
getting really big and hard to manage so
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.509
getting really big and hard to manage so
we wanted to see could we allow for you

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
we wanted to see could we allow for you
 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.729
we wanted to see could we allow for you
to decouple some of the various things

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739
to decouple some of the various things
 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.559
to decouple some of the various things
that your activity classes are doing to

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569
that your activity classes are doing to
 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.970
that your activity classes are doing to
sort of relieve a little bit of that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980
sort of relieve a little bit of that
 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.820
sort of relieve a little bit of that
pressure so that means that anything a

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830
pressure so that means that anything a
 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.830
pressure so that means that anything a
fragment can do or anything an activity

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
fragment can do or anything an activity
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.690
fragment can do or anything an activity
can do a fragment had to be able to do

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
can do a fragment had to be able to do
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.490
can do a fragment had to be able to do
too and that guided a whole lot of the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500
too and that guided a whole lot of the
 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.370
too and that guided a whole lot of the
API design from the beginning so that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380
API design from the beginning so that
 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.840
API design from the beginning so that
meant that you needed to have lifecycle

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
meant that you needed to have lifecycle
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.000
meant that you needed to have lifecycle
events that needed that meant that you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010
events that needed that meant that you
 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.410
events that needed that meant that you
needed to be able to manage a view

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420
needed to be able to manage a view
 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.410
needed to be able to manage a view
hierarchy it meant that you needed to be

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420
hierarchy it meant that you needed to be
 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.850
hierarchy it meant that you needed to be
able to deal with saved instance state

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860
able to deal with saved instance state
 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.949
able to deal with saved instance state
so packaging everything up into a bundle

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959
so packaging everything up into a bundle
 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.900
so packaging everything up into a bundle
or parcel bowls so that if your

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
or parcel bowls so that if your
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.520
or parcel bowls so that if your
application got killed in the background

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530
application got killed in the background
 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.860
application got killed in the background
you could restore from that in a clean

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
you could restore from that in a clean
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.280
you could restore from that in a clean
way and other things as well like non

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
way and other things as well like non
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.229

configuration instance object passing

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
configuration instance object passing
 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.360
configuration instance object passing
and that's always kind of a mouthful but

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370
and that's always kind of a mouthful but
 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.680
and that's always kind of a mouthful but
I mean this is kind of the way that you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
I mean this is kind of the way that you
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.720
I mean this is kind of the way that you
can pass any old object back and forth

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730
can pass any old object back and forth
 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.030
can pass any old object back and forth
across a configuration change that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
across a configuration change that
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.300
across a configuration change that
doesn't actually kill your process back

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310
doesn't actually kill your process back
 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.740
doesn't actually kill your process back
stacks were another really big one

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750
stacks were another really big one
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.180
stacks were another really big one
because suddenly if you were dealing

because suddenly if you were dealing
 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.890
because suddenly if you were dealing
with a single activity where you were

on configuration instance again kind of
a mouthful this method kind of had some

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810
a mouthful this method kind of had some
 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.360
a mouthful this method kind of had some
problems because you've only got one

didn't give you a whole lot of help this
was all boilerplate that you had to

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850
was all boilerplate that you had to

essentially a way to get the activity

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400
essentially a way to get the activity
 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.940
essentially a way to get the activity
itself to sort of do something that we

in the neck this allowed you to make the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500
in the neck this allowed you to make the
 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.260

thought I would see so some of you might
 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.570
thought I would see so some of you might
remember this from for example the

you've swapped between tabs between the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350
you've swapped between tabs between the
 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.290
you've swapped between tabs between the

smaller window within an activity this
idea of nesting activities was something

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
idea of nesting activities was something
 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.030
idea of nesting activities was something
that we started offering very early it

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040
that we started offering very early it
 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.230
that we started offering very early it
had a lot of other issues though

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
had a lot of other issues though
 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.060
had a lot of other issues though
activities made a whole lot of promises

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070
activities made a whole lot of promises
 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.190
activities made a whole lot of promises
that local activity manager had a lot of

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200
that local activity manager had a lot of
 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.200
that local activity manager had a lot of
trouble trying to uphold so we wanted to

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210
trouble trying to uphold so we wanted to
 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.760
trouble trying to uphold so we wanted to
try and tighten that interface a little

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770
try and tighten that interface a little
 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.130
try and tighten that interface a little
bit better for something composable like

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140
bit better for something composable like
 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.540
bit better for something composable like
fragments that would be able to do the

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550
fragments that would be able to do the
 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.100
fragments that would be able to do the
same thing but with a little bit more

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
same thing but with a little bit more
 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.720
same thing but with a little bit more
expected behavior right so this whole

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730
expected behavior right so this whole
 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.640
expected behavior right so this whole
idea of being able to break up your

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
idea of being able to break up your
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.650
idea of being able to break up your
activity and make it into kind of

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660
activity and make it into kind of
 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.990
activity and make it into kind of
composable pieces you know we have this

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000
composable pieces you know we have this
 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.570
composable pieces you know we have this
giant monoliths of an activity and you

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580
giant monoliths of an activity and you
 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.159
giant monoliths of an activity and you
know there's other methods of kind of

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169
know there's other methods of kind of
 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.990
know there's other methods of kind of
factoring it out into different pieces

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000
factoring it out into different pieces
 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.320
factoring it out into different pieces
but for fragments basically approach was

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330
but for fragments basically approach was
 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.440
but for fragments basically approach was
you move that loosely related code right

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450
you move that loosely related code right
 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.050
you move that loosely related code right
those view and all of the state around

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060
those view and all of the state around
 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.720
those view and all of the state around
that view into a separate fragment and

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730
that view into a separate fragment and
 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.360
that view into a separate fragment and
you basically just keep doing this until

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370
you basically just keep doing this until
 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.190
you basically just keep doing this until
you've kind of segmented out your

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200
you've kind of segmented out your
 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.260
you've kind of segmented out your
activity into something that looks

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270
activity into something that looks
 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.390
activity into something that looks
slightly more reasonable right you may

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
slightly more reasonable right you may
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.220
slightly more reasonable right you may
have a couple of fragments in here that

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230
have a couple of fragments in here that
 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.029
have a couple of fragments in here that
kind of have their own specific

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039
kind of have their own specific
 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.200
kind of have their own specific
requirements and their own specific UI

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210
requirements and their own specific UI
 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.659
requirements and their own specific UI
and your activity just becomes more of a

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669
and your activity just becomes more of a
 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.050
and your activity just becomes more of a
show

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060
show
 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.530
show
for this but soon after we started

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540
for this but soon after we started
 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.960
for this but soon after we started
getting into this and when it came up to

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970
getting into this and when it came up to
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.210
getting into this and when it came up to
around jellybean people were like but

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220
around jellybean people were like but
 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.750
around jellybean people were like but
this isn't enough like what if one of my

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760
this isn't enough like what if one of my
 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.850
this isn't enough like what if one of my
fragments has a viewpager in it that

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860
fragments has a viewpager in it that
 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.890
fragments has a viewpager in it that
also has fragments as each one of its

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900
also has fragments as each one of its
 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.310
also has fragments as each one of its
pages so we get into this alright well

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320
pages so we get into this alright well
 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.860
pages so we get into this alright well
now let's break up the fragments into

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
now let's break up the fragments into
 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.740
now let's break up the fragments into
smaller pieces so of course you know the

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750
smaller pieces so of course you know the
 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.930
smaller pieces so of course you know the
only way well if fragments aren't enough

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940
only way well if fragments aren't enough
 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.130
only way well if fragments aren't enough
then you just add more fragments in this

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140
then you just add more fragments in this
 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.980
then you just add more fragments in this
case child fragments became a thing so

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990
case child fragments became a thing so
 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.870
case child fragments became a thing so
now each one of these fragments could

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880
now each one of these fragments could
 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.990
now each one of these fragments could
then be broken up into smaller pieces so

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000
then be broken up into smaller pieces so
 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.510
then be broken up into smaller pieces so
this allowed us to kind of again kind of

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520
this allowed us to kind of again kind of
 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.730
this allowed us to kind of again kind of
D couple things and we built a lot of

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740
D couple things and we built a lot of
 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.130
D couple things and we built a lot of
code around trying to make this nested

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140
code around trying to make this nested
 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.270
code around trying to make this nested
state work really well to varying levels

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280
state work really well to varying levels
 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.540
state work really well to varying levels
of degree of success but it's gotten a

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550
of degree of success but it's gotten a
 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.500
of degree of success but it's gotten a
lot better over time so with these

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510
lot better over time so with these
 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.690
lot better over time so with these
things in mind every one of those

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700
things in mind every one of those
 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.180
things in mind every one of those
fragments whether it's a small thing

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190
fragments whether it's a small thing
 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.060
fragments whether it's a small thing
just managing a view or if it's a

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070
just managing a view or if it's a
 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.120
just managing a view or if it's a
retained instance fragment every single

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130
retained instance fragment every single
 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.430
retained instance fragment every single
one of these fragments give you life

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440
one of these fragments give you life
 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.920
one of these fragments give you life
high cycle hooks every single one of

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930
high cycle hooks every single one of
 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.440
high cycle hooks every single one of
them has back stack management

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.450
them has back stack management
 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.240
them has back stack management
associated with them every single one of

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.250
associated with them every single one of
 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.020
associated with them every single one of
them has a retained object that I can do

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.030
them has a retained object that I can do
 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.480
them has a retained object that I can do
across configuration changes and all of

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.490
across configuration changes and all of
 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.550
across configuration changes and all of
them are stored stateful e in your

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560
them are stored stateful e in your
 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.040
them are stored stateful e in your
fragment manager that means that the

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.050
fragment manager that means that the
 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.190
fragment manager that means that the
existence of that fragment is actually

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.200
existence of that fragment is actually
 

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.920
existence of that fragment is actually
part of the state of your app so when

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:08.930
part of the state of your app so when
 

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.990
part of the state of your app so when
your app dies and comes back that

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000
your app dies and comes back that
 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.090
your app dies and comes back that
existence in the fragment manager is

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.100
existence in the fragment manager is
 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.400
existence in the fragment manager is
actually a really important part that at

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.410
actually a really important part that at
 

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.140
actually a really important part that at
least from fragments perspective that

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.150
least from fragments perspective that
 

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.040
least from fragments perspective that
we're going to do on your behalf and of

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.050
we're going to do on your behalf and of
 

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.080
we're going to do on your behalf and of
course they all have their own ability

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.090
course they all have their own ability
 

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.720
course they all have their own ability
to have a view subtree so that piece of

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:25.730
to have a view subtree so that piece of
 

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.900
to have a view subtree so that piece of
your UI that they manage themselves and

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:28.910
your UI that they manage themselves and
 

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.450
your UI that they manage themselves and
of course we also allow things like

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:31.460
of course we also allow things like
 

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.850
of course we also allow things like
fragments being inflatable and put right

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:33.860
fragments being inflatable and put right
 

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.470
fragments being inflatable and put right
into your XML files and be able to reuse

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:38.480
into your XML files and be able to reuse
 

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.630
into your XML files and be able to reuse
them across multiple layouts and again

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640
them across multiple layouts and again
 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.520
them across multiple layouts and again
this is also kind of hooking into these

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:42.530
this is also kind of hooking into these
 

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.510
this is also kind of hooking into these
same processes but the biggest issue we

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:46.520
same processes but the biggest issue we
 

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.310
same processes but the biggest issue we
found

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320
found
 

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.690
found
is that all these fragments do all of

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:52.700
is that all these fragments do all of
 

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.610
is that all these fragments do all of
these things at once whether you want

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.620
these things at once whether you want
 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.160
these things at once whether you want
them to or not and most of the time

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.170
them to or not and most of the time
 

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.920
them to or not and most of the time
you're only actually using one or two of

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:02.930
you're only actually using one or two of
 

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.220
you're only actually using one or two of
these things and not the full 16 things

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.230
these things and not the full 16 things
 

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.860
these things and not the full 16 things
that fragments do that you get as kind

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:08.870
that fragments do that you get as kind
 

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.870
that fragments do that you get as kind
of a bundle of deal so that means that

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880
of a bundle of deal so that means that
 

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
of a bundle of deal so that means that
some of these things like the stateful

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:15.890
some of these things like the stateful
 

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.890
some of these things like the stateful
restoration means you have a lot of

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:17.900
restoration means you have a lot of
 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.290
restoration means you have a lot of
patterns that look like this where you

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:20.300
patterns that look like this where you
 

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.600
patterns that look like this where you
have to make sure that the fragment

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:22.610
have to make sure that the fragment
 

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.200
have to make sure that the fragment
manager is in the right state so in this

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.210
manager is in the right state so in this
 

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.490
manager is in the right state so in this
case we're actually checking well

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:27.500
case we're actually checking well
 

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.740
case we're actually checking well
alright is there no saved instance state

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:29.750
alright is there no saved instance state
 

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.380
alright is there no saved instance state
ie are we in a fresh run of this

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:32.390
ie are we in a fresh run of this
 

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.750
ie are we in a fresh run of this
activity and oh now I need to add my

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760
activity and oh now I need to add my
 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.630
activity and oh now I need to add my
fragment to my layout so if you've ever

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640
fragment to my layout so if you've ever
 

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.280
fragment to my layout so if you've ever
gotten this approach where you have one

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.290
gotten this approach where you have one
 

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.770
gotten this approach where you have one
fragment over another one yeah this is

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:41.780
fragment over another one yeah this is
 

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.310
fragment over another one yeah this is
this kind of state full restoration

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320
this kind of state full restoration
 

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.560
this kind of state full restoration
actually being something that was a

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:47.570
actually being something that was a
 

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.740
actually being something that was a
useful bit but at the same point like

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:50.750
useful bit but at the same point like
 

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.630
useful bit but at the same point like
maybe not exactly what you were

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640
maybe not exactly what you were
 

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.460
maybe not exactly what you were
expecting or something that you even

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:54.470
expecting or something that you even
 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.130
expecting or something that you even
wanted in some cases but for fragments

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
wanted in some cases but for fragments
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.170
wanted in some cases but for fragments
you kind of got all of them together in

00:09:59.170 --> 00:09:59.180
you kind of got all of them together in
 

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:05.050
you kind of got all of them together in
a package deal but last year we kind of

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.060
a package deal but last year we kind of
 

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.750
a package deal but last year we kind of
took a more holistic approach to how we

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760
took a more holistic approach to how we
 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.720
took a more holistic approach to how we
do api's and this really kind of started

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:10.730
do api's and this really kind of started
 

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.250
do api's and this really kind of started
with a lot of the work we did on

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.260
with a lot of the work we did on
 

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.250
with a lot of the work we did on
architecture components so all of the

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.260
architecture components so all of the
 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.660
architecture components so all of the
architecture components have really

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.670
architecture components have really
 

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.030
architecture components have really
tried to focus in on doing one thing

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040
tried to focus in on doing one thing
 

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.000
tried to focus in on doing one thing
well rather than being kind of the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.010
well rather than being kind of the
 

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.510
well rather than being kind of the
kitchen sink kind of approach so for

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.520
kitchen sink kind of approach so for
 

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.180
kitchen sink kind of approach so for
example lifecycle observers the ability

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.190
example lifecycle observers the ability
 

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.850
example lifecycle observers the ability
to have life cycle and that onresume on

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:30.860
to have life cycle and that onresume on
 

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.920
to have life cycle and that onresume on
start as kind of a piece that is

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:32.930
start as kind of a piece that is
 

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.500
start as kind of a piece that is
completely independent from other things

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:35.510
completely independent from other things
 

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.630
completely independent from other things
something that you can register just if

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:37.640
something that you can register just if
 

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.420
something that you can register just if
you care about life cycle

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:39.430
you care about life cycle
 

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.700
you care about life cycle
similarly for view model we created a

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:42.710
similarly for view model we created a
 

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.150
similarly for view model we created a
new primitive a new object specifically

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160
new primitive a new object specifically
 

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.880
new primitive a new object specifically
for that kind of retained instance state

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:48.890
for that kind of retained instance state
 

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.970
for that kind of retained instance state
across configuration changes and of

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:51.980
across configuration changes and of
 

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.030
across configuration changes and of
course this year just yesterday we

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040
course this year just yesterday we
 

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.100
course this year just yesterday we
announced a new navigation architecture

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.110
announced a new navigation architecture
 

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.500
announced a new navigation architecture
component kind of working at the a much

00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.510
component kind of working at the a much
 

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.210
component kind of working at the a much
higher level architecture on how you

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.220
higher level architecture on how you
 

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.720
higher level architecture on how you

your UI and put these things together

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:03.740
your UI and put these things together
 

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.250
your UI and put these things together
and really trying to tackle just the

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.260
and really trying to tackle just the
 

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.769
and really trying to tackle just the
specific problem of how do you move from

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:08.779
specific problem of how do you move from
 

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:11.680
specific problem of how do you move from
one screen to the next screen so all

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:11.690
one screen to the next screen so all
 

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.420
one screen to the next screen so all
these things were kind of really focused

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:13.430
these things were kind of really focused
 

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.269
these things were kind of really focused
on doing one thing well and we're trying

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279
on doing one thing well and we're trying
 

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:19.389
on doing one thing well and we're trying
to bring a lot of that to fragments but

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399
to bring a lot of that to fragments but
 

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.980
to bring a lot of that to fragments but
that means that you know we kind of have

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:20.990
that means that you know we kind of have
 

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.670
that means that you know we kind of have
a lot of legacy to go along with that

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680
a lot of legacy to go along with that
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.030
a lot of legacy to go along with that
that's right

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040
that's right
 

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.030
that's right
so part of this is that fragments were

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040
so part of this is that fragments were
 

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.340
so part of this is that fragments were
really designed around this idea of very

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.350
really designed around this idea of very
 

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.050
really designed around this idea of very
loose dependencies and loose guarantees

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.060
loose dependencies and loose guarantees
 

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.310
loose dependencies and loose guarantees
about some of the interaction between

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320
about some of the interaction between
 

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.610
about some of the interaction between
them so another kind of quiz for the

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:36.620
them so another kind of quiz for the
 

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.829
them so another kind of quiz for the
audience how many of you know the answer

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839
audience how many of you know the answer
 

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:40.360
audience how many of you know the answer
to this question does a child fragments

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.370
to this question does a child fragments
 

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.329
to this question does a child fragments
oncreate method run before or after its

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:43.339
oncreate method run before or after its
 

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:45.579
oncreate method run before or after its
parents oncreate method how many of you

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:45.589
parents oncreate method how many of you
 

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:48.030
parents oncreate method how many of you
are confident that you know the answer

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040
are confident that you know the answer
 

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.240
are confident that you know the answer
not a whole lot I'm gonna give you no

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.250
not a whole lot I'm gonna give you no
 

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.689
not a whole lot I'm gonna give you no
idea about no how many of you thought

00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:55.699
idea about no how many of you thought
 

00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:57.400
idea about no how many of you thought
you knew the answer before I asked the

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.410
you knew the answer before I asked the
 

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.750
you knew the answer before I asked the
question and then you started

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760
question and then you started
 

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.949
question and then you started
questioning yourself yeah okay I'll

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959
questioning yourself yeah okay I'll
 

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:04.930
questioning yourself yeah okay I'll
admit that sometimes I have to

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:04.940
admit that sometimes I have to
 

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.210
admit that sometimes I have to
double-check this as well because the

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.220
double-check this as well because the
 

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.040
double-check this as well because the
answer really kind of depends on whether

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.050
answer really kind of depends on whether
 

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.569
answer really kind of depends on whether
the parent is an activity or if the

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:10.579
the parent is an activity or if the
 

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:12.460
the parent is an activity or if the
parents of fragment what version are you

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:12.470
parents of fragment what version are you
 

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.319
parents of fragment what version are you
running on are you talking about Android

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329
running on are you talking about Android
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.420
running on are you talking about Android
app dot fragments or the support library

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:16.430
app dot fragments or the support library
 

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.819
app dot fragments or the support library
fragments because the answer has been

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:18.829
fragments because the answer has been
 

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:21.280
fragments because the answer has been
different over time we've changed this

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.290
different over time we've changed this
 

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.930
different over time we've changed this
around and if you were trying to design

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:22.940
around and if you were trying to design
 

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.879
around and if you were trying to design
a fragment that worked across all

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:24.889
a fragment that worked across all
 

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:26.439
a fragment that worked across all
versions of Android that was writing to

00:12:26.439 --> 00:12:26.449
versions of Android that was writing to
 

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:28.150
versions of Android that was writing to
the framework fragments you had to deal

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160
the framework fragments you had to deal
 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.530
the framework fragments you had to deal
with these rules kind of changing out

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.540
with these rules kind of changing out
 

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.850
with these rules kind of changing out
from under you a little bit you couldn't

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:30.860
from under you a little bit you couldn't
 

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.360
from under you a little bit you couldn't
count on anything so one of the things

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.370
count on anything so one of the things
 

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.340
count on anything so one of the things
that we allowed for here with lifecycle

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.350
that we allowed for here with lifecycle
 

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.559
that we allowed for here with lifecycle
observers is that we really wanted to

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:38.569
observers is that we really wanted to
 

00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:40.329
observers is that we really wanted to
give a very strict ordering of the

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:40.339
give a very strict ordering of the
 

00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:42.610
give a very strict ordering of the
callbacks you have a strict lastin

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:42.620
callbacks you have a strict lastin
 

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.530
callbacks you have a strict lastin
first-out callback ordering for all

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:44.540
first-out callback ordering for all
 

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.240
first-out callback ordering for all
lifecycle observers in any given

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.250
lifecycle observers in any given
 

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.309
lifecycle observers in any given
lifecycle this is important because it

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:48.319
lifecycle this is important because it
 

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:49.780
lifecycle this is important because it
means that you can set up dependencies

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:49.790
means that you can set up dependencies
 

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.240
means that you can set up dependencies
between lifecycle observers and use

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.250
between lifecycle observers and use
 

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.620
between lifecycle observers and use
lifecycle observers as the

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:53.630
lifecycle observers as the
 

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.079
lifecycle observers as the
implementation details of a particular

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:56.089
implementation details of a particular
 

00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:57.910
implementation details of a particular
activity instance or fragment instance

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920
activity instance or fragment instance
 

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.069
activity instance or fragment instance
as the case may be you can make sure to

00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079
as the case may be you can make sure to
 

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.019
as the case may be you can make sure to
maintain guarantees between certain

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:02.029
maintain guarantees between certain
 

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:03.939
maintain guarantees between certain
lifecycle events so that any other

00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:03.949
lifecycle events so that any other
 

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.800
lifecycle events so that any other
lifecycle observers that other libraries

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:05.810
lifecycle observers that other libraries
 

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.439
lifecycle observers that other libraries
you may be using can take advantage of

00:13:08.439 --> 00:13:08.449
you may be using can take advantage of
 

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:12.310
you may be using can take advantage of
those guarantees that you've configured

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320
 

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.450
lifecycle observers are created by you

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:14.460
lifecycle observers are created by you
 

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.519
lifecycle observers are created by you
we don't try to recreate them via

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:16.529
we don't try to recreate them via
 

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:18.860
we don't try to recreate them via
reflection which means that you can use

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:18.870
reflection which means that you can use
 

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.079
reflection which means that you can use
any sort of creation pattern that you

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:21.089
any sort of creation pattern that you
 

00:13:21.089 --> 00:13:24.140
any sort of creation pattern that you
may find useful within your app so this

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.150
may find useful within your app so this
 

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.120
may find useful within your app so this
seems like a really small thing but it

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.130
seems like a really small thing but it
 

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.500
seems like a really small thing but it
was a big piece of feedback that we got

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.510
was a big piece of feedback that we got
 

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.720
was a big piece of feedback that we got
with fragments the implication of that

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:29.730
with fragments the implication of that
 

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.280
with fragments the implication of that
though is that you no longer get

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.290
though is that you no longer get
 

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.769
though is that you no longer get
stateful restoration by the system now

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779
stateful restoration by the system now
 

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.440
stateful restoration by the system now
again in some cases this is exactly what

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.450
again in some cases this is exactly what
 

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.240
again in some cases this is exactly what
you want you want to make sure that you

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.250
you want you want to make sure that you
 

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.820
you want you want to make sure that you
have a single control flow path as

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:40.830
have a single control flow path as
 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.170
have a single control flow path as
you're configuring your lifecycle

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180
you're configuring your lifecycle
 

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.730
you're configuring your lifecycle

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:47.730
this back for me I don't want to end up
 

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.280
this back for me I don't want to end up
with two of these things so on and so

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.290
with two of these things so on and so
 

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.519
with two of these things so on and so
forth right so one of these really

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:52.529
forth right so one of these really
 

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:54.440
forth right so one of these really
common patterns that we saw a lot of app

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.450
common patterns that we saw a lot of app
 

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.200
common patterns that we saw a lot of app
developers using is actually a headless

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:57.210
developers using is actually a headless
 

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.530
developers using is actually a headless
fragment a fragment without a UI that

was used basically only to receive on

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.150
was used basically only to receive on
 

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.800
was used basically only to receive on
start on stop life cycle events so for a

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:06.810
start on stop life cycle events so for a
 

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.320
start on stop life cycle events so for a
lot of these kind of approaches

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.330
lot of these kind of approaches
 

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.280
lot of these kind of approaches
lifecycle observers are going to give

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:10.290
lifecycle observers are going to give
 

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.640
lifecycle observers are going to give
you the same kind of API service but

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:13.650
you the same kind of API service but
 

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.019
you the same kind of API service but
with a lot smaller kind of API that you

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:18.029
with a lot smaller kind of API that you
 

00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:20.000
with a lot smaller kind of API that you
don't actually need all of the things of

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.010
don't actually need all of the things of
 

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.630
don't actually need all of the things of
fragment so what does this actually look

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:23.640
fragment so what does this actually look
 

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.490
fragment so what does this actually look
like you might have just a simple life

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500
like you might have just a simple life
 

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.710
like you might have just a simple life
cycle observer that does analytics calls

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720
cycle observer that does analytics calls
 

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.930
cycle observer that does analytics calls
and your analytics library might want on

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940
and your analytics library might want on
 

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.550
and your analytics library might want on
start on stop of a particular lifecycle

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560
start on stop of a particular lifecycle
 

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.670
start on stop of a particular lifecycle
so the thing here is that this is an

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680
so the thing here is that this is an
 

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.550
so the thing here is that this is an
independent piece from fragments from

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560
independent piece from fragments from
 

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.100
independent piece from fragments from
activities now that has a couple of

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.110
activities now that has a couple of
 

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.140
activities now that has a couple of
super important things in that one you

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.150
super important things in that one you
 

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.540
super important things in that one you
can test it independently you don't have

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:50.550
can test it independently you don't have
 

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.730
can test it independently you don't have
to spin up the whole world just to test

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740
to spin up the whole world just to test
 

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.720
to spin up the whole world just to test
this piece you can test it in isolation

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:55.730
this piece you can test it in isolation
 

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.250
this piece you can test it in isolation
also because you can create this

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260
also because you can create this
 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.550
also because you can create this
observer you can use whatever methods

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560
observer you can use whatever methods
 

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.350
observer you can use whatever methods
you want if you want to use an

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360
you want if you want to use an
 

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.510
you want if you want to use an
dependency injection kind of model and

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:05.520
dependency injection kind of model and
 

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.110
dependency injection kind of model and
inject in your dependencies like that is

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120
inject in your dependencies like that is
 

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.840
inject in your dependencies like that is
really easy to do in this model rather

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:11.850
really easy to do in this model rather
 

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.960
really easy to do in this model rather
than trying to do it in the scope of an

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:14.970
than trying to do it in the scope of an
 

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.060
than trying to do it in the scope of an
activity or fragment or doing that kind

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.070
activity or fragment or doing that kind
 

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.990
activity or fragment or doing that kind
of thing so this gives you a lot more

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000
of thing so this gives you a lot more
 

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.060
of thing so this gives you a lot more
power to kind of split out this into a

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.070
power to kind of split out this into a
 

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.340
power to kind of split out this into a
composable piece so if you're building a

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:25.350
composable piece so if you're building a
 

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.940
composable piece so if you're building a
library

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:25.950
library
 

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.790
library
you can just use this same lifecycle

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800
you can just use this same lifecycle
 

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.120
you can just use this same lifecycle
observer across all of your fragments or

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.130
observer across all of your fragments or
 

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.070
observer across all of your fragments or
all of your activities and not have to

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:34.080
all of your activities and not have to
 

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.380
all of your activities and not have to
duplicate that data or worry about like

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:36.390
duplicate that data or worry about like
 

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.110
duplicate that data or worry about like
okay well what state is my instance data

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120
okay well what state is my instance data
 

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.790
okay well what state is my instance data
and you can just always say add the

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800
and you can just always say add the
 

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.830
and you can just always say add the
observer and we're done there's no more

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:42.840
observer and we're done there's no more
 

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.750
observer and we're done there's no more
no more work you need to do here so this

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760
no more work you need to do here so this
 

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.970
no more work you need to do here so this
offers a lot simpler alternative for

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980
offers a lot simpler alternative for
 

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:55.220
offers a lot simpler alternative for
this specific use case we've got some

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:55.230
this specific use case we've got some
 

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.360
this specific use case we've got some
glowing slides to get there

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:56.370
glowing slides to get there
 

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.350
glowing slides to get there
okay so retained instance fragments

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360
okay so retained instance fragments
 

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.480
okay so retained instance fragments
we're really designed to outlive an

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.490
we're really designed to outlive an
 

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.230
we're really designed to outlive an
activity these were basically just a

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240
activity these were basically just a
 

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.110
activity these were basically just a
setter on a fragment to say hey retain

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120
setter on a fragment to say hey retain
 

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.480
setter on a fragment to say hey retain
my instance state across across

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:11.490
my instance state across across
 

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.240
my instance state across across
configuration changes this was a pretty

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.250
configuration changes this was a pretty
 

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.650
configuration changes this was a pretty
useful thing because it meant that you

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660
useful thing because it meant that you
 

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.480
useful thing because it meant that you
could save handles to expensive data or

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:17.490
could save handles to expensive data or
 

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.250
could save handles to expensive data or
operations if you start some sort of

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260
operations if you start some sort of
 

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.200
operations if you start some sort of
query that might take a little bit to

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.210
query that might take a little bit to
 

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.820
query that might take a little bit to
complete you don't want to restart that

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:22.830
complete you don't want to restart that
 

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.380
complete you don't want to restart that
just because somebody rotated the screen

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:24.390
just because somebody rotated the screen
 

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.520
just because somebody rotated the screen
or something got resized it meant that

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:28.530
or something got resized it meant that
 

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.810
or something got resized it meant that
you could reconnect to these same

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820
you could reconnect to these same
 

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.550
you could reconnect to these same
operations after that configuration

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560
operations after that configuration
 

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.050
operations after that configuration
change but really please don't do UI

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.060
change but really please don't do UI
 

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.610
change but really please don't do UI
during this this was another one of

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.620
during this this was another one of
 

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.100
during this this was another one of
those kind of headache pain point sorts

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.110
those kind of headache pain point sorts
 

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:41.480
those kind of headache pain point sorts
of things fragments do everything all at

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:41.490
of things fragments do everything all at
 

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.300
of things fragments do everything all at
once but these were two things that just

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:44.310
once but these were two things that just
 

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.150
once but these were two things that just
really did not taste great together the

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160
really did not taste great together the
 

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.620
really did not taste great together the
reasoning for this is of course that

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:48.630
reasoning for this is of course that
 

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.390
reasoning for this is of course that
views hold on to the context that

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:50.400
views hold on to the context that
 

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.670
views hold on to the context that
created them well what context do you

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680
created them well what context do you
 

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.110
created them well what context do you
use to create views most of the time

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120
use to create views most of the time
 

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.760
use to create views most of the time
well it ends up being the activity you

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:55.770
well it ends up being the activity you
 

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.260
well it ends up being the activity you
don't want to hold on to a reference to

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:57.270
don't want to hold on to a reference to
 

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.880
don't want to hold on to a reference to
an old activity after a configuration

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:58.890
an old activity after a configuration
 

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.580
an old activity after a configuration
change ended up using the same views now

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:01.590
change ended up using the same views now
 

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.110
change ended up using the same views now
technically it's possible to do this

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120
technically it's possible to do this
 

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.520
technically it's possible to do this
right you can go ahead and drop all your

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:04.530
right you can go ahead and drop all your
 

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.370
right you can go ahead and drop all your
references in ondestroy view recreate

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380
references in ondestroy view recreate
 

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.350
references in ondestroy view recreate
the view after after you come around the

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360
the view after after you come around the
 

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.620
the view after after you come around the
other side this was way too difficult to

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.630
other side this was way too difficult to
 

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.329
other side this was way too difficult to
get right all the time just because

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339
get right all the time just because
 

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.189
get right all the time just because
references to these views end up leaking

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199
references to these views end up leaking
 

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.260
references to these views end up leaking
out and getting everywhere no matter

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:18.270
out and getting everywhere no matter
 

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.449
out and getting everywhere no matter
what you try to do so this was something

00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459
what you try to do so this was something
 

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:22.670
what you try to do so this was something
that was it was really just kind of a

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:22.680
that was it was really just kind of a
 

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.500
that was it was really just kind of a
foot gun waiting - waiting to hurt

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:24.510
foot gun waiting - waiting to hurt
 

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:30.380
foot gun waiting - waiting to hurt
people but of course in the architecture

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:30.390
people but of course in the architecture
 

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.450
people but of course in the architecture
component world there's a different

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460
component world there's a different
 

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.130
component world there's a different
solution for this retained instance

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140
solution for this retained instance
 

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.350
solution for this retained instance
pattern and that comes in the model of

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360
pattern and that comes in the model of
 

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.260
pattern and that comes in the model of
view models so this was kind of a brand

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:39.270
view models so this was kind of a brand
 

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.630
view models so this was kind of a brand
new class and to be honest the class

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640
new class and to be honest the class
 

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.240
new class and to be honest the class
doesn't really do a whole lot it's how

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.250
doesn't really do a whole lot it's how
 

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.670
doesn't really do a whole lot it's how
it connects to the overall system so

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:46.680
it connects to the overall system so
 

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.100
it connects to the overall system so
instead of being again part of the

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.110
instead of being again part of the
 

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.340
instead of being again part of the
fragment api's this is a more

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:52.350
fragment api's this is a more
 

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.710
fragment api's this is a more
general-purpose thing something that you

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720
general-purpose thing something that you
 

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.560
general-purpose thing something that you
can attach to any activity or any

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:57.570
can attach to any activity or any
 

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.290
can attach to any activity or any
fragment or any view model store owner

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.300
fragment or any view model store owner
 

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.120
fragment or any view model store owner
if you're building your own framework

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.130
if you're building your own framework
 

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.290
if you're building your own framework
and the main thing that's different here

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:06.300
and the main thing that's different here
 

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.000
and the main thing that's different here
just kind of like the lifecycle

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.010
just kind of like the lifecycle
 

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.870
just kind of like the lifecycle
observers is that we are not the owner

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880
observers is that we are not the owner
 

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.660
observers is that we are not the owner
of creating those objects so by default

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:14.670
of creating those objects so by default
 

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.630
of creating those objects so by default
we provide a factory that just creates a

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640
we provide a factory that just creates a
 

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.460
we provide a factory that just creates a
new instance or creates a new instance

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:19.470
new instance or creates a new instance
 

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.370
new instance or creates a new instance
and attaches your application context to

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380
and attaches your application context to
 

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.680
and attaches your application context to
it but at the same point this is a super

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:24.690
it but at the same point this is a super
 

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.170
it but at the same point this is a super
powerful hook for again kind of adding

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.180
powerful hook for again kind of adding
 

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.510
powerful hook for again kind of adding
in those extra dependencies so if you're

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520
in those extra dependencies so if you're
 

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.640
in those extra dependencies so if you're
using dependency injection like again

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:31.650
using dependency injection like again
 

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.460
using dependency injection like again
you have kind of the hooks you need to

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:34.470
you have kind of the hooks you need to
 

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.770
you have kind of the hooks you need to
hook into the view model creation and

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780
hook into the view model creation and
 

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.510
hook into the view model creation and
pass those in just as a constructor

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520
pass those in just as a constructor
 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.400
pass those in just as a constructor
parameter right there really doesn't

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.410
parameter right there really doesn't

need to be a more complicated structure

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780
need to be a more complicated structure
 

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.930
need to be a more complicated structure
than that so but you get into the same

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940
than that so but you get into the same
 

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.580
than that so but you get into the same
problem of like okay well how do I

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:49.590
problem of like okay well how do I
 

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.060

puzzle here is a different architecture

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:54.570
puzzle here is a different architecture
 

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.470
puzzle here is a different architecture
component called live data and live data

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480
component called live data and live data
 

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.500
component called live data and live data
is kind of all about a lifecycle aware

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:00.510
is kind of all about a lifecycle aware
 

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.890
is kind of all about a lifecycle aware
observer so in this model in this world

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900
observer so in this model in this world
 

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.370
observer so in this model in this world
your view model is the one who's storing

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380
your view model is the one who's storing
 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.310
your view model is the one who's storing
the data right and it's the live data

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320
the data right and it's the live data
 

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.480
the data right and it's the live data
that it has that it can then pass to the

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:14.490
that it has that it can then pass to the
 

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.910
that it has that it can then pass to the
activity or fragment as they get created

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:16.920
activity or fragment as they get created
 

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.320
activity or fragment as they get created
and recreated and that fragment or

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:21.330
and recreated and that fragment or
 

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.510
and recreated and that fragment or
activity can just observe the live data

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520
activity can just observe the live data
 

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.960
activity can just observe the live data
that the view model owns so this model

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:26.970
that the view model owns so this model
 

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.880
that the view model owns so this model
kind of separates things out where

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:28.890
kind of separates things out where
 

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.890
kind of separates things out where
instead of it being the view model that

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900
instead of it being the view model that
 

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.770
instead of it being the view model that
needs to hold on to a reference to views

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780
needs to hold on to a reference to views
 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.380
needs to hold on to a reference to views
the activity can then pull the

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.390
the activity can then pull the
 

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.920
the activity can then pull the
information out of the view model

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:39.930
information out of the view model
 

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.520
information out of the view model
so I think for a lot of use cases where

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.530
so I think for a lot of use cases where
 

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.260
so I think for a lot of use cases where
you're using a retained in some state

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.270
you're using a retained in some state
 

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.450
you're using a retained in some state
specifically to kind of store this

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:48.460
specifically to kind of store this
 

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.500
specifically to kind of store this
expensive data and do that kind of work

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:51.510
expensive data and do that kind of work
 

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.580
expensive data and do that kind of work
view models offer really good

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:53.590
view models offer really good
 

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.920
view models offer really good
alternative to retained instance

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:55.930
alternative to retained instance
 

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.300
alternative to retained instance
fragments so what's a super simple one

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.310
fragments so what's a super simple one
 

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.370
fragments so what's a super simple one
look like well in this case we're going

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.380
look like well in this case we're going
 

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.650
look like well in this case we're going
to use an Android view model so here we

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:04.660
to use an Android view model so here we
 

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.900
to use an Android view model so here we
get a reference to your application your

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:06.910
get a reference to your application your
 

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.270
get a reference to your application your
application context so this is really

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280
application context so this is really
 

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.980
application context so this is really
useful if you're doing things like a

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:10.990
useful if you're doing things like a
 

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.550
useful if you're doing things like a
service locator kind of pattern but the

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:14.560
service locator kind of pattern but the
 

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.650
service locator kind of pattern but the
important thing here is that the view

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:16.660
important thing here is that the view
 

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.190
important thing here is that the view
model stores an instance of a live data

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200
model stores an instance of a live data
 

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.830
model stores an instance of a live data
in this case I live data that has a list

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840
in this case I live data that has a list
 

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.770
in this case I live data that has a list
of our fancy renamed expensive data

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:25.780
of our fancy renamed expensive data
 

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.560
of our fancy renamed expensive data
class now normally you'd put this in

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:28.570
class now normally you'd put this in
 

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.980
class now normally you'd put this in
line but slides are hard so here we're

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:31.990
line but slides are hard so here we're
 

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.170
line but slides are hard so here we're
using it and we're getting our data from

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.180
using it and we're getting our data from
 

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.030
using it and we're getting our data from
a room database a simple or database but

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.040
a room database a simple or database but
 

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.070
a room database a simple or database but
you can really get this data from

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080
you can really get this data from
 

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.760
you can really get this data from
anywhere or set up kind of the correct

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:44.770
anywhere or set up kind of the correct
 

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.400
anywhere or set up kind of the correct
lifecycle events here so that your live

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:47.410
lifecycle events here so that your live
 

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.800
lifecycle events here so that your live
data can kind of get into the right

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:49.810
data can kind of get into the right
 

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.880
data can kind of get into the right
State but that means that your actual

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:53.890
State but that means that your actual
 

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.340
State but that means that your actual
fragments or activities don't need to

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.350
fragments or activities don't need to
 

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.340
fragments or activities don't need to
know where this data came from right

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.350
know where this data came from right
 

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.800
know where this data came from right
it's encapsulated in the view model and

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:01.810
it's encapsulated in the view model and
 

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.170
it's encapsulated in the view model and
again we're in the same thing where we

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:04.180
again we're in the same thing where we
 

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.030
again we're in the same thing where we
can now test this view model in

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.040
can now test this view model in
 

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.400
can now test this view model in
isolation we don't need to create

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.410
isolation we don't need to create
 

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.140
isolation we don't need to create
activities we don't need to create

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.150
activities we don't need to create
 

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.690
activities we don't need to create
fragments to get to this same view model

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:12.700
fragments to get to this same view model
 

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.570
fragments to get to this same view model
we can just use them in isolation and

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:15.580
we can just use them in isolation and
 

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.820
we can just use them in isolation and
make sure that all of the work we need

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:17.830
make sure that all of the work we need
 

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.340
make sure that all of the work we need
here to get our expensive data and make

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:20.350
here to get our expensive data and make
 

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.170
here to get our expensive data and make
sure that it's in the right State can

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:22.180
sure that it's in the right State can
 

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.420
sure that it's in the right State can
all be done kind of separate from the

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:24.430
all be done kind of separate from the
 

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.850
all be done kind of separate from the
actual UI pieces of the framework all

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:29.860
actual UI pieces of the framework all
 

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.100
actual UI pieces of the framework all
right so everybody's favorite topic when

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:32.110
right so everybody's favorite topic when
 

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.810
right so everybody's favorite topic when
it comes to the fragment API is fragment

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:33.820
it comes to the fragment API is fragment
 

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.580
it comes to the fragment API is fragment
transactions because this is a statement

fragment transactions are asynchronous

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:44.910
fragment transactions are asynchronous
 

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.300
fragment transactions are asynchronous
by default if you call commit on a

by default if you call commit on a
 

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.640
by default if you call commit on a
fragment transaction then that ends up

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:49.650
fragment transaction then that ends up
 

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.100
fragment transaction then that ends up
getting posted for later and it'll occur

everybody gets kind of frustrated about
 

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.440
everybody gets kind of frustrated about
it and the biggest one is that you don't

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.450
it and the biggest one is that you don't
 

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.240
it and the biggest one is that you don't
have any reentrant fragment operations

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.250
have any reentrant fragment operations
 

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.780
have any reentrant fragment operations
this means that if you end up

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:16.790
this means that if you end up
 

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.070
this means that if you end up
manipulating fragments within say the

oncreate of another fragment then you

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.150
oncreate of another fragment then you
 

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.280
oncreate of another fragment then you
don't start getting into a state where

source of countless bugs I think that it

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:30.990
source of countless bugs I think that it
 

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.410

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.320
was even just earlier this week last
week that we were helping developer

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.330
week that we were helping developer
 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.120
week that we were helping developer
troubleshoot some other reentrant

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:38.130
troubleshoot some other reentrant
 

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.770
troubleshoot some other reentrant
behavior bugs that was coming from view

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780
behavior bugs that was coming from view
 

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.340
behavior bugs that was coming from view
callbacks for example and this is the

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:43.350
callbacks for example and this is the
 

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.350
callbacks for example and this is the
sort of thing that is can be really

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360
sort of thing that is can be really
 

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.730
sort of thing that is can be really
really subtle and the asynchronous

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740
really subtle and the asynchronous
 

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.130
really subtle and the asynchronous
fragment transactions sidestep all of it

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140
fragment transactions sidestep all of it
 

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.040
fragment transactions sidestep all of it
and that was kind of convenient the

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.050
and that was kind of convenient the
 

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.530
and that was kind of convenient the
drawbacks are of course that the

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:54.540
drawbacks are of course that the
 

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.570
drawbacks are of course that the
observed state at any given point in

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580
observed state at any given point in
 

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.580
observed state at any given point in
time doesn't actually reflect any of the

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:58.590
time doesn't actually reflect any of the
 

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.640
time doesn't actually reflect any of the
queued transactions so this is a huge

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:01.650
queued transactions so this is a huge
 

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.890
queued transactions so this is a huge
problem this basically means that if one

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900
problem this basically means that if one
 

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.110
problem this basically means that if one
piece of your code submits a fragment

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120
piece of your code submits a fragment
 

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.940
piece of your code submits a fragment
transaction another piece of your code

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:07.950
transaction another piece of your code
 

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.100
transaction another piece of your code
tries to read something out of state

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.110
tries to read something out of state
 

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.690
tries to read something out of state
that that fragment would have set up for

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700
that that fragment would have set up for
 

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.010
that that fragment would have set up for
you whether that's another view

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020
you whether that's another view
 

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.060
you whether that's another view
hierarchy that would have gotten

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.070
hierarchy that would have gotten
 

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.800
hierarchy that would have gotten
attached to sort of a sub hierarchy of

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:15.810
attached to sort of a sub hierarchy of
 

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.020
attached to sort of a sub hierarchy of
your UI or whether that's just some data

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.030
your UI or whether that's just some data
 

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.850
your UI or whether that's just some data
about a pending operation say for one of

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860
about a pending operation say for one of
 

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.510
about a pending operation say for one of
these retained instance fragments this

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520
these retained instance fragments this
 

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.530
these retained instance fragments this
essentially means that you can't trust

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:24.540
essentially means that you can't trust
 

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.060
essentially means that you can't trust
anything about the current state of the

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.070
anything about the current state of the

anything about the current state of the
app it means that you can have various

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:28.410
app it means that you can have various
 

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.830

thread handler of your application we've
 

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.210
thread handler of your application we've
even seen people run into the issues of

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220
even seen people run into the issues of
 

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.190
even seen people run into the issues of
sort of the the layered fragments on top

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200
sort of the the layered fragments on top
 

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.170
sort of the the layered fragments on top

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:39.180
of one another because of this issue
 

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.700
of one another because of this issue
because they were checking the fragment

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.710
because they were checking the fragment
 

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.670

a new fragment transaction and stick

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:50.670
a new fragment transaction and stick
 

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.860

something there but there was already
something in flight so this was

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360
something in flight so this was
 

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.549
something in flight so this was
something that was really kind of a pain

00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559
something that was really kind of a pain
 

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.899
something that was really kind of a pain
in the neck and everybody loved when the

commit now API was added because it lets

00:23:59.119 --> 00:23:59.129
commit now API was added because it lets
 

00:23:59.129 --> 00:24:01.159
commit now API was added because it lets
you do something right immediately as

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:01.169
you do something right immediately as
 

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:02.419
you do something right immediately as
long as you promise that you weren't

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:02.429
long as you promise that you weren't
 

00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:03.739
long as you promise that you weren't
gonna do anything with your current

00:24:03.739 --> 00:24:03.749
gonna do anything with your current
 

00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:05.149
gonna do anything with your current
fragment manager as part of that

00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159
fragment manager as part of that
 

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:11.029
fragment manager as part of that
transaction but we kind of get to this

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039
transaction but we kind of get to this
 

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.980
transaction but we kind of get to this
point where okay now we have all these

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:12.990
point where okay now we have all these
 

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.560
point where okay now we have all these
fragment transaction code in your app

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:15.570
fragment transaction code in your app
 

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.279
fragment transaction code in your app
and very subtle changes that you may not

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:19.289
and very subtle changes that you may not
 

00:24:19.289 --> 00:24:22.070
and very subtle changes that you may not
pick up in a simple CL all of a sudden

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080
pick up in a simple CL all of a sudden
 

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.840
pick up in a simple CL all of a sudden
are changing the whole behavior of your

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:23.850
are changing the whole behavior of your
 

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.539
are changing the whole behavior of your
app and we really took a look at this

00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:26.549
app and we really took a look at this
 

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:28.639
app and we really took a look at this
and we said well like should you really

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:28.649
and we said well like should you really
 

00:24:28.649 --> 00:24:30.830
and we said well like should you really
have to be writing all of these fragment

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840
have to be writing all of these fragment
 

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.619
have to be writing all of these fragment
transactions by hand like for so many of

00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:33.629
transactions by hand like for so many of
 

00:24:33.629 --> 00:24:34.519
transactions by hand like for so many of
the use cases

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:34.529
the use cases
 

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:36.289
the use cases
we can do a little bit better here we

00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299
we can do a little bit better here we
 

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:39.320
we can do a little bit better here we
can do a lot better here especially for

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.330
can do a lot better here especially for
 

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.019
can do a lot better here especially for
the really common cases so we built

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:42.029
the really common cases so we built
 

00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:44.119
the really common cases so we built
navigation brand new architecture

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:44.129
navigation brand new architecture
 

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:45.919
navigation brand new architecture
component that's really kind of focused

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:45.929
component that's really kind of focused
 

00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:48.970
component that's really kind of focused
on that screen to screen transitions

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:48.980
on that screen to screen transitions
 

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.129
on that screen to screen transitions
between fragments or other UI pieces

00:24:52.129 --> 00:24:52.139
between fragments or other UI pieces
 

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:54.169
between fragments or other UI pieces
because we really want to make it work

00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179
because we really want to make it work
 

00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:56.899
because we really want to make it work
well with fragments fragments are a

00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:56.909
well with fragments fragments are a
 

00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:59.409
well with fragments fragments are a
really great way of getting access to

00:24:59.409 --> 00:24:59.419
really great way of getting access to
 

00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:02.210
really great way of getting access to
lifecycle observers and view models and

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220
lifecycle observers and view models and
 

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.869
lifecycle observers and view models and
also you know being an owner of a view

00:25:05.869 --> 00:25:05.879
also you know being an owner of a view
 

00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:07.850
also you know being an owner of a view
and those are really kind of the main

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860
and those are really kind of the main
 

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.950
and those are really kind of the main
pieces you need when you're trying to

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960
pieces you need when you're trying to
 

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.539
pieces you need when you're trying to
build a good Android app at the same

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:14.549
build a good Android app at the same
 

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:17.239
build a good Android app at the same
point we realize there's a lot of things

00:25:17.239 --> 00:25:17.249
point we realize there's a lot of things
 

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:20.239
point we realize there's a lot of things
that fragments do that we don't really

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:20.249
that fragments do that we don't really
 

00:25:20.249 --> 00:25:22.720
that fragments do that we don't really
want you to have to deal with yourself

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:22.730
want you to have to deal with yourself
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.639
want you to have to deal with yourself
so one of the things with navigation

00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:25.649
so one of the things with navigation
 

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:28.190
so one of the things with navigation
that we really focused on was actually

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200
that we really focused on was actually
 

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.249
that we really focused on was actually
being able to take ownership of the back

00:25:31.249 --> 00:25:31.259
being able to take ownership of the back
 

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:34.879
being able to take ownership of the back
stack make sure that the navigation

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:34.889
stack make sure that the navigation
 

00:25:34.889 --> 00:25:37.310
stack make sure that the navigation
component can actually handle that back

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320
component can actually handle that back
 

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.710
component can actually handle that back
stack for you whether using fragments

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720
stack for you whether using fragments
 

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.600
stack for you whether using fragments
are using something else the ownership

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:41.610
are using something else the ownership
 

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.789
are using something else the ownership
of that backs that kind of lace with

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799
of that backs that kind of lace with
 

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:46.190
of that backs that kind of lace with
navigation that gives us a lot more

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200
navigation that gives us a lot more
 

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.830
navigation that gives us a lot more
flexibility and a lot more ability to

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840
flexibility and a lot more ability to
 

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.060
flexibility and a lot more ability to
you know be a little bit more

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.070
you know be a little bit more
 

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.680
you know be a little bit more
prescriptive and a little bit more

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:51.690
prescriptive and a little bit more
 

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:55.039
prescriptive and a little bit more
opinionated on what is a good thing to

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.049
opinionated on what is a good thing to
 

00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:57.139
opinionated on what is a good thing to
do and what's a not-so-great thing to do

00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:57.149
do and what's a not-so-great thing to do
 

00:25:57.149 --> 00:26:00.049
do and what's a not-so-great thing to do
and kind of give you a lot of the same

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059
and kind of give you a lot of the same
 

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:03.109
and kind of give you a lot of the same
power of fragment transactions without

00:26:03.109 --> 00:26:03.119
power of fragment transactions without
 

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.149
power of fragment transactions without
actually having to touch one with your

00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159
actually having to touch one with your
 

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:08.570
actually having to touch one with your
our hands because again we're trying to

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580
our hands because again we're trying to
 

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.210
our hands because again we're trying to
make things so that you know you have

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220
make things so that you know you have
 

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.609
make things so that you know you have
all of the power without necessarily the

00:26:15.609 --> 00:26:15.619
all of the power without necessarily the
 

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.560
all of the power without necessarily the
headache and the problems that run

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:18.570
headache and the problems that run
 

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.719
headache and the problems that run
across some of the things that Adam

00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:20.729
across some of the things that Adam
 

00:26:20.729 --> 00:26:24.979
across some of the things that Adam
pointed out so we're gonna be talking in

00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:24.989
pointed out so we're gonna be talking in
 

00:26:24.989 --> 00:26:27.499
pointed out so we're gonna be talking in
detail about navigation tomorrow morning

00:26:27.499 --> 00:26:27.509
detail about navigation tomorrow morning
 

00:26:27.509 --> 00:26:29.649
detail about navigation tomorrow morning
at 8:30 I know you're all early risers

00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:29.659
at 8:30 I know you're all early risers
 

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:31.940
at 8:30 I know you're all early risers
but I wanted to give you a little bit of

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:31.950
but I wanted to give you a little bit of
 

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.769
but I wanted to give you a little bit of
a preview kind of how simple this could

00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779
a preview kind of how simple this could
 

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:36.080
a preview kind of how simple this could
be so we actually offer a helper method

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.090
be so we actually offer a helper method
 

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.229
be so we actually offer a helper method
where if you want to click a button and

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:38.239
where if you want to click a button and
 

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:40.969
where if you want to click a button and
do a full-screen transition to another

00:26:40.969 --> 00:26:40.979
do a full-screen transition to another
 

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:44.149
do a full-screen transition to another
fragment we have a create navigate

00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159
fragment we have a create navigate
 

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:46.580
fragment we have a create navigate
onclicklistener that literally just does

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:46.590
onclicklistener that literally just does
 

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.039
onclicklistener that literally just does
that just that all you need to do is

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:49.049
that just that all you need to do is
 

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:51.200
that just that all you need to do is
pass in the ID of one of those

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.210
pass in the ID of one of those
 

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.119
pass in the ID of one of those
destinations that you've set up in

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:53.129
destinations that you've set up in
 

00:26:53.129 --> 00:26:56.269
destinations that you've set up in
navigation now this looks a little bit

00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279
navigation now this looks a little bit
 

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:59.119
navigation now this looks a little bit
magical so what is this actually doing

00:26:59.119 --> 00:26:59.129
magical so what is this actually doing
 

00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:01.430
magical so what is this actually doing
under the covers well really what it's

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440
under the covers well really what it's
 

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.919
under the covers well really what it's
doing is it's using this nav controller

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:03.929
doing is it's using this nav controller
 

00:27:03.929 --> 00:27:07.129
doing is it's using this nav controller
object and one of the things that I find

00:27:07.129 --> 00:27:07.139
object and one of the things that I find
 

00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:10.339
object and one of the things that I find
super useful about navigation is you can

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:10.349
super useful about navigation is you can
 

00:27:10.349 --> 00:27:12.259
super useful about navigation is you can
actually find that nav controller from

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:12.269
actually find that nav controller from
 

00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:15.229
actually find that nav controller from
any view or any fragment that's been

00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:15.239
any view or any fragment that's been
 

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:17.509
any view or any fragment that's been
created by navigation so here we're

00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:17.519
created by navigation so here we're
 

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:19.219
created by navigation so here we're
using a column extension which makes

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:19.229
using a column extension which makes
 

00:27:19.229 --> 00:27:21.859
using a column extension which makes
this a lot easier if you're in the Javal

00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:21.869
this a lot easier if you're in the Javal
 

00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:25.219
this a lot easier if you're in the Javal
and it's just a static method but here

00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:25.229
and it's just a static method but here
 

00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:27.889
and it's just a static method but here
we can find from any view we're going to

00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:27.899
we can find from any view we're going to
 

00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:29.869
we can find from any view we're going to
say find nav controller and get an

00:27:29.869 --> 00:27:29.879
say find nav controller and get an
 

00:27:29.879 --> 00:27:31.969
say find nav controller and get an
instance of our nav controller and then

00:27:31.969 --> 00:27:31.979
instance of our nav controller and then
 

00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:34.879
instance of our nav controller and then
just call navigate and this navigate

00:27:34.879 --> 00:27:34.889
just call navigate and this navigate
 

00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:37.940
just call navigate and this navigate
call knows how to do fragment

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:37.950
call knows how to do fragment
 

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.669
call knows how to do fragment
transactions so our nav controller in

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679
transactions so our nav controller in
 

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:43.460
transactions so our nav controller in
this case is set up with a fragment

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:43.470
this case is set up with a fragment
 

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.399
this case is set up with a fragment
navigator our own class that knows all

00:27:46.399 --> 00:27:46.409
navigator our own class that knows all
 

00:27:46.409 --> 00:27:48.469
navigator our own class that knows all
about the correct behavior of doing

00:27:48.469 --> 00:27:48.479
about the correct behavior of doing
 

00:27:48.479 --> 00:27:50.930
about the correct behavior of doing
fragment transactions and how to do all

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940
fragment transactions and how to do all
 

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.599
fragment transactions and how to do all
of that work for you so that from your

00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:53.609
of that work for you so that from your
 

00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:55.580
of that work for you so that from your
codes perspective you can just call

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:55.590
codes perspective you can just call
 

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.680
codes perspective you can just call
navigate and we'll do the right thing

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:57.690
navigate and we'll do the right thing
 

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.859
navigate and we'll do the right thing
for you so obviously there's a lot more

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:00.869
for you so obviously there's a lot more
 

00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:03.259
for you so obviously there's a lot more
here like if you want to pass arguments

00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:03.269
here like if you want to pass arguments
 

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:06.109
here like if you want to pass arguments
like you can do a bundle approach we

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:06.119
like you can do a bundle approach we
 

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:08.029
like you can do a bundle approach we
also have a lot more things around that

00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039
also have a lot more things around that
 

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:09.680
also have a lot more things around that
specific case that we'll be talking

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:09.690
specific case that we'll be talking
 

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.899
specific case that we'll be talking
about tomorrow as well as well as

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:11.909
about tomorrow as well as well as
 

00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:13.999
about tomorrow as well as well as
setting things like separate animations

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:14.009
setting things like separate animations
 

00:28:14.009 --> 00:28:16.039
setting things like separate animations
and other objects in here so you have a

00:28:16.039 --> 00:28:16.049
and other objects in here so you have a
 

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:17.840
and other objects in here so you have a
lot of the same power but

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:17.850
lot of the same power but
 

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.720
lot of the same power but
you can also make it really easy to use

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:20.730
you can also make it really easy to use
 

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.940
you can also make it really easy to use
and move a lot of the code that used to

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:22.950
and move a lot of the code that used to
 

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.220
and move a lot of the code that used to
be a fragment transaction that you'd

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.230
be a fragment transaction that you'd
 

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.200
be a fragment transaction that you'd
have to make really sure that you got

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.210
have to make really sure that you got
 

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.380
have to make really sure that you got
right into something that navigation can

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:30.390
right into something that navigation can
 

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.419
right into something that navigation can
understand and helpless

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:34.429
 

00:28:34.429 --> 00:28:37.490
so Adam we've talked a lot of things

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500
so Adam we've talked a lot of things
 

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.240
so Adam we've talked a lot of things
about why not fragments but this is kind

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.250
about why not fragments but this is kind
 

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.340
about why not fragments but this is kind
of a fragment talk right so what why

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:43.350
of a fragment talk right so what why
 

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.840
of a fragment talk right so what why
that's why everyone's here yeah

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:44.850
that's why everyone's here yeah
 

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.340
that's why everyone's here yeah
so why fragments its 2018 it is 2018 so

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.350
so why fragments its 2018 it is 2018 so
 

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.230
so why fragments its 2018 it is 2018 so
what what are fragments still good for

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240
what what are fragments still good for
 

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.360
what what are fragments still good for
after we've sort of carved off some of

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:53.370
after we've sort of carved off some of
 

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:57.289
after we've sort of carved off some of
these other extension points so before

00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299
these other extension points so before
 

00:28:57.299 --> 00:28:58.610
these other extension points so before
we talk about that I think it's kind of

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620
we talk about that I think it's kind of
 

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.110
we talk about that I think it's kind of
important to go into a little bit about

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120
important to go into a little bit about
 

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.450
important to go into a little bit about
the package layering involved in the

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460
the package layering involved in the
 

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.340
the package layering involved in the
android framework specifically in

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.350
android framework specifically in
 

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.419
android framework specifically in
bridgit versus android app now Android

00:29:08.419 --> 00:29:08.429
bridgit versus android app now Android
 

00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:09.919
bridgit versus android app now Android
dot widget is really kind of designed to

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:09.929
dot widget is really kind of designed to
 

00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:12.440
dot widget is really kind of designed to
hold all the mechanism for your UI that

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.450
hold all the mechanism for your UI that
 

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.000
hold all the mechanism for your UI that
means that this is all the stuff that

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.010
means that this is all the stuff that
 

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.610
means that this is all the stuff that
shows state to the user and things that

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620
shows state to the user and things that
 

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.950
shows state to the user and things that
reports user interaction events back to

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960
reports user interaction events back to
 

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.810
reports user interaction events back to
other higher-level portions of your app

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820
other higher-level portions of your app
 

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.880
other higher-level portions of your app
and really that's it anything that's in

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:22.890
and really that's it anything that's in
 

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.289
and really that's it anything that's in
the widget package is really meant to

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299
the widget package is really meant to
 

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:27.440
the widget package is really meant to
only do these two things whereas Android

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:27.450
only do these two things whereas Android
 

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.880
only do these two things whereas Android
app which is where fragments live

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:28.890
app which is where fragments live
 

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.130
app which is where fragments live
activities live so on and so forth

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.140
activities live so on and so forth
 

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.890
activities live so on and so forth
that's where your policy goes this is

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:33.900
that's where your policy goes this is
 

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.169
that's where your policy goes this is
what defines what state to bind to

00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179
what defines what state to bind to
 

00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.480
what defines what state to bind to
widgets this is what defines how you

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:38.490
widgets this is what defines how you
 

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.490
widgets this is what defines how you
should respond to those user interaction

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500
should respond to those user interaction
 

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.529
should respond to those user interaction
events and how to issue changes to your

00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539
events and how to issue changes to your
 

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:44.000
events and how to issue changes to your
data model anything kind of at that

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.010
data model anything kind of at that
 

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.010
data model anything kind of at that
layer or above no matter how you may

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020
layer or above no matter how you may
 

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.960
layer or above no matter how you may
factor it this is kind of how it's how

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:47.970
factor it this is kind of how it's how
 

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.230
factor it this is kind of how it's how
it breaks down

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240
it breaks down
 

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.060
it breaks down
so this also brings us to this idea of

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.070
so this also brings us to this idea of
 

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.890
so this also brings us to this idea of
inflatable components which is something

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:54.900
inflatable components which is something
 

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.380
inflatable components which is something
that comes up quite a bit since you can

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:57.390
that comes up quite a bit since you can
 

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.390
that comes up quite a bit since you can
inflate a fragment from a layout people

00:29:59.390 --> 00:29:59.400
inflate a fragment from a layout people
 

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.549
inflate a fragment from a layout people
found out really quickly that you can

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559
found out really quickly that you can
 

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:03.590
found out really quickly that you can
use a fragment to compose some of your

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600
use a fragment to compose some of your
 

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.510
use a fragment to compose some of your
views together and create basically like

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520
views together and create basically like
 

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.230
views together and create basically like
a custom view but with a fragment and

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240
a custom view but with a fragment and
 

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.370
a custom view but with a fragment and
really some of this kind of comes in

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380
really some of this kind of comes in
 

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.990
really some of this kind of comes in
because people start asking you know

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000
because people start asking you know
 

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.510
because people start asking you know
just if this view had a lifecycle I

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520
just if this view had a lifecycle I
 

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.289
just if this view had a lifecycle I
could as something but really you kind

00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299
could as something but really you kind
 

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:20.120
could as something but really you kind
of want to use that as a stopping point

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.130
of want to use that as a stopping point
 

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.680
of want to use that as a stopping point
and just kind of ask yourself like what

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:21.690
and just kind of ask yourself like what
 

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.620
and just kind of ask yourself like what
is it about this particular view

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:23.630
is it about this particular view
 

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.570
is it about this particular view
remember mechanism only that needs a

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580
remember mechanism only that needs a
 

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.570
remember mechanism only that needs a
lifecycle if you should really only be

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580
lifecycle if you should really only be
 

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.570
lifecycle if you should really only be
showing the

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:30.580

the views themselves none of these

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:40.419
the views themselves none of these
 

00:30:40.419 --> 00:30:42.180
the views themselves none of these
things need life cycle events to

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:42.190
things need life cycle events to
 

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.340
things need life cycle events to
accomplish that goal so you should

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:44.350
accomplish that goal so you should
 

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.899
accomplish that goal so you should
really kind of watch out and figure out

00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:45.909
really kind of watch out and figure out
 

00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:47.310
really kind of watch out and figure out
okay do you need some sort of policy

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320
okay do you need some sort of policy
 

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.639
okay do you need some sort of policy

layer that sits above that this is where
fragments are really useful because you

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:52.390
fragments are really useful because you
 

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.360
fragments are really useful because you
can compose them of higher level

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.370
can compose them of higher level
 

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.639
can compose them of higher level
controls it means that they can be

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:56.649
controls it means that they can be
 

00:30:56.649 --> 00:30:58.710
controls it means that they can be
self-sufficient they have their own life

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720
self-sufficient they have their own life
 

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.330

cycle they know how to hook into some of
 

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.100
cycle they know how to hook into some of
these things they need it means that

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:04.110
these things they need it means that
 

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.539
these things they need it means that
inflated attributes can actually become

00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:06.549
inflated attributes can actually become
 

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:09.240
inflated attributes can actually become
fragment arguments so you can make these

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.250
fragment arguments so you can make these
 

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.039
fragment arguments so you can make these
things super self-sufficient and

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:11.049
things super self-sufficient and
 

00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:13.799
things super self-sufficient and

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:13.809
implement cross-cutting UI policies that
 

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:15.659
implement cross-cutting UI policies that
you don't have to worry about in terms

00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:15.669
you don't have to worry about in terms
 

00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:17.909
you don't have to worry about in terms
of like the overarching top level parent

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919
of like the overarching top level parent
 

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.159
of like the overarching top level parent
context this ends up being really useful

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:20.169
context this ends up being really useful
 

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:22.320
context this ends up being really useful
for things like I mean even just

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:22.330
for things like I mean even just

something as simple as adds something
where you really do need to control for

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600
where you really do need to control for
 

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.750
where you really do need to control for
a lifecycle about when a user comes and

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760
a lifecycle about when a user comes and
 

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.909
a lifecycle about when a user comes and
goes perform a request out to the

network to fetch the content that you're
going to show but really you don't want

the rest of your application logic you

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:38.260
the rest of your application logic you
 

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.450
the rest of your application logic you
can use this for other sorts of like

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:39.460
can use this for other sorts of like
 

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.190
can use this for other sorts of like

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:54.100
the hood in order to get that on screen
 

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.740
the hood in order to get that on screen
and get the user interacting with it so

00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:58.750
and get the user interacting with it so
 

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.269

one example of using the fragment

00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279
one example of using the fragment
 

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:02.129
one example of using the fragment
arguments for this is on screen here

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:02.139
arguments for this is on screen here
 

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:03.570
arguments for this is on screen here
this is the sort of thing that could

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:03.580
this is the sort of thing that could
 

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.490
this is the sort of thing that could
probably benefit from some extensions or

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:05.500
probably benefit from some extensions or
 

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.889
probably benefit from some extensions or
helpers but overall it's it's not too

00:32:07.889 --> 00:32:07.899
helpers but overall it's it's not too
 

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:09.750

arguments just assign the values to the

00:32:13.379 --> 00:32:13.389
arguments just assign the values to the
 

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:14.789
arguments just assign the values to the
bundle set it there and then you can

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799
bundle set it there and then you can
 

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:16.200
bundle set it there and then you can
route all of this logic through your

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.210
route all of this logic through your
 

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.029
route all of this logic through your
normal fragment argument handling that

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039
normal fragment argument handling that
 

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.139
normal fragment argument handling that
appears throughout the rest of your

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:19.149
appears throughout the rest of your
 

00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:24.060
appears throughout the rest of your
fragment implementation so one of the

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.070
fragment implementation so one of the
 

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.950
fragment implementation so one of the
other use cases that we found really

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960
other use cases that we found really
 

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.440
other use cases that we found really
useful for using fragments is this kind

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:28.450
useful for using fragments is this kind
 

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.139
useful for using fragments is this kind
of app screen kind of model so where a

00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:31.149
of app screen kind of model so where a
 

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:33.899
of app screen kind of model so where a
fragment is taking the vast majority of

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:33.909
fragment is taking the vast majority of
 

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:36.690
fragment is taking the vast majority of
the screen it's really the main content

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:36.700
the screen it's really the main content
 

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.240
the screen it's really the main content
of your app and this is really kind of

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:39.250
of your app and this is really kind of
 

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.520
of your app and this is really kind of
where navigation

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:40.530
where navigation
 

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.980
where navigation
and really kind of takes away a lot of

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:42.990
and really kind of takes away a lot of
 

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.720
and really kind of takes away a lot of
the rough edges of fragments so you're

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:44.730
the rough edges of fragments so you're
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.820
the rough edges of fragments so you're
just left with the architecture

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:46.830
just left with the architecture
 

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:51.020
just left with the architecture
component hooks and a view so in this

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.030
component hooks and a view so in this
 

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:55.010
component hooks and a view so in this
model it's a lot easier to move towards

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020
model it's a lot easier to move towards
 

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.830
model it's a lot easier to move towards
a single activity out if you've listened

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840
a single activity out if you've listened
 

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.690
a single activity out if you've listened
to Chet yesterday and this is kind of

00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700
to Chet yesterday and this is kind of
 

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.090
to Chet yesterday and this is kind of
our recommendation going forward to kind

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100
our recommendation going forward to kind
 

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.220
our recommendation going forward to kind
of use activities just as an entry point

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:04.230
of use activities just as an entry point
 

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.400
of use activities just as an entry point
into your app and then your content the

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.410
into your app and then your content the
 

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.800
into your app and then your content the
actual things that the UI the pieces

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:09.810
actual things that the UI the pieces
 

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.070
actual things that the UI the pieces
that developer or users actually work

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080
that developer or users actually work
 

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.010
that developer or users actually work
with are the fragments of your app right

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:16.020
with are the fragments of your app right
 

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.730
with are the fragments of your app right
the actual content is in fragments so

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740
the actual content is in fragments so
 

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.010
the actual content is in fragments so
with this model the only thing the

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:22.020
with this model the only thing the
 

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.260
with this model the only thing the
activity needs to do is handle kind of

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:24.270
activity needs to do is handle kind of
 

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.900
activity needs to do is handle kind of
common app chrome so if you're using an

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:26.910
common app chrome so if you're using an
 

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.500
common app chrome so if you're using an
action bar still or if you're using like

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.510
action bar still or if you're using like
 

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.810
action bar still or if you're using like
bottom nav or a side nav these would be

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820
bottom nav or a side nav these would be
 

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.970
bottom nav or a side nav these would be
good things that the activity can manage

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980
good things that the activity can manage
 

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.120
good things that the activity can manage
but the rest of it can be decoupled

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.130
but the rest of it can be decoupled
 

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.670
but the rest of it can be decoupled
destinations decoupled screens all of

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:40.680
destinations decoupled screens all of
 

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.050
destinations decoupled screens all of
these fragments can be much more

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:42.060
these fragments can be much more
 

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.150
these fragments can be much more
independent from one another rather than

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.160
independent from one another rather than
 

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.870
independent from one another rather than
being tightly coupled together so this

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880
being tightly coupled together so this
 

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.970
being tightly coupled together so this
allows us to kind of move a lot of

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980
allows us to kind of move a lot of
 

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.830
allows us to kind of move a lot of
things that normally you'd have to deal

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840
things that normally you'd have to deal
 

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.880
things that normally you'd have to deal
with manually into a system that we can

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:55.890
with manually into a system that we can
 

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.190
with manually into a system that we can
help you out a lot more on so for

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200
help you out a lot more on so for
 

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.770
help you out a lot more on so for
navigation for example we're going to

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:00.780
navigation for example we're going to
 

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.080
navigation for example we're going to
give you the hooks that you need to set

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.090
give you the hooks that you need to set
 

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.170
give you the hooks that you need to set
up the transitions and animations needed

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:06.180
up the transitions and animations needed
 

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.710
up the transitions and animations needed
to transition between these screens and

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720
to transition between these screens and
 

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.060
to transition between these screens and
it's something that can be done in

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.070
it's something that can be done in
 

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.010
it's something that can be done in
navigation rather than something you

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020
navigation rather than something you
 

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.270
navigation rather than something you
have to do by hand of course like these

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280
have to do by hand of course like these
 

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.700
have to do by hand of course like these
aren't mutually exclusive right you can

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:19.710
aren't mutually exclusive right you can
 

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.600
aren't mutually exclusive right you can
still add a fragment to your layout or

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:23.610
still add a fragment to your layout or
 

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.639
still add a fragment to your layout or
have nested fragments underneath these

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:25.649
have nested fragments underneath these
 

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:27.139
have nested fragments underneath these
things so it's not an all-or-nothing

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:27.149
things so it's not an all-or-nothing
 

00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:30.649
things so it's not an all-or-nothing
kind of an approach it's just one method

00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659
kind of an approach it's just one method
 

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:34.010
kind of an approach it's just one method
that yes this larger kind of content

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020
that yes this larger kind of content
 

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.169
that yes this larger kind of content
based fragment is still a really good

00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179
based fragment is still a really good
 

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.700
based fragment is still a really good
way of kind of bridging the gap between

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:37.710
way of kind of bridging the gap between
 

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.389
way of kind of bridging the gap between
the Android app world and the widget

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399
the Android app world and the widget
 

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:46.129
the Android app world and the widget
world another use case that is still

00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139
world another use case that is still
 

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:49.720
world another use case that is still
super useful is around dialog fragment

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:49.730
super useful is around dialog fragment
 

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.190
super useful is around dialog fragment
again we talked about kind of the active

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200
again we talked about kind of the active
 

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.169
again we talked about kind of the active
he showed aiya log I hope everyone

00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179
he showed aiya log I hope everyone
 

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.720
he showed aiya log I hope everyone
forgot that by now like I said but

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:56.730
forgot that by now like I said but
 

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.940
forgot that by now like I said but
dialog fragment is really kind of the

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:58.950
dialog fragment is really kind of the
 

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.329
dialog fragment is really kind of the
same approach where instead of it being

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339
same approach where instead of it being
 

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:05.569
same approach where instead of it being
something that you need to manage and

00:35:05.569 --> 00:35:05.579
something that you need to manage and
 

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:09.170
something that you need to manage and
make sure is visible or not visible it

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180
make sure is visible or not visible it
 

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.630
make sure is visible or not visible it
really kind of helps encapsulate the

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640
really kind of helps encapsulate the
 

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.510
really kind of helps encapsulate the
interaction between a floating UI like

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520
interaction between a floating UI like
 

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.250
interaction between a floating UI like
if you have a really important question

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260
if you have a really important question
 

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.819
if you have a really important question
to ask the user a dialog is probably a

00:35:19.819 --> 00:35:19.829
to ask the user a dialog is probably a
 

00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:22.700
to ask the user a dialog is probably a
useful case in some manner but it's also

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:22.710
useful case in some manner but it's also
 

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.230
useful case in some manner but it's also
something that we've started to see a

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240
something that we've started to see a
 

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.200
something that we've started to see a
lot more in Android P for instance the

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:27.210
lot more in Android P for instance the
 

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.810
lot more in Android P for instance the
biometric prompt for fingerprint is now

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820
biometric prompt for fingerprint is now
 

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.810
biometric prompt for fingerprint is now
something that is in a dialog kind of

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820
something that is in a dialog kind of
 

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.930
something that is in a dialog kind of
model so this is actually something that

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940
model so this is actually something that
 

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.170
model so this is actually something that
we found really useful and part of it is

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180
we found really useful and part of it is
 

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.390
we found really useful and part of it is
that we can leverage some of that

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400
that we can leverage some of that
 

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.270
that we can leverage some of that

for free as part of fragments with your
dialogue this means that you've asked a

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:49.470
dialogue this means that you've asked a
 

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.079
dialogue this means that you've asked a
really important question otherwise why

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:51.089
really important question otherwise why
 

00:35:51.089 --> 00:35:53.720
really important question otherwise why
would you show a dialog and interrupt

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:53.730
would you show a dialog and interrupt
 

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.480
would you show a dialog and interrupt
the user but you really don't want that

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.490
the user but you really don't want that
 

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.599

fragment is great if you have this UI

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260
fragment is great if you have this UI
 

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.410
fragment is great if you have this UI
that you really don't want to lose right

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420
that you really don't want to lose right

it's really important for the user you
 

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.040
it's really important for the user you
know obviously for things that the user

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.050
know obviously for things that the user
 

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:53.240
know obviously for things that the user
could use could lose it's probably not a

dialog that you want to use it's
 

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.240
dialog that you want to use it's
probably a snack bar or another approach

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:56.250
probably a snack bar or another approach
 

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.269
probably a snack bar or another approach

this is my favorite part about dialogue

00:37:00.559 --> 00:37:00.569
this is my favorite part about dialogue

to do you call show or show now for the

to do you call show or show now for the
synchronous method and that's it

00:37:10.569 --> 00:37:10.579
synchronous method and that's it
 

00:37:10.579 --> 00:37:13.370
synchronous method and that's it
very much kind of this model where we're

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380
very much kind of this model where we're
 

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.259
very much kind of this model where we're
going to do the fragment transactions

00:37:15.259 --> 00:37:15.269
going to do the fragment transactions
 

00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:18.499
going to do the fragment transactions
for you again like we don't want to be

00:37:18.499 --> 00:37:18.509
for you again like we don't want to be
 

00:37:18.509 --> 00:37:21.049
for you again like we don't want to be
in a model where you have to do a lot of

in a model where you have to do a lot of
complicated work yourself for a dialogue

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480
complicated work yourself for a dialogue
 

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.999
complicated work yourself for a dialogue
fragment you can literally just call

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:26.009

show and it'll do the right thing and

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.170
show and it'll do the right thing and
 

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.769
show and it'll do the right thing and
it'll get you back into the right state

00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:32.779
it'll get you back into the right state
 

00:37:32.779 --> 00:37:36.259
it'll get you back into the right state
all right so one of the other things

00:37:36.259 --> 00:37:36.269
all right so one of the other things
 

00:37:36.269 --> 00:37:37.640
all right so one of the other things
that people tend to use fragments for

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:37.650
that people tend to use fragments for
 

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.890
that people tend to use fragments for
quite a bit is managing options menus

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900
quite a bit is managing options menus
 

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.170
quite a bit is managing options menus
and specifically merging some menus into

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180
and specifically merging some menus into
 

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.420
and specifically merging some menus into
some common into a common tool bar into

an action bar that's global to your

00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079
an action bar that's global to your
 

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:48.170
an action bar that's global to your
activity so fragments support options

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180
activity so fragments support options
 

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.059
activity so fragments support options
menus because activities support options

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:50.069
menus because activities support options
 

00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:51.559

rest is kind of left as an exercise to
the reader and we kind of just need to

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.070
the reader and we kind of just need to
 

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.290
the reader and we kind of just need to
do better on this part yeah so one of

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300
do better on this part yeah so one of
 

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.360
do better on this part yeah so one of
the other pieces that kind of came

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:53.370
the other pieces that kind of came
 

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.850
the other pieces that kind of came
alongside of fragments more from a

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:55.860
alongside of fragments more from a
 

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.740
alongside of fragments more from a
convenience method than anything else

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:57.750
convenience method than anything else
 

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.680
convenience method than anything else
were loaders a kind of precursor to a

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:00.690
were loaders a kind of precursor to a
 

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.020
were loaders a kind of precursor to a
lot of what we've done in architecture

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.030
lot of what we've done in architecture
 

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.820
lot of what we've done in architecture
components on doing retained infant

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:04.830
components on doing retained infant
 

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.770
components on doing retained infant
States and one of the things we've done

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780
States and one of the things we've done
 

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.200
States and one of the things we've done
recently is actually tried to decouple

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:09.210
recently is actually tried to decouple
 

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.100
recently is actually tried to decouple
them from fragments so how do we

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.110
them from fragments so how do we
 

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.500
them from fragments so how do we
actually do this well instead of being

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:15.510
actually do this well instead of being
 

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.300
actually do this well instead of being
their own special thing we actually

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:17.310
their own special thing we actually
 

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.220
their own special thing we actually
rebuilt them on a lot of the

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:19.230
rebuilt them on a lot of the
 

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.410
rebuilt them on a lot of the
architecture

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:20.420
architecture
 

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.600
architecture
right using these new primitives we have

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:22.610
right using these new primitives we have
 

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.030
right using these new primitives we have
of live data and view model to kind of

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040
of live data and view model to kind of
 

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.070
of live data and view model to kind of
make these a totally independent thing

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:27.080
make these a totally independent thing
 

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.770
make these a totally independent thing
so now you can actually use loaders in

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:29.780
so now you can actually use loaders in
 

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.960
so now you can actually use loaders in
any lifecycle owner if you model store

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:31.970
any lifecycle owner if you model store
 

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.570
any lifecycle owner if you model store
owner class so activity fragment if

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:34.580
owner class so activity fragment if
 

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.100
owner class so activity fragment if
you're building your own kind of thing

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.110
you're building your own kind of thing
 

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.770
you're building your own kind of thing
it works equally well in all of those

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:38.780
it works equally well in all of those
 

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.130
it works equally well in all of those
cases so what does this mean well it

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:42.140
cases so what does this mean well it
 

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.780
cases so what does this mean well it
really just means that you have the same

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:43.790
really just means that you have the same
 

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.490
really just means that you have the same
loader you always do but instead of

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:45.500
loader you always do but instead of
 

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.250
loader you always do but instead of
calling get support fragment or loader

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:48.260
calling get support fragment or loader
 

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.440
calling get support fragment or loader
manager you can just call get instance

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.450
manager you can just call get instance
 

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.100
manager you can just call get instance
and we'll do all the hookup for you we

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:54.110
and we'll do all the hookup for you we
 

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.470
and we'll do all the hookup for you we
know that you're in a lifecycle observer

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480
know that you're in a lifecycle observer
 

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.330
know that you're in a lifecycle observer
so we know how to hook all that stuff up

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:58.340
so we know how to hook all that stuff up
 

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.110
so we know how to hook all that stuff up
for you and you really were able to kind

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:02.120
for you and you really were able to kind
 

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.240
for you and you really were able to kind
of cut out a lot of the stuff cut out a

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:04.250
of cut out a lot of the stuff cut out a
 

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.210
of cut out a lot of the stuff cut out a
lot of the custom behavior here so that

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:07.220
lot of the custom behavior here so that
 

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.950
lot of the custom behavior here so that
you know we can kind of rely on these

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960
you know we can kind of rely on these
 

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.720
you know we can kind of rely on these
new things to give you stronger

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:10.730
new things to give you stronger
 

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.430
new things to give you stronger
guarantees around lifecycle so we've

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440
guarantees around lifecycle so we've
 

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.410
guarantees around lifecycle so we've
talked a lot about fragments and we've

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:17.420
talked a lot about fragments and we've
 

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.540
talked a lot about fragments and we've
talked a lot about fragments in the past

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:19.550
talked a lot about fragments in the past
 

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.050
talked a lot about fragments in the past
and we've talked about fragments in 2018

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.060
and we've talked about fragments in 2018
 

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.090
and we've talked about fragments in 2018
but there's another question where are

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:25.100
but there's another question where are
 

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.800
but there's another question where are
we going with fragments what do we still

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.810
we going with fragments what do we still
 

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.370
we going with fragments what do we still
have to do so some of this is just

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:30.380
have to do so some of this is just
 

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.320
have to do so some of this is just
coming down to building in those

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:32.330
coming down to building in those
 

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.810
coming down to building in those
stronger guarantees trying to separate

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:34.820
stronger guarantees trying to separate
 

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.060
stronger guarantees trying to separate
the desired behavior things that we've

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.070
the desired behavior things that we've
 

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.240
the desired behavior things that we've
specifically set out to put in versus

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:40.250
specifically set out to put in versus
 

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.760
specifically set out to put in versus
incidental behavior more behavior that

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:42.770
incidental behavior more behavior that
 

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.270
incidental behavior more behavior that
has just been around for six years and

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.280
has just been around for six years and
 

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.630
has just been around for six years and
it's not necessarily something that is a

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640
it's not necessarily something that is a
 

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640
it's not necessarily something that is a
codified standard so we're trying to

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:51.650
codified standard so we're trying to
 

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.890
codified standard so we're trying to
move towards more of a model where you

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:53.900
move towards more of a model where you
 

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.530
move towards more of a model where you
can be very confident in exactly what's

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:56.540
can be very confident in exactly what's
 

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.000
can be very confident in exactly what's
going to happen when you're using

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.010
going to happen when you're using
 

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.840
going to happen when you're using
fragments another case is trying to do

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:01.850
fragments another case is trying to do
 

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.210
fragments another case is trying to do
the same thing with that we did with

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.220
the same thing with that we did with
 

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.360
the same thing with that we did with
loader manager in in re implementing

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.370
loader manager in in re implementing
 

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.520
loader manager in in re implementing
some of these existing api's on top of

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:09.530
some of these existing api's on top of
 

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.830
some of these existing api's on top of
these new primitives for example like

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:11.840
these new primitives for example like
 

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.620
these new primitives for example like
being able to rewrite a lot of the

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:14.630
being able to rewrite a lot of the
 

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.210
being able to rewrite a lot of the
internals of fragments so they're

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:16.220
internals of fragments so they're
 

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.580
internals of fragments so they're
actually using lifecycle observers under

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:18.590
actually using lifecycle observers under
 

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.800
actually using lifecycle observers under
the covers right so these kind of things

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.810
the covers right so these kind of things
 

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.620
the covers right so these kind of things
allow us to kind of make sure that all

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:23.630
allow us to kind of make sure that all
 

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.530
allow us to kind of make sure that all
of our components are on the same page

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:26.540
of our components are on the same page
 

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.460
of our components are on the same page
and really doing the same thing so a few

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:30.470
and really doing the same thing so a few
 

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.400
and really doing the same thing so a few
other things again trying to

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:33.410
other things again trying to
 

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:37.420
other things again trying to
move towards a world where we have the

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:37.430
move towards a world where we have the
 

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.510
move towards a world where we have the
correct set of signals and activity

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520
correct set of signals and activity
 

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.910
correct set of signals and activity
callbacks so that any interested

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920
callbacks so that any interested
 

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.570
callbacks so that any interested
component can be it that means that

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:45.580
component can be it that means that
 

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.040
component can be it that means that
fragments are not a special snowflake

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.050
fragments are not a special snowflake
 

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.980
fragments are not a special snowflake
anymore they're just another component

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:50.990
anymore they're just another component
 

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:53.860
anymore they're just another component
another tool in your toolbox using the

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:53.870
another tool in your toolbox using the
 

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:55.960
another tool in your toolbox using the
same composable hooks that you'd always

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:55.970
same composable hooks that you'd always
 

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.720
same composable hooks that you'd always
have so really trying to play well with

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:58.730
have so really trying to play well with
 

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.880
have so really trying to play well with
other components so that it's not an

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:00.890
other components so that it's not an
 

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.820
other components so that it's not an
either/or it's a both that we can work

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:03.830
either/or it's a both that we can work
 

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.620
either/or it's a both that we can work
together that you can use fragments

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:05.630
together that you can use fragments
 

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.110
together that you can use fragments
alongside other components and it just

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:08.120
alongside other components and it just
 

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:13.180
alongside other components and it just
works all right so options menus are of

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.190
works all right so options menus are of
 

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.670
works all right so options menus are of
course one other thing that we still

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680
course one other thing that we still
 

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.470
course one other thing that we still
don't have a great answer for this in

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480
don't have a great answer for this in
 

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.940
don't have a great answer for this in
terms of how we want to decouple this I

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:18.950
terms of how we want to decouple this I
 

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.800
terms of how we want to decouple this I
mean in a lot of ways I would like for

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:20.810
mean in a lot of ways I would like for
 

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.690
mean in a lot of ways I would like for
options menus just kind of as a concept

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:22.700
options menus just kind of as a concept
 

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.390
options menus just kind of as a concept
to be deprecated but for right now we

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400
to be deprecated but for right now we
 

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.010
to be deprecated but for right now we
still need to make sure that we meet all

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:27.020
still need to make sure that we meet all
 

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.630
still need to make sure that we meet all
those same use cases for when you do

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640
those same use cases for when you do
 

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.860
those same use cases for when you do
have common chrome or for when you're

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:29.870
have common chrome or for when you're
 

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:34.950
have common chrome or for when you're
paging through some different content

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960
 

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.770
