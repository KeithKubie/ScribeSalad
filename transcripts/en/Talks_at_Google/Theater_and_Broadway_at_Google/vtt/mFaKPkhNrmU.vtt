ALAN SEALES: Please
welcome Benjamin Scheuer.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.746
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.340
The show, my gosh,
I saw it last week.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.550
It was absolutely amazing.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.130
It was like this
unexpected journey

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.490
that I didn't expect to go on.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.010
I didn't have any
expectations going into it.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.350
But it's extremely personal.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.730
Extremely, I guess, exposed,
for lack of anything else.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.730
Because you talk about
some very serious things,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.870
like happy and sad.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.769
But actually, happy and
sad is very obvious, yes.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.310
But I actually want
to read something

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.700
from the website about the show.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.870
It says a good storyteller
uses everything he has.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.250
So Benjamin Scheuer uses his
guitar, actually six guitars,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.910
in "The Lion," a wholly original
downtown musical experience

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.230
that tells one man's
gripping coming-of-age story.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.730
The award-winning songwriter
inspires and disarms

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.932
with his raw wit,
emotional depth,

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.140
and leads you on a rock-and-roll
journey from boyhood

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.790
to manhood through pain
and healing to discover

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.319
the redemptive power of music.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.100
And that says it better
than obviously I ever could.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.561
But would you mind
playing us a little song

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.435
to get us started, the
beginning of the show?

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:12.850
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Sure.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.350
Yeah.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.360
This is how the show starts.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.403
There's no introduction.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.816
My father has an old guitar
and he plays me folk songs.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.744
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER, "COOKIE
 TIN BANJO"]

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:33.500
ALAN SEALES: So how
old were you when you

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.000
did get that cookie-tin banjo?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.200
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
About 2, 2 and 1/2.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.570
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.420
That young?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.378
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:40.340
I found a photo of
it recently, of me

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.210
playing my cookie-tin banjo.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.100
It's pretty cool.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.060
ALAN SEALES: Really.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.476
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I was
so excited to have it.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.330
ALAN SEALES: So, um,
I mean you really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.613
learned-- that's all- like
everything in the show

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:50.570
is a true story, right?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.028
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: It's a true
story, it's all a true story.

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:56.514
ALAN SEALES: And so I'm going
to kind of give a synopsis here.

00:03:56.514 --> 00:03:57.930
So you learned to
play instruments

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.762
from your dad growing up, the
relationship with your father.

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:02.220
I mean you're a
complete open book.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.880
So I'm sharing this
with the world.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.520
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Oh, yeah.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.980
Absolutely.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.771
ALAN SEALES: The
relationship with your dad

00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.840
doesn't go so well.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.424
He dies young.

00:04:07.424 --> 00:04:08.381
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.060
We get into a big
fight when I was 13.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.330
And then sort of--
before we had reconciled,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.630
a couple days later, he died
suddenly of a brain aneurysm.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.704
And I totally blamed
myself as a kid.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.370
I thought, oh, I
stressed my father out.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.078
And then he died.

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.490
It's completely my fault.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.300
Which is kind of
what you think when

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.758
you're 13 because the world
revolves around you when you're

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:27.120
13.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.411
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:32.120
So the song, I'm talking
about like the lyrics,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.250
it's not-- what I like
about your song so much is

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.280
that it's not the traditional
kind of pop song lyrics.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.866
Everything that comes out of
your mouth is telling a story.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.930
Like you go somewhere with
everything that you sing about.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.440
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Well, storytelling,

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.090
at least in theater,
is something

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.910
that I find really,
really fascinating.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.300
And the thing about
storytelling in musical theater

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.972
is if you tell a song that
stops the action completely,

00:04:59.972 --> 00:05:01.680
the audience is going
to be really bored.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.160
Your songs need
to be the action.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.330
They need to move the
story from point A

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.940
to point B. And
so one of the ways

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.330
to do that is to put something
in the present tense.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.790
Don't put it in the past tense.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.290
I could have said my
father had an old guitar

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.010
and he played me folk songs.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.540
But audiences are smart.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.210
And they know if I say, my
father has an old guitar

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.210
and he plays me folk songs, and
I'm singing as a 10-year-old,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.600
they get it, as a two-year-old,
as a five-year-old.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.511
People are smart.

00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:28.920
And in musical theater--
so this song is very much

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.840
a musical theater song in
the guise of a folk song

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.130
inasmuch as the first song
in any piece of theater

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.810
in a musical is,
"this is our world."

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.999
Like in "The Lion King,"
it's the "Circle of Life."

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.290
And this is the world we're in.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.780
We're in Africa.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.320
There's lions.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.990
There's elephants.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.220
Great.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.870
OK.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.290
And then usually the
second song in a show

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.910
is the main character's
"I want song."

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.570
"I Just Can't Wait to be King."

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.035
Or in "The Little
Mermaid," I want

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:54.160
to be where the people are.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.880
She says, "I want" in the
first line of the song.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.550
And so the first line
of "Cookie-tin Banjo"

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.830
is my father has an old guitar
and he plays me folk songs.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.330
OK.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.250
So there's a kid and his
dad, guitars, and folk music.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.750
Great.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.160
That's our world.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.500
First line, done, check.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.810
Easy.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.010
And the second line
is what's usually

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.340
the second song in a musical.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.080
It's the main character's
"I want song."

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.020
There is nothing I want
more than to play like him.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.570
OK, cool.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.550
So little Ben wants
to play like Dad.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.170
Off we go.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.440
And so I don't like
to waste words.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.040
Everybody's time is valuable.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.290
And so, yeah, each song
is very much a story.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.169
And I try to get
to things quick.

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:38.960
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.870
So you were playing-- like
I thought from the show,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.960
that you started it later.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.850
But you're saying that you
started when you were two.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.430
So like 2 to 13 is a long time.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.475
So you played with your
father for-- like how often?

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.850
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Yeah, 10 years.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.070
ALAN SEALES: And
your brothers too.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.200
Like, all of you played?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.158
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:55.970
I've two younger
brothers, Adam and Simon.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.460
And Adam played the drums.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.505
And Simon, who's 5 and
1/2 years younger than me,

00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:02.130
just kind of played
whatever we let him

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.220
because he was so little.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.570
ALAN SEALES: Played the blocks.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.528
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:07:05.528 --> 00:07:09.410
Now he's a killing songwriter,
writing songs professionally.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.380
But my dad played the bass
and played the guitar.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.570
And Simon would also
kind of play the piano

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.404
and play the guitar.

00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:16.778
And we'd all play
music together.

00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:18.960
And that's the way that
my father and I got along.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.090
Because otherwise we'd
didn't get along so great.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.970
Because he was super academic.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.500
He went to Harvard and then
Columbia Law School, really,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.270
really bright.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.970
And all I ever wanted
to do was play music.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.752
But I kind of sucked
at everything else.

00:07:30.752 --> 00:07:32.210
ALAN SEALES: Because
he knew maths.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.500
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: He
was very good at maths.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.749
Which they call math in England.

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:38.540
ALAN SEALES: Because
your mother's British.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.498
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:42.660
Mom grew up in London and
Dad grew up in New York.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.160
And Mom moved to New York
when she was in her 20s.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.380
And she and my father met.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.820
And then when my father
died, when I was 13,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.160
my mother moved our
family back to England.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.690
And I went to an all-boys
boarding school, where

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.410
I studied music and English.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.730
But they made me study math,
which I really sucked at.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.790
And I was a pretty
angry teenager.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.510
I was frustrated with my mom
for being sad all the time.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.917
That was really nice
of me, wasn't it?

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:10.500
ALAN SEALES: It's
nice to throw blame.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.640
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.840
Absolutely.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.860
And I felt this
responsibility that I

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.630
had to look after my
two little brothers.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.000
But I had no idea how I
was supposed to do that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.520
I was just a kid.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.512
And so I got back to New York as
soon as I finished high school,

00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:25.720
sort of as quick as possible.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.714
And was playing gigs.

00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:29.630
Actually, I had a residency
right around here.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.796
There's was this club on
14th Street, between Eighth

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:33.145
and Ninth, called Rare.

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.544
It was a short-lived,
really awful place.

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:37.960
And I played there with my
rock-and-roll band sort of once

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.860
a week.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.659
And it was great fun.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.350
But then I met a
girl, which was nice.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.870
And she kind of took
me from feeling sad,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.920
to feeling a little understood.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.294
And her name was Julia.

00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:54.210
ALAN SEALES: Is this
leading into a song here?

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.960
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I'm going
to lead into a song, yeah.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.770
See how I did that?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.760
And Julia and I had a great
relationship until we didn't.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.760
And then we stayed together
for 6 and 1/2 years.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:18.160
And eventually she told me
that she-- well, her parents

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.390
had an affair.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.590
Her mother had an affair.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.710
And so Julia started to see
sex as something shameful that

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.280
ruins relationships.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.380
And so we had sex less and less.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.489
And I asked her
what is going on?

00:09:30.489 --> 00:09:32.780
And she didn't want to talk
about it because she didn't

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.830
want to betray her mother.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.397
So Julia and I
talked less and less.

00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:39.480
And I started to feel ill.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.771
And I was losing weight and
sweating through my sheets.

00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:45.620
And the left side of my lower
back hurt when I drank alcohol.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.070
And then Julia told
me she wants to go

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.550
on a trip around the world
by herself, without me.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.236
And we don't
mention breaking up.

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:55.000
And I tell her
I'll wait for you.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.220
I'll be lonely when you go.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.550
And she says, Ben, you're
the loneliest person I know.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.574
Even if I stay,
you'll be lonely.

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:06.410
I said where exactly are
you planning on going?

00:10:09.626 --> 00:10:11.500
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER,
 "INVISIBLE CITIES"]

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.446
And off she goes.

00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:56.640
And I really love her.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.490
And things have gotten so
bad between the two of us

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.710
that if what she needs
is to figure herself out,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.310
away from me, then that's
what she should do.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.460
I don't hear from
her for a long time.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.315
And then I get an email.

00:11:13.616 --> 00:11:15.490
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER,
 "INVISIBLE CITIES"]

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.460
So Julia never comes home.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.140
And that song came out of
my trying to understand why.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.310
And so I wrote it
from her perspective.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.470
And I find that oftentimes
writing from somebody else's

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.980
perspective allows me to sort
of figure out that perspective

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.590
a little bit more and appreciate
where they're coming from.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.122
And the same is true for
writing from my own perspective.

00:13:26.122 --> 00:13:27.580
I was told by a
songwriting teacher

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.620
once the best piece
of songwriting advice

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.240
I'd ever gotten, which is if
you want to write a good song,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.020
write what you don't want
other people to know about you.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.690
And if you want to
write a great song,

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.060
write what you don't want
to know about yourself.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.430
And so writing for me is very
much discovery and exploration.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.185
And whenever my pen hesitates
above the page, and I'm like,

00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:50.250
ah, fuck, I absolutely
cannot say that.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.410
I don't want people
to know that about me.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.140
They won't like me.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.094
They won't want to
hang out with me.

00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:57.260
That's where I try to start.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.810
So you guys want to
write some tunes?

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.080
Write down the one thing
you don't want anybody

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.224
to know about you.

00:14:03.224 --> 00:14:03.890
And start there.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.480
And I promise you the first
time you do it, it's terrifying.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.989
But if you do it every
day for three months,

00:14:07.989 --> 00:14:09.530
it'll just be your
job after a while.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.863
And it'll stop being that scary.

00:14:10.863 --> 00:14:12.960
And also you'll realize
that the thing you're

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.430
so frightened about, if you
show it to somebody else,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.180
thinking they'll never
speak to you again,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.692
they'll very possibly
say, oh, me too.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.895
And I can't tell you
how good that feels.

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.630
To think the thing you think
is the worst thing about you.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.030
And realize that, in
fact, somebody connects

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.130
to you because of that.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.050
That's pretty awesome.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.530
ALAN SEALES: And that happens--
that happens after your show,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:31.840
right?

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.631
Like you'll have people
have come up to you

00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:36.045
and they'll say like, oh,
yeah, that happened to me too.

00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:37.420
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Oh, it's great.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.961
The best compliment
I can get is when

00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:42.434
somebody says, hey, man, your
story is just like my story.

00:14:42.434 --> 00:14:44.100
And then they tell
me the story that has

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.370
nothing to do with my story.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.280
My mother moved to Tennessee
with my dad's canoe.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.810
And like my dad and I
used to canoe together.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.462
And I couldn't work out
why this was happening.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.670
And I think I have an answer.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.620
I think it's not that the stuff
that happens to us is the same.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.370
It's that we pretty
much feel the same way

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.994
about the stuff that
does happen to us.

00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:05.800
So like we feel alone.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.890
We feel lost.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.520
We feel loved.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.017
We feel understood by
other people, by ourselves.

00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:13.350
ALAN SEALES: Especially,
yeah-- in a city like New York,

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.724
it's like there's
so many people.

00:15:14.724 --> 00:15:18.740
It's so easy to get like lost
up in the shuffle of anonymity.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.420
I mean, do you find the
process of songwriting,

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.580
and these people come
up to you, and whatnot,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.410
is it more therapeutic for you
and for them, do you think?

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.320
Like just to talk about
things that you're

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.621
so afraid to mention publicly.

00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:32.120
And then have like
total acceptance.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.828
People like, oh, yeah,
he's a songwriter.

00:15:33.828 --> 00:15:34.790
It's cool.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.510
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
To feel that-- I

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.830
mean I really try to do
away with guilt and shame

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.830
and feeling bad for
the stuff that I want

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.990
and feeling bad for the
stuff that has happened.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.740
And worrying that people
are not going to like me

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.240
or are going to think that I'm
strange or think that I look,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.520
or sound, or feel weird.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.740
Because we all feel that way.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.760
And it's just fucking tiring.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.780
It's tiring to not-- to
sort of put up a front.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.770
And New York can very
much be that kind of city.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.230
When I go hear songwriters
who I feel tell their truth,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.224
and they're not showing
how hip they are,

00:16:07.224 --> 00:16:08.890
they're just showing
how human they are,

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.279
that's what I connect
to as a listener.

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:13.570
I don't need you to be the
coolest person in the world.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.800
But I'd appreciate it if
you're the most honest person.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.860
Because then I feel
like actually we

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.860
can have a conversation.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.270
And I can come up to
you and talk to you.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.650
And getting to
play the show for,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.600
for I guess the theater I'm in
right now is about 220 people.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.640
And so it's a really
lovely little space.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.580
ALAN SEALES: The Lynn
Redgrave Theater?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:29.750
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.041
It's the Lynn Redgrave Theater.

00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:32.680
It's on Bleecker and Lafayette.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.327
And I play six
shows a week there.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:35.660
I'm off on Mondays and Tuesdays.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.180
And then I play on Wednesday
and Thursday, and then Friday,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.302
and two shows on Saturday,
and a show on Sunday.

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.510
And the only thing that
really changes night to night

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.770
is the audience.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.060
And different people
react differently.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.895
And I can pretty much
only see the front row

00:16:50.895 --> 00:16:52.520
because I'm not
wearing my eye glasses.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.353
It's just like here.

00:16:53.353 --> 00:16:56.280
I can see you all
in the front row.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.620
And they become my
cast members inasmuch

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.610
as I react to what
they're reacting to.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.090
And I take the pace off of them.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.280
And I'll sing different
things to different people.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.308
And then I'll chill
with people afterwards.

00:17:07.308 --> 00:17:09.849
Actually the other day somebody
was sitting in the front row,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:10.700
just like texting.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.195
And I couldn't--
but in a theater.

00:17:12.195 --> 00:17:14.819
And I couldn't tell if they were
like really psyched and really

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.193
wanted to text or that just
had never been to the theater

00:17:17.193 --> 00:17:17.693
before.

00:17:17.693 --> 00:17:19.193
And didn't know
that you're probably

00:17:19.193 --> 00:17:20.950
supposed to turn it
off in a theater show.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.030
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.089
So we haven't gotten
to like the real meat

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.510
and potatoes of the show,
which I guess, spoiler alert.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.210
Spoiler-- he gets cancer,
which is not a fun thing.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.060
Thanks for laughing.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.689
Yeah.

00:17:34.689 --> 00:17:36.730
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: It just
gets better and better.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.896
ALAN SEALES: It gets better.

00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:38.870
The show is amazing.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.740
So you get cancer.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.740
You beat cancer.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.740
You talk about all this.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.340
But we'll talk about that
separately in a moment.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.960
But I want to talk about like,
doing it, what did you say,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960
six times a week, right?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.918
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:17:48.918 --> 00:17:51.660
ALAN SEALES: So this is a
hugely deep, personal journey

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.160
that you are just
putting out there.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.850
You're sharing with these
220 people every night.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.120
I mean do you go to the
same place in your mind

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.470
every night to dig up-- I
guess, for lack of anything

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.670
better to say-- inspiration for
giving a fresh performance all

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.220
the time?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.270
Or does it become tiring
reliving this all the time?

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.410
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Well, it's a
different kind of reliving in

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.360
that when I-- so I was diagnosed
with stage four Hodgkin's

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.490
lymphoma, all these sweating
through my sheets at night,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.037
and my losing 25 pounds, and
the pain in the left side

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.620
of my lower back
when I drank alcohol,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.090
those were all
symptoms of cancer.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.610
And in my case, it was
advanced stage cancer.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.240
And when I was ill, I had
no control over my life.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.050
I had no control at all.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.540
But when I write a song, it
allows me to take a bad thing

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.060
and turn it into a good thing.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.240
I can go from feeling
really, really alone

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.790
and feel connected directly.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.850
And writing allows
me to be an alchemist

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.370
in that I can take
something bad, cancer,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.440
and I can turn it into a
song, which is something good.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.190
And so that to me is
really extraordinary.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.550
I think there's really
a great amount of value

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.976
in telling the truth, in
telling the truth in art,

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:06.850
in telling the truth in
art about bad things.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.670
I promise, tell the truth
in art about bad things

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.910
and you'll be doing
something good.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.980
And so every night
it feels different

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.100
because I get to control cancer.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.410
Cancer is not controlling me.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.050
There's a part in the show
where I sing as cancer.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.910
I take on the sort of character
of cancer and sing as cancer.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.322
And it's totally terrifying
when I first wrote it.

00:19:26.322 --> 00:19:28.280
But just like if you do
something enough times,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.990
it becomes strengthening.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.170
Also it's a happy end--
like he lives at the end.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.010
He lives.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.130
It feels lovely to be
able to take bad things

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.680
and turn them into good things.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.167
I think it's really a special
thing about song writing.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:47.000
ALAN SEALES: So you
recently gave a TED Talk

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.480
where you discussed exactly
making good things out of bad,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.426
right?

00:19:50.426 --> 00:19:51.384
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:52.247
I did.

00:19:52.247 --> 00:19:53.080
It was TEDxBroadway.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.220
So there's a sort of
Bohemian Rhapsody of cancer

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.880
in the middle of the show.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.190
I'll play a little bit
of it for you guys.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.085
So the way I found
out I had cancer

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:10.560
is I was losing all this
weight and feeling really ill.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.246
And I was running through
Grand Central Station

00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:15.151
and I slipped and I fell.

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:15.900
It was wintertime.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.000
It was December 2010.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.560
And I spent the next day in
bed, banged up and bruised.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.200
The following day,
I go to my doctor,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.480
who sends me for some X-rays.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.250
And when we sit down to discuss
the results of these X-rays,

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.920
he looks serious.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.410
He looked scared.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.640
And he says, listen Ben,
you broke your pubic bone

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.364
in the three places.

00:20:38.364 --> 00:20:39.780
And the reason you
did is you have

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.460
lytic lesions in your pelvis.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.775
I said lytic-- I don't
know what that is.

00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:51.650
And he said something's
eating your bones.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.694
So what, like a good kind
of an eating, like a--

00:20:54.694 --> 00:20:56.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.160
And they send me for more tests.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.500
And the following day, I
sat down with an oncologist.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.560
And I'm expecting him to
say, listen kid, you're fine.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.726
You got holes in your bones.

00:21:03.726 --> 00:21:05.510
You got to drink
more chocolate milk.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.195
But instead, he asks me, have
you lost 25 pounds lately?

00:21:09.195 --> 00:21:10.570
And I said yeah.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.490
He said have you been sweating
through your sheets at night?

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.880
Yeah.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.979
And he said, do you have pain
in the left side of your lower

00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:20.145
back when you drink alcohol?

00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:24.880
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER, "THE
 CURE"]

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.556
And so I did six
months of chemotherapy,

00:22:07.556 --> 00:22:12.560
which is once every two
weeks, 12 doses, from February

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.010
to July 2011.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.220
And then--

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.900
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER, "THE
 CURE"]

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.250
And when I learned that
I was cured of cancer,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.840
I called my mother
and my brothers,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.280
who had come back from
England to look after me.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.679
And then I wasn't sure
what I was supposed to do.

00:23:18.679 --> 00:23:20.470
And I learned something
really interesting,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.780
which is 85% of people who are
successfully cured of cancer

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.174
suffer from depression.

00:23:25.174 --> 00:23:27.090
And it seems kind of
head scratching at first.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.770
But the thing about
it is you're working

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:33.340
towards this extraordinary
goal, which is not dying.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.870
And you have this crazy
medical treatment.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.549
And everybody is around
you and rooting for you.

00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:42.090
And then they tell
your you're cured.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.580
And they're like
OK, you're good.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.270
And you feel as sick as you've
ever felt in your entire life

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.060
because you've been pumped
full of poison-- which

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.620
is what chemotherapy is-- for
the last, I mean in my case,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.820
it was six months.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.760
But everybody's
like, you're good.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.176
And then they all
kind of go home.

00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:58.680
And they're all fine and
they're not worried anymore.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.960
And so I thought,
well, what can I do?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.886
And I started writing.

00:24:04.886 --> 00:24:06.010
I started writing about it.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:10.760
I started telling other
people about what it was like.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.900
And it didn't seem at
the time that maybe there

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.620
was value to it.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.950
And sometimes it felt stupid.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.600
And sometimes it felt like
it was kind of pointless.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.620
But I carried on and
I wrote about it.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.964
And I'd really taken the
worst thing in my life

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:26.380
and turned it into
what has become

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.950
the best thing in my life.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.900
I made this record
of these songs.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.580
And I started playing the
record around little coffee

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.220
shops in New York, just sort
of 10, 20 people at a time.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.650
I made the record with
my band, Escapist Papers.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.660
And the song was
called "The Bridge."

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.210
And the way this show
came about at all

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.880
is I just didn't
know what I was going

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.742
to say between these songs.

00:24:46.742 --> 00:24:47.700
And so I wrote it down.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.970
And I figured I'd memorize it.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.094
And I wouldn't tell people
I'd memorized what I was

00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:52.692
going to say between the songs.

00:24:52.692 --> 00:24:54.650
I wanted to be able to
connect the tunes to one

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.382
another better, to be able to
frame each song more clearly.

00:24:58.382 --> 00:24:59.340
And so I wrote it down.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.370
And then I had a
script and a score.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.982
And that's basically a musical.

00:25:02.982 --> 00:25:04.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.310
And so I was invited as
a writer-in-residence

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.840
to the Goodspeed Theater.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.842
It's up in Connecticut.

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.050
It's a developmental theater.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:13.883
It's basically a nice
little college campus.

00:25:13.883 --> 00:25:17.460
You get a house and a kitchen.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.700
And they pay you to write.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.660
And I told them I was
working on a musical.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.090
It was not a
musical at the time.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.340
It was just these songs.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.070
And living next door
to me were the guys

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.820
who wrote another show
called "Urinetown."

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.240
It was Mark Hollmann
and Greg Kotis.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.029
These Tony award-winning
writers, really extraordinary,

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:36.070
sort of senior members of
the Broadway community.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.920
And they were
developing a new show

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.940
with their director
Sean Daniels.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.350
And so we all became buddies.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.170
And I got invited-- this
was January of 2012.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.525
And then-- is that right?

00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:50.025
Yeah.

00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:51.740
January of-- no January of 2013.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.980
God, it was just four
years ago-- three years,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.930
two years ago.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.328
Ah-- math.

00:25:56.328 --> 00:25:57.119
ALAN SEALES: Maths.

00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:58.085
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I'm
not good at maths.

00:25:58.085 --> 00:25:58.876
ALAN SEALES: Maths.

00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:00.720
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
2013, two years ago.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.480
All right.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.090
And I got invited to this
other developmental theater

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:06.192
in April 2013, in Vermont.

00:26:06.192 --> 00:26:08.150
And the guy in Vermont
said, man, why don't you

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:08.945
bring a director?

00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:11.070
You need another pair of
ears, another pair of eyes

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.500
to help you out.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.940
And so I called
the only director

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.310
I knew or really ever heard
of, this guy Sean Daniels.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.060
And I asked if he could
recommend a young director

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.410
for me to work with?

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.020
Because I figured Daniels,
himself, was way--

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.880
he was-- way out of my league.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.590
And he very kindly
made three suggestions

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.000
for three different directors.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.475
And he said for what it's worth
kid, I'll direct your show.

00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.270
I like your songs.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.020
You're a cool guy.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.590
And I said, how would that
work, your directing my show?

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.311
He's like what do you mean?

00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:42.270
I was like-- what?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.740
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.280
How would it work?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.488
How would you direct my show?

00:26:45.488 --> 00:26:47.970
He's like oh, Ben, you
don't have a show, man.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.030
You have like four songs.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.470
And you're probably
going to cut two of them.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.300
What I'd help you do is make the
thing you really want to make.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.260
I'd help you outline the piece.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:04.160
And we'll put scenes on white
cards and songs on blue cards.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.681
And I never heard
of this before.

00:27:05.681 --> 00:27:07.430
And we'll tell the
story you want to tell.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.710
And I'll tell you
when it's boring.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.168
And I'll tell you
when it's stupid.

00:27:10.168 --> 00:27:12.200
And I'll tell you
when it's confusing.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.200
And this seemed sort of
overly simplistic to me.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.910
But man, I promise you, if you
get rid of boring, and stupid,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.970
and confusing, your
thing is so much better.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.023
Boy, oh boy.

00:27:20.023 --> 00:27:20.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.339
And so we took the show to
the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:27:24.339 --> 00:27:25.630
I applied without telling Sean.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.520
And I was like Sean, we
got a gig for the show.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.240
It's going to be great.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240
And he said where is it?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.181
And I was like it's in Scotland.

00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:33.350
He was like why would
we go to Scotland?

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.965
And there are 3,000
pieces of theater

00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:36.340
out there in the
Fringe Festival.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.480
It's the biggest theater
festival in the world.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.810
And we went.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.120
And the show was still
called "The Bridge"

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.050
at that point, named
after the record.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.820
And so I staged the show,
one chair, three guitars,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.050
no light cues-- no
guitar microphone,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.580
just a vocal microphone.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.593
And I sat in the chair.

00:27:51.593 --> 00:27:53.672
And I performed to sort
of 20 people a night.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.380
And then we won the
award for best lyrics

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.540
in the whole Fringe Festival.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.310
And then a theater
in London called.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.770
And they said, why don't
you put the show up?

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.600
We'd love to do that.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.100
And then a theater in New York
called, the Manhattan Theater

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.240
Club, based at City Center.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.090
And they're an amazing theater.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.140
And they sat me down and they
were like we to do your show.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.160
We're going to put a
lot of money behind it.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.730
We're going to do
whatever you want.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.170
The thing is we like working
with directors that we know.

00:28:18.784 --> 00:28:20.200
So that's how we're
going to work.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.440
And I said, guys, I
couldn't agree more.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.500
I like working with
directors I know, too.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.510
So we're going to work
with Sean on this piece.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.130
And it wasn't out of some
false idea of loyalty.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.117
He's the right guy for the job.

00:28:35.117 --> 00:28:36.200
And so we worked with him.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.330
And we put the show
up in New York.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.380
And it sold out.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.364
And we went to London
and played it there.

00:28:42.364 --> 00:28:44.280
And now I'm back at the
Lynn Redgrave Theater.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.710
And it's been a really
extraordinary journey.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.150
It's been really, really cool.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.399
And it just came out of
playing in these little coffee

00:28:51.399 --> 00:28:52.640
shops on Cornelius Street.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.181
ALAN SEALES: Did
you imagine the show

00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:57.180
would be met with the
critical success that it is?

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.440
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I thought that
maybe some people would dig it.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.060
I was just trying to tell
the truth as hard as I could.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.820
But I try not to
worry about critics

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.490
because I mean nobody ever
put up a statue to a critic.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.490
ALAN SEALES: Well, yeah.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.690
So every night you have these
complete strangers there,

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.770
coming in night after night.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.480
Are you over, I
guess, impersonal

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.500
aspect of playing to strangers?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.840
Do you feel like it's
you and them on stage?

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.790
Or is it just you and
you're in your head

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.040
and you're telling the story,
reliving it every night?

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.145
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:29:28.145 --> 00:29:29.590
It doesn't seem
impersonal at all.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.300
It never seems impersonal.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:39.570
So I really try to-- every
night try to tell the story more

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.180
simply and more honestly.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.700
Just like as if your best
friend introduced you

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.790
to some friend of his
that you never met.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:49.030
And you're hanging out,
the three of you guys.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.180
And you're telling a
story to that person.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.050
Like that's what it feels like.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:52.490
That's how I try
to make it feel.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.470
I'm just kind of talking.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.229
I do try to write songs
that feel like I'm

00:29:57.229 --> 00:29:58.270
talking when I'm singing.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.426
I'm not a singer really.

00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:01.800
I like writing
for other singers.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.990
But when I sing, I try to
write the melody the way

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.120
that I would talk because
then it's easier for me.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.359
Like I can't sing
big Broadway notes.

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:13.400
I could never be in anybody
else's musical truly.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.100
Because I'm not an actor
and I'm not a singer.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.120
I can just kind of tell my
story and play a little guitar.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.120
ALAN SEALES: So
going back to cancer.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.200
So you worked with
a photographer.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.280
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.480
ALAN SEALES: Riya Lerner, right?

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.980
Yeah.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.030
So she took your
picture once a week

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.650
when you were
getting chemotherapy.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:34.897
And it turned into this book.

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:35.855
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:30:35.855 --> 00:30:40.655
I made a book to raise money for
the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.

00:30:40.655 --> 00:30:42.510
It's a foundation,
a cancer charity

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.190
that's very close to my heart.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.605
And Riya photographed
me once a week.

00:30:46.605 --> 00:30:48.480
That was the first photo
she ever took of me.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.660
I was very, very, very ill.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:56.130
And so on my left pectoral
muscle they put a little tube,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.610
an IV insertion
point right there,

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.565
that had a tube, that went
up over my collar bone

00:30:59.565 --> 00:31:01.440
and under my ribs and
directly into my heart.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.230
And so that's how
chemotherapy works.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.854
I mean I was so
desperately thin.

00:31:07.854 --> 00:31:09.270
But the problem
with New York City

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.100
is when you're kind of 25 pounds
underweight and gauntly skinny,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.225
people will come up to you
and be like, oh, my god,

00:31:14.225 --> 00:31:15.267
you look amazing.

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:17.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.390
Yeah.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.540
And so Riya came and
photographed me once a week

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.540
with an old '70s
Rolleiflex camera.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.497
And we documented
this little journey.

00:31:26.497 --> 00:31:28.080
And the terrifying
thing was we didn't

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.860
know what the end of the
story was going to be.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.401
We didn't know if the last photo
was going to be a gravestone

00:31:32.401 --> 00:31:33.830
or whatever.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.920
Or if it was going to be
kind of thumbs up, like yeah.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.930
And so I kept a journal.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.670
And Riya photographed me.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.970
And I learned a lot
from photography

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.347
about songwriting
inasmuch as a photo really

00:31:46.347 --> 00:31:47.430
should be about one thing.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.380
It should be very simple.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.213
And you should get rid
of all the cluttering

00:31:50.213 --> 00:31:51.214
stuff that's in the way.

00:31:51.214 --> 00:31:52.671
And it should have
one focal point.

00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:54.220
And the focal point
isn't necessarily

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.230
what the photo is about.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.647
Meaning you can write a song
about one thing seemingly,

00:31:58.647 --> 00:32:00.230
but it's actually
about another thing.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.530
And so I learned a lot
about just art in general

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.505
from Riya and from her
extraordinarily keen eye.

00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:08.130
I think we've got a
couple more images.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.755
Yeah, that's a pretty
gruesome picture.

00:32:09.755 --> 00:32:11.740
That's what
chemotherapy looks like.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.950
There's a needle in
the IV insertion point.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.140
And what's in the
syringe at that moment

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:23.470
is Adriamycin, which is a
very, very potent, very mean

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.990
chemotherapeutic drug.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.094
And it's got sort of the
consistency of jello.

00:32:27.094 --> 00:32:27.760
It's very thick.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.000
And it burns.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.750
You can feel it like
going into your heart

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:39.000
and burning, which is real
fun, let me tell you, real fun.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.490
And then every
few months I would

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.380
get what's called a PET scan.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.850
And a PET scan is how
cancer is tested for.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.620
So cancer is basically a problem
of growth, of reproduction.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.770
Cancer cells are cells
that grow way too fast.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.990
And so when you get a PET
scan, which is a cancer scan,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.750
you're injected with a
radioactive glucose that

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.104
attaches itself to your cells.

00:32:58.104 --> 00:32:59.520
And then you go
into this machine,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.980
this machine over here.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.230
And the machine sees how fast
the cells are reproducing.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.855
And so it's pretty
amazing technologically.

00:33:07.855 --> 00:33:09.480
And one thing that
I sort of discovered

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.380
is the first PET scan I
got took about 45 minutes.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.387
The last PET scan I got
took about 20 minutes

00:33:15.387 --> 00:33:17.470
just because the computer
technology had improved.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.825
And when I go back now, they
take about five minutes.

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:20.190
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.146
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: It's
pretty amazing, yeah,

00:33:22.146 --> 00:33:26.670
how these technological
advances in data processing

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.430
affects all kinds of stuff,
including cancer treatment.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.935
ALAN SEALES: So obviously we
know the end of the story.

00:33:32.935 --> 00:33:34.060
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: He lives.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.359
He lives.

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.150
By the way that book,
"Between Two Spaces,"

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.931
you can check it out at
betweentwospaces.com.

00:33:39.931 --> 00:33:42.640
And all the proceeds go to the
Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.485
It's a good cause.

00:33:43.485 --> 00:33:44.943
ALAN SEALES: It's
a very nice book.

00:33:44.943 --> 00:33:47.759
How did you get connected
with her in the first place?

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.300
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
I wrote to a cousin

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.500
of mine, who is a photographer.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.350
And I asked her who would
be good for this project?

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:56.554
And she recommended Riya.

00:33:56.554 --> 00:33:58.470
And I actually interviewed
some photographers.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.370
And the first photographer
I interviewed came over

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.750
and she's like, I'm so sorry
to hear what's going on.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.980
I was like, no, no, no, no.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.480
I don't need your
sympathy, darling.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.524
Like this is an art project.

00:34:08.524 --> 00:34:09.940
I've got my friends
and my family.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.214
Thank you.

00:34:11.214 --> 00:34:12.630
And I told Riya
about the project.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.460
And she's like this
sounds awesome.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.500
I want to work on this.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.389
We can make something cool.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.199
And I dug her dedication.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:25.739
And that she kept
impersonal in a way that

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:29.054
ultimately allowed us to be
very, very close friends.

00:34:29.054 --> 00:34:30.929
She could kind of
disappear and take a photo,

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.469
to the point where
I wouldn't notice.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.760
Like I'd be going about my day.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.239
I'd get into the shower, be
like floating in the bathtub.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.310
And we have a sort of very
fascinating relationship

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:45.372
because the intimacy of being
there, photographing my body.

00:34:45.372 --> 00:34:47.330
And what we thought it
was going to be was just

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.496
she would take a nude
portrait of me the whole time.

00:34:49.496 --> 00:34:51.360
And we'd just see
how the body changed.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.620
But we realized that
actually cancer affects life

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.639
in all kinds of ways that
you could never anticipate.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.080
And one of those ways
was that clothing

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.795
took on this really
powerful meaning for me.

00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:04.920
Because kind of one of the
only things that I could

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.790
do on any given day that I had
any control over at all was get

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.630
dressed.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.130
And then when you
go to your doctor,

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.910
you're in like the
green gown thing.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:18.660
And you feel sort of half of a
person and you're dehumanized.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.960
And so clothing became control.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.150
It became armor.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.494
And that still
sticks with me today.

00:35:26.494 --> 00:35:28.410
ALAN SEALES: So I want
to digress for a second

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.070
and talk about your custom,
wonderful custom suit here.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.687
It's a little bit
lopsided, right?

00:35:32.687 --> 00:35:33.645
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:35:33.645 --> 00:35:37.010
It is lopsided because
it's cut to play guitar in.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.247
So this right arm is
cut to go like this.

00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:40.830
The left arm is cut
to hold like this.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.750
And the left leg of the
trousers is moving around

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.930
because I move this leg,
but not my right leg.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.120
My guitar sits right here.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.710
So it's cut asymmetrically.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.810
And that actually comes from
military and hunting tailoring,

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.290
when you cut a jacket
to hold like this.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.950
The British tailors
get it right.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.700
They get it right.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.866
ALAN SEALES: Because they
hunt in Britain, more than

00:36:03.866 --> 00:36:05.010
in the US?

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.170
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Well, the
fellow who makes the clothes--

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.405
ALAN SEALES: Gun control.

00:36:09.405 --> 00:36:12.030
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: The fellow who
makes the clothes for the show

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.196
is a guy called Kirk Miller.

00:36:13.196 --> 00:36:16.180
And he makes the most fabulous
suits, really, really beautiful

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:16.680
stuff.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.730
And he runs a shop called
Miller's Oath, which

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.146
is on Spring and
Greenwich Street,

00:36:20.146 --> 00:36:22.960
just down in the
western part of Soho.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.820
And I mean really, really rad,
beautiful, beautiful clothing.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.340
And in the show, I
wear a mic in my hair.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.230
You can't see it.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.063
But just so when I'm
kind of walking around.

00:36:33.063 --> 00:36:36.010
As so I wear this bra that
has like microphone wireless

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:40.167
things sitting behind my jacket.

00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:41.750
And so the jacket
is cut and the shirt

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.420
is cut to sort of
accommodate it at all.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.295
It's all very tricky.

00:36:44.295 --> 00:36:47.567
It's all made to look like I'm
sitting in your living room,

00:36:47.567 --> 00:36:48.900
but with better lighting design.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.510
ALAN SEALES: And six guitars.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.468
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:36:51.468 --> 00:36:52.282
Absolutely.

00:36:52.282 --> 00:36:53.490
ALAN SEALES: Why six guitars?

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.517
I mean you've got two here.

00:36:55.517 --> 00:36:57.100
You've only played
one of them so far.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.650
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.040
ALAN SEALES: Obviously,
we got more songs to come.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.070
But why six?

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.570
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
I play six guitars

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.460
because a lot of the songs
require different tunings.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.960
And what I mean by
different tunings

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.560
is I tune the guitar
to a different chord.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.320
And this one right here
is tuned C, G, D, G, C, E.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.780
And having different
chords allow

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.570
for different textures,
different tonalities,

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.710
different voicings.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.199
This guitar to my left that
I'll play in a little bit,

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:27.740
I play two songs in
the show with it.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:35.466
This one is tuned to D, A, D, D,
A, D. And so you can do stuff.

00:37:35.466 --> 00:37:38.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.670
We were talking earlier and you
asked me about the guitar part

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.450
in that first song
"Cookie-tin Banjo"

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:53.840
and why do I have six guitars?

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.830
Well, I like to try
and use each guitar

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.350
as sort of a few different
instruments at once.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.513
In the "Cookie-tin
Banjo," the melody goes--

00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:03.928
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.275
And the baseline goes--

00:38:10.275 --> 00:38:12.215
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:16.095 --> 00:38:18.578
And so together
that sounds like--

00:38:18.578 --> 00:38:20.998
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.460
And if you do that
and you put chords

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.302
in between the bass and the
melody, it sounds like this.

00:38:30.302 --> 00:38:32.286
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.636
And there's an electric guitar
for a couple of the songs

00:38:40.636 --> 00:38:42.010
that I play as an
angry teenager.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.090
It's a '72 Goldtop Les Paul.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.560
It's a really rad guitar.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.260
There's a guitar that plays
the role of dad's old guitar.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:53.217
And that's a 1929 Martin O-18.

00:38:53.217 --> 00:38:54.800
This one over here
is a Froggy Bottom.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.050
They're made in Vermont.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.540
And they build about
100 guitars a year.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.390
And this one was built for me.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.200
My brothers got it for me
as a 30th birthday present.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.970
It's Adirondack spruce up
top, walnut back and sides.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.920
And I don't know-- you
probably can't see.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.270
But there's a little
watercolor of a lion painted

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.520
on the heel of the neck there.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.660
It's pretty awesome.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.035
ALAN SEALES: So
I expect everyone

00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:26.070
to be able to play because he
gave you such direct lessons.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.540
So do you ever talk
to your ex-girlfriend

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.610
about any of this?

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.260
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Julia.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.051
Do I talk to Julia?

00:39:31.051 --> 00:39:33.250
Well, she plays a pretty
prominent role in the show.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.732
And she did write to me when
the show opened in New York

00:39:37.732 --> 00:39:39.440
last summer at the
Manhattan Theater Club

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.450
to wish me well and
congratulations,

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.310
which was very cool of her.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.290
Beyond that, no, we don't talk.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:46.790
ALAN SEALES: What
about your family,

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.060
are they still in London?

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.601
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
They are in London.

00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:51.499
Actually Simon, my
brother Simon was in town.

00:39:51.499 --> 00:39:53.540
And he came to see "The
Lion" a couple weeks ago,

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.970
the same night that Bruce
Willis came to see it.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:00.492
And Bruce took me and Simon
out to get sushi at Nobu.

00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:01.200
It was very cool.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.510
And he was telling me he's
about to do a Broadway

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.450
play in the fall.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.260
And so we were just
kind of talking

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.180
about the intimacy of acting
in a really small room.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.930
But at the end of this
show, ultimately he

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.580
decided that he was going
to come play the character

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.364
Ben in my musical.

00:40:16.364 --> 00:40:18.780
And I decided I was going to
go be an international action

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.832
superhero.

00:40:19.832 --> 00:40:20.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:22.740
ALAN SEALES: How is
that working out so far?

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.156
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
I got the boots.

00:40:24.156 --> 00:40:26.342
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.342 --> 00:40:27.883
ALAN SEALES: So your
fingers-- I mean

00:40:27.883 --> 00:40:29.133
I just love watching you play.

00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:31.490
I'm talking way less than
I should as a moderator.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.000
But I just love when
your fingers just start

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.466
moving at the speed of light.

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:36.632
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Thank you.

00:40:36.632 --> 00:40:38.260
ALAN SEALES: Did that come
about sort of naturally

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.593
as you developed your own style?

00:40:39.593 --> 00:40:42.170
Or were you ever trying
to emulate like the power

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.520
chords on the radio?

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.960
And you're like, ah, this
is just really boring,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.840
degern, degern, degern.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.798
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:40:46.798 --> 00:40:48.850
I wanted to learn to play
like Eddie Van Halen.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.330
ALAN SEALES: Oh, really.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:49.630
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Oh, yeah.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.170
Absolutely.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:52.810
And so I practiced six
to eight hours a day

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.875
to learn to do all the acrobatic
and crazy technical stuff

00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:57.500
for the guitar.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.200
I really wanted to see what
the guitar was capable of.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.290
And it was cool to do all
that stuff technically.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.914
But I came to the
horrifying conclusion

00:41:03.914 --> 00:41:06.280
that Eddie Van Halen already
plays like Eddie Van Halen.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.080
And he's pretty good at it.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.870
So if I was going to
figure out how to play,

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.970
I'd better learn
to play like myself

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.380
and figure out what
that actually is.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.330
I mean in a really
technical way,

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.120
I do a lot of hybrid picking.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.727
Meaning I hold a guitar
pick between my thumb

00:41:22.727 --> 00:41:23.560
and my first finger.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.420
And then these other
three fingers just kind of

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.461
have a mind of their own.

00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:28.890
They're doing other
stuff as I'm doing it.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:30.960
So that's why you can
play a bass, and a melody,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.072
and chords in between.

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:34.280
These will be the ones
playing chords, these fingers.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.446
Pinky is playing the melody.

00:41:35.446 --> 00:41:37.530
And my pick is playing the bass.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.670
And so I like to get
different sounds.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.880
I mean there's one little
bit of a Van Haleny trick

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.340
in the show at the very end.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.382
It sounds like this.

00:41:51.382 --> 00:41:53.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.620
And it sounds really,
really complicated.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.980
I promise you it's not actually.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.030
It's really not.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.660
But that's a little
bit of the Van Halen

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.020
influence coming into my
acoustic guitar playing.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.940
ALAN SEALES: So do you end
up listening and liking

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.515
more blue grassy, folk
music sort of stuff?

00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:18.390
And what do you listen
to in your spare time?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.032
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I listen
to a lot of hip hop.

00:42:21.032 --> 00:42:21.890
Yeah.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.223
ALAN SEALES: I'm going to let
that sink in for a second.

00:42:24.223 --> 00:42:27.110
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I mean
storytelling is really

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.060
what I dig.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:33.600
I dig a compelling story and
Tupac Shakur, Marshall Mathers,

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.897
OutKast, Nas.

00:42:34.897 --> 00:42:36.480
Marshall Mathers is
Eminem, of course.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.565
Biggie, Big Pun.

00:42:42.565 --> 00:42:45.270
I'm a big fan of his record,
"Capital Punishment" in 1996.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.420
It's a great record.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:47.940
Yeah.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:53.000
And these guys are taking
what really is lyrically

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.835
the most advanced-- it's the
most advanced kind of lyricism.

00:42:55.835 --> 00:42:56.710
And here's the thing.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:01.484
So the best piece of musical
theater up right now--

00:43:01.484 --> 00:43:03.650
and if you haven't heard
of it, you absolutely will.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.350
Paul McCartney was
there last night--

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.270
is "Hamilton." "Hamilton"
was written by a guy called

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.800
Lin-Manuel Miranda.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.800
And it's about
Alexander Hamilton.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.250
And it is a hip hop show.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.940
And it's not trying
to sort of falsely

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.770
squeeze hip hop onto Broadway.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:21.710
He is a rapper and
he is a writer.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.100
And he is one of the
best guys around.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.616
And he wrote a show that's
completely a game changer,

00:43:26.616 --> 00:43:28.490
just the way Leonard
Bernstein thought, well,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.397
why don't we take
real orchestral music

00:43:31.397 --> 00:43:32.230
and put it on stage?

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.521
And he wrote "West Side Story."

00:43:33.521 --> 00:43:35.090
And everyone was
like, oh, OK, right.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.964
You've changed the way
musical theater works.

00:43:36.964 --> 00:43:38.690
Lin-Manuel has on
the same thing.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.865
And though my stuff, it
absolutely sounds folky

00:43:41.865 --> 00:43:43.740
and sounds blue grassy,
that's just because I

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.170
play the acoustic guitar.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:50.750
But in actuality to me, hip hop
is much more the thing that I'm

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.012
really, really interested in.

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:53.970
Because these guys are
doing-- guys and girls--

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.690
are doing things that I aspire
to do, that I would love to do.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.467
I would love to tell these
dense and complex stories.

00:44:01.467 --> 00:44:03.300
I mean "Hamilton" is 2
hours and 45 minutes.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.640
And there's not a wasted
syllable in that show.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.210
Every syllable is extraordinary.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.100
I mean go.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.040
Go see it if you can.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.520
It's amazing.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:16.460
And I listen to a lot of jazz,
Oscar Peterson, the pianist.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.210
The musicals I do dig,
I dig Frank Loesser,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.480
who wrote "Guys and Dolls."

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.870
That's absolutely
my favorite show.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.540
Actually before "The Lion,"
the sort of preshow music,

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.460
is Miles Davis and
his quintet playing

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.540
songs from "Guys and Dolls."

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.090
And I wonder how many
people have caught that.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.780
But I get to warm up
in my dressing room

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.830
to "If I Were a Bell."

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.380
It's a wonderful melody.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.480
It's wonderful lyric.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.730
I mean those melodies are
so strong that when you just

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.450
hear the melody, you
hear the words too.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.190
And that's the kind of things
that I'd like to write.

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.520
I'd really like to
write a melody that's

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.990
so strong that you
can hear the words.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.820
Or write a lyric so strong
that you automatically

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.486
hear the melody.

00:44:54.486 --> 00:44:56.101
ALAN SEALES: Well, you have.

00:44:56.101 --> 00:44:58.350
After the show and during
warm-ups and everything this

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.814
morning, I've have "Cookie-tin
Banjo" in head nonstop.

00:45:00.814 --> 00:45:02.980
Like even as I'm sitting
here listening to you talk,

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.420
I have "Cookie-tin Banjo"
going through my head.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.120
After you played
the other stuff,

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.830
I still go back to
"Cookie-tin Banjo."

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:07.716
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: It's
a sticky little melody.

00:45:07.716 --> 00:45:07.884
ALAN SEALES: It is.

00:45:07.884 --> 00:45:08.383
It is.

00:45:08.383 --> 00:45:09.600
I really like it.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.929
So we've talked about the
music, the song writing,

00:45:11.929 --> 00:45:13.220
and the lyrics, and everything.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.860
So now, we've got the show.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.572
You've got music videos, too.

00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:17.530
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:21.170
I'm making a record right now
called "Songs From The Lion."

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.340
So musical theater has
been doing it backwards.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.720
Musical theater makes recordings
of the shows as souvenirs

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.380
to sell in the lobby.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.150
And this is so stupid to me.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.320
Like if you make a record,
don't make a souvenir.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.860
Make a piece of art.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.670
And your show is not
to sell your record.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.420
I mean, I'm playing
to 200 people a night.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.850
What am I going
to sell, like 150?

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.040
10 maybe?

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.400
Your record is to
sell your show.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.920
You put out a record, you should
try and sell a million copies.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.710
And if you ask any 10-year-old
how do you listen to music,

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:53.260
they'll tell you YouTube.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.370
And so put out a single.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:56.900
Put out as many
singles as you can.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.799
And make music videos for them.

00:45:58.799 --> 00:46:01.090
And so I've made a music
video for the song "Cookie-tin

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:02.180
Banjo."

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.720
And it's an animated video.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.270
It has seemingly nothing
to do with the show.

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.039
But to me, it's the same story.

00:46:09.039 --> 00:46:11.080
And then I made a video
for the song, "The Lion."

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.090
And I made these both with a
fellow called Peter Baynton.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:18.010
And "The Lion," it premiered
at the Annecy Film Festival.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.550
Annecy is a town in the
north of France, just south

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.044
of Switzerland.

00:46:22.044 --> 00:46:24.210
And it's the biggest animated
festival in the world.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:29.640
And we made a little video
for just over $10,000.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.370
And it was playing at Annecy
alongside videos from Bjork.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.090
And Thom Yorke from
Radiohead had a video.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.570
I mean some really
amazing artists,

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.059
who I really, really admire.

00:46:41.059 --> 00:46:42.600
And I was out there
for a couple days

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.156
and I didn't stay until the end.

00:46:44.156 --> 00:46:45.780
I went back to London
to see my family.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.880
And I got a call from Peter
Baynton, the director/animator.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.680
And he's like, hey, man, I just
want to let you know we won.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.240
And I was like we won what?

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.840
And he said, we won the
best commissioned film

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.740
in the festival for "The Lion."

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.780
And I could not believe it.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.520
And so Pete and I are making
a third video right now,

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.340
third animated video.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.720
And we're also making a film
video and one for the song

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.180
"Cure," the cancery one that I
played earlier-- cancery one,

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.750
yea.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.165
ALAN SEALES: Did you film
during the process too?

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:15.040
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: No.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.710
There's no video footage.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.520
I don't believe so.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.870
Ah, that would've
been a good idea.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.170
Eh.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:24.300
ALAN SEALES: Next time.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.365
Don't relive it.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.976
So we've got "The
Lion" video now.

00:47:32.976 --> 00:47:33.600
It's queued up.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.390
That's why the
screen went black.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.797
So we would like
to have you play

00:47:37.797 --> 00:47:39.880
it live while the video's
going in the background.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.838
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:47:40.838 --> 00:47:41.560
Absolutely.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.800
And before I play, I just
want to say thank to you

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.500
guys for listening
to me talk and sing.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.138
And thank you very
much for having me.

00:47:48.138 --> 00:47:52.910
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.542
Here's "The Lion," friends.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.860
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER, "THE
 LION"]

00:50:52.338 --> 00:50:59.170
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:00.660
ALAN SEALES: Nice.

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.440
So we've got microphones
in each aisle.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.670
We've got some tickets
to give away to those

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:08.440
of you who may have questions.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.460
If you have questions,
please go there now.

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.150
This has been
absolutely wonderful.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.549
What was the process like
making the animated video

00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:16.340
in the first place?

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.960
Do you have a lot
of input into that?

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.270
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Well, Peter is a-- he

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.130
went to Cambridge in England.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:28.200
And he studied architecture
and oil painting

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.020
because he likes making
three-dimensional things

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.895
in two dimensions.

00:51:32.895 --> 00:51:34.436
And eventually, he
realized, you know

00:51:34.436 --> 00:51:37.920
what, I think actually I'm
supposed to be an animator.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.220
I want to tell stories, big
three-dimensional stories

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.060
in two dimensions.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.560
And so we had a mutual
friend who connected us.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.150
And I'd finished
recording that song,

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:53.050
"The Lion" on the
record "The Bridge"

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.900
with Escapist Papers, my band.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.009
And so I called my
friend Alex and I said,

00:51:59.009 --> 00:52:00.425
I'm looking to
animate this video.

00:52:00.425 --> 00:52:01.780
And there's so many words in it.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.207
And I really want to
do it pretty literally.

00:52:04.207 --> 00:52:05.290
Do you know any animators?

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:06.130
And he said, yeah,
you should talk

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:07.300
to my friend Peter Baynton.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.631
And so I went to meet Pete.

00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:10.130
I'd sent him the
song ahead of time.

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.255
And he turned up at our
meeting with this cardboard

00:52:12.255 --> 00:52:16.160
guy he'd made with an Exacto
knife and a piece of cardboard.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.641
And he said, what about
him as the main character?

00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:21.890
ALAN SEALES: It looks just me.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:22.848
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Yeah.

00:52:22.848 --> 00:52:27.070
And I just kind of burst
into tears, I was so moved.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.232
And Pete and I talked.

00:52:29.232 --> 00:52:31.190
It took us about nine
months to make the video.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:36.910
And actually I met his mom at
the British Animation Awards,

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.350
where Pete took home
the award for "The Lion"

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.310
for public choice
for best music video.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:47.200
And Pete's mom said, I thought
that-- Peter was at home.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.165
And the kitchen floor
was covered in cardboard.

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.470
And I didn't know
what was going on.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:55.330
And Pete, I really just
let him do his thing.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.415
He sent me an
animatic initially.

00:52:57.415 --> 00:52:59.040
And what an animatic
is, it's basically

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.960
a slide show to the song,
which is kind of drawings

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.750
of how the story would work.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:08.620
And one thing that was
really important to Peter

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.310
was character.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.079
In the very beginning
of the video,

00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:13.620
there's a table with
all the pictures

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.810
of all the lions in the family.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.770
And what's
fascinating about that

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:22.150
is Peter followed every
single one of those characters

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.400
on a journey through the song.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.996
There's no character
that doesn't

00:53:24.996 --> 00:53:26.120
have a journey in the song.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.530
And so it was very much about
telling everybody's story very

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.920
specifically and being
really true to that.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.520
And there's no wasted time.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.080
Similar to the way Riya,
the photographer, works.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.650
Peter works the same way.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.105
And I love, man, I
loved working with him.

00:53:42.105 --> 00:53:43.730
And I don't have to
do a lot with Pete.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.770
I send him a song, and
I send him my ideas,

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:47.290
and I let him get on with it.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:50.770
And he'll come back and say,
this is what we're doing.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:51.710
And it's awesome.

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:54.770
And I hope to-- we're going
to make two more videos.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.465
And one day, I want to make an
animated feature film with him.

00:53:57.465 --> 00:53:59.840
We've made these little movies
for a little bit of money.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.630
One day, I want to go bother
Pixar and go get $10 million

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.422
and make a real movie.

00:54:05.422 --> 00:54:07.380
I mean he's going to be
an extraordinary person

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.500
to do that with.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.160
Radish Pictures is his company.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.530
Mark my words, in 10
years, Radish Pictures,

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.697
they'll be fighting you
guys for real estate.

00:54:16.697 --> 00:54:18.030
ALAN SEALES: Oh, yeah, question?

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.850
AUDIENCE: Hey, Ben.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.260
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Hey.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:19.820
AUDIENCE: Kevin.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.819
I've been a fan of yours
since you played guitar

00:54:21.819 --> 00:54:24.170
in the production of "Tommy"
that I produced at Harvard.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:25.378
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: No kidding.

00:54:25.378 --> 00:54:27.050
Hey, man.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:28.920
AUDIENCE: Best
undergraduate production

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.170
of "Tommy" guitar player ever.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:31.586
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Well, thank you.

00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:32.480
That was really fun.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:32.840
AUDIENCE: It was awesome.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:33.520
It was great.

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.020
Yeah.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:34.520
Yeah.

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.610
It was like 14 years ago.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.750
So like obviously, you're
a great songwriter.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.810
And 50 years ago, you might
be on like a Stephen Sondheim

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:43.660
path, where you
just write musicals

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.810
and they start in Boston.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:48.102
And then they go to Broadway.

00:54:48.102 --> 00:54:49.560
Other than "Hamilton,"
I don't know

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.610
if there are many like original
musicals coming to Broadway.

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:57.090
So what does the career look
like for someone who wants

00:54:57.090 --> 00:54:58.470
to be a Broadway songwriter?

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:01.860
And given like most of the
Broadway theaters right

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:06.620
now are Disney or
movie adaptations,

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.434
what are the plans
for your career?

00:55:08.434 --> 00:55:10.100
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Well, I wholeheartedly

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.016
believe that making
records and making theater

00:55:12.016 --> 00:55:14.050
are not in opposition
to one another.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:16.790
They're, in fact,
the same thing.

00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:19.310
And that if you want to
write a show that you want

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:22.980
to be successful, there's
so many tools that

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.500
can reach beyond the
theater to get audiences

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.795
that don't go to the theater.

00:55:26.795 --> 00:55:28.670
I mean the people who come
to see "The Lion," yeah,

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:29.300
it's a theater audience.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.800
But it's also kids
who just hang out

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.430
at Rockwood Music Hall,
kids who dig pop music

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.390
or who dig folk music.

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:41.590
And so I think that if
you're writing a show,

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:42.900
release your singles.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.345
And if they don't work
as singles, rewrite them.

00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:46.720
And if then they
don't work, then

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.380
probably your show
isn't going to work

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.530
in the contemporary era.

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.460
And if your songs are
compelling enough,

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.501
then people don't even
know they're from a show.

00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:56.250
It doesn't matter.

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.740
People don't need to see the
"Cookie-tin Banjo" video.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.850
If they like it, they don't need
to know it's from "The Lion."

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.170
I mean it's a humble video.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:06.000
It's only been seen 125,000
times, which is nothing

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.602
in sort of big YouTube terms.

00:56:08.602 --> 00:56:10.810
But it's way more than people
who have seen the show.

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:12.730
There's only 200
seats in the theater.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:19.180
So I would advise any songwriter
who's writing for the stage--

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:22.357
and I do, in my group
of writer friends.

00:56:22.357 --> 00:56:24.440
And it's really a huge
community here in New York.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.616
I mean Sam Willmott is
an amazing songwriter.

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.990
Jean Rose, an
amazing songwriter.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.910
Shaina Taub is an
amazing songwriter.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:34.710
These people are really
putting on creative, different

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.960
sounding, excellent theater.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.872
I advise them to write
about themselves.

00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:41.830
Because man, if you can't
write about yourself,

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.910
like good luck writing
about somebody else.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.534
Good luck telling
somebody else's truth

00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:48.060
if you have a hard
time telling your own.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.567
Beyond that, yeah, I think
thinking of different ways

00:56:50.567 --> 00:56:51.150
to do theater.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.540
I mean different venues.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.874
Anything goes.

00:56:55.874 --> 00:56:58.290
I mean I was told that doing
a one-person autobiographical

00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.600
musical was a terrible idea.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.667
And I was like, OK, cool.

00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:02.750
Maybe no one will like it.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:03.920
But that's what I
feel like doing.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.780
And I don't think
there really are rules.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.850
And I think the young
producers, some of whom

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.530
are in this room
today, they dig that.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.265
And they'll help
you make your thing.

00:57:13.265 --> 00:57:15.390
If you believe wholeheartedly,
and you put together

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.390
a good team of people,
and you have a cool story

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:20.310
to tell in a cool way,
like it'll totally work.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:21.600
That's what I think.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.100
AUDIENCE: And I
work on YouTube now.

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.273
So I'll see what I can do about
getting that play count up.

00:57:25.273 --> 00:57:26.439
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Great man.

00:57:26.439 --> 00:57:28.249
Thank you very much.

00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:28.790
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:29.820
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Hey.

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.352
AUDIENCE: You talked
about-- I mean

00:57:31.352 --> 00:57:32.810
a lot of like what
you talked about

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.995
has come from like your
personal experience

00:57:34.995 --> 00:57:36.980
and your personal story.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.210
You also talked about
the technical skills

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.690
that you sought out to learn.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:46.680
So I was curious to know
how much of like what you're

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.190
bringing to the table as
far as like your actual--

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.370
the musical skills
and the writing

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.454
skills came from a school
setting versus self-taught?

00:57:57.454 --> 00:58:00.120
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: Well, I have a
degree in English from Harvard.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:05.310
And I spent a lot of time
reading and performing

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.970
in theater and
studying structure,

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:10.130
studying three-act structure.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.610
And so very, very quickly,
classical three-act structures.

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:14.680
The first act is here
is your protagonist.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.880
Here is what they want.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.610
The second act is here's
why you can't have it

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.970
and how they go off on their
journey to try to get it.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:25.320
And the third act is they get
it and they go home happy.

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.820
That's a comedy.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.680
They don't get it and they die.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.000
That's a tragedy.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.247
Or they realize that they
actually really wanted

00:58:33.247 --> 00:58:35.580
something else all along, and
they get that other thing,

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.413
and they kind of change
their point of view.

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.570
And that's a drama.

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:40.910
This has been going
on for 10,000 years,

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:43.080
however long stories
have been told.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.120
And the thing about that
that I've taken away

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.630
is I try to incorporate that
three-act structure that I've

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.890
learned by studying
theater and literature

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.060
into every single
song, into each song.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.000
And so, yeah, it's
very technical.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.950
"The Lion's" structure, the
piece of theater structure,

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.360
is very much based on
Joseph Campbell, who's

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.230
a 20th-century
American historian who

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:05.460
codified the hero's journey.

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.580
He was like, OK, what
do Buddha, and Jesus,

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.620
and Moses, and Odysseus
all have in common?

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.050
How are their stories similar?

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:13.466
And he kind of worked out that
they all follow pretty much

00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:14.420
a similar trajectory.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.550
And so structurally,
yeah, I really

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.220
try to be very technical.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:22.800
Because the closer I stay to
the technical structuralism,

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.186
the farther I can go in
telling my version of that.

00:59:26.186 --> 00:59:29.210
And I've been very lucky to
study at the Johnny Mercer

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:32.120
songwriting workshop.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.000
It's one week long.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.760
It's hosted at
Northwestern University.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.020
And here's the way it works.

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.690
You apply, if you're
18 to 30 years old.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.800
And you send in three tunes.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.990
And if you get in, they
buy you a plane ticket,

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:47.120
and they give you
a bunch of money,

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.036
and they bring you to
Northwestern for a week.

00:59:49.036 --> 00:59:51.800
And you just write with
three master teachers.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.020
Andrew Lippa is a
fabulous writer.

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.790
He's got "Big Fish,"
and "Addam's Family,"

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.100
and "I Am Harvey
Milk," the oratorio.

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.670
Craig Carnelia is
another songwriter.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.430
Lari White is
another songwriter,

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.763
the woman who told me if you
want to write a great song,

01:00:04.763 --> 01:00:07.300
if you want to
write a good song.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.607
And I just got paid to write.

01:00:08.607 --> 01:00:10.190
It was the first
time anybody had ever

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.630
said you should do that.

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.862
This is a job.

01:00:12.862 --> 01:00:14.070
And there are no assignments.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.140
But you go and you
write whatever you want.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.640
And then these three
master teachers

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.974
will say-- you'll play a tune.

01:00:18.974 --> 01:00:21.390
And they'll say, oh, you know
the second verse is actually

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:23.973
similar to this Dylan song that
maybe you haven't checked out.

01:00:23.973 --> 01:00:26.540
Or did you see Stephen
Sondheim's version of this song

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.350
that you're doing?

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:30.320
This is a I'm sad
you left song, or a

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.720
I want you to love me song,
or a I want to change song.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.026
I mean it's all pretty similar.

01:00:35.026 --> 01:00:37.400
We're writing the same songs
again, and again, and again.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.930
It goes back to what we
were talking about earlier.

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:40.610
It's not that our
stories are the same.

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:42.820
But we feel the
same way about it.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.990
And it was extraordinary
to be able to work

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:48.490
with these writers, these
professional writers,

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.940
and to meet other young writers
who had similar ambitions.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.940
And so to be able to be part
of a community of songwriters

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.180
is one of the most
valuable things.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.660
Because we'll talk about
how rhyme can be helpful,

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.700
how enjambment can be helpful,
how setting up an expectation

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.560
and then not fulfilling it
in a song can be helpful.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.440
And these are all
the technical tools.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.320
And I very much believe
that learn the technique

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.550
as much as you can.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.700
And then use it in support
of, rather than in place of,

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.244
what you want to say.

01:01:19.244 --> 01:01:20.200
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.382
ALAN SEALES: Thank you.

01:01:22.382 --> 01:01:23.840
AUDIENCE: I have
a simple question.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.290
What keeps you moving every
day, like what you keep doing?

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.830
And what's the motivation?

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.590
Where are you getting it from?

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.280
BENJAMIN SCHEUER: I get a lot of
motivation from the audiences.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.030
And some days I wake
up and I'm like, man,

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.488
I do not want to
go to the theater.

01:01:37.488 --> 01:01:38.130
I'm tired.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.450
And it's snowing outside.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.990
I'm like, I'm comfy in bed.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.990
And then I go do a show.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.573
And mean I met a young kid who
was 17 years old the other day,

01:01:45.573 --> 01:01:46.880
who's studying-- or 18 I guess.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.720
He's at NYU.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.880
And he's studying
songwriting and acting.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.490
And he said, man, you're
doing what I want to do.

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.782
That's inspiring
that I don't know

01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:01.240
how I could write songs about
myself and it could be a job.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.156
But you're doing that.

01:02:02.156 --> 01:02:03.900
And that makes me want
to get out of bed.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.550
And I was like, OK, well,
that's pretty beautiful.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.820
I'm a pretty happy guy.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:16.830
I get to play guitar for a
job and wear red clothes.

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:19.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.439
It's pretty awesome.

01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:21.980
I love going to the
recording studio.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.396
I love working with Geoff
Kraly, who's my record producer.

01:02:24.396 --> 01:02:25.920
We've worked together for years.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.780
And we have the best time.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.360
We get to play with microphones,
and play with words,

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.430
and play with melodies.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.346
And also I get to play
with some of the people

01:02:34.346 --> 01:02:35.980
I've always dreamed
about working with.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.340
That's one of the
coolest things.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.390
ALAN SEALES: Like Bruce Willis.

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.430
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Like Bruce Willis.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:41.850
Well, in terms of the record
that I'm making for the show,

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:44.362
I'm not just making a record
with guitar and vocals.

01:02:44.362 --> 01:02:45.570
That's how it is in the show.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.960
But on the record, I
was like, all right,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.810
well who are the people I've
always wanted to work with?

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.950
And there's this one tune in the
show, its on electric guitar.

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:52.640
It's kind of a Nine
Inch Nails thing.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.480
And I was like, why don't we
just hire Nine Inch Nails?

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.620
They're just guys.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.520
You can call them.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.920
And so we called Josh
Freese, who plays drums

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.500
in Nine Inch Nails, and with
Sting, and with Guns and Roses,

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.510
and we said come play
on the record, man.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:08.610
And he sure, why not?

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:11.059
And so that's incredibly
exciting to me.

01:03:11.059 --> 01:03:12.600
So something that
really motivates me

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.190
is working with people
who are better than I am.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.114
If I can keep doing that,
I'll be a happy guy.

01:03:18.114 --> 01:03:20.280
ALAN SEALES: Well, thank
you so much for coming out.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.720
That was wonderful.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.680
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.850
So we've got one more song
you're going to give us,

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:32.230
to close out, that's not
so sad, not so cancery.

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.280
So yeah, before you start,
I want to give you a plug.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.910
Everyone visit

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:41.206

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:42.150
The show is great.

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.260
It's phenomenal.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.380
I can't go on-- I can go on
and on about how wonderful it

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.960
and just how touching it is.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.520
So I'm going to
get off the stage,

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.220
give you your final moment.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:51.720
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Thank you very much.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.553
ALAN SEALES: Please.

01:03:52.553 --> 01:03:53.755
Thank you for coming.

01:03:53.755 --> 01:03:55.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.916
BENJAMIN SCHEUER:
Here's a happy song.

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:09.339
[MUSIC BENJAMIN SCHEUER, "HELLO
 JEMIMA"]

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.300
