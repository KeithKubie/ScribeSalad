00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.942
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:02.400
LEE BILLINGS: All
right, all right.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.921
Well, it's really
good to be here.

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:04.420
Thanks.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.187
And yeah, so actually
this is the quote

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:08.770
that I open the book
with, and I think

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.680
it's appropriate that I open
the presentation with it too.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.560
This is from Werner Von
Braun, the architect

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.330
of Apollo's-- I'm sorry,
NASA's Apollo Program.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000
"Here on Earth we
live on a planet

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.890
that is in orbit around the sun.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.140
The sun itself is a
star, which is on fire

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.790
and will someday burn up,
leaving our solar system

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.900
uninhabitable.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.390
Therefore, we must build
a bridge to the stars

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.290
because, as far as we know,
we are the only sentient

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.640
creatures in the
entire universe.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.620
When do we start building
that bridge to the stars?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.960
We begin as soon as we are
able, and this is that time.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.800
We must not fail
in this obligation

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.510
we have to keep alive the only
meaningful life we know of."

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.780
And I chose that
to open up the book

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.530
and open up this conversation,
this presentation,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.160
just because I think it
encapsulates what the book is

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.150
really about, and what I think
space exploration should really

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.700
be about, at least maybe it was
about what Von Braun thought

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.430
it was about back when he was
building the Apollo rockets.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.440
Some people seem to think
that my book is really

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.880
about the question of life
elsewhere in the universe,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.920
but that's not exactly true.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.510
It's really much more about--
well, it is about exoplanets,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.930
and it's about the
search for other earths,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.120
other Earth-like exoplanets.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.286
But it's much more about
our own Earth and our lives

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:30.660
right here, which
we too often forget

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.035
our own planet is an exoplanet
to every star in the sky

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:33.660
except for one.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.140
So you can look
around, and you think

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.170
about what an alien
biosphere is like, what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.604
it's like to be an
alien on an exoplanet.

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:43.020
Look around you,
look in a mirror,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.455
look at things in
nature outside.

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:46.080
And it's a perspective
that's valuable,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.400
if it's a little prosaic.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.170
So it's really not
so much about life

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.720
out there, the book, as it is
about life right here right

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.930
now, and what life really
does once it's get started

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.375
on an Earth-like planet.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.500
What are we going to do
with our moment in the sun?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.390
Where are we going to take it?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.160
So that's kind of
where I start out,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.760
and that's really what
the book tries to explore.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.080
And this is the
cover, obviously.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.229
I know it's already been
plastered up everywhere.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.360
The title, I have to say, with
apologies to Gabriel Garcia

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.479
Marquez, it's not
inspired by "One Hundred

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.270
Years of Solitude."

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.769
A lot of people
seem to think it is.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.340
It's not.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.530
It's actually inspired by
the lifespan of the biosphere

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.382
as far as we know.

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.590
The Earth is about four and
a half billion years old.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.150
We know that from dating
meteorites and really old

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.100
rocks.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.140
And we can look and see
within those rocks, at least

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.990
the earliest ones we really
have that are well-preserved,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.500
that life got
started here pretty

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.910
quick after the Earth cooled
from the great impacts that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.740
formed it.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.410
So our planet's been
alive almost as long

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.250
as it's been around, so
you get 4.5 billion years.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.194
The lifespan of the
biosphere, obviously,

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:50.610
start with that
4.5 billion years,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.151
and then you project
into the future.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.750
Well, back in the
day, astronomers

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.132
used to say the end
of the world, the end

00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:58.340
of the biosphere, would come
about five billion years

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.260
from now, when the sun
becomes a red giant.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.051
The sun, obviously,
you know is a star that

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.520
changes as it evolves.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.160
Becomes this big
red giant, goes out

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.389
to about two astronomical units,
engulfs the inner planets,

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.180
and that's the end of
life on Earth, right?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.470
Well, a little later
on, planetary scientists

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.927
said, OK, well, sure, you
know, that's going to happen,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.010
and the Earth's crust will
be melted down to slag.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.790
But before that, about two
billion years before that,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.294
or about two billion
years from now,

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:23.710
we're going to lose our oceans
because the sun is steadily

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.160
getting brighter over time.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.360
So the surface temperature
increases, water boils,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.950
turns into steam,
escapes into space.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.929
We lose our oceans.

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:32.720
So people are saying,
well, that's the end.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080
And actually, today, it
seems like the end is about,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.090
if you're a little
pessimistic, about 500

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.100
million years from now.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.620
That's when the end begins.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.956
And that's because, again,
the sun gets hotter.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.330
And as the sun is
getting hotter,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.890
the surface
temperature is rising.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.150
And while that's happening,
the Earth's interior

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.740
is getting cooler and volcanism
is diminishing and declining.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.490
We're going to reach
a point, essentially,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.870
where this is going to throw
the carbon cycle out of whack.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.370
And a lot of details
in the book--

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.953
I'm kind of glossing over this
part to get to some other juicy

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:01.649
stuff-- but
essentially, we may only

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:03.690
have about 500 million
years before this happens.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.806
The carbon cycle goes
all out of whack.

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:08.180
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
is pulled out of the air

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.130
into the rocks.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.660
There's no longer
any CO2 for plants

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.060
to use to drive photosynthesis.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.500
So photosynthesis ends.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.092
Plants die.

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:17.550
They're the base
of the food chain.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.660
We die.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.100
So that's kind of when that's
going to start happening.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.980
Bacteria can exist a lot
longer, but we're not

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.600
talking about bacteria.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.058
We're interested
in things like us.

00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:25.560
We're interested
in complex life.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.560
So that's where the five
billion years comes in.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.732
And the solitude part kind
of comes in from really

00:04:29.732 --> 00:04:31.440
just what we're seeing
around us and what

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.340
we're seeing on our own planet.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.060
The fact that, out of the 4
and 1/2 billion year history

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.890
of our planet, we
see no evidence

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.110
of anything else like us.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.700
Nothing that could build
rockets, or radio telescopes,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.440
nuclear bombs, or write
sonnets, or plays, or feel love.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.190
There's not a lot
evidence of that.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.060
I mean, even if you include
our hominid ancestors, that's

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.444
about 200,000 years,
maybe a million years

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:53.860
you're looking at,
it's not a lot.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.280
So we're just a
blip, and we do seem

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.710
to be kind of special in the
fullness of the planet's life.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.590
Similarly, you look out into
space, you see all these stars.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.654
We now know there's lots of
planets around those stars.

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:07.820
We aren't looking very hard
yet, but we don't really

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.320
see anything else
like us out there.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.880
We don't see any evidence of
any technological civilizations.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.470
We don't see Captain
Kirk and the Enterprise

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.535
or Luke Skywalker
and the Death Star.

00:05:14.535 --> 00:05:15.576
We don't see any of that.

00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.110
It's deathly quiet.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.410
So there's a lot of people
who talk about this much more

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.721
eloquently than I'm going
to, at least on stage.

00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:25.220
Maybe the book's a
different matter.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.110
But that kind of
speaks to me, and makes

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.050
me wonder whether or not we
are, in all practical purposes,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.870
alone, and if we
really have what

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.790
it takes to kind of
break our solitude.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.090
Because right now, we really
are on the cusp of doing things

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.620
like finding Earth-like planets
around the nearest thousand

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.857
stars, finding out whether
or not we're alone.

00:05:45.857 --> 00:05:47.190
We're on the cusp of doing that.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.210
We know how to do it.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.960
We have the money.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.040
We have the capability.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.520
But it doesn't seem
like we have the will.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520
And I'm not really sure
if we're going to get it.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.200
And so that's a little bit
of pessimism on my part,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720
and I hope I'm wrong.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.090
But there you go.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.590
So "Five Billion
Years of Solitude,"

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.340
that's kind of where
the title comes from.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.479
So anyway, let's kind
of move on from that.

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.020
That's really an
overview of the book

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.689
and really broader
view of the book.

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.230
Talks about a lot
of different people

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.590
at the forefront of this
field in different areas.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.700
But let's move on to
what I'm really here

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.610
to talk about, which is
about this revolution that's

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.032
unfolding right now for us.

00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:21.490
The fact that right now, every
single person on this planet

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.500
is really occupying a profoundly
important and special moment

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.130
in history.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.882
We're finally, finally
able, after four

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:30.090
and a half billion years of
this biosphere developing

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.340
on this planet, able to
go out and look around

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.590
all these stars, and the planets
are pouring out of the sky.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.269
We've already found more
than 1,000 exoplanets.

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:39.810
I think, officially,
semi-officially,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.280
depending on what you
define as a planet,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.670
crossed that earlier this
month, that threshold of 1,000.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.690
Those are confirmed exoplanets.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.231
So there's way more
out there than we

00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:47.930
have in our solar
system, obviously.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.680
A single NASA
mission, Kepler, which

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.430
we'll talk a lot
more about in a bit,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.310
has found more than 3,500
planetary candidates.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.880
About 90% of those are
probably going to be legit.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.010
So they're everywhere.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.937
You can run the
statistics, and basically,

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:03.270
anytime you're looking up at
the sky and you see a star,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.510
the chances are you're
looking at a planetary system.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.360
That star probably has planets.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.720
And this is kind of new,
and it's really exciting.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.770
It's a really exciting
time to be alive.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.290
So that's kind of
the big picture.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.070
That's we're going to go.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.180
Let's go a little deeper.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.760
Let's talk about
we've found so far.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.539
So how did this begin?

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:18.580
Where did this come from?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.954
How long has this
been happening?

00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:21.460
Well, you can see,
this is actually

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.217
a plot taken from the excellent
"Exoplanet Catalog" run

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:27.050
by a French astronomer
named Jean Schneider.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.840
This is tracking
all the, I think

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.350
it's 1,039 planets
officially, exoplanets,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.500
and it's tracking
mass on the y-axis

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.190
and the year of
discovery on the x-axis.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.475
And you can just see here,
this little dot-- let

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:44.989
me get my laser
pointer, is it going

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:47.530
to work-- yeah, this little dot
right here, that was actually

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.140
discovered, as you
can see, in 1989.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.850
It's kind of something
that's bigger than Jupiter.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.980
Might be a brown dwarf.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.996
We only went back and
realized what that was.

00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:55.370
The first one that
really, really

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.870
got things started is right
here, and that's 51 Pegasi b.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.400
That's a hot Jupiter that was
discovered around the star 51

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.796
Pegasi, a sun-like
star, in 1995.

00:08:05.796 --> 00:08:07.420
And you can just kind
of see, you know?

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.170
Again, if you look at
planetary mass here,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.640
so right here that's Jupiter.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.800
That's Jupiter mass.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.560
So here's 51 Pegasi.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.880
And you can just see,
there's a couple here,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.530
each year by year, little here.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.600
Some droughts where you
don't even have any.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.510
And then this happens.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.430
And you can see that,
progressively, these individual

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.915
dots, each one of these
dots being a planet,

00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:29.780
they're just blurring into lines
because we're finding so many

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.660
of these things.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.520
And they're also getting
way lower in mass.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.395
Right down here, that's
below Earth mass.

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:36.100
Earth mass is right around here.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.490
So it's this huge
revolution, where we're just

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.990
getting better and
better at finding

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.586
smaller and smaller
things, and more

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.710
and more Earth-like orbits.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.850
They're no longer just
these big balls of gas

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.850
hugging their stars like
the first planets were.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.310
They're smaller planets,
potentially rocky planets.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.640
Planets that could be quite
like Earth in nice orbits.

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.260
And this has been going on
for 20 years, obviously.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.780
There's no sign
it's going to stop.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.570
Keeps going.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.210
But a lot of this
right down here,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.270
when you really see just these
lines, these walls of worlds

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.160
right here, that's from Kepler.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.340
Kepler's really special.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.560
Let's talk about
Kepler a little more.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.957
So this is a view,
Kepler's view.

00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:15.040
This was launched in 2009.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.900
It's a NASA spacecraft.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.536
I think it was
about $600 million.

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:21.430
And it's looking at
this little, tiny swath

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.020
of stars that extends out to
about 3,000 light years away.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.720
And we'll talk about
exactly how it's

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.530
looking for planets
in just a little bit,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.030
but the important
thing to remember,

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.530
again, we're only looking
at a little tiny bit here.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.280
It was on a three and
a half year mission.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.464
Wildly successful, looking
at about 150,000 stars or so.

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:40.880
And again, it's looking mostly
for planets that are really

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.364
about the size of Earth
in year-long orbits

00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:44.280
around sun-like stars.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.645
The reason why it needed
at least three years

00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:47.021
is because, well,
maybe we should

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:48.228
get into that a little later.

00:09:48.228 --> 00:09:50.530
But it has to look for the
planet kind of going around

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.090
the star not once, not twice,
but three times, so for a year.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.300
And yeah, it's just
been phenomenal.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.660
It's found, as I mentioned, more
than 3,500 candidates already.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.980
Of course, you may have
heard in May of this year,

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.200
it kind of suffered a
crippling malfunction.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.550
It's not doing too well now.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.550
A lot of its reaction
wheels aren't working,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.110
so it can't really
point very well.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.340
It's not totally dead yet,
but its glory days are over.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.780
The Kepler wave, I think,
has kind of passed.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.560
There's going to be a
lot of data analysis

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.990
to still do in the future,
but its glory days are gone.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.470
So what has it told us so far?

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.140
This is brand new,
hot off the presses.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.930
This is from last week, a
big Kepler meeting last week.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.930
This is showing
you, essentially,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.356
the breakdown of that 3,500-odd
candidates that they found.

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:37.730
You can see there's
a good number

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.150
of kind of super-Jupiters.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.640
There's a hefty number
of Jupiter-sized planets.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.500
And then you just
see this explosion

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.610
in Neptune-sized planets,
so-called super-Earth-sized

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.830
planets, and then
Earth-sized planets.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.950
Now what's interesting about
this is that the super-Earths,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.670
that green bar, as well as
the Neptune-sized planets,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.150
that yellow bar,
that orange bar,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.960
we really don't
have analogs at all

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.570
for these in our
own solar system.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.230
These were not expected.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.690
They were not predicted.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.524
They're in relatively
short-period orbits,

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:07.940
most of them around
stars that are

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.960
smaller and dimmer than our sun.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.931
Some of them potentially
could be habitable,

00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:13.930
could potentially be
relative to the Earth-like,

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.920
rocky with thin atmospheres.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.630
But it's hard to tell because
we don't know a lot about them.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.190
And again, we have nothing
in our solar system

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.610
to study, really, that we
can use as a local analog.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.184
There's nothing that's
two Earth radii.

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:30.100
There's nothing like
that in our solar system.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.477
There's no Neptune that's parked
interior of Mercury's orbit

00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:34.310
in our solar system.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.189
But we're finding that
all over the place

00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:37.230
when we look with Kepler.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.360
And part of that
is selection bias,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.568
but it is telling us that
our understanding of planet

00:11:40.568 --> 00:11:42.459
formation is incomplete.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:43.500
But you can look at this.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.375
You can look at these
3,500 candidates or so,

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:50.020
and you can see, OK,
674 Earth-sized planets,

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.002
over a 1,000
super-Earth-sized planets?

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.710
Most of those are
candidates, but they're

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.814
going to be proved
legit eventually.

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:57.480
You might think that
maybe we've already

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.550
found kind of this
2.0-- Earth 2.0, right?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.410
Maybe it's lurking
in there someplace?

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.384
Maybe.

00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:04.925
I will go ahead and
make a prediction

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.930
and say that by the
end of the decade,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.360
finding a potentially
habitable Earth-sized planet

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.640
around a sun-like star will
no longer be newsworthy

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.140
at all because it's
going to happen

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.070
so much that no one's
really going to care.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.560
It's not going to be news.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.610
So something to think about.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.510
Let's see what we
really know about some

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.610
of these promising worlds.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.850
This is a list, I think
it's relatively up

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.060
to date, of the current
potentially habitable

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.010
exoplanets according
to various metrics.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.520
When we say
potentially habitable,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.080
again, we're thinking
blinkered, thinking

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.490
about what Earth is like.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.310
We think it needs to be rocky.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.940
We think that it needs to have
a relatively thin atmosphere.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.920
It's a big plus if
it has liquid water.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.556
That's obviously the
basis for life here.

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:46.930
It needs to probably
be in what's

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.820
called be "habitable zone,"
right, this circumstellar,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.770
Goldilocks, just-right
region, where

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.110
it's neither too hot nor
too cold for liquid water

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.930
to exist on a planet's surface.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.140
So what you're looking at here,
this ranked list of 12 worlds,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.300
is essentially, I
mean, all of these

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.930
have been claimed at one
time or another as Earth 2.0,

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.220
as they've all made
headlines as that.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.320
And you can see, maybe
we have found Earth 2.0.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.280
I mean, look at this.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.480
Oh, you got some clouds.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.334
You got some seas
there, some continents.

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:17.250
Lighting is a little
funny because it's around

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.060
really tiny stars.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.260
But man, those look
pretty good, right?

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.610
Look like Earth.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.860
Let's go pack up the starship.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.595
Let's go.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.290
Well, what do we really know?

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.282
What do we really know
about these places?

00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:28.490
I got multiple clickers here.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.911
I got to keep them straight.

00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:30.410
All right.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.100
So actually, pay attention
to this third one right

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.560
here, Gliese 581 g, number 3.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.845
So what you're seeing right
here is the actual data.

00:13:38.845 --> 00:13:40.470
This is what we're
going from the star.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.761
This is all we know about that
planet, about this system.

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:45.260
That's it.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.210
And I'll explain
it a little bit.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.570
The way that we're getting
this planet's signature

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.380
is, essentially, it's
an indirect measurement,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.270
and we're looking at the star
itself and the starlight.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.270
And we can tell when
the star is kind

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.040
of wobbling back and forth
in our point of view,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.814
red shift and blue shift.

00:14:00.814 --> 00:14:02.230
The light will get
a little redder

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.730
when it's coming towards
us-- or I'm sorry,

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.030
going away from us
and a little bluer

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.196
when it's coming towards us.

00:14:06.196 --> 00:14:09.410
So if you plot that over time,
you plot that motion over time,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.290
you get this nice
little sine wave.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.020
You get this nice little signal
of an orbiting planet that's

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.200
tugging on its star and
making the star wobble.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.314
And as you can see,
you get its year.

00:14:19.314 --> 00:14:20.730
You get its orbital
period by kind

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.930
of the repetition of this,
the peak and the trough.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.970
The actual strength
of the signal,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.774
how much it's
pulling on the star,

00:14:28.774 --> 00:14:30.190
gives you an
estimate of its mass.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.190
So you can get its mass.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.860
You can get some orbital
characteristics about it.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.710
And you can see here, if you
look at these little sidebars

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.920
right here, this is
in meters per second.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.530
So you can see this signal is
on the order of-- it's like 10

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.860
meters per second.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.450
Nice and clean, great.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.370
That's not Gliese 581 g.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.132
That's not the planet
that may be like Earth.

00:14:50.132 --> 00:14:52.090
The planet that may be
like Earth that everyone

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.805
was trumpeting a couple
years back is this.

00:14:54.805 --> 00:14:56.530
Look at that.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.312
Doesn't look so hot, does it?

00:14:58.312 --> 00:15:00.520
Not a lot of people are
convinced this planet exists.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.250
I don't know whether
or not it exists.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.606
You need to get more data.

00:15:03.606 --> 00:15:04.730
And look at all those dots.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.600
This is hundreds of measurements
using state of the art,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.640
best things we got,
the best kit we have.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.661
And that's the best
we can do right now.

00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:15.030
Look at this measurement here.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.640
I mean, it's on the order
of like a meter per second.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.010
Now, you think about
a meter per second,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.200
that's kind of like how
fast I'm walking right now.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.660
And we're doing this for
an entire star that's

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.342
light years away, this big,
glowing plasmatic ball of gas.

00:15:30.342 --> 00:15:32.050
It's remarkable that
we can do it at all.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.060
But lots of things can kind of
occlude the signal, star spots,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.080
big waves of plasma,
[INAUDIBLE] cycles.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.252
So the point is is that
we have to be really

00:15:40.252 --> 00:15:42.460
careful about the claims we
make about these planets,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.918
these so-called
Earth-like planets,

00:15:43.918 --> 00:15:46.631
because this is a case of
one-- again, front-page news.

00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:48.130
I don't know if
you-- I mean, I keep

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.960
track of this better
than most people,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.085
but it was front-page news.

00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:53.554
It was all over the place,
and it might not even be real.

00:15:53.554 --> 00:15:54.970
And even if it is
real, you're not

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.020
getting anything
about the atmosphere,

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.800
nothing about the surface,
nothing about the climate,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.490
nothing that's going
to let you actually

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.720
anoint it as Earth-like.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.450
So let's talk about
Kepler some more,

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.630
because this is obviously
not Kepler data.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.010
We're all about Kepler.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:12.890
Well, this is actually kind of
one of the Kepler prize finds,

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.714
the crown jewels.

00:16:13.714 --> 00:16:15.630
This was announced earlier
this year in April.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:21.910
What you're looking at is a
super-Earth called Kepler-62f.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.750
It's about 40%
larger than Earth.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.919
And you may notice that
little dot right there,

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.210
that bright-looking star thing.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:28.960
That's not a star.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.060
That's actually another
planet called Kepler-62e.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.710
These things hug the opposite
cusps of the habitable zone

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.510
around this star,
which is slightly

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.330
smaller and dimmer than our sun.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.970
So this is a case
where we're finding

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.430
two potentially habitable
planets in one system.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.220
Great news, right?

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.890
I mean, Kepler-62f, the
main one you're seeing here,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:54.040
ranks 10th in that-- it's
number 10 right there.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.060
You can see it, little
orb, featureless orb.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.510
Kepler-62e, you may
notice, its companion,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.820
that's that little
star, is number 1.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.504
So that's, supposedly,
prime real estate right now.

00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:06.670
That's supposedly where we
should pack our starships

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.550
and go.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.140
But again, what do we really
know about these planets?

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.200
So I'll show you again.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.619
It's not a lot, not as
much as you'd think.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.384
This is the data we
have for these planets.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:24.710
Pump the brakes.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.251
Don't get in your
starship quite yet.

00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:28.119
This is Kepler-62e.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.512
That's Kepler-62f.

00:17:29.512 --> 00:17:31.970
What you're looking at here is
what's called a light curve.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.754
This is how Kepler
finds planets.

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:34.920
It doesn't look for wobbles.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.650
It doesn't look for
the wobbling star.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.820
Instead, it looks
for these really rare

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.625
geometric alignments, where
the star crosses the face--

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:45.220
or I'm sorry, the planet,
sorry-- the planet

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.904
crosses the face of the
star as seen from Earth

00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:50.070
or as seen from Kepler, and
it casts a little shadow

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.350
that we can detect.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.700
And for things this small,
for things about Earth-sized,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.640
that's pretty tough.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.650
The Earth imparts a shadow
on the sun from interstellar

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.260
distances that is really minute.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.344
I mean, there's no windows
in here, unfortunately,

00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:04.968
but if you think
about a typical window

00:18:04.968 --> 00:18:06.520
pane and the light
passing through,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.894
the window pane
is actually going

00:18:07.894 --> 00:18:12.490
to dim the light more than
an Earth across a sun.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.230
So it's a really
faint measurement,

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.100
but we can measure it, and
it's remarkable that we can.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.630
But you can just see
it's not a lot to go on.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.955
We have this little kind
of a paucity of data here,

00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:24.730
and we have these light curves.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.809
And ideally, what you
want to do to kind

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:29.100
of weed out so-called false
positives-- because, again,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.160
these light curves could
be caused by star spots

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.109
or eclipsing binary stars.

00:18:33.109 --> 00:18:34.150
You have a pair of stars.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.734
It could be caused by all kinds
of things that aren't planets.

00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:38.275
You want to actually
get that wobble.

00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:39.920
You want to get that
wobble measurement

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.925
to confirm each one of
these dips in starlight

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:44.800
is actually a planet.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.425
But that takes a lot
of telescope time.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.950
It's really tough to do.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.890
And consequently, we
actually haven't done it

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.195
for these bottom
two worlds at least.

00:18:52.195 --> 00:18:53.570
So we're pretty
confident they're

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.080
planets for various
other reasons,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.270
but again, it's tough to do.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.852
We don't really know.

00:18:58.852 --> 00:19:00.060
There's always uncertainties.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.455
But what's really cool, the
reason why I brought this up,

00:19:01.455 --> 00:19:03.250
is because when you
get the wobble, when

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.240
you get that measurement
of the wobbling star,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.319
and you pair it with
the light curve,

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:09.110
the light curve is
giving you the estimated

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.790
size of the planet.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.210
The wobble is giving
you the estimated mass.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.420
So let's put those together.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.200
I know you're all
good at math, right?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.302
Mass, size, you get density.

00:19:20.302 --> 00:19:20.965
That's amazing.

00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:23.090
So what we're doing is
we're finding these planets,

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.620
and we can actually
determine whether or not

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.745
they're mostly made of
something like water or rock

00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:28.240
or metal or gas.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.990
And that's phenomenal.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.780
But it's not really enough.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.374
It's really still not telling
us what we really want to know,

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.040
the Earth-like planets,
the planets that

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.290
might be like ours, the
planets that might harbor life

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.020
that we could maybe someday
go to like Von Braun wanted.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.290
So you're probably thinking,
I didn't come here for this.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.510
It's after lunch, I'm tired.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.301
Like why is this guy
being such a buzzkill?

00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:50.930
Why is this guy just going
on about all the things

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.870
we don't know?

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:52.980
I'm sorry.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.550
I apologize.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.710
But this is why.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.350
This is why.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.016
This, what you're
looking at right here,

00:19:57.016 --> 00:20:04.810
is Venus as seen during its
transit last year, 2012.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.830
I think this image is
really emblematic of where

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.290
we are right now in our search
for habitable exoplanets.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.827
You can kind of
look at it, and you

00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:14.450
can tell that that's a planet.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.032
You can get an
estimate of its size.

00:20:16.032 --> 00:20:17.990
Maybe you can figure out
its mass a little bit.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.450
You can get its orbital period.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.100
But there's not a
lot to go on there.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.040
You really don't
know much about it.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.910
And what's important about
this, and what's particularly

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.076
kind of resonant, is that
you have to remember that,

00:20:27.076 --> 00:20:30.010
up until the 1950s, for
centuries people thought

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.010
that Venus was a
wonderful place to live

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.260
because it gets more sunlight.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.250
But it's covered with
clouds, and those clouds

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.490
act like a shield.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.460
So they, essentially,
reflect more sunlight,

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.149
so it's really
doing pretty well.

00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:43.690
If you just run the simple math,
it should be nice down there

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:43.965
and clement.

00:20:43.965 --> 00:20:45.381
And people for a
long time thought

00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:47.690
there was going to be like
carboniferous jungles,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.410
and dinosaurs, and
flying men, things

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.960
like that, all kinds
of crazy stuff.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.160
And wasn't until the
1950s that we actually

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.420
started getting a better idea.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.570
We started looking at
microwave radiation coming out

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.320
of the atmosphere.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.430
It was suggested it was
hot enough to melt lead.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.900
We started seeing things like
polarization measurements

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:08.162
of its atmosphere that suggested
that it had sulfuric acid rain.

00:21:08.162 --> 00:21:09.620
And now, of course,
we send probes.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.411
We know that it's a
terrible place to live.

00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:14.380
It's the worst place to live in
the solar system pretty much.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:19.030
But we were fooled for a long
time for pretty sound reasons.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.142
And the whole point is that
this is a world right next door

00:21:22.142 --> 00:21:24.100
that we thought was
Earth-like for a long time.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.020
We were totally wrong.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.324
And we need to keep this in mind
when we make claims or believe

00:21:29.324 --> 00:21:31.740
what's in the headlines about
all these other planets that

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.940
are being found.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.720
So I really want
to drive that home.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.650
But this image is also
emblematic for another reason,

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.984
and it's positive, not negative.

00:21:42.984 --> 00:21:45.400
This is where we start talking
about the really cool stuff

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.180
that can happen.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.410
So look at this right here.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.201
I don't know if you
can see it, but there's

00:21:49.201 --> 00:21:50.660
this little tiny
line that's just

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.920
limning the planet, this
little arc of starlight.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.210
What that is is it's
actually the sunlight

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.232
blasting through the
upper atmosphere of Venus.

00:22:00.232 --> 00:22:01.940
We can actually, if
we study it properly,

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.640
we can determine-- it tells us
a lot about Venus's atmosphere.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.090
And we can do this for
exoplanets, which is wild.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.560
So this is kind of
how the process works.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.670
I'll simplify it a bunch.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.086
What you need to remember is
that whenever light interacts

00:22:14.086 --> 00:22:17.080
with matter, matter kind
of imprints its fingerprint

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.670
on the light.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.960
I shouldn't say matter, but
not dark matter and stuff,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.270
but normal stuff
like us, things that

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.090
are made out of
elements, chemicals.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.880
So it imprints its
fingerprints on the light.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.380
You can split it
up into a spectrum.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.360
You can see little peaks and
valleys, little absorption

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.150
lines and emission lines.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.200
You can figure out
what stuff is made of.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.320
That's how we know what
the stars are made of.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.750
That's how we know the galaxy
is made of the same things

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.580
that we are.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.510
So obviously,
pretty basic stuff.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.986
But yeah, you can actually get
this for transiting planets.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.110
You can detect that signal.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.157
And we've already done it for
some big, hot, puffy worlds,

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:48.115
again, some of these hot
Jupiters that transit.

00:22:48.115 --> 00:22:49.573
We've already gotten
these signals.

00:22:49.573 --> 00:22:53.844
We've seen things like sodium in
their atmospheres or potassium.

00:22:53.844 --> 00:22:55.260
If you did this
for Venus, and you

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.810
had a big enough spectrometer
or big enough mirror

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.980
to gather all the
light, you'd see

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.344
that there's so much CO2
in that upper atmosphere,

00:23:02.344 --> 00:23:03.760
and there's no
water vapor at all.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.670
That would suggest probably
not a good place to live.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.610
Don't pack your rockets.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.720
So this is a nice way forward.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.890
This is a way we can actually
study exoplanets going

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.306
into the future and get a good
sense of maybe what they're

00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:20.070
like, get more information to
pin down our potential targets,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.417
our other Earths.

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:23.500
And what's really exciting
is NASA, to its credit,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.916
has actually started work on
a follow-up mission to Kepler

00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:28.455
called TESS, the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite,

00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:31.634
suppose to launch in 2017.

00:23:31.634 --> 00:23:34.050
It's actually not going to be
able to do this measurement,

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.633
but it's going to be able to get
targets for this measurement.

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:38.547
Because Kepler stars
are mostly too far away.

00:23:38.547 --> 00:23:40.130
They're thousands
of light years away.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.460
We can't get enough
photons from them

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.394
to get this kind of
measurement from them.

00:23:43.394 --> 00:23:44.810
But if there's
transiting planets,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.268
transiting Earth-sized
planets that

00:23:46.268 --> 00:23:49.044
are around nearby stars in
our cosmic neighborhood,

00:23:49.044 --> 00:23:51.210
well, we could investigate
those with the right kind

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.090
of telescope.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.230
So what kind of telescope
are we talking about?

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.180
We're talking about this
thing, this behemoth.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.900
It's great.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.608
It's a workhorse.

00:23:59.608 --> 00:24:01.710
It is starving NASA
of all its money,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.930
or NASA astrophysics anyway.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.430
It's the James Webb
Space Telescope.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.360
This is a full-size model out
of Goddard Space Flight Center.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.060
You can see how honking
huge this thing is.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.930
It's got a 6.5-meter
mirror, primary mirror.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.495
That's all those
golden hexagons.

00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:17.870
That gray stuff
you're looking at

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.680
is a sun shield that's about
the size of tennis court.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.440
This is all going to
be cryogenically cooled

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.460
when it gets into space.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.460
It's going to be packed
and folded into a rocket

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.420
and shot beyond
the Moon, and then

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.720
unfold like kind of like a
piece of origami out there.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.060
And it really needs to
work because if it doesn't,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.080
bad, bad, bad things
happen, and we've

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.770
lost at least a generation of
astronomy and space science.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.320
So it's kind of all-in bet.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.300
But here's kind
of the tough part

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.150
to admit about it is
that James Webb is going

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.180
to be able to do this
so-called transit spectroscopy,

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.550
getting that information
for potentially habitable

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.100
super-Earth planets around
a handful of nearby stars.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.500
It's mostly going to be
looking for water vapor.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.200
And there's a lot of debate
over just what James Webb can

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.290
do, just what Webb can do.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.373
And I have to say I'm kind
of a pessimist on this.

00:25:01.373 --> 00:25:04.160
It's supposed to launch in 2018,
so we'll find out pretty soon,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.840
I hope.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.520
But yeah, it was designed
to study the first stars

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.870
and galaxies, not exoplanets.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.790
And if you look at what's
needed to do this measurement,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.290
to get that little beam
of starlight coming

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.175
around the planet's
edge, its silhouette,

00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:18.800
it's really going to
work best for kind

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.350
of puffy planets, things that
have big, extended atmospheres,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.445
things that might have
runaway greenhouses

00:25:24.445 --> 00:25:27.330
and might be much more
like Venus than like Earth.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.180
So I'm not really
very optimistic

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.950
about us getting the answers
we want, or the answers I want,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.800
which is, again, finding Earth
twins, finding life out there.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.300
I don't think Webb's
going to do it.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.229
I hope I'm wrong.

00:25:39.229 --> 00:25:41.020
But the other thing
you have to think about

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.510
is that, again, we're
talking about transits.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.802
So this is the other aspect
of why it's not that great.

00:25:45.802 --> 00:25:47.384
Remember how I
mentioned that transits

00:25:47.384 --> 00:25:49.567
are a product of really
rare geometric alignment?

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:50.900
How often do you look out there?

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.575
How often do you think a planet
is going to be aligned just so,

00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:55.730
so that it crosses
the face of its star

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.772
and casts a shadow
towards Earth?

00:25:57.772 --> 00:25:58.480
It's pretty rare.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.652
Doesn't happen
very often at all.

00:26:00.652 --> 00:26:02.360
So most of the planets
that are out there

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.360
are going to be totally
invisible to us.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.070
We can't investigate
them this way.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.430
And that's a problem because
you need a big sample size.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.900
We still don't really
understand how life formed here.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.250
There's a lot of questions
we don't understand.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.280
We don't quite know exactly
what we're looking for.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.155
You need to have as big
a sample as possible.

00:26:17.155 --> 00:26:20.120
So if James Webb can do this
for like 10 or 12 potentially

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.820
habitable planets, that's great.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.862
But what if you
find nothing at all?

00:26:23.862 --> 00:26:25.787
You don't know what
that's telling you

00:26:25.787 --> 00:26:27.370
because your sample
size is too small.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.670
But let's say it
goes for 50 or a 100

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.940
or a 1,000 exoplanets,
potentially habitable

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.190
exoplanets, which it can't do.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.310
But if we could get that
kind of sample size,

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.780
well, all of a sudden,
you can run statistics.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.321
You can kind of know
what's going on.

00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:41.522
You can get a signal
out of that measurement.

00:26:41.522 --> 00:26:42.730
So what's that going to take?

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.230
How are we going to get this
sample of 1,000 nearby stars

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.320
or something like that?

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.960
Well, this is how
we need to do it.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.350
This is an example of what's
called direct imaging.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.182
This is a picture from the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:26:55.182 --> 00:26:57.670
It's a planet, or what's
thought to be a planet,

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.061
about Jupiter mass,
orbiting the star Fomalhaut.

00:27:02.061 --> 00:27:03.560
Now, you probably
look at it, and it

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.768
doesn't look that impressive.

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:06.190
But again, Jupiter-mass planet.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.770
Also, it looks like it's
relatively close, but it's not.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.090
This thing is about four
times further out than Pluto.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.590
This thing is cold
and far, far out.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.340
Actually, it's kind
of a little hot, which

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.560
is why it's able to
be detected this way.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.369
And so this is kind of
cutting-edge stuff right now,

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:23.160
but we're going to need
to do a lot better.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.130
We're going to need to get
a lot closer into the star,

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.296
into the so-called habitable
zone, image things that

00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:28.080
are a lot smaller.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.980
And to do that, the best
way to really compare it

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.810
is like saying there's a firefly
orbiting the world's largest

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.470
and most powerful spotlight,
maybe like less than a meter

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.430
away, probably 10
centimeters away.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.680
And that's happening in LA,
and we're here in New York

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.660
trying to look at it.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.580
And you have to blot out all
that light from the spotlight

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.266
just to see that faint firefly.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:49.890
Another way to look
at it is it's like,

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.397
and this is really
much more true,

00:27:51.397 --> 00:27:53.230
it's like an unlit match
kind of on the cusp

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.110
of a detonating hydrogen
bomb, a thermonuclear

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.970
reactor like stars are, right?

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.930
So it's like that kind
of contrast ratio.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.540
It's on the order of 10
billion stellar photons

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.680
for every single one planetary
photon we want to get.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.880
Now, that sounds really tough.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.816
There's a lot of ways we've
kind of figured out in the lab

00:28:10.816 --> 00:28:12.670
to get that
starlight suppressed.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.481
But what it really does
require, if you just kind of say

00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:16.980
we can do the
starlight suppression,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.380
is it requires a
big mirror in space,

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.005
which means it's
going to be expensive.

00:28:22.005 --> 00:28:24.800
Well, how big are
we talking about?

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.710
We're talking about
something this big.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.560
So you've got Hubble
Space Telescope,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.490
revolutionizes astronomy,
two and a half meters or so.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.830
James Webb, going to
revolutionize astronomy too,

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.340
six and a half meters.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.690
These are two
notional designs for

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.310
planet-finding,
life-finding telescopes.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.024
You can tell by the
acronym, ATLAST,

00:28:44.024 --> 00:28:45.440
that astronomers
have been looking

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.320
for this for a long time.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.540
Eight meters, 16 meters.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.540
This eight-meter,
if we ever build it,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.360
would be able to
get us the spectra,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.510
the atmospheric information
and things for hundreds

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.480
of nearby planets,
rather planets

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.090
around hundreds of nearby stars.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.155
And that 16-meter,
that behemoth,

00:29:06.155 --> 00:29:08.030
we're talking about
thousands of nearby stars

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.590
we can investigate for
potentially Earth-like planets.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.260
So this is really exciting.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.890
Why don't we just go out
and build that, right?

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.180
Oh, I should also say that
these ATLAST designs are

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.570
just two of kind of a whole
suite of telescopes that exist

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.230
or notionally exist that have
been designed to do this.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.688
They come in all
different flavors.

00:29:26.688 --> 00:29:28.120
And kind of
collectively, NASA has

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.724
tended to call them TPFs, or
Terrestrial Planet Finders.

00:29:31.724 --> 00:29:34.140
And around the turn of the
century, in the 2000s actually,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.690
they were spending to the
tune of $50 million per year

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.930
to try to make
these things happen.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.350
Originally, they were going
to launch a pair of them.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.516
The first one was going to
operate in visible light.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:47.161
It was going to launch
next year, in 2014.

00:29:47.161 --> 00:29:49.660
Then there was going to be a
more sophisticated, little more

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.630
expensive, infrared version that
was going to launch in 2020.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.340
Well, I guess you
may have guessed,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.840
but we haven't been hearing
about these telescopes

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.381
really very much
recently, and that's

00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:03.330
because they were officially
deferred indefinitely in 2006.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.900
There just wasn't enough money.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.441
And that's because, again, these
things are really expensive.

00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:09.580
We're talking on the
order of $10 billion,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.177
and that's a lot
of money for NASA.

00:30:11.177 --> 00:30:13.010
That's not just chump
change you can dig out

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.839
of the couch cushions
unfortunately.

00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:16.380
Maybe there's another
way to do this.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.716
Maybe NASA isn't the only way.

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.340
I think it's relevant
that I'm speaking

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.798
at one of the biggest, most
powerful companies in the world

00:30:22.798 --> 00:30:26.010
right now who tends to fund
all kinds of crazy things.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.270
Something to think about.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.130
But meanwhile,
the whole point is

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.160
that as we're dithering and
debating over whether or not

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.910
we can do this-- and
just for perspective,

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.576
the amount of money
we're talking about,

00:30:36.576 --> 00:30:39.270
again, is like a couple of
weeks worth of war in the Middle

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.890
East, maybe how much we
spend on Halloween candy

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.120
each year, or pets, right?

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.570
So it's not, in the big scheme
of things, that much money,

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.632
and it's a pretty
big payoff, I think.

00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:52.215
But while we're
debating and dithering

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:54.470
of whether we can do this,
the planets are just,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.340
they're going to keep piling up.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.870
By 2020, it's not
going to be a big deal

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.830
to find these potentially
habitable planets.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.930
But the difference is
is that we aren't going

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.570
to know what they're
actually like,

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.090
and there's this
huge, yawning gap.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.120
Right now, officially, NASA
is thinking about maybe,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.210
maybe doing this in the 2030s.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.770
That just seems like a
long time to wait for me.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.560
Maybe I'm just impatient.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.584
So this is my final slide.

00:31:16.584 --> 00:31:18.000
This is kind of
the payoff, right?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.186
So OK, we make these
big investments.

00:31:21.186 --> 00:31:23.060
We build a telescope or
two that can do this.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.392
What's it going to look like?

00:31:24.392 --> 00:31:25.600
What's it going to do for us?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.579
Well, you may
recognize this image.

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:29.370
I have doctored it a
little bit, obviously,

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.460
with this blue circle.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.950
Earth does not have rings.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:36.810
That is Earth taken by Voyager
1 from a viewpoint of about four

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.420
billion miles away,
passing over to Pluto.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.890
This was taken in, I
think, 1990, not 1991,

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.690
and this kind of approximates
what we would see.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.500
If we build one of
these telescopes,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.144
and we find a little promising
planet and we image it,

00:31:51.144 --> 00:31:53.310
this might be what it looks
like, a "pale blue dot,"

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.849
as Carl Sagan called it.

00:31:54.849 --> 00:31:56.390
Well, it doesn't
seem very impressive

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.342
until you realize how
much we can take out

00:31:58.342 --> 00:32:00.550
of that "pale blue dot,"
the way we can data mine it.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.012
So just look at its
brightness change, the way

00:32:03.012 --> 00:32:04.970
that, as it rotates,
depending on the geometry,

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.511
if we're lucky, as
it rotates, and we

00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:09.932
see the kind of fluctuation of
illumination on its surface,

00:32:09.932 --> 00:32:12.390
if you kind of track that over
a long enough period of time

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.690
via photometry,
light curves, you

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.700
can pin down its rotation rate.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.425
You can get the
length of its day.

00:32:18.425 --> 00:32:20.090
If you get that,
you can bin it up,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.820
you can bin up the data
day by day by day by day.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.790
You know what's passing
under you each time.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:30.030
And you can start to see things
like oceans, or grasslands,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.830
or deserts because these all
have different reflectance.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.009
Grasslands are kind
of medium, mid-scale.

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:37.550
You have oceans that
are really dark.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:40.244
They absorb a lot of light,
except when they kind of have

00:32:40.244 --> 00:32:41.660
to glint every now
and then, which

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.340
is its own thing that
we can use to map.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.820
And then you have deserts or ice
that are extremely reflective.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.230
So you can do very, very
crude mapping, Google mapping

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.730
of other planets beyond
the solar system.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.690
You can do that with
just that point of light.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.810
Again, it's crude,
but you can always

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.240
build a bigger space
telescope, right?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.540
The other thing you can do,
of course, is get spectra.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.050
You can get atmospheric spectra.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.250
You can figure out what's
in that atmosphere.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.259
And when we do this
for Earth-- there's

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:11.550
another famous spacecraft
from NASA called Galileo that

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:15.770
did this for Earth,
I believe, in 1991.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:19.670
You can see the breath of life,
literally, in our atmosphere.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.150
You can see free oxygen.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.569
Oxygen is a very reactive gas.

00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:24.610
It doesn't want to really
hang around in the air.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.390
It wants to fall out
of the air and rust.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.810
It wants to go into rocks.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.230
Yet somehow, our
atmosphere is 21% oxygen.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.390
You can see methane.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:33.780
Methane also does
not really want

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.613
to hang around in the
atmosphere, especially

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:36.738
when there's oxygen around.

00:33:36.738 --> 00:33:38.820
You put oxygen and
methane into a sealed box

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.195
at room temperature
and pressure,

00:33:40.195 --> 00:33:42.540
it's going to turn into carbon
dioxide and water vapor.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.650
Yet somehow, we still
have this breath

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.960
of methane, this wisp of
methane in our atmosphere.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.451
So you can look at
that, put it together,

00:33:49.451 --> 00:33:51.200
and you can kind of
think, well, you know,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.908
it's kind of out of
chemical equilibrium,

00:33:52.908 --> 00:33:54.720
out of thermodynamic
equilibrium profoundly

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.622
by many, many, many
orders of magnitude.

00:33:56.622 --> 00:33:59.080
And we can't really think of
a better explanation for that.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.800
Again, we're blinkered.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.966
We're looking here on Earth.

00:34:00.966 --> 00:34:04.310
We don't know the whole panoply
of life that exists out there.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.060
But that's a pretty
good signature of life

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.190
as far as we can
understand it, and we've

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.719
done it for our own planet
from the depths of space.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.289
So that's kind of
the big picture.

00:34:11.289 --> 00:34:12.580
That's what we're trying to do.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.455
That's what I think
people should get excited

00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:16.510
about for the coming
generations of astronomy.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.665
And I guess I'll just close
by saying this is something

00:34:19.665 --> 00:34:21.290
that I believe in
fervently, obviously.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.600
A lot of other people in the
book believe in it a lot.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.520
And I do think that this
is the kind of thing

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.094
that we could really
do quite soon.

00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:28.469
I think this is
the kind of thing

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.760
that, if we really wanted
to, we could do in a decade.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.580
But the way things
are going right now,

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.090
it looks like we're all going
to be old and grey or dead

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:35.800
by the time it happens.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.216
So I hope that we
can change that.

00:34:37.216 --> 00:34:40.364
So with that, I'll go ahead
and take your questions.

00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:47.684
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:47.684 --> 00:34:48.670
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.090
So you talked a lot about
upcoming space telescopes.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.949
What about upcoming
ground telescopes?

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.115
I know there are quite a
few of those being planned.

00:34:55.115 --> 00:34:56.490
What can they
contribute to this?

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:57.698
LEE BILLINGS: Great question.

00:34:57.698 --> 00:34:58.770
They can do a lot.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.250
It depends on kind of
what you're going for.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:05.070
They can do a whole lot in
terms of trying to pin down,

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.556
for instance, a lot of
the Kepler candidates.

00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:09.430
They can maybe measure
some of those wobbles,

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.740
so you can actually get the
mass as well as the size

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.370
and get the density.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.660
Confirm it's actually a
planet instead of a candidate.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.280
More importantly,
we're really coming

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.300
to this dawning era of
extremely, extremely

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.030
large telescopes.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.820
These are huge
things that are going

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.700
to have big
light-collecting surfaces,

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.760
I think on the order of 30
meters, and that's really big.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.767
And these things, these
kind of big light buckets,

00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:32.350
are probably going
to be coming online

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.120
by the end of the decade.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.580
There's various different
projects, the giant Magellan

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.600
Telescope, the
30-meter telescope.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.660
There's a few others.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.160
And hopefully,
they're going to come

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.493
online by the end of the decade.

00:35:41.493 --> 00:35:45.560
Those could, in theory,
do some measurements,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.850
get some spectra
for, really, kind

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.360
of super-Earth-sized planets
that are orbiting red dwarf

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.852
stars, which are much smaller
and dimmer than our sun,

00:35:55.852 --> 00:35:57.560
and particularly when
they're transiting.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.184
But if you look at the contrast
ratio of that really small, dim

00:36:00.184 --> 00:36:02.645
star, that really big
planet transiting across it,

00:36:02.645 --> 00:36:05.020
that's actually a signal that,
especially in the infrared

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.600
like what you can get from the
top of a mountain someplace,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.615
you could conceivably get some
legit, nice atmospheric spectra

00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:12.600
from.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.210
But it's only going to be
able to do that, they're only

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.820
going to be able to do
that, as far as I know,

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.340
for a handful of
stars in the sky.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.630
So this really gets
back to the question of,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.070
what's your sample size?

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.500
If you want to investigate
hundreds of stars or thousands

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.510
of stars, what you
probably need to do

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.312
to find some other
planet that's like ours,

00:36:27.312 --> 00:36:28.520
then you have to go to space.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.311
Otherwise, you're really
depending on luck.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming first.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.410
So let's say that we are lucky,
and by 2050, hopefully we'll

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.140
all be alive by then, we'll
find a very good candidate,

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.290
like 95% certainty, 20
light years from Earth.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.580
What will we be able
to do about that?

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.670
LEE BILLINGS: Well,
I mean, in some ways,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.440
we're only limited by the laws
of physics and our imagination.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.040
I think that what we do
about it is-- I mean,

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.290
it's kind of up to, I guess,
whoever's in charge then.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.680
But I mean, you can think about
all kinds of grandiose notions

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.632
of building some kind
of small robotic probe,

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:16.090
maybe a series of
them, maybe about

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.559
the size of Coke can,
maybe send voyaging at 10%

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:19.350
the speed of light.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.725
I think that's
probably something

00:37:20.725 --> 00:37:23.140
we could figure out how to do.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.685
Maybe it could return
some close-up images.

00:37:25.685 --> 00:37:27.310
You could think about
things like that.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.380
You can think about building an
even bigger telescope or even

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.380
fleets of telescopes.

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.780
Right now I've been
restricting this conversation,

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.890
just to simplify it, to filled
apertures, big pieces of glass,

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.960
big mirrors in space.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.410
One of the most
exciting things is

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.000
to go with unfilled apertures,
to use interferometry

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.955
to actually link together kind
of like a hyper-telescope.

00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:49.960
You link together a lot of
small, individual apertures,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.474
maybe dishes that are
about a meter in size,

00:37:52.474 --> 00:37:53.890
but you get a lot
of them, and you

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.780
get a big, big
baseline stretched out.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.480
And then you get
enough of that, you

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.880
can get some pretty crazy
surface feature map.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.010
And you can do things like,
I mean, in simulations

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.370
and looking at Earth
from 10 parsecs, say,

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:07.565
you can see things like
phytoplankton blooms

00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:08.440
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.680
You can see coastlines.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.530
You can see mountains.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.370
You can see nighttime
electric lighting.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.700
You can see New York City.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.240
You can see LA.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.699
So there's things
that we can think

00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:20.781
of that we could do that
are even more futuristic,

00:38:20.781 --> 00:38:22.120
or we could try to go there.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.054
But for me, it's not
so much about what

00:38:25.054 --> 00:38:26.970
do we do then, necessarily,
it's just the fact

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.750
that we're kind of
on the cusp of being

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.833
able to do these things,
of being able to find out

00:38:30.833 --> 00:38:34.210
whether or not we're alone for
the first time in the history

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.100
of the biosphere, in four
and a half billion years.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.130
And I'm actually somewhat
more compelled by the notion

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:42.860
that we'll look
out there, and we

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.260
aren't going to find
anything like that.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.735
And I think if
that happens, then

00:38:47.735 --> 00:38:51.591
I don't know if it will really
change the lives of people,

00:38:51.591 --> 00:38:52.840
everyday people on the street.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.230
But I think for people
who think about it,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.275
it might kind of change
how you look at the world

00:38:56.275 --> 00:38:57.790
and how you look
at your own life

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.160
if you realize that
for, let's say,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.244
a radius of 500
light years or 300

00:39:02.244 --> 00:39:03.660
light years around
the Earth, this

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.802
is literally the
coolest thing going.

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:08.760
I think that's a powerful
thing to think about.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.920
And I think if we
had that realization,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.420
maybe we'd take a
little better care

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.960
of ourselves and our planet.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.889
AUDIENCE: Sort of
along the same lines,

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.430
I mean, if we're
looking for company,

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.140
it would seem that
something like SETI

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.250
would be more interesting than
looking for other planets that

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.190
happen to have oxygen.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.160
It might be that all the
cool people out there

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.370
are nitrogen-based
except for us.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.880
Who knows?

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.000
LEE BILLINGS: Right.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.435
Yeah, no.

00:39:29.435 --> 00:39:30.434
That's a great question.

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:33.454
And this is not, in any
way, meant to bash SETI.

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:34.370
I think SETI is great.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.110
I think it's
tragically underfunded.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.735
It's been tragically underfunded
the entirety of its existence.

00:39:38.735 --> 00:39:42.720
And Frank Drake first pointed
a telescope at Epsilon Eridani

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.750
in Taos SETI.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.290
But the problem with
that is that I think

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.922
we have this really
kind of-- you

00:39:48.922 --> 00:39:51.290
know, the inverse-square
law is a real thing.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.381
And if you look at
our own emanations,

00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:55.630
people sometimes think that,
oh, if they're out there,

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.040
they already know we're here
because of "I Love Lucy"

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.840
or whatever that's
going out there.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.470
But I don't think so.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.832
I think if you look at
how big, at least as far

00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:06.540
as we understand it,
how big the hardware

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.092
has to be to detect that even
just a few light years away,

00:40:10.092 --> 00:40:10.800
I don't think so.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.550
So the point is is that all
this radio communication,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.080
or communication
via laser pulses,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.640
whatever it is, it
requires intentionality.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.480
It requires someone
saying, huh, I

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.360
don't want to invest billions
of dollars, a lot of treasure,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.786
a lot of time, into beaming
this message out into space.

00:40:27.786 --> 00:40:29.410
And we're listening
for those messages,

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:30.310
and I'm not saying
that's bad to do.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:31.310
I think we should do it.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.990
But oxygen in an atmosphere,
this kind of disequilibrium

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.610
we're talking about-- and it
doesn't just have to be oxygen,

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:38.460
there's other
things we could look

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.246
for-- there's no
intentionality required.

00:40:40.246 --> 00:40:42.370
It's just something that's
a product of metabolism.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.789
Life exists.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:45.580
And as far we know it,
life has to maintain

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.580
its orderly structures,
so it vents byproducts.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.530
So if you can detect
that in an atmosphere,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.410
it doesn't really
matter whether or not

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.362
the little green men want to
talk to you, you can find them.

00:40:55.362 --> 00:40:57.945
So that's why I think this is a
little, maybe, more important.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.014
Shouldn't say more important,
but maybe prioritize that.

00:41:05.014 --> 00:41:06.180
Then we find the cool stuff.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.924
Then we do the SETI
with the big dishes.

00:41:08.924 --> 00:41:09.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.920
I saw that India recently
launched a Mars mission,

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.010
I guess.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.860
Are other countries or
other space programs

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.680
doing anything interesting?

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.869
LEE BILLINGS: Well,
a guy once told me

00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:22.660
that the best way to
make this stuff happen

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.280
is actually to convince the
Chinese to go out and find

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.270
the nearest 100
potentially habitable

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:32.820
planets and name them all after
departed emperors and things.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.470
Right now,
unfortunately, there's

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.450
not a lot of activity
internationally.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.660
ESA, the European Space
Agency, is doing some things.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.701
They have some really
exciting missions proposed.

00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:43.330
There's one called
"KEOPS," CHEOPS, "KEOPS."

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.110
There's another
one called PLATO.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.710
But these are not kind of
"Battlestar Galactica" scale,

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.210
really large missions
that are going

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.400
to be able to bring home
the bacon, so to speak.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.770
The European Space
Agency was on board

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.080
with NASA for these
terrestrial planet finders

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.100
earlier last decade.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.480
But again, NASA decided we
should go back to the Moon

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.190
instead and keep doing a
few more shuttle flights

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.920
and did that.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.910
So right now, it
is mostly the US,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.830
but the US isn't
really doing much.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:15.160
No one's really doing a lot.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.940
AUDIENCE: It's me again.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.350
So I have a theory.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.280
It's extremely expensive
to launch things to space,

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.020
especially if we want to
put them in the Lagrange 1

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.754
point, which no one
ever done so far.

00:42:32.754 --> 00:42:34.420
So we don't even know
if we can do that.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.960
Maybe it's going to be
more efficient to be

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.570
a little bit more
strategic about it

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:47.450
and invest in ways to deliver
things to space in a cheaper

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.240
fashion, so that
this will be easier

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.100
to bring those big telescopes.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.725
LEE BILLINGS: No,
you're totally right.

00:42:52.725 --> 00:42:54.480
I mean, the main
cost, the reason

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.295
why these things
cost so much and they

00:42:57.295 --> 00:42:59.420
take so long to develop is
because they can't fail.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.840
James Webb is a great example.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.360
Again, it's kind of got the
astrophysics program of NASA

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.984
on the ropes because
it's so expensive.

00:43:04.984 --> 00:43:05.840
It's over budget.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.590
These things are so
expensive because they

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.881
have to be launched into space.

00:43:08.881 --> 00:43:10.675
They have to be built
to not fail in space.

00:43:10.675 --> 00:43:12.600
They have to be built
to survive the launch.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.170
And it's just expensive to get
out into space fundamentally,

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.420
especially if you're doing
something like the shuttle.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.910
I mean, that was
ridiculously expensive.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.430
If we can bring
launch costs down

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:24.800
via like an Elon Musk
Space X, things like that,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.740
or if we can find a way
to maybe build things

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.160
modularly, right,
just like we do

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.540
on ground-based observatories.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.130
No one assembles
a whole telescope

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.525
in a basement someplace, and
then hikes it up a mountain,

00:43:38.525 --> 00:43:40.400
and puts it up there,
and expects it to work.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.844
Instead, you build
it on the mountain,

00:43:42.844 --> 00:43:44.510
and you bring it into
alignment, and you

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.101
make it work from there.

00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:47.350
We could do that in space too.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.069
And there's a guy in the book,
the director of the Space

00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:51.860
Telescope Science
Institute, Matt Mountain,

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.640
who's a very big
proponent of this idea.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.056
He thinks that it's a good
mission for NASA and for NASA's

00:43:56.056 --> 00:43:59.510
Astronaut Corps to do in
the interim of going to Mars

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:00.050
or whatever.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.000
I think it's more exciting
than visiting an asteroid,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.399
personally, if we could build
a big planet-finding space

00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:06.190
telescope up there and
service it in space.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:07.500
That's awesome.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.747
I think we should do that.

00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:10.830
So these are ideas that
everyone's thinking about.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:11.920
And I think you're
on the right track

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.580
that we need to get
launch costs down.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.510
We also need to,
frankly, I think, get

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:20.030
space science solely out of the
hands of big federal agencies

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.530
probably.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.970
Anymore?

00:44:27.281 --> 00:44:29.280
AUDIENCE: I think it was
Neil deGrasse Tyson who

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.710
said that if you just
convince the Chinese to launch

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.680
a massive space program, the
US will be on Mars in a decade.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.830
But you mentioned
earlier that it's

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.350
kind of tough to
get people excited

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.970
about this kind of exploration
because it's so commonplace,

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:42.470
I think.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:46.840
Someone mentioned SETI earlier.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.980
One cool thing they did, maybe
like six or seven years ago,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.700
was they had this
program run out

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.220
of their institute
in Berkeley, I think,

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.760
where they leveraged
the power of the web

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.740
to get a lot of this
heavy processing.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.810
And just where they were
lacking the computer power,

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.330
they just set up this proxy
service where people at home

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:08.220
could volunteer their
computers to help process

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.757
this massive corpus of data
that they were taking in

00:45:11.757 --> 00:45:12.840
from all their satellites.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.340
LEE BILLINGS: I'm a
SETI@home volunteer.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.337
So yeah, yeah.

00:45:16.337 --> 00:45:18.420
AUDIENCE: Do you think
we'll ever get to the point

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.380
where if web is giving us
so much more information

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.190
than we can possibly
sift through

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.640
in any reasonable time,
that we could leverage

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.717
the power of the web to help
quicken the search, I guess?

00:45:31.717 --> 00:45:33.300
LEE BILLINGS: That's
a great question,

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.966
and the great part of the answer
is that we're already doing it.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:39.870
There's a great program called
Planet Hunters that's-- I mean,

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:44.360
I think a lot of funding for
it comes through The Planetary

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.610
Society, which I recommend
everyone support.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.020
And this is something that
actually looks at light curves

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.090
from Kepler.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.570
I mean, we talk about planets
pouring out of the sky.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.160
I mean, Kepler's
like a fire hose

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.000
that we're all
trying to drink from.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.280
There's so much data
that's coming out of it.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.870
The telescope's kind of out
of commission right now.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:02.280
It had this pointing
error, so it's not even

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.320
delivering a lot of new data.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.980
We're still processing
through, churning

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.521
through all that
data from last year.

00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:08.160
So we haven't even
processed it all.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.940
And Planet Hunters
is this great project

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.260
where-- yeah, you go through
and everything's automated is

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.570
what I'm saying for Kepler.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:15.470
So much of it is
just algorithmic,

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.830
where it's like
you flag something.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.680
OK, maybe this is of
interest, goes in this bin.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.971
Oh, it's not, goes in this bin.

00:46:19.971 --> 00:46:24.200
Well, algorithms are imperfect,
and they don't always

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.740
catch things that human eyes do.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.986
And so Planet Hunters,
volunteers go through,

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.610
and they look through
the light curves,

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:31.901
tag things that look promising.

00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:34.110
And actually, they
recently discovered

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.940
a seven-planet system.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.190
That's, I think, maybe the
second seven-planet system,

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.877
maybe even the first
that Kepler has found.

00:46:40.877 --> 00:46:42.460
And that was through
volunteer effort,

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.620
and I think there's a
huge potential for that.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.940
But I just want to say,
the other half of that

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.510
is that I think we can't
get too kind of lost

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.030
in the woods of thinking about
like Kickstarter-like stuff.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.510
Because volunteer work is
great, and that kind of activity

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.760
is great, where you're sifting
through data and stuff.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.710
I'm a little more not so wild
about the notion that we're all

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.170
going to Kickstarter fund
like a big space telescope

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:04.490
to find other Earths.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.010
Just because like,
I mean, how often

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.182
does a $5 billion
Kickstarter program happen?

00:47:08.182 --> 00:47:09.640
And the other
question is like, you

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.801
know, it's kind of an
abdication of what we-- I mean,

00:47:12.801 --> 00:47:15.300
the biggest Kickstarter thing,
the biggest crowdfunded thing

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.630
we have is what we
pay in taxes, right?

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.755
I mean, NASA, in a
way, is crowdfunded.

00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:22.330
It's funded by us.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.140
So I think that if you're
just either resorting

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.180
to the beneficence
of billionaires

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.570
to do this or the
crowd, well, you're

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.200
really missing the fact that,
well, what is NASA doing?

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.070
And then you have to question,
what is NASA's purpose?

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.880
So I think that before we get
on the bandwagon of that kind

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.610
of thing, we have
to really consider

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:41.715
what we already
have on the table.

00:47:41.715 --> 00:47:42.673
AUDIENCE: Well, thanks.

00:47:46.149 --> 00:47:48.190
LEE BILLINGS: Well, it's
been a lot of fun, guys.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.316
Is there anymore questions?

00:47:49.316 --> 00:47:50.564
We can always talk afterwards.

00:47:50.564 --> 00:47:52.030
I know that everyone's
probably got

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.196
other things they got to do.

00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:55.600
So thanks.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:01.270
[APPLAUSE]
