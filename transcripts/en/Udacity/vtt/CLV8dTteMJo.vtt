00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:07.681
Machine learning can change people's
lives through medical diagnosis.

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:10.441
Machine learning
can improve traffic.

00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:12.420
I've built models
even to find out

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:15.301
who had scored more goals
in soccer championships.

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.441
My name is Anderson Luis Amaral.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:22.081
I'm currently the CDO -
Chief Data Officer - at Dataholics.

00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:24.270
I work as the company's
data scientist.

00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:27.021
I also build models
using machine learning.

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:29.830
I'm from Pindamonhangaba,
in SÃ£o Paulo's countryside.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:32.021
I was raised both there
and in the capital.

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:34.681
I didn't know which career
to pursue when I was young.

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:38.461
I always enjoyed looking at data.
I was a very curious kid.

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:41.361
I had to find a way
of channeling that.

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:44.825
I worked with technology, IT,
and software development,

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.021
but there was still
something missing.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:52.441
I have no problem admitting
I was only an average developer.

00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:53.989
I wasn't extraordinary.

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:57.961
I wouldn't even consider myself
a senior developer, far from it.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.853
I took an interest in machine learning,
but I knew little about it.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:03.601
I didn't know where to start.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:07.161
I started studying on my own
and signed up for the Udacity programs.

00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:11.571
As soon as I entered
the field of data science,

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:14.701
I saw a huge difference,

00:01:14.753 --> 00:01:18.486
as I became highly sought-after.

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:21.611
I was truly impressed.

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:26.641
It was huge. I was getting
job offers every single day.

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:29.571
When I met the people
at Dataholics,

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:32.925
they had been operating
as a data mining company.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.365
They would perform data mining,

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:39.341
but would not build any models
based on those data.

00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:44.161
So we sat down and came up
with the machine learning services

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:46.761
that are now the company's
main product.

00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:48.358
When Anderson joined our team,

00:01:48.416 --> 00:01:52.461
not only did we go from a company
that provided data

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:57.281
to one that provided intelligence,
but we also underwent big changes.

00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:00.581
He actually implemented
this machine-learning technology.

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:04.161
That's why I'm a partner now.

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:08.711
He started behind the scenes
and took center stage.

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:10.721
That's what really
happened to him.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:15.581
For the last 4 months, we've won,
on average, one prize per month.

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:20.051
Demand for our products
is so high at the moment

00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:22.361
that we're struggling
to meet it.

00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:24.408
If there was anything
I could change,

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.201
I probably would've studied
machine learning earlier

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:33.001
and would've put it into practice
in my previous jobs,

00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:37.381
because you see surprising results
very quickly

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.241
and you have answers
that only data could give you.
