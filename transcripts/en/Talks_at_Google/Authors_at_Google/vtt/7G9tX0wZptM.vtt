[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:07.940
SPEAKER: Please help me welcome
to the stage Alexis Jones.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.807
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:11.890
ALEXIS JONES: That's good.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.500
I don't need that.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
I think I'm all good.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.133
Hi, Googlers.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.674
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:16.970
AUDIENCE: Whoo.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.920
ALEXIS JONES: I was listening
to all the different cool groups

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.500
you all have.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.080
I'm super into it.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.570
And you have the best
snacks of anything

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.220
I've ever been a
part of-- so the fact

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.680
that I've been obsessed
and eaten more today

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.170
than I have in a week.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.900
I always want to preface
with two questions.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.560
One, are you OK with me having
a conversation with you?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.070
Are you cool with that?

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.050
Awesome.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560
And two, are you OK with me
being really honest and really

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.972
vulnerable?

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:44.930
Are you cool with that?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.429
Awesome.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.720
Because I think, especially if
you're a speaker for a living,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.669
which I am--

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:51.710
I have the luxury of
traveling around and getting

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.730
to have conversations.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.250
It's really easy to get up
and perform until I just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.770
go directly into your schtick.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.950
And I think it's kind of
an injustice to people

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.410
because I think we deserve
to have actual conversations.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.330
So I don't take it
lightly that you're here.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.520
I understand that you all
have a million things that you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.561
could be doing right now.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:10.550
So the fact that you've
shown up means so much.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.758
So I don't take that lightly.

00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:12.600
So thank you.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.985
It's a privilege to be
here in front of you all.

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:16.610
That being said,
we'll kind of dive in.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.401
I'm a big fan of not
reinventing the wheel.

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:21.320
So is there anyone
who's a brave soul?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.520
Not a single brave--

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.020
there we go.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.811
There we go, buddy.

00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:24.770
What's your name?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Todd.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.660
ALEXIS JONES: Todd, do you
mind standing up and reading

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.253
this quote?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.120
AUDIENCE: Sure, absolutely.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.850
ALEXIS JONES: And
by the way, do we

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.975
recognize, what is the
number one fear above death?

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:32.420
Do we know what this is?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.090
Public speaking.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.160
So thank you, Todd.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.510
Can everyone just go like
this and put your hands

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.051
towards Todd.

00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:36.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:37.670
Doesn't that feel good?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.820
We're just going
to keep doing that.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.270
That's just loving
on you, buddy.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.995
Oh, yeah, read it
loud and proud.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.370
AUDIENCE: Martin
Luther King, Jr.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.650
"Our lives begin
to end the day we

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.449
become silent about the
things that matter."

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.240
ALEXIS JONES: OK, that
wasn't even planted.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.200
That was good.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.095
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:52.970
That was legit.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.440
Thank you, Todd.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.240
Do we have one more brave soul?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.750
Yeah, buddy.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.777
What's your name?

00:01:57.777 --> 00:01:57.980
AUDIENCE: [? Maton. ?]

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.563
ALEXIS JONES:
[? Maton. ?] Great name.

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:00.220
Stand up.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.182
Hands up.

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:05.050
You kind of feel it don't
you a little bit, all that?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.520
Yeah.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.830
AUDIENCE: "If you
stand for nothing,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.914
you will fall for anything."

00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:14.330
ALEXIS JONES: There
you go, buddy.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.320
Totally.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.430
I like it.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.094
Thank you so much.

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:20.510
Those are two
things I really live

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.468
by-- this idea of being
silent about the things

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:24.140
that absolutely matter
in this lifetime

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.275
and also the idea of what do
you stand for in this lifetime.

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.150
I think it's going to
be a conversation we're

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.900
going to have throughout
this whole thing.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.757
But that means-- to kind of dive
into a little bit of my story,

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:35.840
which, again, I think is
part of the vulnerability

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.267
piece of being able to get
up and share the things that

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:38.850
are important.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.940
I feel like whenever
you tell your story,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.898
you have to show adorable
pictures of yourself.

00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:43.880
So this was me growing up.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.500
I was a precocious girl
growing up in Austin, Texas.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.180
Do we have any
Texans in the house?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.805
AUDIENCE: Whoo.

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:49.290
ALEXIS JONES: What?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.790
Yes.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.660
OK, Corpus Christi.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.960
Where are we at?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.570
What?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.229
OK.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.020
I love you already.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.785
AUDIENCE: Austin.

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:55.190
ALEXIS JONES: Austin?

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.022
Come on, this is
just getting better.

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:57.980
I just had those chips.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.580
Never had them before,
but they are awesome.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.840
AUDIENCE: They're good.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.200
ALEXIS JONES: Yeah.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.340
That's good to know.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.390
15 grams of protein.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.740
Who knew?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.807
Things you learn when
you're at Google.

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:06.890
So this was me growing up.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.515
And I think the other
thing is, to know

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:11.060
me is to know that
my mother is my hero.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.920
My mom is my best
friend, and she

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.980
is the coolest, most
badass woman I've ever

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.090
met in my entire life.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.070
And the fact that I
get to call her mom,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.112
the fact that she's been
the role model that I've

00:03:21.112 --> 00:03:22.528
been able to emulate
my whole life

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:24.590
is probably my greatest
privilege and probably

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.340
my greatest success.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.150
The other thing to
know about me is I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.740
grew up with four
older brothers.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.690
So I grew up, again,
a precocious girl

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.100
in Texas, four older brothers.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.550
My dad is the best
man that I know.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.890
And he's my real life superhero.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.110
I also happened to
marry a guy named

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.330
Brad Buckman, a kid that
I went to middle school

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.010
and high school with
and didn't know.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.907
But after graduating
college 10 years later,

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:49.490
I wouldn't have seen
or talked to him,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.164
but would come back
around and end up

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.330
marrying this guy who played
professional basketball

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.500
for nine years.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.980
So to understand this
intersection of the fact

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.580
that I grew up with
really being a connoisseur

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.200
of phenomenal men.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.620
My story around men was
that they were awesome,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.650
that was my
experience with them.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.264
And that being said, it led me
to starting "I Am That Girl"

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:11.930
because the other
thing to know about me

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.670
is that I grew up in Austin.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.904
You know the stereotype.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:16.320
What's the stereotype
of Westlake?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.514
And you can be honest.

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:18.180
AUDIENCE: Money.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.084
ALEXIS JONES: Money.

00:04:19.084 --> 00:04:20.959
That was a really polite
way of saying that--

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.320
it's like money-- super
obnoxious, rich, wealthy,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.540
all the expectations
and stereotypes

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.390
that come with that.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.760
The only thing was that
growing up in Westlake,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.009
I always joked that I was
the girl from the other side

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.060
of the tracks.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.584
So I grew up with a working mom.

00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:35.000
And when I said
she was a warrior,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.861
to understand that my
mom was a single mom.

00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:39.110
Her and my mom had gotten
divorced at a young age when

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.526
I was young.

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:41.900
But they were
awesome co-parents.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.400
So I always say we have the
most dysfunctionally functioning

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.216
family that's ever existed.

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.590
But I don't have a memory in
which my mom and dad weren't

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.360
front and center for
everything that I ever did.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.250
My dad coached
everything I ever played.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.930
To have the humility
as parents that,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.970
even in the midst of
a divorce, to say--

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.160
the willingness to die to
their ego, to say our kids

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.180
are more important than
even our own drama,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.180
whatever that drama was.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.940
So I also couple
that with, maybe we

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.910
didn't have a lot of money, but
I was a billionaire in love.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.350
And I think with
great opportunity

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.570
and great wealth comes
massive responsibility.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.370
And that was something
that was really

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.640
imbued in me from a young age.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.949
And so to understand this
idea that there was a massive

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.240
insecurity because I was a
poor kid going to a rich-kid

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.230
school--

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.450
and at nine years
old, the teachers

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.197
pulled me aside and
pulled my mom aside

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.530
and said we're really worried
about Alexis because she's

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.277
showing up to school
smelling like smoke.

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:34.860
And does someone in
your family smoke?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.470
Because we're afraid that maybe
she's sneaking cigarettes.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.200
And my mom didn't have
the heart to tell her

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.630
that she was working two jobs
and going to night school

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.230
as a single parent of five kids.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.730
And to make extra money, she
was a paralegal during the day.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.280
To make extra money, she
would bartend at night.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.640
And then to make even a little
extra money, before we showed

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.940
up to this rich school in
Austin, that we would show up

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.410
to the bar at 5 o'clock in
the morning to clean the bar.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.721
So I was stocking beer,
and I was cleaning urinals

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:04.470
at nine years old.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.600
So I was maids.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.100
My family, we were maids.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.330
And growing up in an environment
where all my friends had

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.510
live-in maids--

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.330
there's a big discrepancy
between the haves

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.220
and the have-nots.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.690
I would say I don't know
what that is for you.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.370
I don't know what
your insecurity is.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.670
We live in a society
that is ruled

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.525
by duality, that is ruled by--

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:28.650
you're too fat, or you're
too skinny, or too smart,

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.858
or you're not smart enough,
or you're too tall or too

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.685
short, or some something.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.060
And whether that's you growing
up with a pill-popping dad

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.890
or whether you grew up
with a deadbeat mom,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.930
or whether you grew up with
some kind of abuse or some kind

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.390
of addiction, the truth is--

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.635
and I think at this
age, we get to talk--

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:45.510
when I talk to middle
school and high school,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.759
it's a different conversation.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.782
But as adults, we have
just enough heartbreak.

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.240
We have just enough
disappointment.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.530
We have just enough failure.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.040
We have just enough
moments of self-doubt

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.080
that can really
justify a cynical life.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.380
And so for me to understand
that I don't have

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.115
to understand the monsters.

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:05.490
I don't have to understand
the insecurities and the masks

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.571
that you wear to understand
this concept of Me Too.

00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:11.820
And I think what's interesting
is we live in a culture

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.742
right now that is driven
by perfection, that

00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:15.700
is driven by a facade,
especially when you look

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.800
at social media.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.820
It's driven by a facade
of a projection of who

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.756
we want people to think
that we are as opposed

00:07:20.756 --> 00:07:21.630
to who we really are.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.338
And we're going to
get into conversations

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:25.980
about the consumption of media
and how much it's affecting

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.560
our belief systems, and
our definition of self,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.540
and how we're treating
people in the world,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.550
and how we're
treating ourselves.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.050
So again, I don't
have to understand

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.520
what your insecurities
are and what you woke up

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.645
with this morning struggling
with what you struggle

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:39.487
with every single day.

00:07:39.487 --> 00:07:41.070
But the irony is
that I actually think

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.359
our insecurities are the glue
that holds humanity together.

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:48.150
And so to flip the
script on the fact that,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.524
rather than hide
our insecurities

00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:51.200
and pretend that
we're not struggling

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.991
and to pretend that
we're perfect, I think,

00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:54.929
creates a barrier for
us to actually get

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:55.720
to know each other.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.360
This power of
vulnerability, the stuff

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.320
that Brene Brown preaches on,
she in herself is a goddess.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.090
But this idea of how can we
learn to accept who we are,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.530
not who we think the world is
telling us that we should be.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.060
That's a silent revolution.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.400
That's the kind of stuff
that has the ability

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.780
to alter the world.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.140
That's the kind of stuff
that Gandhi talks about--

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.625
personifying all that you
wish to see in the world

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.250
and having the courage
to first embrace

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.800
who you are on the
inside and being

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.690
that which you want to see.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.852
That was the impetus
for "I Am That Girl."

00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:31.310
It was the idea
that I was a broken

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.101
girl and I went from
being a poor kid going

00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:34.850
to a rich-kid school.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.591
And then going to USC, which was
like Westlake on crack cocaine,

00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:38.090
right?

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.610
I mean, top three most expensive
schools in the entire country.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.340
So I went to this
private school.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.230
And then, all of a
sudden, it was, like,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.120
all of my insecurities
magnified.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.820
And I ended up doing this
play by Eve Ensler called

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.979
"The Vagina Monologues."

00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.520
And I just remember,
all of a sudden,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.519
it was the first time I
ever had the opportunity

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:57.777
to stand on a stage and to talk
about things that mattered.

00:08:57.777 --> 00:08:59.360
And I don't know
what your passion is,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.540
and I don't know
what your purpose is.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.820
And I don't know
if that's something

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.100
that you get to exercise
here in the grounds at Google

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.300
or if that's something
you get to do

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.591
in your hobby in your lifetime.

00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:09.194
But I know that if we don't
live a purpose-filled life

00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:10.610
in something that
gives us meaning

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.070
that there's an expiration
date on our happiness.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.710
And there's an expiration
date on our ability

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.090
to wake up everyday joyful.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.959
So I did this play
by Eve Ensler and I

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:22.750
got to talk about these
things that matter.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.330
And I came back to my
sorority at the time.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.580
And I sat down with six girls.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.330
And I said, we have a
lot of conversations

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.230
about things that don't matter.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.280
Like, that's the luxury
of a first world.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.400
We get to talk about boys,
and movies, and gossip,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.100
and clothes, and shoes,
and all these things.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.850
What if, once a week,
we had conversations

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.100
about things that did matter?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.360
Would you come?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.110
Would you show up?

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.660
And at that first meeting,
I had six girls show up.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:51.210
And six meetings later, there
were 347 girls showing up.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.730
And what was so
powerful about that

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.604
was that it transcended
the matrix of diversity.

00:09:55.604 --> 00:09:57.020
These weren't just
sorority girls.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.082
This was all the girls from the
international relations classes

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:01.040
that I was involved in.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.270
These were athletes.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.530
These were dudes showing up.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.530
Our star quarterback
at USC, Matt Leinart,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.859
was one of my best friends.

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:10.400
These were alpha dudes showing
up because they were like, yo,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.233
one, I know where the
girls are hanging out.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.600
Two, I too want to
have conversations

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.990
about things that matter.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.020
And what was crazy,
at 19 years old--

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.100
and part of it is blissful
ignorance, right--

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.780
about why not me?

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.990
Why not now?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.140
Those 347 girls have thus
grown into 1.2 million girls.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.740
We have chapters in 24
countries around the world now.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.480
Because I think that, when we're
looking at this generation,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.900
this is a generation
who deeply cares

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.696
about contributing to the world
and, truthfully, don't even

00:10:43.696 --> 00:10:44.820
really know where to begin.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.130
And I think that, that
is an awesome entry point

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.310
to understand a generation
that is inundated

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.660
with so much technology and
with analysis paralysis, quite

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.990
frankly, so many options.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.842
And so to understand this
movement of a million girls,

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:01.800
what's fascinating with
this intersection was--

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.240
I was always such a
tomboy growing up.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.870
I was an athlete.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.430
Like I said, I grew up
with four older brothers.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.054
And we were late to
church every Sunday

00:11:07.054 --> 00:11:09.330
because we were watching
"ESPN Highlights."

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.760
And so I always straddled
this interesting line

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.320
of being an athlete
and a tomboy.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.540
And all my best
friends were guys.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.160
But then, all of a sudden, I
was super into girl empowerment.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.190
And I cared about the
treatment of girls

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.330
because I'd been so blessed to
have been so divinely protected

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.980
my entire life.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.710
And so to see the intersection
of-- after starting

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.530
"I Am That Girl," I ended
up hosting a TV show

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.450
on the red carpet
for three years.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.310
That quickly
transitioned into me

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.170
working at Fox Sports
and ESPN and getting

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.220
to work a lot in the
entertainment industry

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.650
and, again, this intersection.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.810
But it wasn't
until Trent Dilfer,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.370
who's a commentator
for ESPN, who

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.720
won a Super Bowl playing for
the Baltimore Ravens called me.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.970
And he said, here's the thing.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.980
I have this camp.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.940
It's called Elite 11.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.515
It's the top 18
quarterbacks in the country.

00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:55.140
Is there any way that
we could convince

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.960
you to come and give a talk on
the importance of respecting

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.250
girls?

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.410
And I was kind of like
half laughing on the phone.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.200
And I said, Trent, why don't
you bring in some dude?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.790
Bring in some dad
that they respect.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.690
And he was, like,
no, here's the thing.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.460
I actually think
that the conversation

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.690
needs to come from a girl.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.002
And more importantly--
and Yogi Roth

00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:13.710
was involved in this
entire conversation.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.140
He's one of my best friends
who's a commentator-- the face

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.939
of the Pac-12 Network.

00:12:17.939 --> 00:12:19.230
And Yog said, here's the thing.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.720
It needs to come from a girl
because they've been hearing

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.980
this from guys left and right.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.422
But the difference is
not only are you a girl,

00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:27.630
but you know football better
than any of these dudes.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.590
And so they're going to
have mad respect for you.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.559
So you have to come in.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.600
And they convinced me to
come and give this talk.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.110
And I called my husband Brad,
who's a 6' 9" poster boy

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.610
of feminism.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.350
I call him, and I
say, babe, they want

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.600
me to come and give this talk.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.260
I've never spoken
to guys before.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.010
What do you think?

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.760
How should I go
about doing this?

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.385
And he said, the
truth is, you're going

00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:48.870
to have to reframe it for guys.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.740
Because the truth is, to
understand where they're coming

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.325
from, you have to reframe it.

00:12:55.325 --> 00:12:56.700
Because he said
here's the thing.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.074
At 18 years old, when you're
talking about sexual assault

00:12:59.074 --> 00:13:02.250
prevention, an 18-year-old boy
doesn't get past the word sex,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.750
right?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.830
You're like sexual
assault prevention,

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.980
and they're, like, sex.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.480
Right?

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.682
And all of a sudden, they are
imagining the hot sorority

00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:09.890
girls that they want to bang.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.649
That's the truth.

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:12.440
He's, like, that is
who they are imagining.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.856
So he said, if I
were you, I would

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.770
pull pictures of
their sisters and moms

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.870
and girlfriends
from social media,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.330
and I'd put it in
your presentation.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.930
So what I didn't anticipate
on the other side

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.184
of this video that
was aired on ESPN

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.100
was that a week later
everything with Ray Rice

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.652
would come out, right?

00:13:32.652 --> 00:13:35.390
So a couple of years ago, Ray
Rice hitting his girlfriend

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.870
in the elevator, and that
would clearly go viral.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.570
And having been the girl
in the locker room giving

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.784
these tough love conversations
with these guys, that suddenly

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:48.200
overnight-- and I went from--
and I've joked at this point

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.783
that, over the past decade, I've
keynoted every single women's

00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:53.090
conference in America.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.510
And overnight, I was hired
by Division I locker rooms

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.892
all over the country to
have this conversation

00:13:58.892 --> 00:14:01.100
with young men on the
importance of respecting women.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.300
Because when we start
looking at the statistics,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.340
the pandemic levels--

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.850
1 in 4 girls would be sexually
assaulted on a college campus.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.640
University of Texas just came
out a report that 1 in 3 girls

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.600
have been sexually
assaulted on their campus.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.975
There's another
university that I

00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:18.590
won't name because their
survey hasn't gone public,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.730
but 78% of girls in
a major university

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.670
have been sexually assaulted
on their college campus.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.910
We know the staggering 1 in
3 teens experienced some form

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.270
of physical abuse or threat.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.440
And the thing about that stat
that is the most terrifying

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.986
is, oftentimes, that's their
actual definition of love

00:14:35.986 --> 00:14:37.610
because that's coming
from a boyfriend.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.210
1 in 2 women are walking around
having experienced something.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.890
So we're beyond pandemic levels.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.620
And to understand
also the 1 in 4--

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.420
that's based off of
only 20% of girls

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.390
who will ever say anything.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.456
96% of girls who get
admitted into rehab

00:14:52.456 --> 00:14:54.580
are sexually assaulted at
some point in their life.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.390
So you can imagine, when
you do the real math,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.520
we're beyond pandemic
levels of what's happening.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.350
We're a first world, and we
can't send our daughters,

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.870
and our sisters, and our girls
to get a higher education

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.265
without flipping a coin.

00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:07.140
To me, I think that
every single generation--

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.714
I think that in
any given lifetime,

00:15:08.714 --> 00:15:10.380
that we're presented
with an opportunity

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.000
to understand and to stand
on a side of history.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.376
And I often wonder,
historically--

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:18.750
and I remember
asking my dad when

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.440
I was 14 years old
at the dinner table--

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.390
these are the kind
of conversations

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.590
I had at the dinner table.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.173
I remember saying,
Daddy, do you think

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:28.290
that I would have hidden Jewish
people during World War II

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.502
even though I wasn't
raised Jewish?

00:15:30.502 --> 00:15:32.210
I said, do think that
I would have fought

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.580
at the height of the Civil
Rights for African Americans,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.340
even though I'm clearly
not African American?

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.620
And I remember there
was this brief pause.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.245
And my dad looked at me, and he
said, of course you would have.

00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:45.450
Because I raised a
daughter to lend a voice

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.400
to people whose voice
has been taken away.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.234
And I raised a daughter to stand
for people who can't stand.

00:15:51.234 --> 00:15:52.650
And my god, did I
raise a daughter

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.410
to fight for people who
have no fight left in them.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.882
And I often wonder, in
those historical moments,

00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:01.340
did they even
understand that there

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.310
was an invitation for them
to step up and do something?

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.310
Or were they in a situation
where they were just

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.143
going with the flow?

00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:10.455
And life is stressful, and
there's a million to-dos,

00:16:10.455 --> 00:16:12.080
and there's all these
responsibilities.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.750
And they were just going
through the motions,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.750
not recognizing that, in
any given moment, any given

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.820
lifetime, in any given
generation, that we

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.360
are provided an opportunity
to say what kind of person

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.530
will I choose to
be in this moment?

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.530
And so to understand,
I genuinely believe--

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.154
especially on behalf
of my generation--

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:32.120
I genuinely believe
that this is one

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.360
of the biggest invitations is
the current treatment of girls

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.780
and women.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.940
And I think we've been
going about it really wrong.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.590
And I've been part
of that problem,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.714
if I'm being really honest.

00:16:41.714 --> 00:16:45.490
Because having preached
to women for a decade,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.260
it didn't dawn on
me until this moment

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.940
that we've missed the window.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.110
And we've missed the opportunity
to invite men to participate.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.940
The fact that, for
an entire decade,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.700
I've been preaching in
rooms with only women,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.190
preaching to half the
sky about the problem,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.059
preaching to the
choir, quite frankly.

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:03.850
Because there's not a
woman that I know who

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.190
hasn't had some kind of
incident, some kind of run-in,

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.109
whether it's catcalls,
or sexual harassment,

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.130
or sexual assault, or something.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.630
There is not a woman who
walks around and says, weird--

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.439
I felt safe my whole life.

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.730
There is no-- I mean, that's
why we're laughing, right?

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.855
Because it's so ridiculous.

00:17:16.855 --> 00:17:18.859
And I remember looking
at my husband once--

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.040
and again, 6' 9"
professional athlete.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.849
And I said, what is it like?

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:25.329
And he said, what
do you mean, babe?

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.880
I said, that you've never
one time felt unsafe.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.920
What is that like?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.860
Because every single
day, there is a moment--

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.990
a fleeting, maybe--
but every single day,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.140
there is a moment
as a woman where

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.790
I wonder whether I'm safe.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.470
And whether that is
a physical safety,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.060
whether that is an
emotional safety,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.310
whether that is a mental
or spiritual safety--

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.040
every single moment
from the time

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.070
that I've been conscious
enough to be aware that I've

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.000
experienced that fear.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.260
And what would it be like?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.110
What kind of
liberation and freedom

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.820
would it be to not have
to live with that fear?

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.580
And so to understand
these facts--

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.350
and so when I walked in--

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.830
and his suggestion of put
pictures of their sisters,

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.077
and moms, and girlfriends.

00:18:13.077 --> 00:18:15.160
And in the first three
minutes of the conversation

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.562
when I walked into this
first talk for Elite 11--

00:18:18.562 --> 00:18:20.770
and I said, 1 in 4 girls
would be sexually assaulted,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.350
and it was the
traditional eye roll

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.660
that you get that he'd
already prepared me for.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.110
He was like, here's the thing.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.068
As a professional athlete,
I've heard this talk

00:18:27.068 --> 00:18:29.582
1,000 different times in every
different way of officers

00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:32.040
coming and being, like, you're
going to get 14 years if you

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.000
ever rape someone.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.790
And 99% of these guys would
never intentionally do that.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.040
So immediately, they zone out.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.600
And they're like,
well, I'm not a--

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.140
OK.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.670
This isn't relevant
to me, right?

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.250
Or they bring in, heaven
forbid, a survivor

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.452
who shares her experience.

00:18:45.452 --> 00:18:47.160
And they have the same
reaction of, well,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.590
I would never hold a
woman down while she's

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.429
screaming against her will.

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:54.470
And so when I come in,
and I said, 1 in 4 girls--

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.220
the eye roll of, it's this talk.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.071
OK, I get it.

00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:59.070
And I put up this slide.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.700
And I said, that being
said, what if it was her?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.870
And I memorized 10 to 15 names.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.480
And I've pulled
pictures of their moms

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.950
and their sisters and
their girlfriends.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.010
And I said, what
if it was Sarah?

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.790
What if it was Danielle?

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.470
What if it was your
single mom Laura?

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.840
Talk to me about these women.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.855
And there was a visceral
reaction in the room.

00:19:26.855 --> 00:19:29.230
And now these guys aren't
thinking about the random girls

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.200
that they want to have sex with.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.366
They are thinking about the
only girls in their life

00:19:32.366 --> 00:19:36.150
that they don't want
anyone having sex with.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.550
All of a sudden, it ignited--

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.580
I think that there is truly a
predilection inside of male DNA

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.670
that is hard-wired to protect.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.420
And all of a sudden, it
ignited that version of them

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.000
that wasn't slumped back in
their chair with their arms

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.980
across their body
and their eye roll.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.510
This was a vigilance.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.980
This was a sitting straight up.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.940
This was a call to arms.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.010
This was a battle cry.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.090
This was an invitation.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.370
This was you tell me
what I have to do.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.750
Put me in, Coach.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.760
Because if you're
talking about her,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.870
that's a different conversation.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.780
So you tell me what you
need from me in order

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.250
to show up in this space.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.090
And I was absolutely
unprepared for the reaction

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.630
that half the guys in
the room started crying--

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.800
immediate, visceral,
emotional response

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.380
to seeing pictures of
the women that they love.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.090
And that was the
opportunity, right?

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:32.295
Because the truth is
that this version exists

00:20:32.295 --> 00:20:34.760
inside of every man, right?

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.950
There is a version of us.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.325
And inside of
every woman there's

00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:39.200
a little girl inside
of us that never

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.620
grows up much past this age.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.280
And so to invite
them to participate--

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.770
and the truth is that this
little boy, at a certain age,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.080
gets told that he's not
allowed to feel anymore.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.820
He's certainly not
allowed to express

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.690
how he feels in a society with a
toxic definition of masculinity

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.300
that tells him to perform
in all of these areas that--

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.332
and there are three
consistent things,

00:20:59.332 --> 00:21:01.040
when I walk into a
locker room when I say

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.540
you tell me what manhood is.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.260
Give me words.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.640
And I'll use
something like this.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.931
And I start writing down words.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.480
And every time, they usually
start with really respectful--

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.640
when I say, what
does manhood mean?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.330
And they're like,
it means leadership.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.710
It means protecting.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.740
And it means-- and I
say, OK, that's adorable.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.592
Super sweet.

00:21:16.592 --> 00:21:18.800
I don't think dudes are
rapping about, (RAPPER VOICE)

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.410
this guy's got some
crazy integrity.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.012
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.012 --> 00:21:22.720
I was like, I don't
think they're talking

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.027
about character, and-- right?

00:21:25.027 --> 00:21:26.360
And I'm like, so tell me really.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.039
What are we talking about?

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:30.080
And finally, when we really
start getting honest.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.450
And consistently, in
every single locker room--

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.600
and now I've spent
going on for years,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:43.090
220 days a year in locker rooms
with alpha male athletes--

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.660
three consistently-- be rich,
be famous, bang as many girls

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.200
as you can.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.840
And they're doing
it effectively.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.620
That's the programming that
they're receiving right now.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.700
And so to understand
the fact that there

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.190
is a deep, embedded
programming, to understand

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:05.360
that we, as a culture, have
programmed them very well--

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.450
so to understand what
this programming is,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.540
they're consuming 10
hours of media a day.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.730
10.3 hours on average-- they're
consuming 3,000 brand images.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.570
We have 98% of millennial boys
learn about sex through porn

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.560
at 12 years old.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.010
So we start understanding that,
if you put any human being

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.830
in front of a screen
for 10.3 hours a day,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.890
and when we start to break
down the content that they're

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.470
consuming in the video games
that they play in the music

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.140
lyrics that they're listening to
in the movies that they watch--

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.690
the glorification of
violence against women,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:45.239
the overt hyper-sexuality,
the objectification.

00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:46.780
That I really-- all
of a sudden, when

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.060
I started really digging
into what is going on

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.162
is the fact that,
like I said, they're

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:54.870
doing exactly what we
program them to do.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.900
So it's not actually their
fault. Doesn't mean it's

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.870
not their responsibility.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.092
There's a difference between
stupidity and ignorance.

00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:06.050
And when I come in, and
I talk to them, instead

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.633
of standing on a
platform telling them

00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:10.220
that they're failing at a job
that they didn't know they had,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.600
instead of coming in and
pointing fingers and being,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.660
like, you, as a dude, inherently
should feel bad about yourself

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.440
because-- right?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.900
Instead, coming in and
saying, look, here's the deal.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.751
My bad.

00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:19.250
OK.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.857
As a women's empowerment woman--

00:23:21.857 --> 00:23:23.690
is that a thing-- women's
empowerment woman?

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.910
As a women's empowerment
woman, my bad.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.850
And I apologize on
behalf of the fact

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.111
that we didn't recognize how
important you were and that,

00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:34.610
for a long time, that we blamed
you, and we pointed fingers,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.620
and we stood on soapboxes.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.490
And by the way, that
is not an inspiring way

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.746
to inspire any kind of change.

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:41.120
And instead coming
in and saying,

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.369
actually, we've never
needed you as much

00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:45.410
as we need you right now.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.240
And by the way, the
amount of backlash

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.370
that I get from women in
that statement of saying,

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.740
we need you, and them saying, we
don't need guys to protect us.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.030
And I have to do all
of these asterisked--

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.580
by the way, protector
is not just for men.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.440
It's an invitation to humanity.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.390
Because the truth is
that we all need it.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.370
As women, we have to
better protect ourselves.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.578
I don't just mean physically.

00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:09.770
I mean we are our worst
critics, amen, sisters?

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.300
Are we so brutally
awful to ourselves?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.357
We look in the mirror,
and the only thing we see

00:24:14.357 --> 00:24:16.940
are the flaws and all the things
we wish that we could change?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.502
And then worse is there's
a symbiotic relationship.

00:24:19.502 --> 00:24:20.960
The way in which
we treat people is

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.610
practice for the way in
which we treat ourself.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.170
And the way in which
we treat ourself

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.730
is practice for how
we treat people.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.300
So of course we're so
good at being mean-- like,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.550
the Simon Cowell that
exists inside of our brain.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.910
And we have so
much damn practice

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.590
with the self-loathing.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.310
But then we turn around,
and we look at the way

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.560
in which we treat one another.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.750
If we think we're
brutal to ourselves,

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.124
look at how we
treat one another.

00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:46.060
Look at how we
treat our sisters.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.910
There's a zero-sum game
embedded in how women are raised

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.980
and how we're programmed.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.480
So yes, it's an
invitation for us

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.310
as women to better
protect ourselves

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.380
and to be kinder and more
compassionate and more

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.630
empathetic and more
understanding with ourselves.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.340
But it's also an
invitation for us

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.100
to protect each other better.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.210
And how are we
doing a better job

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.620
of injecting more empathy and
compassion for other women?

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.690
And yes, it is
also an invitation

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.492
for men to participate.

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:15.950
Because I think
that's the only way

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.544
that we're ever going
to see any change.

00:25:18.544 --> 00:25:20.460
Because this isn't a
women's movement anymore.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.200
And maybe that was the
problem to begin with.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.449
This isn't a women's movement.

00:25:23.449 --> 00:25:24.710
This is a human movement.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.460
And if this is, in
fact, a human movement,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.180
then it requires the entire
sky, not half the sky.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.250
So to understand, this is the
current definition of womanhood

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.010
that's been programmed
for us, that there

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.410
are two ways in which women
are told that we matter.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.840
In the same 10 hours of
media a day that we consume,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.850
it's our physical
attractiveness based

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.360
on impossible, unrealistic,
impossible expectation

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.480
of beauty, and it's the
attention that we get from men.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.930
As men, do you have any idea
how powerful that makes you?

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.730
That half of how I
have been programmed

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.930
to matter in this world is the
attention that I get from you?

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.600
So to understand, this is what
our daughters and our girls

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.260
are battling.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.060
Because we're so shocked,
right, that girls

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.440
feel shitty about
themselves when

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.309
that's what we consume
10 hours of media a day.

00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:10.600
The truth is the guys don't
have it much better, right?

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.225
Again, the three ways
in which guys are

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:13.490
told that they matter--

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.090
be rich, be famous, hook
up with a ton of girls.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.020
So this, unfortunately, is
what young men are battling.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.820
So the truth is,
between those two,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.610
you can understand that there's
this perfect storm at play.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.110
And so to understand the perfect
storm is to understand that

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.859
the opportunity to
come into locker rooms,

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:31.830
which are the
real-life gladiators--

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.414
when you look historically,
you look at the guys that--

00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:36.330
all the other guys-- and
when you ask the boys

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.620
under the age of 10,
what do you want to be,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.990
more often than not, it's
a professional athlete

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.850
in some capacity.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.360
So to understand
the way in which

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.880
our culture has
set athletes up as

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.862
these mythological gladiators.

00:26:47.862 --> 00:26:49.320
So when I was given
the opportunity

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.903
and invited into a
locker room to have

00:26:50.903 --> 00:26:53.250
a conversation with the actual
influencers themselves--

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.410
and look, I have horror
stories of the things

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.320
that I've heard in locker
rooms at my expense

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.020
especially when guys
thought that I couldn't

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.200
hear what they were saying.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.410
I walked out of one locker
room after having just finished

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:04.910
a talk.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.110
And right as I turned the
corner, one of the guys

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.890
looked to his two buddies.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.150
And he said, yeah, she
wouldn't talk so much

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.233
with my dick in her mouth.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.120
And I turned the corner, and
I said, hey, man, what's up?

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.660
And his two buddies
bailed him immediately.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.284
Because they were,
like, and we're out.

00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:18.787
See you.

00:27:18.787 --> 00:27:19.620
And I looked at him.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.828
And I said, here's the thing.

00:27:20.828 --> 00:27:23.810
It's actually not-- it's
not personal, right?

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.820
So it's actually kind
of an unoriginal comment

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.580
if we really want to dissect
it to give you insight

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.160
into your degradation
of me as a woman

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.100
and then your overt,
hypersexuality

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.090
of me at my expense
actually isn't personal.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.180
The truth is, what I'm
curious about in this moment

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.220
is who hurt you?

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.370
And there was this long pause.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.180
And I said, did you
have a girlfriend--

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.350
she break up with you?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.712
She cheat on you?

00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:52.170
Your sister mean
to you growing up?

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.310
And there was this long pause.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.851
And he started
welling up with tears.

00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:59.727
We're talking a 6' 5" alpha
dude welling up with tears.

00:27:59.727 --> 00:28:01.310
And he couldn't make
eye contact at me

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.059
because he was staring
down at the ground.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:06.920
And he said, my mom
left me at four.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.250
What fucking woman
leaves a child?

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.900
And he started sobbing.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.710
And I said, here's the thing.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.350
Now that, that's fucking brave.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.040
That other stuff
that you're doing?

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.080
The dick in my--

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.710
that, I mean, come on.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.790
That-- the bravery to
have the vulnerability

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.409
to say out loud the pain and the
fear that you've experienced.

00:28:29.409 --> 00:28:30.950
And then for another
hour and a half,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.533
he sat there bawling
and talking to me

00:28:32.533 --> 00:28:34.550
about how he basically
saw his mom's

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.750
face on every single girl.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.250
And he was so
angry, and he didn't

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.400
know what to do about it.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.191
And he didn't know.

00:28:39.191 --> 00:28:41.689
And I think that that is
the stuff that lights me up.

00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:43.730
The stuff that lights me
up is, last night we did

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.896
a screening of "ProtectHer."

00:28:44.896 --> 00:28:47.900
And when one of the top tennis
players in the entire country--

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.560
who's 19 years old, who's
ranked number one right now

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.994
in this country-- came up to me.

00:28:52.994 --> 00:28:54.410
And he was, like,
here's a thing--

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.452
and then wrote me a text
message this long saying

00:28:56.452 --> 00:28:58.660
if there's anything I could
do, if there's anything--

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.810
I want to be involved in--

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:03.770
I live for the stories of
the hope that exists inside

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.170
of these guys when we
give them permission

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:11.290
to openly communicate
about their pain points.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.734
The truth is, we can inspire
and motivate all day long.

00:29:13.734 --> 00:29:15.400
But the truth is, to
not take the time--

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.316
and maybe this is what
our country is lacking.

00:29:17.316 --> 00:29:19.920
And maybe this is actually
the bigger conversation--

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.690
the intersectionality of we look
at every facet of our country

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.490
right now, and
it's pretty tragic.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.990
You look at the
environment, and you

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.742
look at the political
spectrum, you

00:29:27.742 --> 00:29:29.200
look at the treatment
of women, you

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.710
look at the social issues
that are happening.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.065
And maybe the real point is
it's less about motivating.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:36.440
It's less about
me coming in here

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.600
and inspiring you
and empowering you.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.950
And maybe it's about,
how can we as humanity--

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.287
and Google's the
best at innovation.

00:29:45.287 --> 00:29:46.870
But are we having
enough conversations

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.989
about innovating humanity?

00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:49.030
What does that look like?

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.560
Because we've gotten
really, really

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.387
good at innovating technology
and industry and all

00:29:53.387 --> 00:29:54.470
of these different things.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.430
But what are we doing about
taking a pause to step back?

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.160
Because when you look at every
single industrial revolution,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.250
whenever you look at
dark days, dark ages,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.310
it was always preceded by
technological revolution.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.770
Because sometimes,
maybe it's easier

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.350
to jump on board of
technological advances.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.210
And maybe in those
moments, we actually lose

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.355
sight of the ability for
us to actually engage

00:30:16.355 --> 00:30:17.980
in our own humanity
and say, what do we

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.310
have to do to make sure that
we're constantly injecting

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.370
more compassion and more empathy
and more patience and more

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.100
love?

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.060
And maybe we're
missing the point right

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.117
now in the 10 hours of media
that we consume every day.

00:30:32.117 --> 00:30:34.450
Maybe we've missed the point
of being silent long enough

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.330
to figure out who the fuck
we are so that we can love

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.450
ourselves a little bit more.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.210
Because you can't give
something you don't have.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.170
And if we don't
have self-respect,

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.200
and if we don't have
self-compassion and self-love,

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.864
we are in no position to
offer that to anyone else.

00:30:52.864 --> 00:30:55.280
And so standing in these locker
rooms with the opportunity

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.290
to say maybe--

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.030
maybe I missed it.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.220
One of my favorite
scenes in "Selma,"

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.590
which is an incredible movie,
is two young African American

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.290
activists, and they're talking
to Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.320
And he's sitting
there, and he says,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.360
what are you doing
here in Selma?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.960
And they look at him.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.180
And they say, with all of the
enthusiasm of young activists,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.110
and they say, we're here.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.360
We're trying to create African
American consciousness.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.570
And Martin Luther King,
Jr. Starts laughing

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.072
as an activist veteran.

00:31:21.072 --> 00:31:24.420
And he says, I don't think
that we, as African Americans,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.064
need more consciousness
around the prejudice

00:31:27.064 --> 00:31:28.230
that we experience everyday.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.855
I don't think that we need more
consciousness around the police

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:32.090
brutality.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:35.021
What we need is
white consciousness.

00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:37.020
And all of a sudden, there
was this huge moment.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.760
And it dawned on me that I was,
like, I don't need more women.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.620
I don't need more
groups of women talking

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.220
about how we feel insecure
and scared and unsafe and

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.110
disrespected and
[? degradated. ?]

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.150
We don't need more
speaking to the choir.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.280
What we need is we need
consciousness and buy-in

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.010
from dudes stepping
up to the plate

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:57.440
and being the badass humans
that we know them to be.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.020
What we need is
men to participate

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.840
in this because we're certainly
not doing anything on our own.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.730
And at the very
least, I think we

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.440
can have the humility
to say whatever

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.910
we've been doing isn't working.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:12.380
So maybe it's just worthy
trying something else.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.204
So what's interesting
is, in this idea

00:32:14.204 --> 00:32:16.120
of redefining a rock
star-- so when I come in,

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.220
and I'm able to share
these different videos

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.190
that I think explain it really
well and in a funny way--

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.080
and what's amazing to me is
how receptive these guys are.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.630
We still, I think, have half
the states teaching abstinence

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.640
as the best form of--

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.640
AUDIENCE: Birth control.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.180
ALEXIS JONES: Thank you.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.763
Birth control.

00:32:34.763 --> 00:32:36.400
Contraceptives.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.080
So I think we're
missing an opportunity,

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.360
not only to have the
conversation about innovation

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.110
within humanity.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.170
I think we're actually
missing a conversation--

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.800
or we have the
opportunity, rather--

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.650
to talk about, how are
we disrupting education?

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.260
How are we able
to create videos?

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.860
How are we able to create
edutainment, if you will,

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.214
that is entertaining and
simultaneously educating?

00:32:56.214 --> 00:32:58.380
Because I think that's the
cutting edge of education

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.800
is, let's meet
them where they're

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.860
at as opposed to old workshops.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.250
I mean, when I came in
working with these coaches--

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.252
and like I said, now having
worked for several years

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:10.210
now-- coming in and
working with these coaches.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.070
They were pulling
out these binders

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.320
with dust flying everywhere
with Garfield references.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.860
And this is their sexual
assault prevention programs.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.390
And I was like, in what world?

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.550
Guys aren't doing worksheets
anymore on this stuff.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.396
So how are we creating
digital education?

00:33:24.396 --> 00:33:26.770
And how are we creating stuff
that is funny, and is edgy,

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.000
and is kind of inappropriate?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.700
Because the truth is, the
minute that I have a coach who's

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.550
concerned about my
profanity and my language,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.550
they clearly aren't concerned
about the actual issue at hand.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.897
So I'm less concerned
about dropping an F-bomb

00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:41.230
because I'm meeting these
guys exactly where they're at.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.240
And instead, how we start
having conversations

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.695
around consent
that is educational

00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:48.070
that does prepare them for
these different circumstances?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.340
And how are we also, as a
country and within media,

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.520
redefining what it
means to be a rock star?

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.410
How are we positive
storytelling?

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.960
Because all media ever
wants to talk about right

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.240
now are the bad apples
or the guys messing up.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.362
Well, there are so many
guys doing it right.

00:34:04.362 --> 00:34:06.070
So when we look at
the Brock Turner case,

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.199
why was the entire-- why
does every single person

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.350
in this room know the name
Brock Turner and Stanford

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.489
in this crazy rape situation?

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.730
Why don't we know the
names of Carl and Peter

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.560
who are the two
guys who saved her?

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.489
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.739
ALEXIS JONES: That, two guys
rolled up on a situation,

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.100
saw something sketchy
going on, they literally

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.420
jump off their bikes.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.310
Homeboy jumps up and
starts to run off.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.880
They chase him, they tackle
him, they bring him to justice.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.550
Why was the story
not, two heroes

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.936
from Stanford save a girl?

00:34:36.936 --> 00:34:39.060
Those are the kind of
stories that have the ability

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.860
to change our entire culture.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.469
Because you can't become
what you can't see.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.630
So why aren't we
telling those stories?

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.690
Why aren't we celebrating
the Christian Garcias

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.360
who sees a sexual assault
behind a dumpster at a party

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.409
and walks out, and intervenes,
and does something about it?

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:59.460
Or Manny Wilkins, who's
the star quarterback at USC

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.400
who shows up to I Am That
Girl chapter meetings?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.340
And every time someone talks
about a girl in a locker room

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.980
and refers to her as a bitch,
he interrupts and says,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.960
why's she got to
be a bitch, bro?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.480
That guy single-handedly
is changing the culture

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.510
of his locker room by stepping
up and saying, why you got

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.250
to talk about her like that?

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.030
We don't do that.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:23.730
One dude is changing the entire
culture of his locker room

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.160
because he has been imbued
with the right language of what

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.306
to say in the moments
which people are

00:35:28.306 --> 00:35:30.180
being disrespectful to
say the simple phrase,

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.790
we don't do that.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.780
And as the star
quarterback of this team,

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.470
and as the leader,
and as the captain,

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.980
I'm setting a
different expectation.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.450
Because we treat--
not just women--

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.020
we treat all people
with respect and dignity

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.510
because that's who we are.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.880
How do we inspire
that kind of shift?

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.950
And that's where
"ProtectHer" was born.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.302
It was born out of the
urgency of coaches coming

00:35:52.302 --> 00:35:53.760
to me being, like,
this is the most

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.190
honest and real
conversation that I've ever

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.120
seen on this topic with our
boys that isn't pointing fingers

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.102
and isn't blaming,
but is inviting them.

00:36:02.102 --> 00:36:03.810
I was having coaches
saying, I have never

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.580
had the sexual
assault prevention

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.910
talk where dudes lined
up after the talk

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.040
to come and hug you, to
take selfies with you,

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.960
and are asking where
they can get swag.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.919
Because they want to
wear your hats, and they

00:36:14.919 --> 00:36:15.960
want to wear your shirts.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.770
We just had shirts come out that
say "I play ball, not girls."

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.170
And all of the guys were
like, where can we get shirts?

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.440
Oh my god, I love it.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.180
And coaches are
like, in what world?

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.530
This is crazy.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.714
And so in that same
moment, coaches are saying,

00:36:30.714 --> 00:36:31.380
this is awesome.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.120
We love this one-hour
talk that you're giving.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.786
But really, up until
this point, there's

00:36:34.786 --> 00:36:38.280
never been any
preventative medicine.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.190
We have all of this research
of survivors on the other side

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.120
of this conversation.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.730
But how are we preventing
this before it's happening?

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.160
Not just how are we
providing resources

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.440
which, yes, are
essential to survivors,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.760
but what are we having to do
in order to have conversations

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.586
on the front end to potentially
prevent this behavior?

00:36:56.586 --> 00:36:57.960
And so the coaches
said, is there

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.520
any way that you could
create a program?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.500
Can you create some kind
of education for us?

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.940
Because coming from the
entertainment world,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.800
having worked in
entertainment for 10 years,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.254
working at Fox
Sports and ESPN, we

00:37:08.254 --> 00:37:10.420
feel like you could put
together interesting content

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.836
that these guys
are actually going

00:37:11.836 --> 00:37:13.450
to listen to that
feels relatable that

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.130
feels like something
that is really

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.255
going to make a difference.

00:37:16.255 --> 00:37:18.340
And "ProtectHer" was born.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.220
So to wrap it up the things
that I have learned--

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.970
I want to be respectful
of y'all's schedules.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:25.720
I love this quote.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.570
"I always wondered why somebody
didn't do something about that.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.010
And I realized I was somebody."

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.260
I can imagine that y'all
listen to a lot of talks here

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.920
at Google and that you have far
more impressive people than me

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.257
who come in and share ideas and
all the ways in which they want

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.090
to change the world.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.850
And you're arguably one of
the most influential brands

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.090
and companies globally.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.940
So don't get lost in
the midst of a brand

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.170
and to recognize
that you are somebody

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.004
and that every single
one of us has agency.

00:37:54.004 --> 00:37:55.920
And every single one of
us has the opportunity

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.567
to put our feet on the
floor and to do something.

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:00.150
And if this isn't
your issue, and this

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.540
doesn't resonate-- amazing.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.650
What does?

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.650
Because I think, in the
midst of looking around,

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.650
what feels like really
hopelessness in all areas,

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.450
when you look at
the news any day,

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.150
it's easy to get super depressed
and overwhelmed to be, like,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.190
and I'm going to have
more potato chips

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.330
and get back to my Netflix.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.010
It makes sense to anesthetize
the pain and all of it.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:21.510
But the truth is
you are somebody.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.550
And my god, we have
never needed people

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.460
as much as we need right now
to put their feet on the floor

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:31.430
and to say the simple question
of how can I best serve?

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.097
How can I get involved
and actually do something?

00:38:34.097 --> 00:38:35.930
And it doesn't have to
be on a global scale.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.890
And you don't have to
create a global movement.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.490
But what are you doing to
contribute to this world

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:44.240
to make it even a little bit
better than when we found it?

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.630
The other thing I've learned
is that women need women.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:49.580
Girls need girls.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.136
We are our worst enemy.

00:38:54.136 --> 00:38:56.510
And the truth is that, in the
midst of this conversation,

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:59.750
the part that, oftentimes within
the women's empowerment space

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.630
that they leave out, is that,
when I walk into a locker

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.690
room, one of the first questions
I ask is, raise your hand.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.240
As Division I male
athletes, raise your hand

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.580
if you have a naked
selfie of a girl that's

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.200
been sent to you by someone
you've never met before.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.030
9 out of 10 hands go up.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.120
So it's not just that
guys are out there

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.630
taking advantage of women.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.905
It is that we are now
doing this to ourselves.

00:39:23.905 --> 00:39:26.280
Because we're also consuming
that 10 hours of media a day

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.840
that's hypersexualizing
us and objectifying us.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.550
And somehow, I think
we've lost our way

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.920
into thinking that sexual
empowerment is sending

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.017
naked selfies to dudes that
we've never met before asking

00:39:36.017 --> 00:39:37.600
if we can come over
to their dorm room

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.540
because we somehow think
that the number on their back

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.050
of their jersey is going
to give us meaning in life.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.810
Women need women to remind
us because it's like amnesia.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.540
Every two seconds we forget
how inherently badass we are.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.460
And we need our sisters to
remind us that we are important

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.010
and that we matter and that
we deserve to be respected

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.880
and that we accept the love
that we think we deserve.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.940
And we need to start thinking
that we deserve a lot better

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.980
on all fronts.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.590
Thirdly, love and compassion
are necessities, not luxuries.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.950
Without them, humanity
cannot survive.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.744
We've never needed compassion
the way that we do right now.

00:40:18.744 --> 00:40:20.410
And like I said, the
greatest revolution

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.970
that you could
ever take on right

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.200
now is having
compassion for yourself

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.930
and forgiving yourself for
whatever it was, right?

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.075
For thinking that that guy
deserved you who didn't, and

00:40:32.075 --> 00:40:34.450
you stayed in the relationship
way longer than you should

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.990
have, for thinking that that
girlfriend was supportive

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:42.050
when you knew better, for all
the ways in which we disrespect

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.870
ourselves.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.580
That, I think the true,
like I said invitation,

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.310
to be rebellious
in a culture that

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:52.250
is begging you to stay
on autopilot, the most

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.900
rebellious act
that you will ever

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.400
make is a deep, unapologetic
sense of self-compassion that

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.500
is so fucking radical that you
overflow with that compassion

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.880
and love for other people.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.990
It has to start with you.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.350
And it's so much easier,
especially as women,

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.320
to put our oxygen mask on other
people instead of ourselves.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.430
We need men.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.450
And we don't just
need ordinary men.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.750
We need exceptional,
badass men who

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.410
recognize that their voices have
never been as important as they

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.010
are right now.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:31.230
And that those jokes that are
told in bars, in locker rooms,

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.555
to say the simple
phrase, we don't do that.

00:41:33.555 --> 00:41:35.080
We're better than that.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.080
One of the best things
Billy Donovan talks about

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.480
in our documentary is that
the best relationships

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.380
are confrontational.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.360
And we associate
confrontation with being

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.160
this violent encounter.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.870
And really, confrontation
is just saying,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.340
I'm just going to
hold you to the person

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.048
that I know that you're
capable of being.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:53.070
So when you make inappropriate
comments on any -ism-- sexism,

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.000
right?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.470
On any -ism-- racism--

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.470
that you simply use the phrase
that we're better than that.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:00.642
We're better than that.

00:42:00.642 --> 00:42:02.350
Because those tiny
little jokes and those

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:05.870
tiny little infractions turn
to much bigger infractions.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.190
That tiny little ripple
turns into a tsunami,

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.449
and they're preventable.

00:42:11.449 --> 00:42:13.740
So we've never needed men as
much as we need right now.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.930
And the last thing that I'll say
is that you owe it to yourself

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.190
to be remarkable.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.850
And I don't know what
that looks like for you.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.520
But if that's the only thing
you walk away with tonight

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.760
is that you are
remarkable, and you

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.180
deserve to let that shine in
any capacity that you see.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.010
But I truly think
that we're standing

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.420
at an intersection in
the world and maybe even

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.470
within our own humanity in
which we've never needed people

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.180
the way that we do right now.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.000
So thank you so much
for the invitation.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.327
I appreciate having me.

00:42:51.327 --> 00:42:52.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.910
[APPLAUSE]
