00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't know what the question there is.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay. &gt;&gt;People like it. &gt;&gt;Okay. Good. I'm glad Anisha likes it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay. A question about the upcoming classes. &gt;&gt;I see this a lot.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Will they also be using Python? Yes, they will.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We have four new classes that will be starting in April.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
re-offering these two classes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Three of the new courses are 200 level courses 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that if you complete 101 and understand what we do in 101, 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you'll be ready to take those.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I think they're three really, really exciting courses.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One will be about building web applications, and that's going to be taught by Steve Huffman

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
who was the cofounder of Reddit as well as Hipmunk, yes, which are two of the coolest websites.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you haven't checked those out, I encourage you to do so.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One will be a programming languages course that will use the goal 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of building a web browser to focus the course, and that's going to be take by Wes Weimer,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
who has been out here recording parts of that class this week.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's going to be a terrific class.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The third of the 200 level courses is going to taught by Peter Norvig,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and he's really a legendary programmer and is going to look at ways of using Python

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in more advanced that what we do in CS101 to solve a whole range of interesting problems.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The fourth class that will be offered will also use Python in the course.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm going to teach an applied cryptography.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That course is going to be a 300 level course.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you have fairly good confidence in math--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the Python programming that we use will not go beyond what you've learned in 101.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You would be able to take that class. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm going to assume a little bit more math background than you might have otherwise,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but it won't assume any more programming background than you'll have from 101.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Does anyone have a question?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Followup to that one--f we take the three 200 level classes,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 what would your goal be for what we would be able to do on our own once we've done that?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If you take all of them at once? &gt;&gt;Well, once completing them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Okay, yeah. If you take all of them at once I think you'll be very tired.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I commend anyone who wants to attempt to take all three at once.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You're certainly allowed to and welcome to.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think each one of those is going to be a substantial amount of work. &gt;&gt;They're time consuming.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I think it's going to be really hard to take all three, 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but they will be offered again.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Our plan is to keep offering the courses every 8-week cycle,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so whichever one or two you can take starting in April, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
you'll have a chance to take the other one starting in June.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Each of those courses has a different goal in terms of what material it covers.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Definitely, if you take all three you'll be quite an experienced programmer.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You'll really be able to build and understand complex programs.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The goal for the web applications course is by the end of that course 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
you'll be able to build a web application. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Not only you'll be able to--you will build one.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It will be a blog. It will have user accounts. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll learn how to use APIs to interact with other websites like Facebook API,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and you'll learn about how to make it scale, 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which since Steve Huffman is teaching it, he's built websites that scale--

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Has some experience in that. &gt;&gt;Many millions of users.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I think that will be really interesting.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If you take the programming languages course, at the end of that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you'll understand how to build an interpreter so it's focused around a browser,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but the core part of a browser interprets the JavaScript programs that are in the browser.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
JavaScript is a language fairly similar to Python that runs inside almost all web browsers today.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What you'll do in that class is build an interpreter that can handle not all of JavaScript

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but a core of JavaScript, enough to really understand how an interpreter would work.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You'll also won't be building an interpreter for Python in that class. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but you'll have a much better understand of what's going on behind the scenes

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
when you run a Python program from having built a JavaScript interpreter as well.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Anyone else have a question?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So the question is for the CS101 class being offered in April,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
will it be a re-broadcast of the exact class or talk live again.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
None of the lectures are actually live now.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
There's a lot of editing that goes into producing the lectures.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
When the course is re-offered, we'll be reusing a lot of the content.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Probably most of the lecture content will be reused.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The things that we have ideas how to do better than we did this time we'll try to improve.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Many of the problems from the homework, some will be reused, some will have new problems.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Our goal is to take advantage of the content that we've developed 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and to be able to use that to offer the course again.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But it will still be an experience similar to this one where we do hope to have a group of students

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
going through the course together, doing the homeworks together.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
We haven't figured out exactly how to manage the forums that we have from this offering of the course

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
starting new forums or having ways to access the old forums 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and maybe have them scheduled along with the course.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We don't plan on deleting the old forums.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Right. We don't want to delete the old forums. We have all this content.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But we also don't want the students taking the April course

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 to see the answers to the questions before they have a chance to have their own discussions

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and figure them out themselves.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We haven't figured out exactly how we're going to do that, but well try to make it so

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
it feels like students are going through a class together that's a real class

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
running at the same time but still taking advantage of all the content

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and being able to improve the content based on what we've learned from all of you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
from taking it this time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I have another grading question. &gt;&gt;Sure. &gt;&gt;Okay.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This may sound silly, but what exactly is the purpose of the grading?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Is it just for motivation for those of us who are motivated by it?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is a question about what's the purpose of the grading.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It is really up to you if you care about the grading.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We're providing grading. For many students I think that makes it feel more like a real class.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's a motivating factor.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It is the case that students do the homeworks on the deadlines and take the exam,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the ones who get above the threshold will get a certificate ,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and based on how well they do, they can get a certificate that indicates that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We also have a long-term plan--at least long term meaning this year--

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to have enough courses that you'd be able to do something comparable to a top-level university degree,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
taking courses through Udacity.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Students who are doing that because they want to build a transcript,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
they want to be able to get a job, they want to have something they can show to an employer

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that shows here's what I've learned. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
This demonstrates my ability from having grades in these classes.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Having grades that are meaningful will help us do that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So I see a lot of stress on the forums and in emails to me about the grades.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If you're taking the class because you want to learn to program, 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and you're not worried about that, that's perfectly okay.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I hope people don't get too stressed out about the grades.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's really about learning.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But for students who do want to pursue something like a complete CS degree

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
or take a large set of courses with us and build a transcript,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
then the grades will start to be meaningful and valuable.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Probably from 101, that's not going to be enough to have a transcript.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
For at least most employers, having just had the one class the grading of that class won't matter too much.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But I think it is a motivator, and I hope people will value the certificates that they get,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
because it is a lot of work to do while in the class.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We definitely appreciate your efforts and want to recognize them.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Sorry. Couldn't hear you. &gt;&gt;I had the audio muted, so could you repeat your question?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Oh, it's okay. What programming languages will you be offering courses in after this one?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It's a good question. I don't have an answer to that yet.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We're working on planning the June courses.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We don't have anything ready to announce about those courses yet.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We will definitely eventually have some courses that use languages other than Python,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
but all the courses we have planned now are still using Python.
