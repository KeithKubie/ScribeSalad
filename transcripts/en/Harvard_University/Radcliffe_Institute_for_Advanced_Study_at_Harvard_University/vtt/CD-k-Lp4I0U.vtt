00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.970
- From around the eighth to
the late fourth centuries BCE,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.750
the Greek world consisted
of around 1000 city-states

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.410
concentrated in the southern
Balkan Peninsula and the Aegean

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.580
and spread over the coastlands
of the Mediterranean and Black

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.910
Seas.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.360
In these centuries, the Archaic
and Classical periods that have

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.240
been canonized as
Greek civilization,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390
this network of city-states
was characterized by a close

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.080
relationship with a sea, a
fierce insistence on local

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.010
autonomy, and a complicated
interaction with a powerful,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.700
dominant, non-Greek imperial
state of the Near East--

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.330
Egypt, Babylonia, and from
the sixth century, the Persian

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.930
Empire.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.590
This all changed
suddenly in 334 BCE

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.670
when Alexander the Great,
the young king of Macedonia,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.460
steered his flagship across the
Hellespont and from its prow,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.130
threw a spear onto
the beach of Troy.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.320
With this symbolic
act of invasion--

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.050
a deliberate emulation
of the Homeric heroes--

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.120
he launched his
campaign of conquest

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.180
across the Near East,
North Africa, Central Asia

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.680
and northern India.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.380
Alexander's campaign is one of
the best understood and most

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.100
densely studied moments
in all antiquity.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.590
And it has been turned, in some
complex and often pernicious

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
ways, into the archetypal
case of the European man going

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.150
east of the triumphal and
heroic conquest of Hellenism

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.870
over a supine Asia.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.140
Yet conqueror of the
world though he was,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.440
Alexander failed to
sire a male heir--

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.730
an adult male heir.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.760
And as a result,
in a civil war that

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.550
lasted more than a
generation, his vast empire

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.800
broke into three
great powers ruled

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.310
by lines of kings descending
from his generals.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.140
These offer the
ancient historian

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.510
three usefully
different scenarios

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.360
of Greco-Macedonian imperialism.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.550
In Macedonia,
Alexander's own homeland,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.010
we find the Antigonid
Kingdom, shown in red.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.419
This was basically a
monocultural, Hellenic sphere,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.130
its kings slotting
themselves into

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.310
the long institutional
tradition of Macedonian

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.990
national monarchy.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.870
In Egypt, yellow, the
Ptolemaic Dynasty,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.670
running from Ptolemy I to
the famous Cleopatra VII,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.490
this dynasty ruled the
bicultural, Janus-faced kingdom

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.580
of Greeks and Egyptians
centered on the new capital

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.930
of Alexandria.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.000
And its rulers worked
to fit themselves

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.930
into the ancient pharaonic
paradigm of kingship.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.050
And finally, the kingdom which
is my focus, the Seleucid

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.880
Empire, in green, multicultural
or, perhaps better,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.929
hydra-headed.

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.970
Over the course of the
second and first centuries

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.890
BCE, each of these
kingdoms would

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.010
be defeated by the expansion
of the Roman Republic,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.080
relentless as a tectonic plate--

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.240
first Macedonia, then
Asia, finally Egypt.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.640
The historical period of
these three great kingdoms

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.560
is known as the Hellenistic Age.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.160
It's one of the most thrilling
moments in all ancient history.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.810
From the perspective
of classics,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.820
the spatial frame
of Greek history

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.970
suddenly and rapidly
explodes from the coastlands

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.080
of the Mediterranean to
Central Asia, the Sudan, India,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.090
and the borders of China.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.040
Near Eastern history
and Greek history

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.840
become the same project.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.790
There's a greater
urgency to all forms

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.280
of cultural and
intellectual interaction

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.230
between the Greek world
and former neighbors-- now

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.870
subjects.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.850
The dominant form
of Greek government

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.350
becomes territorial monarchy,
not city-state democracy.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.870
And for the first
time, Greek history

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.630
becomes a true history
of empire, that is,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.969
of a spatially extensive rule
over non-Greek populations

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.260
and all that follows from this.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.590
At its height in the third
and early second centuries,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.750
the Seleucid Empire
extended from Central Asia

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.430
to Bulgaria, from Armenia to
Bahrain before expanding down

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.160
the Levantine coast at the
beginning of the second century

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.550
BCE, when it lost its eastern
and western peripheries.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.950
It had two basic
characteristics from which

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.670
its forms of statecraft and
claims to legitimacy descend.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.780
First, most obviously, an
extraordinary linguistic,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.670
religious, and social diversity.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.680
So from the great Iranosphere
in the east of kind of Central

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520
Asia, Persia, Mesopotamia--
fabulously fertile--

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.740
much of our evidence
comes from here.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.280
Anatolia, including
important Greek city-states

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.280
on its western coast,
and eventually also

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.800
the Levant, so Lebanon, Israel,
the Palestinian territories.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.910
Second foundational
characteristic,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.080
and quite a bizarre one,
actually, the Seleucid kingdom

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.960
was ruled by a dynasty
and an imperial elite who

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.500
came from Greece and
Macedonia, who spoke Greek

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.200
and who privileged
Hellenic cultural forms.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.930
Yet the Greco-Macedonian
homeland

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.770
lay outside the
kingdom's territories.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.390
It was a kind of imperialism
of diaspora, which is

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.450
hard to find a close parallel.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.980
It would be like imagining
British India without Britain.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.320
What I want to suggest today
is that this double situation--

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.450
on the one hand a confrontation
with cultural multiplicity

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.720
and the sense of arbitrariness
that follows, and on the other,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.140
the disembeddedness of
this imperial elite,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.440
the fact of being sundered
from all the traditional forms

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.770
and claims of the
Greco-Macedonian homeland--

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.760
generated forms of statecraft
that tended toward abstraction

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.620
to a degree otherwise
unparalleled

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.660
in the ancient world.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.360
In my first book,
as Judy mentioned,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.070
I explored how this worked
at a spatial level--

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.190
things like grid-planned
cities, road building,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.090
and measurements, geographic
exploration, and science.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.220
This afternoon, I'll
introduce some ideas

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.870
on Seleucid time
reckoning, which

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.240
is the focus of my current
book project, which

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.750
is the new working title,
Time and Its Adversaries

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.360
in the Seleucid Empire.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.190
Now I accept that chronology
and dating may not

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.560
seem the most
exciting of things,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.330
but they're the stuff
that history is made on.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.920
In two respects they
turn the past historical.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.830
Dates allow things
to happen only once.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.800
And dates insist on the
ordering and interrelation

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.630
of all happenings.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.360
An event must be chained
to its place in time

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.580
before it becomes
an available object

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.270
for historical articulation.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.800
And the modes by which we
apprehend such historical time

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.200
frame how we experience our
present, conceive a future,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.760
remember the past,
reconcile with impermanence,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.420
and make sense of a world far
wider, older, and more enduring

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.720
than any of us.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.040
Today, almost
everyone in the world

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.090
thinks of the passage of
historical time in these terms,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.430
and it will sound
completely obvious.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.720
This year is 2018, last year was
2017, next year will be 2019.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.620
We're confident that a
century ago it was 1918,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.100
and in a 1,000 years, it
will be 3018, if there's

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.000
anyone left to name it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.620
All of us are fluent
with these years.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.450
We're used to writing
them everywhere.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.080
As a child, I used to line up
my pennies by year of minting,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.060
and now I carefully note
dates of publication

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.400
in my scholarship.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.410
Year numbers are ubiquitous.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.760
I'm going to ask you to
imagine a world without such

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.320
a numbered timeline.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.540
I think it may be
ultimately impossible

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.380
for us to sort of inhabit such
a world, but we should try.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.420
Because before the
Seleucid Empire,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.330
historical time, the
publican annual marking

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.920
of the passage of years, was
measured in only three ways--

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.930
by unique events,
by annual offices,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.290
or by royal life cycles.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.960
So years could be designated
by an outstanding event

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.920
of the preceding
12 months, selected

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.820
and formulated by
state authorities

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.680
into long lists
of date formulas.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.480
So from ancient
Mesopotamia, something

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.630
occurred, say, in the year
when King Enlil-bani made

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.230
for the god Ninurta three
very large copper statues.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.270
That's how you'd give a date.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.850
Or it could be dated by
the name of the holder

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.070
of an annual office of state.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.210
So say, something happened in
the magistracy of Pythodorus

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.320
from Athens or in the
consulship of two named Romans.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.289
Finally, and most commonly
in monarchic states,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.520
was counting by the regnal
year of an individual monarch--

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.690
in the third year of King
Alexander, for example.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.820
But each of these systems
was geographically localized.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.240
There was no transcendent
or translocal system

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.480
for locating oneself
in the flow of history.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.750
There was no uncomplicated
way to synchronize events

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.660
at geographical distance.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.090
Two quick examples
to illustrate this.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.680
One from the club of
Greek city-states.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.960
The other from the succession
of Mesopotamian kingdoms.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.650
This is how the famous Athenian
historian Thucydides attempted

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.800
to date the outbreak of the
Peloponnesian War, fought

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.676
between Athens and Sparta at the
end of the fifth century BCE.

00:09:19.676 --> 00:09:21.050
And he's doing
his utmost to give

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.330
as precise a date as possible.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.830
The Thirty Years'
Peace, which was

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.550
entered into after the conquest
of Euboea, lasted 14 years.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.980
And the 15th year, in the
48th year of the priesthood

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.850
of Chrysis, and when Aenesias
was magistrate at Sparta,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.460
and there still being two
months left of the magistracy

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.260
of Pythodorus at Athens,
six months after the Battle

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.140
of Potidaea, and at the
beginning of spring,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.770
a Theban force-- a little over
300 strong and about the first

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.660
watch of the night--

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.290
entered into Plataea.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.080
So this first shot of
war must be synchronized

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.280
to non-overlapping diplomatic,
religious, civic, military,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.700
seasonal, and
hourly data points.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.880
Another example,
which I won't read,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.190
but it's from the
mid-sixth century BCE.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.470
It's an inscription
authored or attributed

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.620
to Adad-guppi, the mother
of the last King of Babylon.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.990
Sets up in an
inscription in cuneiform,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:22.010
and it honors her devotion
to the moon god, Sin.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.410
Text is on the screen, you
can read it yourselves.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.970
The point is that Adad-guppi
calculates her 95 years--

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.860
this is the only way
she can do this--

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.770
by totting up the reigns
of six successive monarchs

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.370
from two different empires,
conveniently omitting the king

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.790
her son had murdered
to take the throne.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.090
Thucydides' history and
Adad-guppi's autobiography

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.820
illustrate the complications
of pinning down

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.660
the flow of history
in the absence

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.470
of a transcendent and
translocal system.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.430
Their dates are intimately tied
to central state institutions,

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.620
dependent on a
bureaucratic list making,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.290
ascribable literacy
applicable only

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.480
within a self-limiting
geography,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.270
and highly sensitive
to political change.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.300
Indeed, they're not really
dates at all so much

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.060
as synchronisms
between multiple events

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.680
coordinating a network of better
and lesser known occurrences.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.930
What is being dated
and what dates

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.330
it belong to the
same order of things.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.140
Try to give the date
of, say, your grandma's

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.660
birth, or the invasion of
Iraq, or American independence

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.370
in this manner.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.210
And then try to explain that to
someone from another country.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.270
The founder of the Seleucid
Empire, a general of Alexander

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.650
called Seleucus Nicator,
changed all of this.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.710
He introduced a new system for
reckoning the passage of time

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.590
known as the Seleucid Era.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.770
This was the world's first
continuous and irreversible

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.540
tally of counted years.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.440
And it's the unheralded ancestor
of every subsequent era system,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.400
including the Jewish Era of
Creation, the Islamic Hijra,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.120
the Christian anno Domini
system, and our own Common Era.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.870
This first ever era was
never a regnal count,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.390
never a count of Seleucus
I's years on the throne.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.760
It's opening was
placed in 311 BCE,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.340
over a decade after
the death of Alexander

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.980
when Seleucus regained
control of Babylon,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.750
but six years before he
took the throne of kingship.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.300
At his death in 281 BCE,
his summoned successor,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.280
Antiochus I, did not
restart that calculation,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.740
and all subsequent kings
continued accordingly.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.720
So the date never
reverted to year one.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.320
These two decisions-- at
the coronation of Seleucus

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.100
and at the succession
of his son--

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.260
gave the Seleucid
Era temporality,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.120
a new kind of texture.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.030
As we'll see, the era
counts was decoupled

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:56.230
from the phenomenal order of
things, objects, or events.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.590
It did not represent a king's
reign or imperial office.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.240
It was not dependent on
actions in the real world.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.790
It was simply a regular
measure of duration

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:11.250
that rolled on and on,
paratactic, endless.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.350
The novel texture
of the Seleucid Era

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.260
can be well illustrated
in a tiny cuneiform tablet

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.150
from Babylonia,
which carries both

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.670
the old and the new systems.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.100
As an aside, much
of our best evidence

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.050
for Hellenistic
chronography comes

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.430
on cuneiform tablets,
which usefully combine

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.750
an imperishable writing medium.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.310
So hundreds of
thousands of these

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.150
survive, with an obsession
with accurate dating.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.390
The one I'm showing is about
the size of a smartphone.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.300
The script is a mixture
of Sumerian and Akkadian--

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.910
neither language
spoken at this point

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.390
but preserved by Hellenistic
temple scribes, much like Latin

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.387
in the monasteries
of medieval Europe.

00:13:51.387 --> 00:13:52.970
Showing two sides
of the same tablet--

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.010
could be obverse on the left,
the reverse on the right.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.510
And you can see where a worm
has crawled through the obverse.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.170
This tablet lists out the
astronomical Saros cycle,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.680
that is, the 18-year intervals
in which a lunar eclipse takes

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.750
place on a particular day.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.747
In its preserved
form, it extends

00:14:10.747 --> 00:14:12.830
from the reign of the great
Neo-Babylonian monarch

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.920
Nebuchadnezzar II
in the sixth century

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.710
to the Persian
conquest of Babylonia,

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.870
the Macedonian takeover, and
into the early third century

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.340
BCE.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.700
The text is organized
into three columns.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.770
The right-hand
column simply repeats

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.370
in each row with the number 18.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.070
That's the interval of
duration between the eclipses'

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.160
periodicity.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.390
The middle column identifies
the king in whose reign

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.480
the eclipse series falls.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.480
And the left-hand
column begins by giving

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.760
the regnal year of this ruler.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.180
So an eclipse takes place
on this particular day

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.560
in, according to the
tablet, the 38th regnal year

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.940
of Nebuchadnezzar II.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.350
Then 18 years later, in the
seventh year of Nabonidus;

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.900
another 18 years, the
eighth year of Cyrus.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.690
These are all names to conjure
with from biblical history.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.190
Note that the regnal numbers
in the left-hand column

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.840
go up and down dependent
on life cycle or conquest.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.090
We passed through the
Neo-Babylonian, Persian and

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.780
early Macedonia dynasties up
to the third year of Macedonian

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.820
general good Antigonus,
the One-Eyed.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.080
At this point, the
dating shifts from regnal

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.780
counting to the new
Seleucid Era system,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.077
so I'm showing in yellow.

00:15:26.077 --> 00:15:28.660
The right-hand column continues
as before to repeat the number

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.700
18 with every entry.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.090
The middle column no longer gets
the name of a king but simply

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.126
the syllabic abbreviation "se".

00:15:37.126 --> 00:15:39.000
And this syllable is
repeated without change,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.730
despite the death of Seleucus
I, succession of his son

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.300
Antiochus I, death of Antiochus
I, succession of Antiochus II.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.960
And in the left-hand column,
the year numbers of the Seleucid

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.790
Era accumulate irreversibly at
18-year intervals without ever

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.470
restarting or reversing--

00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:00.210
15, 33, 51, 69.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.880
Amazingly, for me at least,
when the scribe turned over

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.430
the tablet to write
on the reverse,

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.660
the calculations continue, but
the middle political column

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.300
is simply omitted.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.300
So in the right column,
we have the continuation

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.340
of the 18-year periodicity.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.860
And in the left, the
continuous Seleucid Era count--

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:27.240
87, 105, 123, 141,
159, 177, 195, 213.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.310
I'm reading the
numbers because no year

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.940
dates had ever before approached
anything like this magnitude.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.350
So what we witness on this
modest tablet, I think,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.200
is a fairly stark visualization
of the distinctiveness

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.310
of the Seleucid Era vis-a-vis
previous temporalities.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.940
We seem to be watching
homogeneous time transcend

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.410
the world in two stages.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.490
First, in yellow, with the
use of the unchanging syllabic

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.250
abbreviation se,
which itself amounts

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.000
to an entirely new kind
of political abstraction

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.870
for monarchic states.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.990
In a curious way, it's
the passage of time

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.460
which has become the
site of the immutable.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.700
Then on the tablet's
reverse, in green,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.720
we see the absolute autonomy
of the annual reckoning system.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.819
And there's almost
a Jacobin logic

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.630
in this temporal technology
that can do away with a king.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.710
This is temporal transcendence,
a universal, absolute,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.940
freestanding, regularly
increasing number.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.400
One last thing-- perhaps the
most important-- but also

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.740
the hardest to pin down.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.620
We don't know when, after the
introduction of the Seleucid

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.240
Era, this tablet was written.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.520
The Era as a regularly
increasing number

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.840
permitted an entirely new kind
of temporal predictability.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.990
It had been impossible
for subjects of, say,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.250
the elderly Nebuchadnezzar II
in the 38th year of his reign

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.280
to confidently and
accurately conceive, name,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.730
and hold in the imagination a
date several years, decades,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.960
or centuries into the future.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.650
And this was equally true of the
other systems, the year names,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.830
and the eponyms.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.780
Now with the Seleucid Era,
this was easy, unproblematic,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.300
and uniform for every subject
of the Seleucid kings.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.550
One of [INAUDIBLE]
recent novels has

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.890
an image that I
think may capture

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.030
the force of this change.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.520
And I do suspect it was
actually quite profoundly felt

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.460
and, in a way, unnerving.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.160
Quote, "It was as if a
wall had been removed

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.810
in the room they inhabited.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.420
The world no longer
enveloped them completely.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.115
There was suddenly an opening.

00:18:39.115 --> 00:18:41.770
Their glance no longer
met any resistance

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.440
but swept on and on
through more of the same."

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.350
All this would just be
an interesting aspect

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.120
of intellectual history without
greater social significance

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.270
were it not for two
additional factors.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.430
First point.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.010
The Seleucid Era was
only and exclusively

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.880
materialized as a
number and nothing more.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.130
And dates had never
before been just a number.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.860
So in whatever script
the Seleucid Era

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.090
number was recorded--

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.730
and we have it attested in
Greek, Akkadian, Phoenician,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.130
and Aramaic--

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.620
the year's numerical value
was universally stable.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.190
That's to say, within the
extraordinary diversity

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.865
of the imperial territories,
the Seleucid Era,

00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:28.540
as a regular and homogeneous
cryptographic system, achieved

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.380
a regulating and
homogenizing force.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.990
Second point.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.260
The Seleucid Era
year numbers were

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.330
marked onto an
unprecedented range

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.240
of public, private,
and mobile platforms.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.210
Era dates were affixed
to market weights,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.400
amphora handles, royal and
local coinage, building

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.850
constructions, votive offerings,
seal rings, silver bowls,

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.370
royal letters, civic
decrees, tombstones,

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.800
tax receipts, [INAUDIBLE]
boundary markers,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.030
astronomical reports, personal
horoscopes, marriage contracts,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.180
manumissions, and
much, much more.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.490
In a world of
ubiquitous date marks,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.230
I think it's easy
to underestimate

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.590
the sheer novelty, and so
historical significance,

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.870
of this mass year marking.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.760
But to my best
knowledge, this was

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.310
without precedent or parallel.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.830
In no other state in
the ancient world,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.720
in the Mediterranean
or west Asia,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.720
did rulers and
subjects inhabit spaces

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.190
that were so comprehensively
and consistently dated.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.630
In some, the Seleucid Era
proposed fundamentally

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.050
new possibilities and
problems of politics, history,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.100
and religion with which I'm
wrestling in my book project.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.570
It was a new temporal situation
that put enormous pressure

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.480
on long-held notions of
the future and the past

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.640
and, I'd suggest,
one that generated

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.520
new sites of contestation
between empire

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.330
and its subjects.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.985
It's difficult to trace the
effects of this new time,

00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:58.640
for only occasionally
will an ancient source

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.320
make its impact explicit.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.330
Time thinking is
not so much a thing

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.350
that can be held as much
as a mode of existence that

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.940
must be inferred.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.700
So for today, rather than
speaking in general terms,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.620
I've chosen two
case studies, both

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.050
relating to the imperial
administration in which

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.520
this imperial time system was
translated into material form--

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.690
archives and market trade.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.890
The evidence compels
only in its details.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.400
We'll be descending into
the archaeological trench

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.830
to look closely at some
buildings, objects,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.300
and their use.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.150
These very humble remains
offer the only way

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.890
to begin to access how this
time began to pervade society

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.735
and with what effect.

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:42.110
I suspect that to
those who don't

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.890
deal in the ancient world, the
evidence I'm about to present

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.590
would appear
unbelievably scanty.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.840
But they should
also give some idea

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.020
of our method and practice.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.120
The first case study--

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.590
Archives.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.660
The preservation of
administrative data--

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.380
tax documents, receipts, wills,
government orders, and so on--

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.660
have been characteristic
of complex states

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.520
since the Bronze Age.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.020
And by the Hellenistic
period it had

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.270
been going on for many centuries
in the Mediterranean and Asia.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.120
But Seleucid archives stand out
for the institutionalization

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.750
of this imperial time system
as the logic of administration

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.590
in sometimes bizarre ways.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.830
Seleucid archives are
attested in one way or another

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.240
at a number of sites--

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.360
at Sardis in western Asia Minor
where I do my archaeological

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.120
work, at Kedesh in
northern Israel,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.460
at
Dura-Europos-on-the-Euphrates.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.570
This is a site
not far from Raqqa

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.340
and has suffered enormously
from destruction and looting

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.890
by ISIS.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.980
At Seleucia-on-the-Tigris,
Uruk and Nippur in Iraq,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.530
and at Susa,
[INAUDIBLE] in Iran,

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:56.220
and no doubt there are many
others to be discovered.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.500
Less than a handful of
administrative documents

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.310
on papyrus or parchment survived
from the Seleucid Empire.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.830
I think there might be three
from all the territories

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.280
between Afghanistan
and Bulgaria.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.140
But hundreds of thousands
of such documents

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.690
did once exist, maybe millions.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.840
These were rolled up and
sealed with a blob of clay.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.790
And then this blob
was inscribed--

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.420
was impressed with inscribed
seal stones, which functioned

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.600
like authorizing signatures.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.120
While the documents
themselves don't survive,

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.880
these clay sealings have been
excavated in the thousands

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.600
from Seleucid archives.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.490
Each of these clay
seal impressions,

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:37.590
which are called bullae,
bears on its surface

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.210
the seals of public
administration

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.700
alongside personal seals
of the private individuals

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.640
who were engaged in the economic
activity once documented

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.380
within.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.120
The number of separate seal
impressions on a single clay

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.040
bulla ranges from 2 to 40.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.850
So some documents had, sort
of, 40 signatures on them.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.630
In other words,
these clay bullae

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.110
trace the institutionalized
encounters

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.510
between empire and subjects.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.510
Over half of them,
around 16,000,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.030
prominently bear a
standardized impression

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.580
of a Seleucid Era year date.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.010
The shape, size, and
content of the seals

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.800
are uniform across Babylonia--

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.790
ovoid impressions
with short sides

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.710
and slightly
curving longer edges

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.680
carrying a three- or
four-line Greek inscription.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.780
So to give just one
example, the one in color

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.320
at the center of the screen,
the stamp's top line identifies

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.200
the sealed document, which has
now been destroyed, as relating

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.060
to the salt tax-- a tax on salt
[? trey, ?] [GREEK] in Greek.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.730
Bottom line names
the fiscal authority,

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.210
the royal city of
Seleucia-on-the-Tigris,

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.010
on the river Tigris, which
I'll talk about shortly.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.340
And at the center of the seal
in a much larger script is

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.710
the year number in
Greek alphabetic numbers

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.210
[NON-ENGLISH], the year 68.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.810
And as I say, there are
about 16,000 of these.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.440
The Era year number
is privileged

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.500
as the most dominant
element on these bullae.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:11.070
By itself, numbers can
represent the empire.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.860
These thousands of dated bullae
permit the reconstruction

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.370
of the bureaucratic practice
of this new Era time.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.250
It seems that each year,
Seleucid subjects brought

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.870
their documents to the Archive
to be sealed and registered,

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.000
stamped in their own inscribed
seal rings, which usually

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.290
showed personal portraits or
family symbols side by side

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.300
with the Empire's year stamp.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.280
So all participants
in this way were

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.910
pulled into the standardizing,
linear logic of the time

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.510
system.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.720
Further, the number
and uniformity

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.740
of these clay bullae, 16,000
over 1 and 1/2 centuries,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.480
required that the Seleucid
court systematically engraved

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.070
and annually distributed
year-dated sealed rings

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.630
to its officials.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.850
So Seleucid administrators
received and probably wore

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.390
on their person these
Era dates populating

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.280
the civic and
domestic landscapes

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.190
with mobile, breathing
year numbers.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.270
And, obviously, they would
need to be replaced every year.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.270
The vast majority of
these bullae were found

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.150
in the Archive
building from the agora

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.530
of Seleucia-on-the-Tigris.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.870
Seleucia was the earliest
colonial foundation

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.390
of the Seleucid Empire,
established and named

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.090
after the first
king, Seleucus I,

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.730
located just to the
south of today's Baghdad,

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.430
its outline and plan still
very visible on Google Earth.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.040
It was one of the three great
cities of the Hellenistic world

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.480
along with Antioch--

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.030
another Seleucid foundation
in northern Syria--

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.840
and Alexandria in
Ptolemaic Egypt.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.060
It was an entirely new city
conceived as a replacement

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.240
to ancient Babylon with
a rationalized grid plan,

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.870
policy institutions, and a
mixed population of Babylonians,

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.820
Greeks, and Jews.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.790
Estimates for the population
ranged from about a quarter

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.090
of a million to half a million.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.040
The Archive building at
Seleucia was constructed

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.610
along the edge of the
agora, or market square,

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.370
at the north of the city.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.050
And it was a building
precisely constructed

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.380
to meet the new information
ordering structure

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.610
of the Seleucid Era count.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.910
Seleucid's Archive
is the largest

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.320
known from the ancient world.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.810
It's 140 meters long
by six meters wide.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.870
I'm not good at
estimating distances,

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.570
but I think that means about
four or five times the length

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.635
of this room and maybe about
half the width of this screen.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:40.980
Maybe.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.210
The building had
a modular layout

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.210
of 14 identical rooms
linked to one another

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.360
by doorways and access, not
as is shown here on the sides,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.882
but actually at the short
north and south ends.

00:27:52.882 --> 00:27:54.340
And the wall niches
would have been

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.600
filled with bookcases giving the
impression of a long corridor.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.260
More than 25,000 seal
impressions of documents

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.810
were found on the floor of the--

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.870
of these modular rooms
following a devastating fire

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:12.540
after the capture of the city
in the mid second century BCE.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.520
While the bullae have
not yet been processed

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.020
in a way that allows
us to correlate

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.350
the fine spots with the
building's architecture,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.860
it's hard to doubt that some
form of linearized ordering

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.970
was at work.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.000
Certainly, the high proportion
of bullae with Seleucid Era

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.700
dates suggests that
this time system forms

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.870
the principal organizing axis.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.640
At another Seleucid colony,
Dura-Europos-on-the-Euphrates,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.160
one which has now
almost been destroyed,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:47.040
it was a small little archive
room, which it niches,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.800
which circles around
the walls of the room,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.390
each one dated with a year so
that years cycled in order.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.720
Just to explain the
photo-- at the time

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.640
when the site was dug
in the First World War,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:06.060
archaeological photographers
used local workers for scale.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.120
Right.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.220
So the Seleucia Archive
building represents

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.070
a streamlined governmental
knowledge system--

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.470
a uniform, predictable
temporality

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.130
extended over a
defined linear space.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.260
The combination of
dates-wearing officials,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.560
date-stamped documents, and
dated-built infrastructure--

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.160
basically the correlation
of where with when--

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.760
represents a fundamental
simplification of statecraft.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.650
This may seem natural or obvious
to us, but it was in fact new.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.810
If I may reverse
Marx's famous dictum,

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.440
it's as if this building
were constructed by the bee

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.300
and not the architect in its
direct rendering into mud brick

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.450
cells--

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.270
the Seleucid Era's
underlying structure--

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.240
a single idea, unity
in construction,

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.250
and the linear repetition
of an elementary shape.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.650
The Archive building
lined the Western side

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.440
of the agora for
about 140 meters.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.860
It presented an
impermeable walled barrier

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.260
on the city's main
public square obliging

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.200
movement along its length.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.600
Its external aspect was of
an absolute, unrelenting

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.040
linearity.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.340
Indeed, the building's
very shape--

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.650
a long, document-lined corridor
without any real depth to speak

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.420
of--

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.830
comes as close as an ancient
monumental building could

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.030
to a simple line,
as if reproducing

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.110
in its public architecture the
serial, irreversible structure

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.770
of the time count.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.260
Now we might be tempted to
think of archive buildings

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.400
as institutions oriented
toward the past as preserving,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.360
accumulating, and even
arresting temporality.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.690
But they were also, and I think
in much more profound ways,

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:51.600
directed toward the future--

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.560
directed forward.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.810
The registration
of fiscal documents

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.810
was a responsibility
and a promise designed

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.390
to anticipate the
practical needs

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.240
of various legal scenarios--
inheritance disputes,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.610
tax cases, and so forth.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.470
More fundamentally, though,
the Seleucid Archives building

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.220
materialized a confidence
in the continuity

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.070
of the imperial project itself.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.220
This vast building
140 meters long

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.910
must have remained mostly
empty for many decades

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.810
after its construction.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.860
It expressed the inevitability
of a knowable, secure,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.240
and stable future.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.760
Put another way,
the verbal tense

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.000
enunciated by the
Seleucid Archive

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.630
was the future perfect--

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.060
this will have been.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.810
The unparalleled enormity of the
building stretching 140 meters

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.570
into the future
was a translation

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.950
of the Seleucid Era.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.160
It's a daunting spatial
gigantism and all

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.682
that this proclaim.

00:31:50.682 --> 00:31:52.640
I find this building one
of the most terrifying

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.270
from all the ancient world.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:59.120
There's something almost
totalitarian about its design.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.470
I'll now discuss much more
briefly my second case

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:08.160
study, which is Market Trade.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.770
Throughout the ancient
world, trade and commerce

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.530
were sites of enormous distrust.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.630
It was competitive
in ethos, and there

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.560
were information asymmetries
between buyers and sellers.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.470
Accordingly, it had long
been the responsibility

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.200
of civic and imperial overseers
to control and authorize

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.090
the devices of trade, like
weights and measures used

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.030
in the market.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.420
This vesting of integrity
in the impersonal mechanisms

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.300
of commerce, rather than in
the face-to-face interactions

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.530
of fellow traders, was achieved
through visible guarantees

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.470
marked onto the surfaces
of trading standards.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.860
These stamp symbols, or
names of civic officials,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.280
indicated to participants
in economic activities

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.990
that a regulated system and a
unitary system were at work.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.780
If, for instance, Athenian
weights and measures bear on

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.800
their surface the head of
Athena or a double-bodied owl,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.780
Hellenistic amphorae from
the Island of Rhodes,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.300
grain measures from
the Sicilian kingdom,

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.450
and other devices and containers
from many other places

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.890
carried the stamped
name of a magistrate--

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.500
the magistrate in
charge of the agora.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.700
But within the Seleucid
Empire, this guarantee mark,

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.730
the symbol of official
fairness, was simply

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.060
the Seleucid Era year
number, either standing alone

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.420
or associated with imperial
icons or local magistrates'

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.050
names.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.270
Got three fairly
randomly chosen examples.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.680
One on the top left--

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.460
it's called a sekoma
A sekoma is a device

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.420
to measure fixed
volumes of liquids--

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.150
so four volumes of liquids
running along the top.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.750
This is the front of the sekoma.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.560
It would look, if
you were using it,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.200
as if the liquids were coming
out of the lions' mouths.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.290
It's dated to year 170.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.770
Quite a nice piece from a town
called Maresha just southwest

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.080
of Jerusalem.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.500
Very recently discovered in
building work in Tel Aviv--

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.470
a quite crudely made
handle of a jug--

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:10.690
of a jar dated to the year 158.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.760
A lead weight from the
still unlocated city

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.280
of Demetrius-by-the-Sea.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.179
It's a trading city.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:20.690
Clearly, there's a
caduceus, Hermes' staff--

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:25.130
Hermes is the patron god of
trade, a dolphin, the name

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:31.670
of the city, and the year 159.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.400
In other words,
the precise volume

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.040
of a liquid, the
carrying capacity

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.915
of an amphora, the
correct weight on a scale,

00:34:38.915 --> 00:34:42.510
were all authorized
by the year date.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.480
This number functioned
as a shorthand

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.300
for the entire system of
certifying bureaucratic

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.290
institutions and also for
the universal categories

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.150
of calculable and
exchangeable units--

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.350
perhaps the first example
of numericalized time

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.120
serving as a
commercial assurance.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.560
These market devices guaranteed
by the visible Seleucid year

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.220
date, either with themselves
be regularly employed,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.560
or would set the standard
for other shopkeepers.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.020
In these ways, the
imperial time system

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.810
became the locus of the
conventions and categories

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.170
of fair exchange, of the
criteria of reliability

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.660
and credence, and,
fundamentally,

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:26.380
of political predictability
and accredited knowledge.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.830
Most of these market devices
juxtaposed two measures--

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.410
the Seleucid Era dates and
whatever commercial unit

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.610
it guaranteed-- a liquid volume,
mean weight, silver value,

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.990
and so on.

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.270
Some kind of analogy
seems to be at work

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:44.990
here between a temporal regime
that, for the first time,

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.290
was systemized as a regular
numerical and countable

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.950
abstraction and those
sites and activities

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:56.990
where consistency and precision
of units were required.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.080
Such quantification of prices,
weights, volumes, and now,

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.990
for the first time, in
years was a shared technique

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.020
of simplification, a
translation of the world

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.990
into a problem of arithmetic
in order to solve it.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.460
This relationship
of analogy maps

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.280
on to a semantic quality
or characteristic

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.200
termed portability.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.230
Portability describes the degree
to which a semantic technology

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.460
is contextually independent,
applicable beyond itself,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.520
permitting one
domain to be treated

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.425
as if were constituted
by the same principals

00:36:29.425 --> 00:36:32.200
or contain the same
features as another.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:36.465
That is, time is like weight,
is like money, and so on.

00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:39.040
And as we'll see, there
are contemporary hints

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.370
of such transposability
between the Era count

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:46.212
and standardized market units.

00:36:46.212 --> 00:36:48.270
Now as Judy mentioned,
my investigation

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.774
of all this material is
part of the book project

00:36:51.774 --> 00:36:53.190
on the emergence
and interrelation

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.980
of new kinds of time and
historical experience

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.410
in the Hellenistic east.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.435
I'm interested above
all in the emergence

00:37:00.435 --> 00:37:02.460
in the third and
second centuries BCE

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.390
of apocalyptic theologies,
or as I hope to frame them,

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.865
total histories.

00:37:08.865 --> 00:37:11.490
These are texts that run through
a full and extended historical

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.830
timeline from the deep
reaches of the past

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.530
through a succession of
kingdoms or historical periods

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.570
into the Seleucid
Empire and then

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.550
to the predicted
end of time itself.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.510
All our earliest
apocalypses date

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.250
to the period of
the Seleucid Empire

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.060
and they all emerge from the
Empire's core territories--

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.420
Babylonia, Iran, and Judea.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.890
In this sense, the
end of the world

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:38.696
appeared for the first time
in the Seleucid Empire.

00:37:38.696 --> 00:37:40.930
I think it's of the
highest significance

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.020
that these historical
apocalypses don't appear before

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.680
and they don't appear
outside the Seleucid Empire.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.600
They're not found in
the Greek city-states,

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.480
in the Babylonian or
Persian empires, at Rome.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.760
It's a phenomenon restricted to
the Seleucid Empire's subject

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.510
populations.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.970
The theological and political
roots of apocalyptic are,

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.750
of course, complex and multiple.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.350
And an entire discipline
of second temple

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.300
and early Christian
scholarship is devoted

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.565
to this problem of emergence.

00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:14.320
Where does the end of
the world come from?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.740
But the Seleucid Era
has played no role

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.200
in existing research within
either classical ancient

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.112
histories or biblical studies.

00:38:22.112 --> 00:38:25.920
In my book, I'm suggesting
that the ubiquitous visibility

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.400
and bureaucratic
institutionalization

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.835
of an irreversible,
interminable,

00:38:30.835 --> 00:38:34.240
and transcendent
time system provoked,

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.740
as a kind of reaction
formation, fantasies

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.680
of finitude among those who wish
to resist the Seleucid Empire.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.730
That's to say, the only way
to arrest the open futurity

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.190
and endlessness of
the imperial time

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.351
was to bring time
itself to a close.

00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:55.260
Further, that these
apocalypses answered

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.940
the monotonized, depersonalized,
and disenchanted, empty time

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.820
of the Seleucid Empire--

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.260
time that was a mere
passing, and so a loss,

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.840
with a conception
of temporal fullness

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.660
in which everything,
including the future,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.735
was already determined.

00:39:11.735 --> 00:39:14.370
Where all that happened
to you happened for you.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.590
Where history was
shaped, directed,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.870
and reaching toward
a conclusion.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.450
And every event,
however dislocated,

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.070
part of a single story.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:27.690
Above all, these texts asserted
that God, and not the king,

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.600
was the architect of time.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.200
So in my closing
remarks, I'll try

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.020
to elucidate the unworking
of the imperial time regime

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.620
by returning to our
specific case studies--

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:41.690
market trade and archives.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.960
The most familiar of these
earliest apocalyptic works,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.950
and the only one I expect
people not in the field to be--

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.860
to know of is the Book of
Daniel from the Hebrew Bible.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.050
The Book of Daniel was
completed in 165 BCE.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.750
It's the easiest
biblical book to date

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.560
because it recounts a history
which is accurate up to 165

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.134
and inaccurate after.

00:40:02.134 --> 00:40:04.640
It was completed in the
reign of Antiochus IV

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.760
at pyphanes, that is,
during the Maccabean Revolt

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.695
against the Empire,
still celebrated

00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:12.020
in the festival of Hanukkah.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.170
The Book of Daniel is built up
of two main sections-- a series

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.770
of court tales in Aramaic and
then of apocalyptic visions

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.940
in Hebrew.

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.570
But both parts of the book
display a subtle sensitivity

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.830
to Seleucid imperial
symbolism and, simultaneously,

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:31.880
a remarkable capacity
for ideological critique.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.470
I'll focus here
on the famous tale

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.900
of King Belshazzar's
Feast, told in Chapter

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.400
5 of the Book of Daniel.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.310
As the book reports, Belshazzar,
the last King of Babylon,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.220
and his 1,000 nobles, and
his wives and concubines,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.200
were making merry with
the sacred vessels

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.680
looted from the first
Jerusalem temple.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.730
Suddenly, a disembodied
hand appears and inscribes

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.270
mysterious words on the
plaster wall of the palace.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.450
Nobody can read them,
and there's general panic

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:04.140
until the now elderly
Jewish sage Daniel arrives.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:09.300
He reads, "mene, mene, teqel,
upharsin", and then interprets,

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.380
as follows.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.410
Mene-- God has numbered
[INAUDIBLE] your kingdom

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.180
and brought it to an end.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.050
Tekel-- you have been weighed
to kilter in the scales

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.670
and found wanting.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.450
Peres-- your kingdom has been
divided, or I think assessed--

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.660
[NON-ENGLISH]---- and given
to the Medes and Persians.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.570
And that very night, the chapter
concludes, King Belshazzar

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:36.570
was killed and his Babylonian
kingdom conquered by the Medes.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.960
The tale has been an exegete's
puzzle for over two millennia.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.880
What is the connection,
it's been asked,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.620
between the writing on the
wall and the fall of Babylon?

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.580
I think for our purposes, it's
key that the words on the wall

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.990
give the technical names
of market weights--

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.450
mene for a mina,
tekel for a shekel,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.444
and peres for a half-mina.

00:41:59.444 --> 00:42:00.860
And just to
illustrate this point,

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.960
this is a Seleucid mina,
the weight standard

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.850
from the market.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.410
It dates precisely
to the time when

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.980
Daniel would have been
written, and it comes

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.380
from the vicinity of Jerusalem.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.380
Daniel's own
interpretation of mene

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.830
directly links this weight unit
to the enumeration of time.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.320
His interpretation of
tekel adopts the imagery

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.160
of a pair of weighing scales
to visualize God's judgment.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.180
Like a shopkeeper's faulty
weights in the Seleucid market,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.280
Belshazzar and Babylon had
been tested and found light.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.090
So in sum, the famous episode
of the writing on the wall

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.960
pulls into a knot of mutual and
intertwined identifications,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.180
market weight units,
the enumeration of time,

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.040
and the fate of empires.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.740
And this is precisely
the semantic portability

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.280
that I think is first attested
in the Seleucid agora.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.640
It's even more starkly expressed
in a passage from 4 Ezra--

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.860
an apocalypse first
composed in Hebrew

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.170
during the reign of the
Roman emperor Domitian

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.450
in the first century CE.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.510
But in a passage that
cites a lost, probably

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.140
Hellenistic source
text, this apocalypse

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.170
has the archangel
[? Uranio ?] answer righteous

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:23.060
Jews, who are urgently inquiring
when the end of days will come.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.040
And Uranio says, "When
the number of those like

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.560
you is completed.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.020
For God has weighed
the age on the balance,

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.990
measured the times by measure,
and numbered the times

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.750
by number."

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.600
This is only one example
of how apocalypticism

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.350
engages with the Seleucid
Imperial thought world.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.616
I think they're very
closely intertwined.

00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:43.990
It's not simply
that the language

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.180
of Hellenistic
government-- in this case,

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.600
weighing and measuring--
is displaced to God.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.690
Rather, it's the specific
material expressions

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.770
of the new Seleucid Era and the
calculative, authority-vested

00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:01.300
time system these enunciate that
God's true sovereignty exposed

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.670
as hollow and transitory.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.590
Something akin to apocalyptic
fantasies of closure

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.820
seem also to have been
enacted on the ground.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.980
Back to Archives, briefly--

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.720
concurrent with the
large public archive

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.820
we've looked at at
Seleucia were a pair

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.490
of smaller domestic ones
designated by the excavators

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.080
as Archives A and B. Both
collections were deliberately

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.700
burned at the end
of Seleucid rule

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.970
in Babylonia preserving,
as elsewhere, the clay seal

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.160
impressions but
not the documents.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.730
In Archive A, over and
above evidence of burning,

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.487
several seal impressions
of the Seleucid Era date--

00:44:37.487 --> 00:44:39.320
these are the year
numbers-- were physically

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.310
gouged out of the bullae.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:45.250
To quote the excavator, "There
can be no question but that

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.520
the sealings, and presumably,
the documents to which they'd

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.920
been attached, were
deliberately destroyed,

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.870
not for purposes
of cancellation,

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.610
but with hostile intent."

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.956
This was an effortful,
malicious act

00:44:56.956 --> 00:44:58.330
that clearly went
beyond what was

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:03.690
necessary for the obliteration
of the parchment rolls.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.960
A second case is a
little more gruesome.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.410
The monumental
administrative center Kedesh,

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.280
located at the edge of the
Huleh basin in northern Israel,

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.700
had first been constructed
in the early Persian period

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.260
and was used by all
subsequent regimes.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.360
Following the Seleucid
conquest and incorporation

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.940
of the southern Levant at the
beginning of the second century

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.870
BCE, an archive complex was
inserted into the building's

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.120
northwestern corner.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.040
So this suite of rooms here--

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.430
and I'm going to be
focusing on this room.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.740
We can reconstruct from the
small finds, topography,

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.960
and architecture of
the site something

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.840
like a fiscal route
of resentment.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.780
The local inhabitants
of the region

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.220
were obliged to hike
up the steep hill

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.400
to the administrative
center on this ridge.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.880
They would then enter through
this narrow door, pass

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.380
by (carrying their taxes)
a suite of reception rooms

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.390
where the local
administrators lived.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.670
These were elaborate
mosaic floors,

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.030
imported gloss-painted stucco.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:13.620
They would then deposit their
taxes in kind in the bin rooms.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.800
And it seems that records
were taken of payment

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.640
or not payment, so debts
and preserved here.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.660
So if you were to design
a building to generate

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.320
resentment, this would be it.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.270
Excavation revealed
that the Seleucid

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:31.980
administrative
building fell victim

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.400
to two independent disasters
in short succession.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.060
First, the site was suddenly
abandoned during or shortly

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.904
after 145 BCE.

00:46:40.904 --> 00:46:42.570
It's about the same
time as the archives

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.720
were abandoned in Iraq.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.810
Then the main archive room alone
of the entire administrative

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:51.720
center was deliberately burned.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.010
Before the
conflagration, the door

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.000
was blocked up with stones, but
only at the bottom of the door.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.470
So it seems more symbolic
than a practical act.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:04.680
And then two infants
were buried within.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.990
One burial had been too
disturbed for examination,

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:11.460
but the other was sealed beneath
a layer of burnt brick debris.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.000
As you can see, the child's been
interred without grave goods,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.950
and its head, hands, and feet
were cut off before burial.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.490
This deposition was part
of the destruction moment.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.850
It's not a secondary reuse.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.150
The burning of archives was a
recurring, if not especially

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.640
frequent, event in antiquity.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.110
But in our two Seleucid cases
from Seleucia-on-the-Tigris

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:40.760
and Kadesh, the destruction
seems to indicate an additional

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.080
and rather shocking assault.
The gouging out of year dates

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.940
before the burning of
the domestic archive

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.030
at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris points
to something like a symbolic

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.880
annihilation of the
administration, its date rings,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.370
and perhaps the temple
system these manifested.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:00.680
At Kedesh, the motivations
behind the horrific amputations

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.660
and perhaps sacrifice of
the child remain obscure.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.460
Perhaps we're dealing with
a religious polluting, even

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.910
a magical unworking, of
the imperial Archive.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.400
Perhaps it was an
archaizing act reviving

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.370
a defunct religious tradition
at a moment of revolt--

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.790
and there are traditions
of sacrificing babies

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.270
in this area.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.000
But it remains unclear.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.530
Notably, though, even
when the Kedesh site

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.320
was re-occupied by
later inhabitants,

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.676
this archive room
was never again used.

00:48:33.676 --> 00:48:35.050
The destruction
of these archives

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.990
seems to me to be as
much about enacting

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:40.480
a temporal ending
as inciting a more

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.090
general bureaucratic amnesia.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.640
And I think we can place the
symbolic undergound gestures

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.420
of termination alongside
contemporary apocalyptic

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.830
theology.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:55.780
For each-- the Empire's timeline
is linearizable, open ended,

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.880
and pervasively
institutionalized the era

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.840
system--

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.250
was a provocation to finitude.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.190
I don't think it's accidental
that our apocalyptic texts

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:08.340
adopt the archival
imagery of sealing a text

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.650
and filing it away
for the future

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.010
as their mainframing metaphor,
displacing once again

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.900
sovereignty from
the Seleucid king

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.290
and administration to
God and his angels.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:23.260
This cleft door of resistance,
a physically violent,

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.840
disworldly confrontation
with empire,

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.750
and theological fantasies
of God's exclusive kingship

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.750
on earth recur in
various combinations

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.510
throughout the Hellenistic
east, especially as the Seleucid

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.705
Empire begins to crumble.

00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:40.080
Let me close with some sweeping
comments which are really

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.910
provocations for conversation.

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:49.510
The Seleucid Empire was
not a timeless state.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.500
That may be one--

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.300
surprise many of
the people who work

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.580
in modernity or early modernity,
but for the ancient world

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.370
it's quite unusual.

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.140
The Seleucid Empire
did not fashion itself

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.450
as archetypal or mythological.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.780
It did not proceed
or transcend time.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.100
Far from it.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.580
More than its predecessor,
peer, or even successor regimes,

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.280
Seleucid kingship and
governmental practice

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.060
employed and encouraged
the dating of the world.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.970
The Era was everywhere visible
as a basic and necessary

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:23.730
technology of administrative
knowledge and urban life.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:26.560
By being exclusively
numericalized,

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.760
just numbers, the Seleucid
Era marked dates, not events,

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.090
and it was the first
chronological system to do so.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.450
At the same time, by structuring
the kingdom's visibility

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:41.140
and institutions around a
continuous, irreversible

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:45.250
accumulation of years, it made
the Seleucid Empire historical

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:51.240
in a new sense, perhaps even the
first truly historical state.

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.220
This new imperial
time was just one

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.010
of the countless ways in which
we humans have comprehended

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:57.960
historical gyration.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.370
That is, of course, undeniable.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:05.580
And yet the imperial temporality
had also made visible,

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.150
at least in part, and in the
face of every cultural system

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:12.870
generated to deny it,
a terrifying truth--

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.590
the irreversibility, loss,
and indifference of time.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:21.760
In doing so, the Seleucid
Empire made not only a new earth

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.610
but also, as I think we can see
in the emergent apocalyptic,

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.530
a new heaven as well.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.050
It's in this sense,
in the tension

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:32.660
of living between an
empty time of state

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.960
and the core of an ending, of
balancing number with meaning,

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.360
that I think the claim
could be sustained

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.220
that the Hellenistic east opened
a very historical age to which

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.440
we still belong.

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.480
I suspect you're having your
own fantasies of finitude,

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.390
so I'm going to stop here.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.330
But thank you very much
for your attention.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:54.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.980
