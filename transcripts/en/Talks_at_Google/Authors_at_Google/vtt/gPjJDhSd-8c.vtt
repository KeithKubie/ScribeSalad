00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.117
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.117 --> 00:00:03.700
NIKIL SAVAL: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.290
Thank you for inviting
me to your office

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.280
to talk about the
history the office.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.350
It's very, very cool that
you would take time out

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.940
of your lunch hour to see me.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.400
I feel like lunch is sacred, so
this is very, very gratifying

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.900
for me.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.350
So thank you, thank
you for coming.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.530
So, my book is a
history of the office.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.510
The workplace-- not the show.

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.000
You don't know many times
I've had to say that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.164
It's actually people--
when I'm like, yeah,

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:43.330
I'm writing this book, it's
a history of the office.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.274
And they're like, that
sounds super boring.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:48.190
And they're just like,
why did you-- you mean,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.160
you just watch the show
and you wrote about it?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.993
And then I have to
explain, and then they're

00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:54.640
like, that sounds
even more boring.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.180
Why would you do
that with your day?

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.950
You don't even work-- I
don't work in an office now,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.060
because I write books.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
But, why I would do that
seemed to many people

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.620
very masochistic.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.800
Maybe it is.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.070
But I just want
to talk today-- I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.890
will start by talking about the
history of the office, where

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.050
I locate the origin of
the office in the book,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.222
and then I'll talk about
the most important part

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.680
of the history of
the office, which

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.220
is when I enter the office.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.650
That was a big day for
work, when they let me in.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.020
And people often ask me why I
got interested in the topic,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740
and of course I got interested
because I had an office job.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.390
And I took my interest
just a little too far

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.790
and got obsessed.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.384
And then I want to conclude
with the thing that

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.300
became the seed for the
book in general, which

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.720
is the curious history of
the office cubicle, which,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.130
like everything, I think
is super fascinating.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.670
It's chiefly because
it-- and some of you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.900
may know this a little bit--
that the original office

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.540
cubicle was meant to
liberate office workers,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.070
and it turned into this symbol
of white collar servitude.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.720
And how that happened
I think is paradigmatic

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.100
for the general story
of the way we work

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.790
and what's going on now.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.620
And then I think we
could talk-- there's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.500
some stuff towards
the end of the book,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.570
and then stuff I've written
about the so-called future

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.980
of the office, which we could
talk about or in a Q&amp;A setting.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.840
So, some of this is some
material from the book.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.940
Some of it is fresh.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.470
So, thank you for having me.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.120
This is from the origin of the
office about clerical workers.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.440
They labored in poorly lit,
smoky single rooms, attached

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.880
to merchants and lawyers, to
insurance concerns and banks.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.250
They had sharp penmanship and
bad eyes, extravagant clothes

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.080
but shrunken,
unused bodies, backs

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.400
cramped from poor
posture, fingers

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.760
calloused by constant writing.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.290
When they were not thin,
angular, and sallow,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.890
they were ruddy and soft.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.540
Their paunches sagged
on to their thighs.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.820
Clerks were once a rare
subject in literature.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.930
Their lives were considered
unworthy of comment,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.360
their workplaces
hemmed in and small,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.800
their work indescribably dull.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.630
And yet, one of the
greatest of short stories

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.740
is about a clerk, "Bartleby, the
Scrivener" by Herman Melville.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.320
Melville would become famous
for writing memoirs and novels

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.810
about spectacular sea
voyages to exotic islands.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.430
He became famous but he lost
the readership eventually

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.630
with this strange, long
book about a whaling voyage.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.510
He decided to turn inward
after this, weirdly.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.160
I mean, if you write all these
books about whaling and stuff,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.720
it's odd that your
next choice would

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.290
be to write about the
snug, suffocating world

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.209
of the office, and to
exchange the titanic hunt

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.660
for the white whale to the
hunt for the right size pen.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.440
And he writes a lot about
finding the right position

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.510
to sit at a desk.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.320
This is from "Bartleby,
the Scrivener."

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.290
"If, for the sake
of easing his back,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.640
he brought the table
lid at a sharp angle,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.930
well up towards
this chin, and wrote

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.570
there like a man using the
steeple roof of a Dutch house

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.970
for his desk, then he declared
that it stopped the circulation

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.210
in his arms.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.440
If now he lowered the
table to his waistband

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.210
and stooped over it
in writing, then there

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.220
was a sore aching in his back."

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.040
So, you see this is the story
of the standing desk from 1853.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.840
Melville was really progressive
in his office design.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.329
Melville had worked
for a few years

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.620
as a scrivener on Wall Street,
the setting of Bartleby,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.140
some years before
he took to the ship.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.634
He knew from inside, therefore,
the peculiar emptiness

00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:06.800
that office work could have.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.430
Its atmosphere of
what he thought

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.032
was purposeless labor
and dead-endedness.

00:05:11.032 --> 00:05:13.490
Even in "Moby Dick" he speaks
of the thousands in Manhattan

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.640
who idle along the battery, lost
in what he calls "sea reverie."

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.130
And they just are
lost because they

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.860
want to avoid returning
to their work lives,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.810
"pent up in lathe and
plaster, tied to counters,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.590
nailed to benches,
clinched to desks."

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.290
In "Bartleby, the Scrivener,"
the few windows in the office

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.630
look out onto nothing
but more walls.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.510
"On one end," the
unnamed narrator writes,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.800
"the window faced the
white wall of the interior

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.850
of a spacious skylight shaft,
penetrating the building

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.780
from top to bottom,
and on the other side,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.800
there was an unobstructed
view of a brick wall,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.010
black by age and
everlasting shade."

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.140
"This wall," the
narrator adds wryly,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.420
"required no spyglass to bring
out its lurking beauties,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.230
but, for the benefit of
all nearsighted spectators,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.410
was pushed within 10
feet of my window panes.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.840
On two sides, then, two
walls-- the white wall

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.140
of the light shaft, on the
other, a soot-black brick

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.090
wall hemming in
vision and light.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.100
It was a room with no view."

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.490
What Bartleby means has been
a subject of endless debate.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.190
There was even a film a few
years ago called "Bartleby"

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.790
set in a cubicle office, but
it was just the same story.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.460
Office workers have
always taken it

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.620
to be a mirror of-- of a
bad office, bad office work.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.370
And Bartleby's famous phrase,
"I would prefer not to"--

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.335
when his boss asks
him to work, he just

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:39.130
says "I would prefer
not to"-- it's

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.990
the encapsulation of
how the office has

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.870
its way of reducing all titanic
conflicts to petty grievances

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.530
and simmering resentments.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.230
The funny thing is that
in 1853-- this story

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.950
is so prophetic-- but
when it was written,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.480
the term "office" itself,
and the sort of labor

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.220
that was performed
there, had nowhere

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.760
near the universal
significance it has now.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.180
In those tense years
before the Civil War,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.300
clerks were just a small
and unusual phenomenon,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.690
a subject of anxious scrutiny.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.840
There were places that
where at once centers

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.970
of American business
and breeding

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.980
grounds for a kind of work
that nobody recognized as work.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.780
Clerks were a kind of worker
that seemed, like Bartleby,

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.370
at once harmless and ominous.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.430
Bartleby, then,
was early evidence

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.050
that the office had just
begun to blot its inky mark

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.400
on the consciousness
of the world.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.390
People ask me often,
because I've-- it's tragic,

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.524
I've become an office
expert-- they ask me,

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:41.690
where does the office begin?

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.100
What's the first office?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.501
And this is actually a question
without an easy answer.

00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:47.500
You can just start with
the origins of paperwork

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.640
itself, which is,
until quite recently,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.400
the most common association
with office work was paper.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.077
I still use it.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.660
You can think of the
derogatory phrase

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.840
"paper pusher," which is
increasingly becoming obsolete.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.722
I don't know what-- we should
come up with a new phrase.

00:08:05.722 --> 00:08:06.930
You push code, is that right?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.962
But what else-- we
can work on this.

00:08:11.962 --> 00:08:13.920
In other words, since
the invention of writing,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.880
and the corresponding
ability to keep records

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.030
in a systematic manner,
there have always

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.740
been places that resemble
offices-- monasteries,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.010
libraries, scholar's studies.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.410
Banking has always furnished
an especially large amount

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.640
of paperwork.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.170
The Uffizi gallery
in Florence was also

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.830
one of the first office
buildings, the bookkeeping

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.580
offices of the Medici family.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.039
Clerks have existed for ages.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.789
Many of them became
quite famous.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.720
There's the diarist Samuel
Pepys, the British government

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.740
diarist who is a major source
of knowledge about 17th century

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.710
England.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.720
Alexander Hamilton was
the merchant's clerk

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.960
before he became
Secretary of the Treasury.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.660
Benjamin Franklin, paragon
of pecuniary restraint

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.910
and bourgeois self-abnegation,
was a dry goods clerk.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.840
Some of the tediousness
in his own writing

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.240
may have been honed in the
conditions of his first job.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.730
Since clerks have had the
opportunity to keep diaries,

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.200
they've bemoaned
the sheer boredom

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.390
of their tasks--
the endless copying,

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.650
the awkward postures, the
meaningless of their work.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.260
When not doing
writing for their job,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.420
clerks have cultivated their
habit of writing about the job,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.500
or literally around.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.180
There's some infamous
marginalia we

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.719
have from medieval scribes--
on the sides of manuscripts

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:31.260
they were copying,
they were so bored

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.843
that they would just
continue to write

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:34.030
about how bored they were.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.892
"Writing is excessive drudgery,"
once such jotting reads,

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.600
"it crooks your back,
it dims your sight,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.950
it twists your stomach
and your sides."

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.630
And then one scribbling
on one manuscript just

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.804
goes, "Oh my hand."

00:09:46.804 --> 00:09:48.970
And that was just dumb,
because actually writing out

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.790
that sentence is worse-- then
your hand gets-- Anyways,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.790
clerks were not super smart.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.890
So, you could say that this
is all the office work, right?

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.459
But I take a different tack.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.750
I think if you were to find
the emergence of the office

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.784
in history, the workplace
that really prefigures

00:10:07.784 --> 00:10:09.450
the offices of today,
even if it doesn't

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.200
look like, say, the office
we're in right now--

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.160
not superficially,
anyway-- you have

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.990
to look at a peculiar confluence
of new sorts of buildings,

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.960
deep economic
changes, as well as--

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.860
and this is the
most slippery of all

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.700
to pin down-- new kinds of
feelings and mass awareness

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.710
of one another in the workforce.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.670
And this, I think,
starts to happen--

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.680
I locate this in the mid- 19th
century in America and England,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.530
but you see this
elsewhere as well.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.850
At that time, industrialization
in Britain and America

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.380
was producing more and
more administrative work,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.740
and alongside it, the need
for a rational approach

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.930
to managing accounts,
bills, and ledgers.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.390
In short, paperwork.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.467
And rising to take these
positions were clerks.

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:52.550
And this is the key thing.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.508
They're looking around.

00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:55.140
They began to feel
that they themselves

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.250
were part of some
new special group.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.990
There was this sort
of sense of we clerks.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.990
They didn't all
say office workers,

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.150
but they knew that they
belonged to something different

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.970
and their kind of
work was different.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.750
So one finds the office
coinciding, then,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.670
with the change in the position
of the clerks themselves.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.010
It's a new restiveness on their
part, a new sense of power.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.650
They're not sure of themselves,
but they're no longer isolated.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.800
By the middle of
the 19th century,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.570
clerks in their
workplaces begin to appear

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.170
with the new regularity in
literature and journalism.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.700
And so Bartleby, with its
simultaneously assertive

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.440
and retiring
protagonist, I think

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.160
nicely captures this
ambivalence of the early world

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.860
of the office.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.100
What Bartleby also
captures, what

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.630
makes it so great as a short
story, is that, at the time,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.620
people really thought
office work was unnatural.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.210
At the time in the US,
shipping and farming, building

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.230
and assembling-- these were
the natural order of work.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.660
And in this, clerks
just didn't seem to fit.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.230
It's odd, because
at the time, they

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.960
were the fastest growing
sector of the workforce

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.490
in the late 19th century.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.570
In 1880, less than 5% of
the workforce, about 186,000

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.540
people, was in the
clerical profession.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.930
But in cities, they were
the fastest growing.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.370
In some mercantile
cities like New York,

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.740
they had become ubiquitous.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.470
The 1855 census recorded clerks
as the city's third largest

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.150
occupational group, just
behind servants and laborers.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.390
So you had manual workers
and then office workers,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.750
and this was, for many,
a terrible development.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.080
Nothing about clerical labor
was congenial to the way

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.700
most Americans thought of work.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.130
Clerks didn't work the
land, lay railroad tracks,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.050
make ammunitions in factories,
let alone hide away in a cabin

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.360
by a small pond to raise
beans and live deep.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.080
Unlike farming or
factory work, office work

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.140
didn't produce anything.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.090
At best, it seemed
to reproduce things.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.920
Clerks copied endlessly,
bookkeepers added up numbers

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.200
to create more numbers,
and insurance men literally

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.590
made more paper.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.360
For the tobacco farmer or
miner, it was not work.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.345
He-- the clerk-- was
a kind of parasite

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:12.730
to them on the work of
others, and they really

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.410
did the heavy lifting.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.190
And so the stereotype
of workers was

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.160
that they were sinewy,
tanned by the relentless sun

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.680
or blackened by smokestack soot.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.520
And the bodies of clerks
were slim, almost feminine,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.300
in their untested delicacy.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.630
The press took a lot of time,
a shocking amount of time,

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.040
leveling invectives
against clerks.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.170
This is from a big journal of
the time, The American Whig

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.200
Review, "We venture
the assertion

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.960
that there is not a more
dependent or subservient set

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.800
of men in this country than
of the genteel dry goods

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.200
clerks in this and
other large cities."

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.550
The American
Phrenological Journal

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.330
had stronger advice
for young men facing

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.790
the prospect of a
clerical career.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.850
They said, "Don't do it,
be men instead, therefore.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.680
And with true courage
and manliness,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.990
dash into the
wilderness with your axe

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.800
and make an opening
for the sunlight

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.860
and for an independent home.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.190
Vanity Fair had the
strongest language of all.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:13.770
They said clerks were "vain,
mean, selfish, greedy, sensual,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.620
and sly, talkative,
and cowardly."

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.890
And they spent all their
minimal strength attempting

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.490
to dress better than "real
men who did real work."

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.520
It was somehow never questioned
that journalism, which was also

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.750
conducted in offices
with pen and paper,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.840
constituted real work.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.330
That would have been
too complicated.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.690
The attire of clerks was
a barb for the press.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.720
The very concept
of business attire

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.840
came into being
around this time.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.940
There's a manual of
etiquette from this time that

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.290
writes, "In the counting
room in the office,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.660
gentleman wear frock
coats or sack coats.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.510
They need not be of
very fine material,

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.019
and should not be of
any garish pattern."

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:55.060
There are other fashion
advisers of the time that

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.980
pointed to a host of
business coats, business

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.760
surtouts, business paletots,
you could find at new stores.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.390
There was a store at the time
called Brooks Brother's, which

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.640
came up to clothe
office workers.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.980
You may know it.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.430
Working class Americans
were seen in straight straw

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.460
hats or green
blouses, but the clerk

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.400
had a certain kind of collar.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.510
It was usually bleached
in immaculate white,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.470
and it was starched
into imposing stiffness.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.770
The color business shirts
were actually quite expensive,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.460
so even Brooks Brother's used
to sell collars by themselves.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.000
You would buy your white
collar and put it on.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.222
And half a dozen collars is
about the cost of a shirt.

00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:37.680
And so this is kind
of a key thing.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.070
The white collar was
detachable, and yet it

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.895
was essential as
a status marker.

00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:43.270
It was sort of
the perfect symbol

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.880
of what was pseudo- genteel,
the dual nature of office work.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.880
And this clerk became a
subject of satire in fiction.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.080
Edgar Allen Poe wrote a story
called "The Man of the Crowd,"

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.600
where he's observing
this tribe of clerks,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.290
and it's composed entirely
of overdressed dandies,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.650
imitating aristocratic
styles several years old.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.510
This is from that story.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.370
"There were the junior clerks of
flash houses-- young gentleman

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.120
with tight coats, bright
boots, well-oiled hair,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.080
and supercilious lips.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.530
Setting aside a
certain dapperness

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.450
of carriage, which
may be termed deskism

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.010
for want of a better word,
the manner of these persons

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.980
seemed to me an exact
facsimile of what

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.620
had been the perfect bon ton of
about 12 or 18 months before."

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.550
"They wore the castoff
graces of the gentry,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.660
and this, I believe,
involves the best definition

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.930
of the class.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.440
The division of the upper
clerks of staunch firms,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.514
or of the "steady old fellows,"
it was not possible to mistake.

00:16:39.514 --> 00:16:41.430
These were known by their
coats and pantaloons

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.940
of black or brown,
made to sit comfortably

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.360
with cravats and
waistcoats, broad solid

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.190
looking shoes and thick
hose and gaiters."

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.190
"They all had
slightly bald heads,

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.230
from which the right ears,
long used to pen-holding,

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.085
had an odd habit of
standing off on end.

00:16:57.085 --> 00:16:59.460
I observed that they always
removed or settled their hats

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.590
with both hands,
and wore watches

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.040
with short gold chains of
a substantial and ancient

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.119
pattern.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.950
Theirs was the affectation
of respectability,

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.470
if indeed there be an
affectation so honorable."

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.760
This is quite nice, a quite
loving portrait of clerks.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.670
Satirical but loving.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:22.760
Walt Whitman, the poet,
had different words.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.140
He set out to
establish that clerking

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.890
was antithetical to
American democracy.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.880
He wrote this piece
called "Broadway,"

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.630
where he's observing
clerks coming down

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.130
Broadway in New York City.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.000
And this is around the 1850s.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.810
And he writes, "A slender and
round-shouldered generation,

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.445
of minute leg, chalky
face, and hollow chest.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.210
They were trig and
prim in great glow

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.300
of shiny boots, clean
shirts, sometimes

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.020
now of an extraordinary
pattern, as if

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.120
overrun with bugs, tight
pantaloons, straps-- which

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.130
seem to be coming
into fashion again--

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.510
startling cravats, and
hair all soaked and slick

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.920
with sickening oils.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.730
"What wretched, spindling,
forked radishes would they be,

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.090
and how ridiculously would
their natty demeanor appear,

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.650
if suddenly they could
all be stripped naked."

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.220
So, he didn't like clerks.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.802
And the funny thing is the
sense of clerks as being weak,

00:18:24.802 --> 00:18:30.865
unmanly, they looked thin and
they didn't do heavy lifting

00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:34.189
unless they lifted
boxes, this was

00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:35.480
perceived by clerks themselves.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.580
And this is sort of led to
the culture of the modern gym.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.400
At the time, you
find a lot of clerks

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.740
writing about going the gym.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.840
They're like, "we have
to not be narrow chested,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.500
like Whitman says we are.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.790
I advise everyone
to go to the gym."

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.970
So, in a way that
hasn't changed.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.360
This fantasy that Whitman had
of stripping clerks naked,

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.800
exposing the clerk to
his own inadequacy,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.410
I think only concealed
a deeper fear

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.140
about the changing world
of American business.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.140
Under the pressures of
growing industrialization

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.890
in the north of
the United States,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.810
the Jeffersonian
democracy of farmers

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.580
was heading towards the
same fate as the buffalo.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.560
More importantly, the
old 18th century world

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.490
of businessmen who were
also craftsman, white collar

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.870
types who worked
with their hands

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.950
began to suffer a slow
decline as merchants

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.730
and their groups
of clerks started

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.520
to exploit their superior
knowledge of distant markets,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.020
and industries begin to require
more and more bookkeepers

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.060
to maintain their ever
more complicated accounts.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.220
The growth of manufacturing
led to myriad urban retail

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.480
and wholesale
establishments, which,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.950
in turn, required more clerks.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.870
The basis of prosperity,
Hunt's Merchants' Magazine

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.350
held in 1839, lay in
"the vast modern increase

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.730
of the facilities for
defusing and obtaining

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.670
full and correct
information on everything

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.380
pertaining to trade."

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.250
The people who handled
this were clerks.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.850
Cities began to acquire ever
more sizable numbers of clerks,

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.320
ambling down the broad
avenues for men like Whitman

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.010
to gawk and fret over.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.780
By 1860, 25% of
Philadelphians were

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.270
working in non-manual
occupations.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.500
In the brand-new city of San
Francisco, it was already 36%.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.450
In Boston, it was 40.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.560
Not all of them were clerks,
but the trend was clear.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.930
More and more people had
ceased to work with their hands

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.900
and were now working
with their heads.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.670
The journals of
opinion in the US

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.130
might have hated the wretched,
spindling office worker,

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.360
but the hatred refracted
the intense ambivalence

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.780
over the nature of business,
and that clerks might not

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.825
be an aberration but the future.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.360
So that's a little bit
about the origin the office.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.570
Now, like I said, I want to
talk about the origin of me

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:50.260
in the office, which
is a great story.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.900
Ever since I began
writing this book,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.580
people have asked me
where the idea came from.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.730
Why, given the many paths
available to a person

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.755
in the world, especially with
a certain level of education

00:20:58.755 --> 00:21:00.500
and skills, would I
choose to spend years

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:06.950
in my life studying desks,
and chairs, and file cabinets,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.140
typing pools,
accounting machines,

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.940
demountable partitions, steel-
reinforced masonry, curtain

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.380
walls, and, of course, cubicles?

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.370
Why, moreover, would
I want to be reading

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.140
esoteric treatises like the
marketing plans for Herman

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.460
Miller Furniture in 1962,
studies from journals

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.560
of organizational
psychology from 1920,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.250
the proceedings of the
International Association

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.777
of Office Managers from 1935?

00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:36.110
Why on earth would I want to
spend serious time plumbing

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.740
the hallucinatory treatises of
erstwhile superstar business

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.560
guru Tom Peters for
insight into the mind

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.166
and life of the American
white collar worker?

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:46.540
Months after
finishing the book--

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.581
I really don't have an
answer that satisfies me--

00:21:48.581 --> 00:21:52.766
but here, at the very least, is
a provisional attempt at one.

00:21:52.766 --> 00:21:54.490
The idea for a
book on the office

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.590
first came to me when I
was working in an office.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.985
I got my first job
straight out of college.

00:22:00.985 --> 00:22:05.000
This was lucky, even in the
comparatively flush years

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.100
of 2005, which the
economically- minded among you

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.382
will remember as one of the
peaks of the "jobless recovery"

00:22:11.382 --> 00:22:13.340
in the United States that
followed the dot- com

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:19.590
crash of 2000, 2001, 2002.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.490
I was working in a large
corporate publishing

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.270
house, one of the biggest
in the world, with branches

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.630
all over the place.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.630
It's named after a
certain tuxedo- colored

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.310
species of Arctic animal.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.150
I don't want to
name first names,

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.630
so I'll just call
it Polar Bear Books.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.740
At Polar Bear Books, I
was an editorial assistant

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.830
in the business books imprint,
helping to acquire and edit

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.459
scintillating treatises
on brand management

00:22:47.459 --> 00:22:50.000
and endless attempts to one-up
to Clayton Christensen's book,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.230
"The Innovator's Dilemma."

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.190
Please do not write
any more books

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.250
about "The Innovator's Dilemma."

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.400
There are so many.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.350
"The Innovator's
Problem," "The Innovator's

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.090
Solution," just ugh.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.760
Anyway.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.860
So many.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.440
The work was nine to
five, pretty much,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.631
and the hierarchies were
very straightforward,

00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:12.130
the atmosphere
pleasantly corporate,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.870
the office design as
traditional as could

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.920
be, the corridor
offices around the side,

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.670
cubicles in the middle.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.885
My cubicle was enormous.

00:23:18.885 --> 00:23:20.460
It had tons of shelf space.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.740
I spent a shocking amount of
company time pinning things

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.990
to it.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.250
Cartoons, poetry,
color printouts

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.830
from the office
printer-- which are

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.801
very expensive for the office.

00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:35.300
And then I was doing this when
I wasn't wandering the office

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.420
and gossiping to
anyone I could find.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.270
Over time, I started to tire
of ordering my boss's lunch--

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.620
although it was the one
thing I did really well--

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.490
and some of the more mindless
work I was tasked with.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.296
More damaging to my
morale was the fact

00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:50.010
that every so often,
a friend I had made

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.525
would disappear,
or be disappeared.

00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:54.820
It wasn't that they had
left for another company,

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.347
it was that they had
been fired or laid off.

00:23:57.347 --> 00:23:58.930
No one would be told
of their leaving.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.480
Suddenly, their items
and their presence

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.021
would be spirited
away, and one would

00:24:02.021 --> 00:24:04.790
have to go to great lengths to
find out why, say, a long- time

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.360
editor with a newborn
child had been thrown out

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.720
into one of the grimmer job
markets in recent memory

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.739
without so much as a
word of explanation.

00:24:13.739 --> 00:24:15.780
To many of you, this might
seem naive on my part,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.900
but to me, an ingenue
in the brutal world

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.340
of American capitalism,
it was something

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.110
I found difficult to stomach.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.650
So I left for another
publishing house.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.800
It was a smaller place
with a more academic list,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.840
sort of a crossover list.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.230
It was more interesting, I
had more control over my work,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.680
but the pay-- the
work was harder.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.880
My pay was $30,000 a year.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.110
You should all
gasp at this fact.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.135
In New York City,
it's not a lot.

00:24:47.135 --> 00:24:48.880
Or anywhere.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.020
It's just horrible.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.590
It remained the same,
but my hours got worse.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.550
The books- to- staff
ratio was twice

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.220
that of the previous company.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.920
My benefits were also worse.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.340
My health care costs increased.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.695
My boss made me work nights
and come in on weekends,

00:25:02.695 --> 00:25:04.320
chiefly because I
worked in publishing,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.524
and one only does that, she
said, because you love it.

00:25:07.524 --> 00:25:08.940
One way of learning
not to love it

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.304
is to work day after day, hour
after hour without overtime.

00:25:12.304 --> 00:25:13.970
At the same time, the
office arrangement

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.621
became more precarious.

00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:17.620
The lighting in the central
area was alternately

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.870
poor or overbearing, where
my area was dark and obscure,

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.430
one of my friends--
a rather pale,

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.287
blond specimen of humanity-- was
under a poorly placed skylight,

00:25:28.287 --> 00:25:30.120
which meant that if he
sat in place all day,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.560
as indeed he had
to, he would burn.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.240
He placed a piece
of poster board

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.890
on top of the cubicle walls
as a kind of retractable roof,

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.640
like where do the
Dallas Cowboys play?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.530
It was a kind of dome to keep
himself from being scorched.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.700
My own cubicle was
smaller than before,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.830
and my back to my boss's
door, which had me constantly

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.064
looking over my shoulder to
make sure no one was watching.

00:25:56.064 --> 00:25:57.480
And then when she
closed the door,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.030
I was even more freaked out.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.090
I mean, closed doors.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.070
There's nothing scarier than
sitting out in a cubicle

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.980
and watching two people behind
you just walk into an office

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.330
and close the door.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.130
Because you're
like, what are they

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.950
talking about that I can't hear?

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.250
So, I said the
workload was punishing,

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.716
the job situation precarious.

00:26:18.716 --> 00:26:20.840
Halfway through my time
there, an entire department

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.590
was laid off, just months
after a few had been hired,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.529
with the CEO saying that he was
caving to a painful reality.

00:26:28.529 --> 00:26:30.070
I knew that something
had to be done,

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.153
but I had no way of
understanding what that meant.

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:33.740
I lazily tried to
talk my coworkers

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.556
into considering unionizing.

00:26:35.556 --> 00:26:37.680
But the thing about white-
color offices in America

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.690
is that the idea
of a union hardly

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.290
ever enters an
office worker's mind.

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.250
The office both looks
like and is structurally

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.520
set up to be a meritocracy.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.470
You can rise from the
cubicle to the corner office.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.050
At the same time, everyone knows
that this isn't always true.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.360
There's personalities,
there's petty politics,

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.000
all sorts of unfair
situations can

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.020
intervene to make
the idea of merit

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.940
a farce in some situations.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.140
At the same time, the
idea of organizing

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.460
to make the division
between management and labor

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.240
less arbitrary
counters everything

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.710
I think that we believe
about office life.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.970
The fact that any clerical
worker or junior staff member,

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.470
when you start at
the bottom, you're

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.740
a junior businessman
in training.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.059
Business person.

00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:23.100
This central contradiction
of office life I think

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.830
makes it at once a source for
many people and inevitably,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.260
for just as many people,
a source of frustration--

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.980
a source of hope as well
as a source of frustration.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.190
So, eventually I
quit this place.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.530
I was sick of overwork,
and I discover

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.700
that I could make the
same amount of money,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.230
weirdly, as a temp in
a job that sucked less

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:46.200
of my mental energy, my
spirit, and my the time.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.450
I got a job-- I
was placed, really,

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.440
working for a private
equity firm on Park Avenue.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.560
This was before the
financial crisis.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.620
So, flush years--
not for temps, but I

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.260
wasn't taking in commission.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.060
But I was working in
a cubicle suite shared

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.760
by two other administrative
assistants who gabbed all day.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.130
And I felt like I had been
squeezed in my cubicle.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.740
I believe that it
was two by two feet.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.240
I know that's
physically impossible,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.620
but it certainly felt that way.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.810
I was like this the whole time.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.790
But it was meant to encourage
greater interaction, they said.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.700
My bosses liked me,
but eventually they

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.680
realized I wasn't
doing much work there,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.335
so they moved me to a
larger cubicle right next

00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:36.770
to a very powerful
air conditioner.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.490
In the midst of summer,
I wrapped myself

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.229
in wool sweaters
and scarves while I

00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:41.770
muddled through
PowerPoints about how

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.844
to get more state pension funds
to invest in private equity.

00:28:45.844 --> 00:28:47.260
Eventually I was
out of there too.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.760
And by that point,
I was researching

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.850
the history the office
as a freelancer.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.370
And then I started to
realize the irony in this.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.730
I realized I had gone through
all the stages of being

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.540
an office worker since the
middle of the 20th century

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.370
in about two years.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.780
I had started in a very
cushy, corporate firm

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.480
in sort of like a 1950s place.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.180
I had moved to a more precarious
and entrepreneurial spot, where

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.680
everything was on the verge of
collapse or being bought out,

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.460
sort of like the 1980s.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.170
And, after a stint
as a temporary worker

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.869
in a rich firm of
high equity investors

00:29:16.869 --> 00:29:18.410
performing skillful
leveraged buyouts

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.360
of various public
companies, I was on my own.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.990
My capacious cubicle that I
had suddenly been squeezed out

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.470
of that I had been in, had
something been squeezed out

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.256
of existence.

00:29:30.256 --> 00:29:31.880
And it was at this
point that I started

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.620
researching the history
of the office cubicle.

00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:39.620
The curious thing about
the office cubicle

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.369
is that-- and I'll
sort of talk about this

00:29:41.369 --> 00:29:47.711
and then we can break to
Q&amp;A-- the reason I got

00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:49.460
so interested in the
history of the office

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.450
is that I just
started researching,

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.270
why do we work in cubicles?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.584
Maybe you guys don't?

00:29:55.584 --> 00:29:57.250
I haven't actually
seen the office here.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.352
Do you guys have cubes?

00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:00.580
I know Mountainview
some people do, right?

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.240
I've seen that.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.500
And the cubicle is
a symbol, right?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.040
No word is more
efficient than cubicle.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.545
You just say cubicle and
then just waves of horror

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.420
can wash over people.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.985
Cubicle farms, cubicle
infernos, cubicle warrens.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.770
There's terms like six
packs for packs of cubicles.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.490
And maybe you guys
know this stuff?

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.790
And then you're prairie
dogging, looking

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.956
over the top of the cubicle.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.914
Dilbert, Office Space.

00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.580
The line in Office
Space-- "Human beings

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.960
were not meant to sit
in cubicles staring

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.310
at computer screens all day."

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.010
It's one of the purest words
in the English language

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.280
for connecting dread and
insecurity and anxiety.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.770
But, when I looked
into the history,

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.500
I discovered that it was not
at all meant to be the case.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:01.730
And the way that
what was designed

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:06.150
as the origin of the cubicle had
become its antithesis, I think,

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.550
is one of the paradigmatic
stories of the office.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:12.620
I'd like to tell it to you now.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.626
It's so exciting.

00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:15.750
Let me just check the time.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:28.270
In 1964, the iconic
furniture design company

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:33.310
Herman Miller unveiled an office
plan unlike anything anyone

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.850
had ever seen.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.870
Called Action Office,
it was the brainchild

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.860
of Robert Probst, who was
among the first designers

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.252
to argue that office
work was mental work.

00:31:43.252 --> 00:31:44.960
He actually used the
term knowledge work.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.170
This is one of the
earliest uses of this term.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:54.220
It had been coined by
Peter Drucker in 1962.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.790
Anyway, so Probst was
one of the first to argue

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.930
that office work was mental
work and that mental effort

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.900
was tied to
environmental enhancement

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.160
of one's physical capabilities.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.810
Rather than a furniture item
or a collection of them,

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.730
Action Office was a proposition
for an altogether new kind

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.070
of space.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.810
Most office designs
at the timer were

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.190
about keeping people in place.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.829
I think people are
familiar with the images,

00:32:17.829 --> 00:32:19.370
if you've watch "Mad
Men," of course,

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.661
but if you've also seen "The
Apartment," the great film

00:32:21.661 --> 00:32:25.221
from the '60s, or "The
Crowd," an the earlier film,

00:32:25.221 --> 00:32:27.720
or "How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying," where

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.840
you have rows of
desks in a steno pool,

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.130
or an accounting pool,
and then corridor

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.040
offices around the side.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.930
And people don't know
this, but this was really

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.310
modeled on factories.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.020
This came out of, in
the early 20th century,

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.010
people were like,
what are offices?

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.830
I'm being silly, but
really they didn't

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.871
know what to do with these
administrative spaces,

00:32:48.871 --> 00:32:51.360
and the only model workplace
that they had was the factory.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.907
So they assumed that the
office was a kind of paperwork

00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:55.740
factory, it should be
organized accordingly.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.350
People should clock in and out.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.210
You file into this
place, and effectively

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.920
are a paperwork assembly
line, and only when

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.770
you each achieve a
certain level of prestige

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.480
do you get an
office of your own.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.555
So this was about status,
it was about place,

00:33:11.555 --> 00:33:14.011
it was about prestige.

00:33:14.011 --> 00:33:15.120
Probst hated this.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.060
He thought offices
should be about movement.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.170
He thought offices
should be about being

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.210
conducive to whatever kind of
work you had to do at the time.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.270
Advertisements for
Action Office at the time

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.856
show workers in constant motion.

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:30.480
Indeed, the human
figures in the images

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.900
often appear blurred,
as if the photographer

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.020
were unable to capture
their lightning speed.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.150
You have to imagine what
it was like in the 1960s.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.850
Probst, he thought
of office workers

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.720
as kind of futurist
soccer players.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.657
They were just
constantly in motion,

00:33:44.657 --> 00:33:46.990
they were doing knowledge
work here and then standing up

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.198
and doing knowledge work
there and then sitting down.

00:33:49.198 --> 00:33:51.800
And it was this
incredibly dynamic idea

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.270
of what office life was.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.152
It was the result of an
unusual collaboration.

00:33:57.152 --> 00:33:58.860
Probst had been through
together with one

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.350
of his near opposites,
George Nelson.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.120
Some of you who are
interested in design,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.280
you would know the name.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.250
He's one of the great
mid-century furniture

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.800
designers, just
designers in general.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.409
He grew to prominence
by converting

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.060
the ideas of modernism into
effortlessly cool pieces

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.540
of furniture.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.980
Probst was laconic,
prophetic, intransigent,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.420
he exuded the tight- lipped
silence of the American West.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.920
He was from Colorado.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.130
Nelson, by contrast,
was a scotch-

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:28.260
swilling bon vivant
and raconteur.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.929
I don't know, have people seen
the show "True Detective?"

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.230
Someone told me that oh
yeah, Nelson and Probst

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:37.969
is kind of like Woody Harrelson
and Matthew McConaughey.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.489
Does that sound right?

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:41.990
No.

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:43.989
It's such a bizarre
comparison that someone even

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.270
thought of that anyway.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.219
The items Nelson had
designed for Action Office

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:52.159
were beautiful, at once
homey and utterly modern,

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.420
nostalgic and forward thinking.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.120
His desk surfaces rested on
cantilevered die- cast aluminum

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.020
legs.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.890
There was a standing desk,
where a chrome brace doubled

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.335
as a foot rest, and it was
a roll- top standing desk.

00:35:05.335 --> 00:35:06.710
These are very
beautiful objects,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.380
if you ever have the
chance to look them up.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.330
A communication center
with the telephone

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.720
was acoustically
insulated for phone calls.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.370
There were many
idiosyncratic touches,

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.828
because Probst had convinced
himself that work out of sight

00:35:18.828 --> 00:35:19.996
was work out of mind.

00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:21.370
There were no
large desk drawers.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.220
Instead, there was a
movable display surface

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.770
from which items could be
retrieved and replaced at ease.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.602
The standing desk kept workers
off their feet-- on their feet,

00:35:29.602 --> 00:35:32.060
rather-- but also allowed them
to leave work out overnight,

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.120
securely closed.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.090
It was also very colorful.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.030
It was green, bright blue,
navy blue, black, and yellow,

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.402
unlike the office
furniture you find here.

00:35:42.402 --> 00:35:44.610
But this was very strange
in the '60s, and, in a way,

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.710
it remains strange.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.010
It was like a magazine
advertisement, the pop art

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.360
at the time of
Warhol Lichtenstein.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.130
Action Office at the
time was very '60s.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.380
It proclaimed its allegiance
to the spirit of the age.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.664
It was rich,
advanced, liberating.

00:35:59.664 --> 00:36:02.080
In this sense, the Action
Office that Probst had conceived

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.860
and Nelson designed might have
been the first truly modern

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.256
idea turned to the office.

00:36:06.256 --> 00:36:07.630
The first in which
the aesthetics

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.030
of design and progressive
ideas about human needs

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.450
were truly united.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.520
When Action Office was
unveiled before the press,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.020
the answer was
resoundingly affirmative.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.254
"Seeing these designs,"
wrote the writers

00:36:19.254 --> 00:36:21.670
of Industrial Design, "one
wonders why office workers have

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.120
put up with their incompatible,
unproductive, uncomfortable

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.029
environment for so long."

00:36:27.029 --> 00:36:29.070
Meanwhile, the more popular
Saturday Evening Post

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.230
cried, "Office workers
of America, beware!

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.907
The Action Office is coming.

00:36:33.907 --> 00:36:35.490
We are in real danger
of being enabled

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.090
to work at 100% efficiency."

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.279
Despite the rapturous reviews,
Action Office didn't sell.

00:36:42.279 --> 00:36:44.320
Office managers complained
that the entire system

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.111
was too expensive
because the furniture was

00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:48.104
made of such quality material.

00:36:48.104 --> 00:36:49.770
And the space that
Action Office created

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:54.130
was too vaguely defined,
its borders too porous.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.362
The product won a few
awards in the industry,

00:36:56.362 --> 00:36:58.320
within the furniture
industry, but it otherwise

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.800
saw little adoption
in the workplace.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:08.582
Probst had sort run up against
a classic problem of design.

00:37:08.582 --> 00:37:10.040
Office planners
and architects tend

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.080
to imagine that the set
up of their own offices

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.964
should be the way that
everyone should work.

00:37:13.964 --> 00:37:15.880
They pretend that their
subjective methods are

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.671
objective, empirical
results, and then they

00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:21.410
try to impose them
on a workplace.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.180
In a way, you see this all
over the place with open office

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.020
plans, where people just don't
always work in a certain way

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.770
that they're just imposed.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.679
Unfortunately, the
copycat Action Offices

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:33.720
were starting to have
strange, unforeseen effects

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.330
in other workplaces.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.180
Rather than making
them more flexible,

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.437
they, in fact, appeared to be
making them more regimented.

00:37:42.437 --> 00:37:44.770
Douglas Ball, a designer for
the rival furniture company

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.830
Hayworth, came up with one
of the many knock-off designs

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.970
for the Canadian company Sunar.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.220
Initially excited, he emerged
from the completed space

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.390
utterly depressed.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.490
"I went to see the first
installation of the Sunar

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.710
system, the huge government
project," he said.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.512
"The panels were
all 70 inches tall.

00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:03.970
So, unless you were
six foot three,

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.110
you couldn't look over the top.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.090
It was awful, one of the worst
installations I'd ever seen.

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.340
We thought it was extremely
flexible in the plan view,

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.620
but we'd never considered
the vertical elevation.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.850
And it was too late
to fix the problem."

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.450
He had trapped people in
giant fabric- wrapped walls,

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.327
when he had meant, like
Probst, to free them.

00:38:23.327 --> 00:38:25.660
It turned out that companies
had no interest in creating

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.860
autonomous environments
for their human performers.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.100
Instead, they wanted to stuff
as many people in a small space

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.580
for as cheaply as possible,
as quickly as possible.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.070
By 1978, Probst
was composing memos

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.655
on repositioning his
design, panicked over

00:38:41.655 --> 00:38:44.240
the obsession with "easily
defined and accountable cost

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.592
savings."

00:38:45.592 --> 00:38:47.050
He wrote, "Meanwhile,
other matters

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.175
of more profound influence
on the real productivity

00:38:49.175 --> 00:38:52.020
of organizations have
slipped into the background,"

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.210
he worried.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.980
Action Office had been
meant for flexibility.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.580
Instead, a new
rigidity set in that

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.340
was wrapped disingenuously
in humanistic fabric.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.700
Probst memos seemed
to have no effect.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.090
Soon, the designs for Action
Office in the Herman Miller

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.620
brochures began to
seem more box-like.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.650
They were selling what
the companies wanted.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.570
In 1998, a journalist
interviewed Robert Probst,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.975
then 77 years old, for
Metropolis Magazine.

00:39:17.975 --> 00:39:19.350
He defended the
features that had

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.970
made his designed so
popular-- its austerity,

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.240
its flexibility--
but he conceded

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.930
what he hadn't been
willing to understand then.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.530
"The dark side of this is
that not all organizations are

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.010
intelligent and
progressive," Probst said.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.210
"Lots are run by
crass people, who

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.290
can take the same
kind of equipment

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.700
and create hell holes."

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.950
Probst noted that his design had
proved irrepressibly popular.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.240
40 million employees
in America at the time

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.560
worked in 42 different
versions of the Action Office.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.420
But he failed to note
that, by that point,

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.456
they were all known by the
same name-- the cubicle.

00:39:54.456 --> 00:39:56.886
Thank you.

00:39:56.886 --> 00:40:04.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.800
Take questions?

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:18.643
Just like what the
I think yeah, you

00:40:18.643 --> 00:40:19.906
might need to step to the mic.

00:40:19.906 --> 00:40:20.405
Sorry.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.250
AUDIENCE: So, it
seems like there's

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.340
a balance between what's
good for the employee

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.320
and what's good for the company,
in terms of productivity,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.850
however you want to describe it.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.520
So, you talked a
little bit earlier

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.780
about the future of
where this is all going.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.180
So, I'd be curious-- given
the fact that companies

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.360
are specifically here to make
as much money as possible,

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.310
or improve products, make
the world a better place--

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.240
what would you say
the future looks like?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.720
How do you define the
balance between what's

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.969
good for the employee and
what's good for the company?

00:40:58.485 --> 00:41:00.110
NIKIL SAVAL: It's a
very hard question.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.540
Predictions are
always sort of wrong.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.200
Predictions are often
wrong, as everyone knows.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200
Now that I've seen
lots of attempts

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.140
to define the future the
office in the last 150 years,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.940
it's shocking how
often people are right

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.140
but also how much they're wrong.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.260
The question though,
about worker satisfaction,

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.130
about worker's
control over what it

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.940
is they do, vis-a-vis the
organization they work for

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.690
and what organizations
think is valuable,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.120
is definitely changing a lot.

00:41:43.151 --> 00:41:45.490
I think one thing
that we should--

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.312
just to take one
part of that, one way

00:41:48.312 --> 00:41:49.770
to look at the
future of the office

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.030
is to look at the increasing
informalization-- I guess

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.580
you call it-- casualization
of the workforce.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.520
There are many, many more
people at the present working

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.810
in contract positions,
as independent workers,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:08.430
as freelancers, as temps,
than there have been probably

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:09.850
since the 19th century.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.880
Those terms didn't exist,
but it's something similar.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.260
It's hard to estimate, but it's
somewhere between 25 and 30%.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.920
Some people think this is
the fastest- growing sector

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.670
of the workforce.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.840
And a lot of this is
not conscious decision

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.630
making on those workers' part.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.890
A lot of people are thrown
out into independent work.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:36.390
People I know cannot get
permanent employment.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:41.450
But a lot of it, in a way, is
a certain kind of disaffection,

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:47.820
I think, with companies
that have, they feel,

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.810
shirked a certain obligation,
a certain contract.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.590
It may not feel
that way at Google--

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.964
and I don't really
want to speak,

00:42:55.964 --> 00:43:00.210
since I don't work
here-- but in many places

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.424
you, just find
that-- and I think

00:43:02.424 --> 00:43:03.965
this happened over
the '80s and '90s.

00:43:03.965 --> 00:43:06.423
One of the things I don't talk
about in that little cubicle

00:43:06.423 --> 00:43:10.860
section is that the sense of the
cubicle as being this bad place

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.910
really took off in '90s, when I
think layoffs were more common,

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.680
permanent employment
became much less common.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.490
In the '50s, you got
a job and you kind of

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:22.430
thought you would stay there.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.580
And then you didn't.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.480
And so then the
cubicle became the sign

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.130
of this callous
workplace environment.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.060
It's like, oh this
company doesn't care.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.850
They just stuffed
me in a cubicle,

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:35.150
and they're probably
going to lay me off.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:41.170
So, when you want to look at
the future of the workplace,

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.650
I think, if you
look at freelancing,

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.690
if you look at temping, if you
look at that sort of activity,

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.230
if you look at people even just
wanting to work from home more,

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.140
people seeking certain
kinds of flexibility

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.770
in their work lives.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:56.100
I think you see a real
desire for autonomy

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.650
when it comes to determining--
it may even be little things,

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.280
like just how your work day
goes, how you do your work,

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.720
and where you do it.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.040
Or it may even be just
controlling your work

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:14.030
entirely outside the confines
of a corporate environment.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:23.050
And so that's where for me,
when it comes to the balance,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:27.270
I tend to load
things on what's good

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.310
for the workers of the company,
rather than the office space

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:35.796
thing like, "Is this
good for the company?"

00:44:35.796 --> 00:44:39.680
I think the workplaces
I visited that seemed

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.570
to exude more control by the
employees over what they do,

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.680
that tends to be the
most tangible thing.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.430
And control can take
many different forms.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.460
In workplaces like the
ones in Silicon Valley,

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.040
I think one of the
things that you

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.610
see is the reason a lot of these
places are so-- a lot of them

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.500
put a lot of care into--
which is an unusual.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.140
And that also, in
a way, reflects

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.240
a certain kind of
mobility for the people

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.490
who work in these places,
that they can move,

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.100
you have to retain them.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.044
There's a tighter labor market,
or a way in which workers

00:45:18.044 --> 00:45:19.710
seem to feel that
they have a little bit

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.830
more control over
their own choice, yes.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.010
You may not even be making
demands in a certain way,

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.910
but there's an
unspoken, latent idea

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.780
of how the workplace should be.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:41.100
And that, I would hope, would
be the case in throughout.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.020
That's a better situation
than a lot of people have.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.470
so that's sort of a long answer,
because it's a big question,

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.432
but yeah.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.420
AUDIENCE: You alluded to briefly
the open office, open floor

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.940
plan in your opening.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:07.300
I was wondering if you have any
thoughts about how it relates

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.035
to what you're describing
in terms of answering

00:46:10.035 --> 00:46:12.660
the last question or just
cubicle life in general

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.220
you were describing earlier.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.220
NIKIL SAVAL: Absolutely.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.270
Open office plans.

00:46:21.622 --> 00:46:24.580
Do you people know-- I'm going
to steal a joke from something.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.210
Do you people know
the blog or the book

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.410
"Stuff White People Like"?

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.120
if you don't know it, it's
just a list of things,

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:42.200
like-- I can't even come up
with a good example now--

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.410
but like cafe lattes.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.500
White people like cafe lattes.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.400
It's a way of classifying
a certain kind

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.650
of upper middle class
white taste, right?

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.340
And one of the things they list
in "Stuff White People Like"

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.780
is open office plans.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.710
And the joke is that
you grow up in America

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.050
and you have this inexplicable
loathing for the cubicle.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.784
You just hate it, even
before you've worked in one.

00:47:07.784 --> 00:47:09.200
And so the first
thing you want is

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.430
to work in an open office plan.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:16.610
And so there's things
like doing data entry

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:20.370
or pushing code in a cubicle
is somehow mindless drudgery,

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.700
but doing the same thing
in an open office space

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.249
with exposed brick walls is
somehow creative and explosive.

00:47:26.249 --> 00:47:27.290
I mean, I'm paraphrasing.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.870
But the thing about
the open office plan

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:36.650
is-- I understand the
rhetoric behind it,

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:42.000
that it's meant to
encourage collaboration,

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.730
it creates a certain kind of
symbolic notion of openness,

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:46.690
transparency.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.120
If people are familiar with the
Bloomberg offices in New York

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.600
City, which is big.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.050
Each desk is like five by five
answer and they[re slightly

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:57.841
partitioned and your
just crammed together.

00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:02.290
It's open and there's this huge
floor plan you just see across.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.660
It's noisy, it's buzzy.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.420
These are often
very pretty spaces

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:14.540
that have little basis in
psychological research,

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:17.870
how people actually work,
what they should actually do.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:24.630
I think the rush to do it
is a big mistake, frankly.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.620
I just think there are ways
in which the offices that

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.990
include openness as part
of their work space--

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:34.630
the ones that are better, you
have to be able to retreat

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.400
to a private space,
to take a phone

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.200
call, just to get
away from noise.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.600
The fact is, they're
very distracting.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.135
They often repeat the mistakes
in cubicle environments,

00:48:43.135 --> 00:48:44.470
because you can hear noise.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.250
And added to that is
visual distraction.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.240
You just are
constantly surrounded

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.412
by visual distractions.

00:48:51.412 --> 00:48:53.120
And distraction has
always been a problem

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.078
in office environments.

00:48:54.078 --> 00:48:56.670
There's just very rarely
room for private work

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:58.060
or concentrated work.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.150
And that's most work.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:02.570
I mean, it differs
by sector, et cetera,

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:04.660
but most work you
actually have to just

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.230
put your head down
and concentrate.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:13.650
So, there's a way in which the
open office plan is repeating

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.720
a certain kind of
mistake that we

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.510
made with the office cubicle.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.790
Also I should've mentioned
this just briefly.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:22.810
The open office plan is not new.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.760
The kind of rage
for it now is new,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.560
but in the 1950s is when
the first open office

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.420
plan was invented.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:33.790
And it was invented in Germany
by two designers working

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.610
for the publishing
company Bertelsmann,

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:41.370
and it was called an office
landscape, a Burolandschaft.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.020
And it was exactly like
the open office plans

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.890
today-- swirling patterns
of desks, no hierarchies.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.370
Everyone had the same
kind of location.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.665
It was egalitarian
in terms of design.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:58.110
It was really popular among
architects and designers,

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.720
but workers in Europe actually
rejected open office plans,

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.962
because they had councils,
union- like structures,

00:50:05.962 --> 00:50:07.420
the traditions of
social democracy.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.870
And they were like, no way.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.230
We hate these places.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.220
We can't do any work.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.110
They're noisy.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.940
Egalitarian or not, if you're
a CEO in an open office plan,

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.762
you're still a CEO.

00:50:17.762 --> 00:50:19.345
That doesn't change
your understanding

00:50:19.345 --> 00:50:21.830
or makes you more approachable.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.360
So they moved radically
away from the way

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.310
the US was trending and
towards private offices.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.250
Studies are equivocal, but they
show that they don't-- you can

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.050
still collaborate
in private spaces.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:39.258
You can still do a lot of
things that you need to do.

00:50:39.258 --> 00:50:41.980
And in some ways, it's
easier, because if everyone

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.900
has a private space,
that's egalitarian too.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.510
So I guess I'm not hiding
the fact that I'm really

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.340
against open office plans.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.220
I find that the claims
advanced on their behalf

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.500
are totally exaggerated.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.740
And certainly, if you want to
include that kind of space,

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.520
you have to make huge
provisions for private space.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.530
And, in a way, they're
imposed on people,

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:09.363
regardless of what they
actually have to do.

00:51:22.937 --> 00:51:24.770
AUDIENCE: Your comment
at the beginning kind

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:29.580
of implied that you recognize
that this book and this topic

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.990
does suffer from a lack of
upfront sexiness, as it were,

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:42.350
which creates an interesting
marketing problem for the book.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:45.640
I know for myself
that I was-- there's

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.190
a Hebrew saying, I was kind
of favorably disappointed,

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.530
or whatever.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:52.150
But this was hugely enjoyable.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.790
Very interesting, very
enlightening, in many ways,

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.250
but you can see that, I
mean, it's not exactly

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:03.030
people are hanging by the doors
because they can't get in.

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:06.024
NIKIL SAVAL: What are
you saying? [LAUGHS]

00:52:06.024 --> 00:52:07.690
AUDIENCE: So, I'm
just kind of wondering

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.500
what your thoughts
are about this.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.550
Or, just the way it is--
you wrote your book,

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:13.804
and whoever comes, comes?

00:52:13.804 --> 00:52:14.470
NIKIL SAVAL: Oh.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.470
Well, I have to say
I've been actually

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.715
pleasantly surprised
by the response.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.880
I mean, even though people are
not hanging off the rafters

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:37.172
and throwing their bras at
me, it's been-- or underwear.

00:52:37.172 --> 00:52:39.130
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make that gendered.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.505
The point of this, I think, was
that office work is so common,

00:52:50.505 --> 00:52:55.180
a part of so many people's
lives, especially in the West,

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:58.490
and increasingly in
other countries as well.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.730
And I, as a worker, wanted
to make this meaningful

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:02.390
for myself.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.236
In a way, I wrote this
book for people like me.

00:53:05.236 --> 00:53:08.020
And in a sense, I know
offices are different,

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.920
industries are different,
workplaces are different,

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.070
but there's also a show
called "The Office," which

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.030
speaks to a certain kind
of collective experience

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.030
that, however varied,
is nonetheless common.

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.350
I think that was the sort
of person I was writing for.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:28.470
And in a way, I feel
like in speaking

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:32.730
to people about the book when
I was writing and since, what

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.280
is always elicits
is someone trying

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.540
to tell me about their office.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.623
They're like, Oh, let me
tell you about my office.

00:53:41.235 --> 00:53:45.590
I think there has been-- I've
been surprised by the interest.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:48.439
Some of the reviews
have been OK.

00:53:48.439 --> 00:53:49.980
And some of them
even say, "I thought

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:55.290
this book would be boring
and it's not boring."

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.670
I leave that to you,
of course, to decide.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:59.810
You may find it totally dreary.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.520
AUDIENCE: Judging
by the talk-- and I

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.020
guess you do make a good point,
even if one in 1,000 office

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.290
workers, 100 office workers
thinks it is interesting,

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:12.530
wants to know more, that's
already a nice niche chunk,

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:13.681
there's some market there.

00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:14.430
NIKIL SAVAL: Yeah.

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:15.290
I hope so.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.920
But yeah, it's the
idea is that it's

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.497
an essential part of
my life, our lives.

00:54:20.497 --> 00:54:21.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:27.674 --> 00:54:29.590
AUDIENCE: So, I was
curious if the book treats

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:32.640
at all the topic of the
extension of the office

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.950
into the home, the home
office, and basically

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:40.290
the cubicle-ization of
the home environment.

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:44.390
You think of loft living
and live- work environments.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.160
I don't know if they are
historical precedents for that,

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:53.560
that extend beyond into
the 19th, 18th centuries.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.180
But it seems like
with virtualization,

00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.120
with telecommuting, it's
more the case now than ever

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.800
that people are setting up
offices within their own homes.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.130
And I'm wondering if they
are taking office metaphors

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.410
that you would find in a
more collective environment

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.260
and transposing
them to the home,

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.040
or whether they're coming up
with new ways of interacting

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.350
all together.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.750
NIKIL SAVAL: Yeah,
it's a very good-- yes.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:21.880
The short answer is yes,
that I did treat it.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.740
It's a very difficult
topic to talk about,

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.990
in a way, because
it's so talked about.

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:31.790
And actually, when I
was finishing the book,

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.520
the kerfuffle over the Yahoo!

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.160
CEO's Marissa
Mayers, I'm sure this

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:40.090
was the topic of discussion,
eliminating telecommuting

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.430
came up.

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:46.390
There is this history of it.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:49.490
People started
foreseeing telecommuting

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:53.150
as a real thing in the 1970s.

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:56.800
I think Business Week ran
a series about this in 1975

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.290
called "the office
of the future."

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:05.790
If you guys are familiar with
the futurologist Alvin Toffler,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:11.350
he's this old famous dude that
had sold millions of his book,

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:13.810
"The Third Wave."

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.810
That might be wrong.

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:17.720
But it's from the early 1980s.

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.160
He foresaw that the increased
use of telecommuting

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.450
would depopulate downtowns,
that everyone would suddenly

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.865
be working in these networked
electronic "cottages,"

00:56:29.865 --> 00:56:33.260
he called them, out
in the countryside.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:38.331
And there would
be no more cities.

00:56:38.331 --> 00:56:39.330
Why would you have them?

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.825
You wouldn't need
skyscrapers, you

00:56:40.825 --> 00:56:43.660
would just have people
working at home.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.310
The curious thing is-- and this
is sort of my interest in it

00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:50.740
and the way I sort
of connect it--

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.630
is that this hasn't happened.

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:56.550
In a way, though, the
office has bled out

00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:00.060
of the building envelope,
and being set up

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:03.050
in homes, and into
all areas of life.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:07.290
It has somehow created a
need for more concentration.

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.600
What you see is
actually people working

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.870
in city- like environments
or really wanting density,

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.110
in a certain way.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.084
And the city sort of
informally right now--

00:57:19.084 --> 00:57:20.750
but I think in there
are planned efforts

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.570
at this, like Tony
Hsieh in Las Vegas--

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.930
to actually set up cities
that support work anywhere.

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:30.340
So the issue is not just
homes, although that's

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.610
interesting in terms of
the erosion between leisure

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.950
and work that is
already quite advanced.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:39.010
But also obviously
cafes, the rise

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.910
of coworking facilities,
which is largely

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:46.060
to support freelancers but
it could support any of you.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.030
And if you needed to
work at, whatever it is,

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.330
like NextSpace or something.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:54.420
So, in a way, the real
context to consider

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.910
that, that kind of
expansion of work

00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:02.330
is the urban environment,
that cities are in some ways

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:06.180
are turning into
large workspaces.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.650
Universities are talking about
giving up more space to people

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.390
to work in them I think
that's where I see the trend.

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:21.350
And, in a way, it points
to a kind of new raison

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:26.060
d'etre for cities themselves,
is to function as these expanded

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.030
workplaces.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.238
AUDIENCE: Well, it's funny
because, at the same time,

00:58:29.238 --> 00:58:30.700
you've got say,
in San Francisco,

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.700
you've got a lot of class
and political conflict

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:35.780
at the moment right now about
San Francisco being a feeder

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.850
city into basically
corporate office parks,

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:44.284
the great corporate office
park of Silicon Valley overall.

00:58:44.284 --> 00:58:45.950
And a lot of people
have answered, well,

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:50.290
one of the solutions to that is
greater telecommuting, right?

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.390
If you can densify
within a given city,

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.700
and the city is just going
to become a feeder city,

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.300
well, you could allow people
to work from their homes.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:02.320
So, there's a tension between
I guess the terror of one's

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.670
home becoming the
office, and also

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.950
the Utopian aspect of
that at the same time.

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:12.020
It's hard to know exactly
where that will pan out.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:15.900
NIKIL SAVAL: Yeah, I mean that's
a very complicated question.

00:59:20.599 --> 00:59:23.140
Some of the people within that
particular situation, I think,

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:28.430
some the proposals involve
densifying the actual offices,

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:29.740
like the campus offices.

00:59:32.217 --> 00:59:34.550
One of the critiques is that
they suck economic activity

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.320
out of the surrounding
environment.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.900
Having a cafe in
Facebook or Google

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.280
means that you don't have
it-- or it's less likely--

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.680
that you would have it
for those workers outside

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:47.750
and then for anyone else.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.720
And the other thing
that you said,

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:54.785
there are more people
moving to San Francisco

00:59:54.785 --> 00:59:56.720
and commuting by
bus or what have you

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.720
to the offices down south.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.625
It's a more complicated
issue than people

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.290
just simply moving
into that city.

01:00:04.290 --> 01:00:06.840
The city actually
supports those activities

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.760
and doesn't support
public housing.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.940
It doesn't support ways to
keep people in San Francisco.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.000
There's a way in which
it doesn't provide

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.600
economic activity that
is varied or diverse.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.030
And that's been true of San
Francisco for the last 30

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:23.570
years.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:25.310
I'm not saying that
this class conflict

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.710
isn't real and important.

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:30.210
AUDIENCE: It has a long-standing
generational history, yeah.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.126
NIKIL SAVAL: But yeah.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.500
It's accelerated tremendously
in the last few years.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.960
And the reasons for that are
not just people moving in.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.410
[APPLAUSE]
