00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
It’s Summer, and you know what that means!

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.620
Manipulating the spin and speed of a flying
sphere to change its velocity and elude a

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.340
Homo sapien swinging a third class lever!

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.240
Also known as baseball season.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.930
Hello fans of sport and physics alike, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.330
Baseball is often called America’s Past
Time, and it’s mostly known for being a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.650
relaxed-paced game that goes great with beer
and hot dogs.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.730
You know what else goes with baseball?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.349
Science, that’s what.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.009
Of course any physical activity is going to
have some physics behind it, and one of the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.400
more nuanced aspects of baseball to a non-fan
is the physics of different pitches.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.060
Justin Allegri, broadcaster for the San Jose
Giants, explains there’s a lot more to a

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.620
pitch than just rocketing the ball over the
plate.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.510
By changing the grip, pressure, and release
of the ball, the pitcher can alter its flight

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.700
path and make the batter’s life miserable.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.930
The most well known pitch is the fastball,
but there are different variations on the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.930
theme.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.350
The most direct one is a 4 seam fastball,
where the fingers are placed across 4 seams.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.940
On release the pitcher imparts backspin on
the ball.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.490
The result is the ball doesn’t drop as much
as it would otherwise, appearing to fight

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.750
gravity and travel in more of a straight line.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.830
The pitcher is taking advantage of the Magnus
effect, which is when a spinning sphere affects

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.510
the air pressure around it, much like an airplane
wing.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.211
The side of the ball spinning with the direction
of travel is essentially moving against the

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:21.670
air faster, creating more drag, creating more
pressure, and causing the air to push on it.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.420
On the opposite side of the ball, air pressure
is reduced and the ball travels more easily

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.420
in that direction.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.980
You see it in other ball sports too like in
Soccer, or yes, Football, I know, rest of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.620
the world, you don’t have to keep reminding
us.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.750
Curve balls take advantage of the Magnus effect
more, but instead of stabilizing the flight

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
into a straight line the topspin causes is
to drop and cut.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.400
Different grips and releases open up more
possibilities like sinkers, sliders, screwballs,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
and changeups, but they’re all essentially
doing the same thing; causing the seams to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.980
push air around and change the pressure on
the ball.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.280
The exception to the rule is the knuckleball.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.660
A Knuckleball is designed to spin only once
on it’s flight, Moving through the air this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.740
way causes a Kármán Vortex Street, which
is a string of vortices trailing alternating

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.880
sides of the ball.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.090
The effect is the ball wobbles from side to
side and its flight becomes impossible to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.090
predict.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090
Clearly the seams play a huge role in affecting
the flight of the ball.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.120
The seams on balls the pros use are smoother
than those used by college players, to give

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.870
them less of an advantage and grip.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.970
The lowered seams also give the batter an
advantage; because of the reduced drag a batter

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.730
will hit the smoother baseball farther.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.310
You’ll also notice balls that get hit into
the dirt and scuffed are tossed out by the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.400
umpires, because a skilled pitcher can use
the scuff to their advantage.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.010
Baseball pitches, are great examples of people
innovating and getting creative to elevate

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
their game.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.760
Speaking of insane augmentations, Toyota has
been doing some tinkering of their own with

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.840
the TRD line of Toyota Trucks.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.900
Enhanced to rule the off-road!
