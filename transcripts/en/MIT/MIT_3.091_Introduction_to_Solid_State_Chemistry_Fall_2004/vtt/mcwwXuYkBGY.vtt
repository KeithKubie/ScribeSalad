00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:39.266
What I want to do today is finish
the second installment of phase

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
diagrams. Last day,
we looked at unary phase diagrams.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That is to say, single component.
That meant all we had to do was

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
worry about pressure versus
temperature because everything is of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
simple composition.
And I have up here on the display a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
phase diagram of water which we
looked at last day.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:54.610
And I have redrawn it here for
convenience. And I just wanted to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.220
draw your attention to several
things. We are looking at how the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.840
stability of the different phases of
water varies with pressure and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.460
temperature. I have drawn the solid
region over here,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.070
single phase, liquid region up here
single phase, and vapor region over

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.690
here single phase.
And, at some point,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.130
we transit from solid to liquid.
And it does not happen at a single

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.390
point, it happens over a range of
temperatures and pressures along

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.660
this line which is called the
coexistence curve.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.930
Whenever you have two phases in
equilibrium, they define a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.190
coexistence curve.
And so here is the solid-liquid

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.460
coexistence curve,
liquid-vapor and solid-vapor.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.730
We saw that happens at R life,
which is the one atmosphere isobar.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:02:07.860
This equilibrium solid-liquid, that
is ice-water at zero degrees C.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:55.850
And the normal boiling point,
that is to say, one atmosphere

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.710
applied pressure which is nominally
sea level is 100 degrees C.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.560
And we saw how boiling point varies
with applied pressure.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.420
And that is defined along this
coexistence curve.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.280
The other thing to note is that
when the three coexistence curves

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.140
intersect, we have this unique set
of circumstances called the triple

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:33.680
point where all three
phases coexist.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:23.420
And they coexist at only one point.
That is to say, one

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.850
temperature-pressure combination,
which is very nearly identical to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.280
the solidification temperature.
This is not to scale. This is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.710
slightly higher than zero degrees C.
It is about 1/100th of a degree

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.140
above zero at a reduced pressure of
4.58 millimeters of mercury.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.570
And at this point here, the triple
point, you, in fact,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:03:03.806
have ice cubes floating in boiling
water.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:54.300
And there is the triple point.
And then the last thing was I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.610
talked about supercritical fluids at
the end of last lecture.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.920
Just for completeness, in the case
of water, water turns into a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.230
supercritical fluid at the elevated
temperature of 374 degrees Celsius,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.530
218 atmospheres. Above this
pressure-temperature pair,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.840
we have something that is simply
fluid. It is neither

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.750
a liquid nor a vapor.
You could argue that it is a highly

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.250
condensed vapor or highly rarefied
liquid, but it has the properties of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.750
a supercritical fluid.
What I want to do today is to now

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.250
look at multi-component systems.
And we want to start with two

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:48.700
component systems.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:51.120
We are not going to be talking about
pure materials.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.240
C will equal two,
so that means now we have to think

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.370
about temperature,
pressure and composition,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.490
because composition is a variable
between the two components.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.620
And that gets to be messy because
we already had a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.740
pressure-temperature diagram for
let's say component A.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.870
This is component A. And,
over here, I have the pressure

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:34.140
temperature variation
of component B.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:24.720
And here I have drawn the solid
liquid coexistence curve as it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.450
normally is found in most materials,
which is to say positive because

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.180
solids are generally denser than the
liquids. Water is one of the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.900
exceptions. Now the question is how
do various properties change with

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.630
composition? If I ask what is going
on in between here so I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.310
can join these two --
I am going to need a

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.930
three-dimensional plot; pressure,
temperature, composition. I have an

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.560
infinity of unary phase diagrams all
across here from pure A all the way

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.180
over to pure B with all of the
different composition ratios in

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.800
between. For example,
here is the melting point of A and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.430
here is the melting point of B.
I might ask how does the melting

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.060
point vary with composition.
Is that a case of just connect the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.680
dots? If I know the melting points
of the two end members,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.930
say copper and nickel.
And I want to know what the melting

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.790
point of a 50/50 copper-nickel alloy.
Is it just the halfway temperature

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.660
between the two,
or does the temperature go through a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.530
local maximum,
or does it go through a local

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.390
minimum or does the temperature go
nuts? I mean,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.260
the question is how does temperature
of some critical feature vary with

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.130
composition? We need to look at
three-dimensional stability maps.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:06:08.460
And this is a pain in the neck
because it is 3D and it is messy.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.800
But, fortunately,
this is 3.091. And 3.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.600
91 is concerned about solid-state
chemistry. In 3.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.400
91, we care more about liquid-solid
equilibrium instead of liquid-vapor

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.200
equilibrium because we do not
process too many materials in the

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.000
vapor state, we don't use too many
materials as vapors.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:27.790
This is the equilibrium that is most
important. We know that equilibria

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:34.590
depend upon temperature,
pressure and composition.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.390
And it turns out that when it comes
to the liquid-solid equilibrium,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.190
liquid-solid equilibrium is strongly
dependent, there is a strong

00:06:48.190 --> 00:07:05.913
dependence between the temperature
of transformation and composition.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:59.280
Whereas, the relationship between
the temperature of the

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.570
transformation and pressure is
weakly dependent.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.850
There is a weak dependence between
pressure and the temperature of the

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.140
transformation.
And we saw that last day.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.420
These are not to scale. In other
words, these lines are nearly

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.710
vertical for solid liquid.
You would have to apply geological

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:40.353
pressures to alter the melting point
of water substantially.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Whereas, we saw it doesn't take
anything more than just a rise in

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
elevation of several thousand feet
to move the boiling point along.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
That means I can throw away the
pressure dependence and just focus

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
on the two-dimensional relationship
between the temperature of a

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
transformation and the composition.
So that is what we are going to do.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:54.280
We are going to look at three
different types of binary systems.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.570
And, in each case, we are going to
assume that the pressure is one

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.850
atmosphere. And we know that the
dependence of the transformation

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.140
temperatures that we write is going
to be negligible in terms of the

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.420
impact that pressure might have on
them. We are going to look at three

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.710
different types of systems,
and they are all dependent upon the

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:34.220
extent of solubility.
Oh, what is the word?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:24.930
I have given them the very "catchy"
distinctions of type one,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.860
type two and type three. Let's look
at the type one type of binary

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.790
system. And type one binary system
has complete solubility.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.730
By this I mean complete solubility
of the two components.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.660
Complete solubility in solid and
liquid states.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.590
That is to say,
if I mix A and B,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.530
they will mix in all proportions as
solids and will mix in all

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.870
proportions as liquids.
And the second thing is we are

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.620
looking at change of state.
This diagram applies to a change of

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.370
state. And since we are talking
about solid-liquid that is the only

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.120
one we need to document.
Let's think about what the relevant

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.760
chemistry here is.
I mean, I have been telling you that

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.290
phase diagrams are stability maps
and you can just look at them and

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.820
consult them. But there are always
some basic chemistry embedded in

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.350
these diagrams.
For example, if it were a metal

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.880
system and I were to tell you that
these two metals,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.410
A and B, mix in all proportions as
solids and liquids,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.930
what would have to be the
characteristics of those two metals?

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.460
They would have to be either very
nearly similar or maximally

00:09:46.460 --> 00:10:06.386
different. They would have to be
very nearly similar.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:55.450
And, in fact, it is sort of a
takeoff on like dissolves like.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.900
Complete solubility in a liquid
state with respect to metals,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.360
when it comes to metals there is a
set of rules called the Hume-Rothery

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.810
Rules. Hume-Rothery was a British
metallurgist, and he annunciated a

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:17.270
set of rules for identifying
candidate systems that will have

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.930
this type of phase diagram.
And they are very simple.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.790
Anybody in 3.091 would have come up
with these rules if you had thought

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.660
about it before Hume-Rothery.
But he beat you to it so you cannot

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.530
get the glory anymore.
But let's think about it.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.390
What would have to be the situation?
If the two metals,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.260
A and B, are going to mix in all
proportions then they must be very

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.130
similar. They must have similar
crystal structures.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:11:04.860
That way you get simple
substitutional solid solutions.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:54.140
And, furthermore,
if they are going to substitute

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.280
solid for solid,
they should have similar atomic

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.420
dimensions. It does no good to have
two FCC metals mixing where one has

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.560
an atomic radius that is so large it
has to force fit into the lattice of

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.710
the other. Similar atomic volumes.
And, lastly, bring in some

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.850
chemistry. We want them to mix and
not chemically react,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:39.033
so they should have a small value in
electronegativity difference.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:28.710
If they are both the same size,
they are both crystal structure but

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.420
have a high electronegativity
difference, they are going to engage

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.140
in electron transfer.
That is no good. But I think this

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.850
set of Hume-Rothery Rules is nice to
reflect upon, in light of everything

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.570
else we have learned in 3.
91, because the phase diagrams,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.280
as I said earlier, have embedded in
them a lot of basic chemistry which

00:11:47.280 --> 00:12:07.093
goes back to electronic structure of
the constituents.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:55.460
Let's draw a schematic of an AB
diagram for one such system that I

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.920
call type one.
I am plotting A versus B.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.380
This is temperature on the vertical
axis. Horizontal axis is

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.840
composition. On the left side,
I have pure A. The right side, I

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.300
have pure B. And I am looking at
solid-liquid equilibrium.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.760
At this extreme, pure A, this end
member must be the melting

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.070
point of pure A.
And the other extreme is pure B.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.230
This is the melting point of pure B.
And I have drawn it just

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.380
arbitrarily where the melting point
of B happens to be higher than the

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.530
melting point of A,
but it does not matter.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.690
One has to be larger than the other.
This is going to answer the

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.840
question how does melting point vary
as a function of composition?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:13:02.813
It varies like this. It is not a
straight line for two reasons.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:52.060
The first one being that when you
take thermodynamics,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:57.130
subsequently, if you choose to do so,
you will understand the physical

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.190
chemistry behind what I am going to
tell you. Let me just state it

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.260
without proof that if C is greater
than one, in other words,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.330
if you are not in a pure material,
if you are in a multi-component

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.390
system, if C is greater than one,
it is impossible to go from phase 1

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:22.460
to phase 2. You cannot go from
phase 1 to phase 2 without a two

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:27.180
phase region in between.
We cannot go from all liquid to all

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.540
solid. Remember,
we said these mix in all proportions

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.900
down here. Solids,
you can mix any mix,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.270
any ratio of A and B as solids,
any mix of A and B as liquids. But,

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.630
because we must go through a two
phase regime, this opens up to give

00:13:44.630 --> 00:14:03.326
a two phase regime. Up here
this is all liquid.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:53.610
Down here this is all solid.
And in between is a two phase

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:58.220
regime of liquid and solid.
We can call it slush. We have seen

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.840
slush before. We have seen ice
slush in water.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.450
The two phase equilibrium for a
pure material.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.070
This is now liquid plus solid in a
multi-component system.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.690
Up here we have single phase liquid
because they are mixing in all

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.130
proportions, so this is a solution.
Down here, these are solid solutions.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.390
And in here we have a two phase
regime, a liquid phase homogenous,

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.660
a solid phase homogenous. And these
lines are now no longer called the

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.930
melting line or the freezing line.
We have two different lines. The

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.190
upper line defines the lowest
temperature for any composition.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.460
Pick any composition you want.
This temperature is the lowest

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.730
composition at which you have only
liquid present.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:15:05.860
Change the composition and that
temperature changes.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.500
But, below this temperature,
you start to see the emergence of

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.000
solids. This line here
is called the liquidus.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:15:05.420
Liquidus is the line associated with

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.280
this reaction.
Single phase liquid goes to liquid

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.140
plus solid. And the lower line is
called solidus,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:32.880
and it represents the complimentary
set.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
The solidus is the highest
temperature at any composition for

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
which you have only solid present.
If you see the line that I have

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
drawn, the solidus temperature is
the highest temperature for which we

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
have solid solution present.
If we raise the temperature anymore,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
we go in a two phase regime,
some liquid starts to emerge.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
The solidus represents the highest
temperature for all solid,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and it represents solid goes to
liquid plus solid,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
homogeneous solid.
Let's write it again.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
This is the lowest temperature for
only liquid. And this is at any C,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:50.000
at any value of composition. And a
solidus is the highest temperature

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.000
for only solid to be present at any
composition. And this only applies

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:24.790
once you move off of purity.
In here this is showing you how

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:30.390
things vary as a function of
composition. And such a diagram

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.990
that has such similarities because
the end members must have common

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:41.590
bonding, common size and so on,
this type of a diagram is called

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:47.190
isomorphous. This is an isomorphous
diagram. And the shape looks like a

00:16:47.190 --> 00:17:00.646
lens. It is a lens-shaped diagram.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:17:01.330
But if you want to get fancy,
we don't say lens-shaped. We say

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:06.660
lenticular from the Latin.
Lens is lent, degenerative is

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.990
lentis, so lenticular.
It is a lenticular diagram.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:17.330
Now we have it. Let's look at some
example systems that exhibit this

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.760
kind of behavior.
Before we do that,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.290
I meant to show you this.
We talked about what happens at

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.820
ultra high pressures.
This is water. We are down in here.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.350
This is now kilobars,
thousands of atmospheres.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.880
This is the normal line that you
see. That is this line that I have

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.410
shown you. That is here.
There is ice at a density of about

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.940
0.92. And normal water is about one,
so ice floats on water.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.460
But, if you keep pressing,
eventually you will force that

00:17:46.460 --> 00:18:07.320
crystal structure to change and it
will become more closely packed.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:53.870
And now you see normal behavior.
Liquid goes to solid. And all of

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.740
these different Roman numerals
represent different crystal

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.620
structures. Ice has at least nine
different crystal structures,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.490
and some of these are really
interesting. Look at this one.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.370
These are all triple points. This
is ice III, ice I and liquid.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.240
In a single component system,
that is a triple point. That is

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.120
uniquely defined.
Now, looks what happens over here.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:37.040
This is a triple point between ice
VI, ice VII and liquid.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:26.070
And it is at about 80 degrees C,
way up there. Now look at this one.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:31.150
This is ice VII. I am in a single
phase regime. It is 100 degrees C.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:36.220
I have to go to 25 kilobar, but we
have laboratories.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.300
It is 100 degrees C.
And it is not vapor. Remember,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.380
water boils. Normal boiling point
is 100 degrees C.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.460
But, if I apply 25 kilobars,
I go not only through liquid, I go

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.850
right across the solid.
You saw I brought the dry ice into

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.570
the classroom.
By the way, I was here yesterday

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.280
and half of the block was still
sitting there because I left it in

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.990
the box and it had this little
comfort zone of CO2 vapor around it.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.710
It was just naturally thinning in.
It took a long time.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.420
What is my point? My point is when
you make such a metastable state and

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.140
bring it into some unnatural
conditions, it will last

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:37.613
for a long, long time.
The kinetics are quite slow.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Let's say we go into the lab.
We make ice VII. It is 100 degrees

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
C, it is 25 kilobar,
and there is a party going on down

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
the hall. We come out and we have
some ice seven.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
It is going to start to want to
melt because the temperature is

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
going to fall.
You are going to move this way and

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
down. But some of it is going to be
left. Now you go up to somebody,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
you take some ice seven, you drop it
in the drink and the drink heats up

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:54.540
and starts to boil.
And the ice sinks to the bottom of

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.630
the glass. That might get someone
to rethink their drinking habits.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.720
This is the power of changing
pressure and temperature.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.810
By the way, those of you who know
"Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:14.900
there is ice IX. It exists. It has
been characterized.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:33.800
Somebody actually measured this
stuff, and we are still here.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.500
We didn't freeze the whole world,
so you can relax. He needs to

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.000
rename that maybe ice 11 or
something. I don't know if there

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.500
are any more phases here.
Here is a phase diagram

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.000
copper-nickel.
That is a lenticular diagram.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.500
Copper and nickel both FCC metals,
very similar in atomic dimension,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.000
very small electronegativity
difference. You have a lens-shaped

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.500
diagram. Copper melts at 1085
centigrade, nickel melts at 1455,

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.000
and there is the liquidus and the
solidus.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:51.330
And in between,
if you cool it at any one of these

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.660
concentrations,
you are going to go through this two

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.990
phase regime. And we are going to
talk a little bit more about that in

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.320
a second. Here is a ceramic system.
Here is nickel oxide, magnesium

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.660
oxide. This is an ionic solid.
It is nickel cations, magnesium

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.990
cations and oxide anions.
And the nickel and magnesium are

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.330
roughly similar in size,
modest electronegativity difference.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.660
And so this one starts at 2000
centigrade, goes up to 2800

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:34.853
centigrade and has a lens-shaped
diagram. Here is one.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:22.260
This is gold nickel.
It is almost lenticular.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.530
Look at the top part here.
The nickel melting point is up

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.790
around 1450. Gold melts at 1063.
It is almost perfectly lenticular

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.060
with this little bit of a dip here,
sort of the liquid-solid analogy to

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.330
an azeotrope. Again,
you see they are both FCC metals.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.590
But, in this case, the
electronegativity difference is a

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.860
little bit larger than you would
like. And so you see a little bit

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.300
of a freezing point depression here.
Now I want to go back and talk about

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.920
what is going on inside that two
phase regime, because that two phase

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.530
regime is peculiar.
Let's see what happens if we take

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.150
something of a particular
composition and cool it.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.760
Here is what I am doing.
I am going to blow this up.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.380
And, what I want to do is take
something that is about 40%.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:34.560
Here is where we are. We are
looking at the liquidus here.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:25.630
Liquidus line.
And here is the solidus line.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.270
This is all solid. This is single
phase, P equals one,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:36.900
this is all liquid single phase,
and this is liquid plus solid. And

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.540
let's say we drop the temperature
down into the middle of this two

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:48.180
phase regime. What is happening
here, this is a two phase system,

00:22:48.180 --> 00:23:06.826
and we have a liquid and a solid.
And the phase diagram tells us the

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
composition. Here is the sequence.
Let's look at, say, composition C2

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
there. Composition C2 is about 40%
nickel in copper.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
At 1300 degrees C,
we have homogeneous liquid.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And, if we go down to 1200 degrees
C, we have a homogeneous solid.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
These are the different grains.
This is liquid, this is solid, and

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:30.120
it is polycrystalline.
And the composition of each of these

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.370
grains is the same.
What is happening at 1250?

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:42.620
This diagram says I should have
solid and liquid,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:48.870
but, look, the composition of that
liquid is not 40% nickel in copper.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:55.110
The composition is way over here.
It is about 32%.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:01.330
And the composition of the solid is
up here at about 45%.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:07.550
This is 32% nickel and this is 45%
nickel. I have a nickel rich solid

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:13.770
and I have a copper rich liquid.
There is a shift. Suppose I take

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:29.940
something of a different
composition.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.570
This is the C2 that is on the
diagram. Here is C1.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.140
I think it starts at around 35%
nickel. This started at 40% nickel.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.710
C1 is 35% nickel. I cool it down
to the same temperature.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:38.280
It is the same end members.
The liquid at this temperature has

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.850
a unique value of nickel content.
It does not matter what the

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:47.420
composition is,
I will always end up with a liquid

00:24:47.420 --> 00:25:06.506
of one composition and a solid of
the other composition.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:56.660
Well, how can I start with two
different? This is 40% and this is

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.330
35% nickel. These end members are
the same. There is only one

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.990
variable left.
It is the relative amounts of these

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.660
because I need conservation of mass.
Because, at the end of the day, if

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.330
I add up all of the nickel in the
liquid and all the nickel in the

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:33.326
solid, it still has to
be net 40% nickel.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:24.570
Only in here it is 45% nickel.
Up here it is 32% nickel. I have a

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:29.140
Vernier scale.
I have a sliding scale that I can

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.710
move so that if I have something
that is 35%, in other words,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.280
it needs less of this phase, so the
35% is going to end up doing this.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.850
Whereas, the 40% is going to end up
doing this. It is the relative

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:47.420
amounts. This line that tells me
what the concentration of the solid

00:25:47.420 --> 00:26:06.706
and the liquid at any temperature is
called the "tie line."

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:57.630
The tie line defines the composition
end members, the liquid and the

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:03.270
solid in that two phase regime.
And we can take all of this that I

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:08.900
have been talking about and we can
codify it in terms of a simple rule

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:14.540
that captures the notion of phase
separation and conservation of mass.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.180
And that is called the "lever rule."
The lever rule answers the question,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:35.960
how much of each phase is present?
The relative amount present of each

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:20.000
phase in the two phase region.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:45.840
For example, here we are with the
40% nickel. It is 40% nickel in

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.690
copper. We have dropped down into
the two phase regime,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:57.530
draw the tie line. And the tie line
tells us that the liquid will

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:03.380
proportionate as follows.
This is 40% nickel at all liquid.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.230
Now we drop the temperature. This
is 1300. Now we drop down to 1250.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:15.070
And we know, according to the phase
diagram, we are going to end up with

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.690
a liquid and a solid.
And, furthermore,

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:26.070
the tie line tells us that the solid
is going to be 45% nickel and the

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.460
liquid is going to be 32% nickel.
The question is what are the

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.840
relative values?
It is shown right up there on the

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.220
transparency that the percent of the
liquid is equal to,

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.610
in this case, the end member 45
minus the individual amount at the

00:27:47.610 --> 00:28:06.753
concentration of the bulk divided by
the end members of the tie line.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:58.090
And we will multiply that by 100%.
And that gives us a value of 38%

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.180
present as liquid.
And why is it called the lever rule?

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.270
Because, if you look at the tie
line, here is where we are.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.360
We are at this value which is shown
in the phase diagram as z.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.450
This is our 40%. And the amount of
the liquid is x and the amount

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.300
of the solid is y.
And so, when I am asking how much

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.920
liquid is present,
I choose the amount opposite,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.530
as you do on a seesaw or
teeter-totter.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:37.150
In other words,
to calculate what the force is here,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.760
you take the amount between the
fulcrum and the opposite side

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.380
divided by the total length.
This is yz over xy. It gives us

00:28:46.380 --> 00:29:05.826
liquid. And then the compliment
gives us the amount for solid.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:55.140
You see that worked out for you on
the transparency.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.280
And this works for any two phase
regime. Whenever something drops

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.420
into a two phase regime,
disproportionation has to occur,

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.560
and the lever rule will give you the
relative amounts.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.710
The tie line tells you the
composition and the lever rule tells

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.850
you the relative amounts.
Two things. I want this to be like

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:35.100
you are that Manchurian candidate.
This is your cue.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:25.380
From now on, if you hear two phase,
you just go lever rule. What are

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.760
the end members?
Tie line, lever rule whenever you

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.150
see two phase regime.
And it will keep you out of trouble.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:41.530
I mean, many times I get into
trouble. I just think of the lever

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.920
rule and I am out of trouble.
Now let's look at a second case.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.300
Second case is type two phase
diagram in contrast to

00:29:52.300 --> 00:30:09.900
complete solubility.
Type two phase diagram is

00:29:37.700 --> 00:30:03.100
characterized by a system that has
partial or limited solubility.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:21.900
When you try to mix A and B, they
do not mix in all proportions.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:30:13.900
They only mix up to a certain point.
That is like a solubility limit or

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:31.433
a miscibility.
Miscibility and solubility are

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:25.090
synonymous.
This leads to a miscibility gap.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:31.290
A range of composition over which
you cannot mix the two of them and

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:37.490
form a homogeneous solution.
And, in this case, there is no

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:43.690
change of state.
That is either always liquid or

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:49.890
always solid. Let's look at the
phase diagram for one of

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:57.280
these type of systems.
A. B. I am plotting composition

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:05.850
across the abscissa.
The ordinate is temperature.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:14.420
And this gives us a synclinal phase
diagram. Above we have single phase.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:28.706
This is single phase and
this is dual phase.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
For example, this could be all
liquid. And then in here we have

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
two liquids. Or,
it could be all solid.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And inside here we have two solids.
When it comes to solid solutions

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
people use Greek letters and call
this alpha and beta.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
This is the coexistence curve or
the solubility limit.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.500
What is the coexistence curve?
The coexistence curve is liquid is

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.000
in equilibrium with liquid one and
liquid two. In other words,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.500
if you drop into this two phase
regime, what happens as soon as you

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.000
hear two phase?
Tie line, lever rule.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.500
The tie line will give you the
concentrations at the end,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.000
or solid goes to alpha plus beta.
Both of these are solid solutions.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Let's take a look at some of these.
This is gold nickel. At low

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
temperatures look what happens.
Gold nickel will actually phase

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
separate. If you take something
like this one here,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
which is 50 weight percent nickel,
at high temperatures they mix in all

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
proportions. Drop into here,
we have a slush consisting of liquid

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
and solid. And they have different
compositions given by the tie line.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:53.250
Drop even lower in temperature and
all of a sudden it is a single phase

00:32:53.250 --> 00:33:13.133
solid solution,
FCC lattice with gold and nickel

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:59.750
atoms 50/50. Well,
in this case it is weight percent so

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:20.366
it is not exactly on an atomic basis.
There it is about 75.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:33:06.250
And then we drop into lower
temperatures, and now they phase

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:26.200
separate. We end up,
for example, at 600 degrees.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:33:12.750
Let's get down to, say, room
temperature. This is 300 degrees C,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:32.566
but the lines are starting to get
fairly steep.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:20.260
What you find is that it will phase
separate so that you will end up

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.530
with zones that are nickel rich and
zones that are gold rich.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.790
And the tie line tells you the
compositions of both of those end

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.060
members. Here is one,
hexane-nitrobenzene. At high

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.330
temperatures they mix in all
proportions. You drop the

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.590
temperature and then they phase
separate, just as oil and water.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.860
Down at this temperature, you will
have a hexane rich phase and a

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.550
nitrobenzene rich phase.
And, the lower and lower you get in

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.660
temperature, the greater that
separation. Think about it at this

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.770
constant temperature.
What this is saying is that you can

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.880
put a certain amount of nitrobenzene
into hexane, and that is the

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.990
solubility limit.
If you try to put any more

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.100
nitrobenzene into hexane,
it won't go in. On the other side,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.210
it says you can put a small amount
of hexane in nitrobenzene.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.330
If you try to put any more,
it won't go in. It will just

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.440
precipitate out.
This makes sense to you,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.130
doesn't it?
Furthermore, at this temperature,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:22.390
I can put, say, 0.1 units of
nitrobenzene. If I raise the

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:26.660
temperature, the solubility goes up
with temperature.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.930
All of this is making sense.
Finally, you get to a temperature

00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:35.190
here above which they mix in all
proportions. This temperature is

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.460
called the "consolute" temperature.
Above the consolute temperature,

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.730
even a system that has a propensity
for limited solubility will mix in

00:34:43.730 --> 00:35:02.793
all proportions.
You see this in different systems.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:52.110
This one is a surprise.
This is two alkali halides,

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.230
sodium chloride and potassium
chloride. You would expect those to

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:00.350
just trade off with one another,
but there is a problem here. The

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:04.460
sodium ion and the potassium ion are
different enough in atomic dimension,

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.580
different enough in charge density
that, as you get to low temperatures,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.700
they phase separate.
Instead of making a perfect solid

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.820
solution at lower temperatures,
the single phase solid solution

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.940
breaks into a potassium rich solid
solution and a sodium

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.680
rich solid solution.
Here is from the polymer world.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.060
This one is polystyrene,
polybutadiene.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.430
At high temperatures,
you can mix them and make a

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:34.800
copolymer, a copolymer mix in all
proportions. As you drop the

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.180
temperature, they will phase
separate. And you will end up with

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.550
something that has islands of a
polystyrene rich phase.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.930
Not pure polystyrene. There is a
certain amount of polybutadiene in

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.310
it. And then the other phase will
be polybutadiene with a certain

00:35:48.310 --> 00:36:07.420
amount of polystyrene.
They phase separate.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Here is one. Certain systems,
instead of exhibiting a consolute

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
temperature in this fashion,
for entropic reasons the system is

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
flipped upside down.
This is a lower critical

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
temperature. This is weird because
normally you think as you raise

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
temperature you increase solubility.
This is one case where it goes the

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
inverse. Water triethylamine mixes
in all proportions at low

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
temperature. At higher temperatures
there is the --

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Instead of being synclinal,
this is anticlinal. It is a U

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
shaped curve. Single phase out here.
Down here they mix in all

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
proportions. Up here you can put a
certain amount of triethylamine in

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
and then it stops.
Then you get the second phase.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Here is the weirdest one of all.
This is nicotine and water. It has

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
an upper critical point and a lower
critical point.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
At low temperatures,
you can mix nicotine and water in

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
all proportions.
And, at very high temperatures,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
you can mix nicotine and water in
all proportions.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:50.880
And at intermediate temperatures
they phase separate.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.760
There is the map that tells you how
the system behaves as a function of

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.640
temperature and composition.
In here you cannot get a

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.520
homogeneous solution.
If you try to make a 50/50 mix of

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.410
water and nicotine and you heat that
to 100 degrees C,

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:10.290
it will phase separate.
Even though you will mix it at room

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.170
temperature, and it will be
homogeneous, as you raise the

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.050
temperature all of a sudden you will
see milkiness, globs of one

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:37.900
forming in the other.
What would happen if we were to take

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
60% sodium chloride and cool it down
to, say, 400 degrees C?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
What happens? Bingo. Tie line.
P equals two, so the homogenous

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
solid solution breaks into an alpha,
which is the designation for the

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
potassium chloride rich solid
solution, and beta,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
which is the designation for the
sodium chloride rich solid solution.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And how do we figure out the
relative amounts of alpha and beta?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Lever rule. It is a two phase
regime. Lever rule.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:54.280
That is it. Now I will do a little
experiment here to show you how this

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.570
works. I want to work with a simple
system. This is ouzo and water.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.850
Ouzo is a drink, a liqueur from the
absinthe family.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.140
And wormwood is the chief flavoring
agent. It contains licorice,

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:11.420
hyssop, fennel, angelica root,
aniseed. The thing is it has a lot

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.710
of oil in it. It is very oily.
It is clear and colorless but very

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:35.086
oily. And then water,
of course. You know what water is.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Let's have a look.
Can we cut to the document camera

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
here? What I am going to do is --

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:36.800
Here is water and here is ouzo.
These are at room temperature. I

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.590
am assuming the phase diagram looks
like this. I can put a little bit

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.390
of ouzo into water,
and I can put a little bit of water

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.190
into ouzo, but if I exceed these
solubility limits,

00:38:48.190 --> 00:39:07.380
in here this is milky because it is
two phase.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:56.800
This is milky and this is clear.
Why? Because this is single phase

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.590
and this is P equals two.
We are going to do an experiment

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.390
here. What I am going to do is put,
this is just pure water, and you

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:11.190
know what pure water looks like,
distilled water. And here is some

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:29.380
ouzo. And this is clear
and colorless as well.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.500
Now what I am going to do is pour

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:11.000
water into the ouzo.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:34.630
If I pour a little bit in,
I can stir this, and it will

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.270
dissolve. What I am doing here is
pouring water into ouzo and I am

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.900
coming across.
If I pour too much water in,

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.540
I am going to hit this miscibility
gap, and this will precipitate out.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.180
And when it precipitates out, it
has a different index, it

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.280
is going to look milky.
In fact, I think I have already hit

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.850
there. Look at this.
I have crossed the miscibility gap.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.420
Now, if my hunch is correct, I
should be able to keep adding water

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:21.706
and eventually emerge on this side.
Let's see what happens.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:57.000
We will dilute it.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
I am going to pour this down to
almost a tiny fraction.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:28.390
And I will pour in more.
I have crossed the miscibility gap.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:33.790
I can do it the other way. Let's
start with water.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:39.190
We can go across or we can do the
other. It doesn't matter.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:44.590
Now, what is the difference between
this and absinthe?

00:40:44.590 --> 00:41:02.980
Absinthe is similar,
but it has a little more color to it.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:57.330
Absinthe is green.
And so, when you add water to

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:04.660
absinthe, you are supposed to add it
five parts water and one part

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:21.320
absinthe. We are going to make the
louche which is the milky.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:21.580
This is the way absinthe would be

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.740
drunk. You can see how milky this
is. Now, when Toulouse-Lautrec

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:31.910
drank, he made a drink called the
"Earthquake." What he did with the

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:37.080
earthquake is he added cognac to the
absinthe louche.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:42.240
What are we going to do here?
What is the chemistry? The

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.410
chemistry is the following.
I have oil droplets here in water.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.870
Oil.
And then over here is water.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:42:01.620
What I am going to do is put ethyl
alcohol, CH3CH2OH.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:09.370
And what does the OH do?
The OH makes a hydrogen bond.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:17.120
I have a hydrophilic head. Ethyl
alcohol is amphipathic.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:30.306
And this is a hydrophobic tail.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:28.870
The hydrophobic tail can stab the
oily phase of the louche.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.740
This is what you do in cooking.
How many recipes will ask you to

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.620
add a little bit of alcohol?
And they will subsequently ask you

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.490
to heat it. And you say,
well, wait a minute, alcohol is

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.370
going to evaporate.
What is going on? Whenever they

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.240
are asking for alcohol,
chances are you are adding something

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.120
fatty to an aqueous solution and it
does not want to mix.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:43:06.173
As soon as you add the alcohol it
cosolvates.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:53.420
Alcohol is magical for this
amphipathic character.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.850
Let's make the Earthquake.
The Earthquake is like this.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:02.280
We are going to add a little bit of
this. It is a beautiful green-gold

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.710
color, but it is clear because what
has happened now,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.140
I have put in a third component.
Now I have got water, ouzo, alcohol.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.570
And as I add alcohol,
I narrow the miscibility gap.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:34.273
The miscibility gap narrows as a
result of that.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
It is fantastic.
May we go back to the computer

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
graphic, please?
This is where we were.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
We were along this tie line.
And I figured the louche is here.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
It is five parts water, one part
absinthe. And then away we go.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
This is the late 1800s. Why did
absinthe take over in France?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Because there was a blight that
wiped out the vineyards.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:53.860
And so the price of wine shot up and
people started turning to absinthe.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.730
You hear he is making the louche.
He is pouring water through a

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.590
slotted spoon on which there is a
sugar cube. And here is a woman

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.460
looking at him saying,
wow, is he ever cool, what a guy.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.330
Hey, it's the 1800s. This is an
object of art.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.190
This is Van Gogh.
This is Picasso. This is the

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:17.060
absinthe drinker.
This is Picasso after he,

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:37.520
I guess, had a lot of absinthe.
The only thing I can recognize here

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
is the slotted spoon with what
appears to be a rather large sugar

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
cube. And this is somebody's mind
after huge quantities of it.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
The thing about it is it had
thujone in it,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
which comes from the white cedar.
And what this does is it

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
antagonized the receptors that
regulate neuron firing.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
We can think much faster,
but we kind of slow ourselves down.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
It is the gamma-aminobutyric acid
that helps us stay in place.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:53.530
Actually, epileptics suffer from a
lack of regulation.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:58.060
And that is a motor regulation,
but in the case of mental acuity.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:02.590
This is one of these cases where
the alcohol tracks with the thujone.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:07.130
And so instead of making you drunk
and stupid, it makes you drunk and

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:11.660
very, very highly active.
But unfortunately large quantities

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.190
of it also had other neurological
disorders. If you have seen Moulin

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:20.730
Rouge, you will see here,
it is all about absinthe in that

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.920
period.
What happened was this absinthe took

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.780
over. I mean,
people drank huge quantities of this

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.640
in place of wine.
Eventually, the wine was restored.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.490
The vineyards in France were
restored by grafting onto American

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:40.350
stocks. There are very few wines in
France that are not produced as

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:44.210
hybrids on American stock.
Occasionally, you will see a bottle

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:48.070
of wine that says vieux vin,
old vine, meaning that it was spared

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:52.140
from the Phylloxera blight.
By and large, it is not American

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:56.420
vine. French wines are grown on
American roots,

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.710
just remember that.
Now the wine cooperatives wanted to

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.990
get people to switch back to wine,
so there was this strange alliance

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:09.280
between the wine cooperatives and
the temperance movement to get

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.570
people to stop drinking absinthe.
And so what happened was there were

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.850
a number of murder trials in which
somehow it was portrayed that

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:38.033
absinthe figured prominently.
And so, little by little governments

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
banned it. This is October 7,
1910 where absinthe is being banned

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
in Switzerland.
Here it says, Gentlemen,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
this is the hour. And this is the
symbol of absinthe.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Absinthe was known affectionately
as the "green fairy."

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
That is why in Moulin Rouge you
will see this sort of Tinkerbell

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
type figure, Nicole Kidman playing
this Tinkerbell figure in an

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
animation. Well, she
is the green fairy.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:55.380
And she has a wand made of opal
because the beverage is opalescent.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:00.760
When it shimmers, you have
gradients in index of refraction to

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:06.150
give you that internal incipient
surface. Here is the green fairy

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.530
slain by the temperance movement and
so on. The last thing I wanted to

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:16.920
comment on is how we use the two
phase regime in purification.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.300
Much of what we know about
purification requires that we go

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:41.033
into a two-phase regime.
Because the thing that happens in a

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.500
two phase regime is two phase region
implies compositional

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:23.000
differentiation.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:49.160
For example, here is the phase
diagram. For one time,

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:55.330
I am going to go to liquid vapor.
This is the liquid vapor phase

00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:01.490
diagram of ethyl alcohol and water.
We know that water boils at 100

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:07.660
degrees C. This is normal boiling
point. And ethyl alcohol boils at

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:13.830
78.5 degrees C.
And they are both polar liquids.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:31.326
Ethyl alcohol is a little bit more
elongated than water.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:24.280
It is very nearly an isomorphous
phase diagram.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.570
There is a tiny little dip but,
by and large, it is an isomorphous

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:32.850
phase diagram.
Alcohol and water,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:37.140
miscible in all proportions in the
vapor, obviously.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:41.420
And this is the liquid.
This is the two phase liquid plus

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.710
vapor regime. Let's say you have
some wine and it is 10% alcohol.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:49:05.486
What do you do? You heat the wine
up to this two phase regime.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:56.440
And now, in the two phase regime,
tie line. What do you note? You

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:02.880
note that the alcohol content of the
vapor is much higher than the

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:09.330
alcohol content of the liquid.
What we can do is condense the

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:15.770
vapor, which puts us down here,
and now reheat. Condense. Reheat.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:21.330
Condense.
And, by doing so,

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:25.990
we can raise the alcohol content.
Or, in some cases, this could be

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:30.660
the way you purify for the liquid.
It doesn't matter. You either want

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.330
the condensate or you want what was
the base from which you took the

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:39.990
condensate. And this is used over
and over again.

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:44.660
It is used in the solid-state to
purify metals.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:49.330
Look up here on the slide.
Suppose I have a solution that

00:49:49.330 --> 00:50:07.460
consists of, over here
of, say, 60% nickel.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
It is all liquid.
Drop it down into this two phase

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
regime. The solid that comes out
has very much less gold in it.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
That means that the liquid behind,
the last liquid to solidify is going

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
to have more gold in it than the
bulk that I started with.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
I can keep taking that fraction by
moving into a regime where the

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
composition splits.
And I either want the high fraction

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:22.380
or the low fraction.
This is the principle by which,

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:27.150
in fact, the computer-grade silicon
is made. We start with beach sand.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:31.920
We upgrade to something that has to
be about four or five nines silicon

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.690
for single crystal growth.
How do we go from something that is

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:41.450
about 98% silicon,
2% impurities to such a high degree

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:46.220
of purification?
By dropping repeatedly into the two

00:50:46.220 --> 00:51:04.506
phase regime and pulling
out the pure fraction.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.500
The key here is compositional
differentiation,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.000
which then allows you to distill.
You start with 10%, you end up 40%,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.500
you go from wine and end up with
brandy or cognac.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.000
There it is. It is all back to
chemistry, chemistry,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.866
chemistry. OK. We will see you on
Wednesday.
