00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:04.810
WESLEY CHUN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.490
This is Wesley Chun from Google.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.560
Have you ever wanted to
programmatically update

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.600
your email signature,
say to send

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.140
the latest news or random witty
quotes to your email messages?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.100
Me, too.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.280
In 2016, the Gmail API was
enhanced with the ability

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.889
to update user settings,
including signatures.

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.930
In a moment, I'll walk
you through a short Python

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.000
script that does exactly that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.040
For more info on this
addition to the API,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.870
check out the launch blog post.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.840
But first, a quick word
about SendAs email addresses.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960
Gmail lets you send
messages from addresses

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.510
other than your actual Gmail
address, which is considered

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.340
your primary address.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.040
This lets you manage multiple
accounts from the same Gmail

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.390
user interface.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.580
As expected, you need
to own or have access

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.340
to the alternate email
accounts in order to do this.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.710
However, most people only
use their primary address,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.240
so you may not know about it.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.790
You can learn more about
the SendAs addresses

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.770
at the pair of links onscreen.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.380
Now, you may be tempted
to use the term "alias,"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.090
especially since it was in the
help pages you just looked at,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.740
right?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.660
But try to avoid
that word for now,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.360
as it will open up Pandora's
box and distract us

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.740
from the focus of this video.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.310
Hello?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.341
Email signatures?

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:10.840
See?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.090
You almost forgot
already, right?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.820
If you stick with sender
addresses or SendAs email

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.520
addresses, there won't
be any confusion.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.380
So what's the app
we're building today?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.910
It's a short Python
script that sets

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.570
a quote of the day
as the signature

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.130
in your primary address.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.520
Well, where does this
quote of the day come from?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.650
Well, it can be as
simple and as boring

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440
as this function that
returns a hardcoded string.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.820
Cute, but not very
random, right?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.060
A better idea is to choose
from a number of quotes

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.590
you have in a
relational database

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.880
with columns for
quotes and authors.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.530
Here's some sample code for
data in a SQLite database-- more

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.810
random, which is cool,
but not as efficient,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.400
because we're
selecting all the rows

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.770
and then choosing one randomly.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.850
I prefer to use a web service
instead, using a REST API.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.230
The code snippet here
does exactly that.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.070
You only need to provide the URL
for a quote of the day service

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.990
that returns a JSON payload.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.050
To play it safe, it does fall
back to a hardcoded string--

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.300
the one we saw earlier--
if the service fails

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.710
to return a quote.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.040
Now, be sure to have the latest
Python Client Library installed

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.720
with pip or pip3.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.480
Also make sure to have a
Google API project in the dev

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.060
console with the
Gmail API enabled.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.430
Finally, if you're
new to the Gmail API,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.292
check out our intro video first.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.000
If you're ready, let's
go to the computer

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.531
and take a look at the code.

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.030
OK.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.580
Here in the desktop, I have
a window open to Gmail.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.230
And I clicked on Compose, and
I'm composing a new message,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.200
and you can see my
current email signature.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.450
As much as I love it,
it's time for a change,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.780
so let's go to the code.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.540
On lines 1 through
16, you can see

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.120
that these are our standard
imports in boilerplate,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.340
except for line
8, which is where

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.630
we get the quote of the day.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.670
And we saw three
examples of that earlier.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.460
On line 10, we need to
have the authorization

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.590
scope to access Gmail settings.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.380
And then on line 16 is where
we build a service endpoint

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.490
to Gmail.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.950
On lines 18 to 19,
this is where we get

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.510
all of our sender addresses.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.020
And the fields requests
only the sendAs.isPrimary

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.990
and sendAs.sendAsEmail fields.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.980
The first one, isPrimary,
is a Boolean flag on

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
whether or not an address is
the current primary address.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.410
And the sendAsEmail is
just the email address.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.660
So we're getting back a
flag and an email address.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.620
Got it?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.340
We execute this call to the
API, get the results keyed off

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.390
of sendAs.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.790
And then lines 20
through 22 is where

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.700
we cycle through all of
the sendAsEmail addresses

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.670
and stopping when the primary
one is found, which you know

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.940
will be contained in
the variable address.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.810
Lines 24 and 25 are where we
actually set the new signature.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.300
So given what we have
defined on line 8,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.100
we're going to pass
that in as the body,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.410
and we're going to use
the primary address's

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.170
sendAsEmail attribute,
which is just, like I said,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.580
the email address.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.470
And then we execute
that API call.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.270
And when it comes
back, we confirm

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.880
that the primary address
signature was changed.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.530
Now, note that lines 18 through
22 are really only necessary

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.150
if you have many
sender addresses

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.680
and want to search for the
primary one to modify it.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.034
But if you already know
the primary sender address

00:04:09.034 --> 00:04:10.450
because you only
have one address,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.140
there's no need
to do any of this.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.470
You just pass your
one Gmail address

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.860
in here as the sendAsEmail
argument, and you're done.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.570
So all this can go.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.970
But I think it's a good idea
for you to get practice.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.845
Because one day, you
might have a whole bunch

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:25.770
of sender addresses, right?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.127
And by the way, our
quote of the day--

00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:29.710
we're just going to
use the simple one

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.600
that I demoed earlier
with a slightly more

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.780
interesting quote.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.280
All right.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.870
Let's run it and
see what happens,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.820
assuming that you've
already run this before

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.540
and you've gone through
the OAuth 2 prompt.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.320
OK.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.860
It says the primary
address has changed.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.910
So let's kill this compose,
refresh our Gmail window.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.130
Click on Compose again,
and you see, boom,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.570
we got a new email signature.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.880
Isn't that awesome?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.040
So, yes, you can change
an email signature

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.530
in less than 30 lines of code.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.060
But now hold on, sailor.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.650
While you can go crazy with
your consumer Gmail settings,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.350
be aware that more sensitive
operations in a Google Apps

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.260
domain, such as modifying
sender addresses or controlling

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.060
forwarding, are
restricted to accounts

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.912
with domain-wide authority.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.870
If you want to dig deeper
into the code sample,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.540
check out the
accompanying blog posts.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.610
Well, where can you
find out more info?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.985
Well, the first link takes
you to the first of the guides

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:22.390
we have on Gmail settings.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.700
If you're new to the API
and want to get an overview,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.230
check out the second link.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.740
The last link takes you directly
to the API reference docs.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.790
Want a challenge?

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.090
Well, write some code that uses
a Gmail API to manage filters

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.490
or configures your
vacation responder.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.130
Well, we hope these features
will help enhance your next app

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.717
using the Gmail API.
