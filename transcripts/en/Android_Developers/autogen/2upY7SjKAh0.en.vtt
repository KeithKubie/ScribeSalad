exactly last video and is there a way to

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680
exactly last video and is there a way to
 

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:13.420
exactly last video and is there a way to
do that for fragments as well and

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.430
 

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.310
not really let's see you can manage

insane so you can book set

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480
insane so you can book set
 

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.090
insane so you can book set
customizations on the fragment

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100

transaction yeah so you could

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.090
transaction yeah so you could
 

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.110
transaction yeah so you could
theoretically get the view from the

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120
theoretically get the view from the
 

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.840
theoretically get the view from the
fragment I call it fragment docket view

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:29.850
fragment I call it fragment docket view

and then sort of hacking an animation

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:31.890
and then sort of hacking an animation
 

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.570
and then sort of hacking an animation
together that will do some it similar

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:34.580
together that will do some it similar
 

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.030
together that will do some it similar
you would need to provide an ID for in

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040
you would need to provide an ID for in
 

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.940
you would need to provide an ID for in
animation so can you create an animation

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:40.950
animation so can you create an animation
 

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.300
animation so can you create an animation

there's two versions of the methods for

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:46.650
there's two versions of the methods for
 

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.200
there's two versions of the methods for
my remember there's one which gives a

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.210
my remember there's one which gives a
 

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.610
my remember there's one which gives a
resource ID and one that has an

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.620
resource ID and one that has an
 

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.060
resource ID and one that has an
animation object no I think they're both

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.070
animation object no I think they're both
 

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.680
animation object no I think they're both
there are two methods but I think they

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:54.690
there are two methods but I think they
 

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.570
there are two methods but I think they
both require the ID ok I'll check that

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:58.580
both require the ID ok I'll check that
 

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.140
both require the ID ok I'll check that
in my case I think you can use the tool

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.150
in my case I think you can use the tool
 

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.240
in my case I think you can use the tool
to create an object for animation then

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.250
to create an object for animation then
 

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.940
to create an object for animation then
attach it to the view just animation

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:10.950
attach it to the view just animation
 

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:18.380
attach it to the view just animation

you're right without them either those

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:33.630
you're right without them either those
 

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.690
you're right without them either those
were and I mean obviously passing in

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700
were and I mean obviously passing in
 

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.579
were and I mean obviously passing in
your own custom animation would probably

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:40.589
your own custom animation would probably
 

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:43.250
your own custom animation would probably
solve this as you pointed out but the

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260
solve this as you pointed out but the
 

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:50.470
solve this as you pointed out but the
API doesn't allow but yet mmhmm yeah

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480
 

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.540
alcohol coming of away then ok always

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:56.550
alcohol coming of away then ok always
 

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.250
alcohol coming of away then ok always
I'll investigate because that's quite

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260
I'll investigate because that's quite
 

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.340
I'll investigate because that's quite
interested in to public answer almost

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:01.350
interested in to public answer almost
 

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.610
interested in to public answer almost
definitely yeah wait but if you have a

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620
definitely yeah wait but if you have a
 

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.370
definitely yeah wait but if you have a
fragment hold of you can't you do the

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380
fragment hold of you can't you do the
 

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.540
fragment hold of you can't you do the
animation on it when the view changes

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:10.550
animation on it when the view changes
 

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.400
animation on it when the view changes
but yeah it later to itch it should be

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.410
but yeah it later to itch it should be
 

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.949
but yeah it later to itch it should be
easier to do that instead of packing

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959
easier to do that instead of packing
 

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:18.290
easier to do that instead of packing
after the view is created or something

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300
after the view is created or something
 

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.829
after the view is created or something
like that

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839
 

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:25.860
like once on view created and then you

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:25.870
like once on view created and then you
 

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.920
like once on view created and then you
load the animation and insert it to the

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:28.930
load the animation and insert it to the
 

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.130
load the animation and insert it to the
view back but I want to have the same

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:32.140
view back but I want to have the same
 

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.410
view back but I want to have the same
effect like you fade up an image and

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:34.420
effect like you fade up an image and
 

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.600
effect like you fade up an image and
then the image is displayed in full

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.610
then the image is displayed in full
 

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.210
then the image is displayed in full
screen for example like in a gallery

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.220
screen for example like in a gallery
 

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.780
screen for example like in a gallery
like you would have it so you would need

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:42.790
like you would have it so you would need
 

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.850
like you would have it so you would need
the original location of the image in

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:44.860
the original location of the image in
 

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.370
the original location of the image in
the first fragment and fade it up to the

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:47.380
the first fragment and fade it up to the
 

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.199
the first fragment and fade it up to the
full screen fragment like activity

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:52.209
full screen fragment like activity
 

00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:56.300
full screen fragment like activity
option that's pretty well okay yes

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.310
option that's pretty well okay yes
 

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:01.380
option that's pretty well okay yes
anyways and if no one's got question

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.390
anyways and if no one's got question
 

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.090

the best way to check and see if you are
 

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.370
the best way to check and see if you are
able to commit a transaction for a

able to commit a transaction for a
 

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.590
able to commit a transaction for a

prev med school you'll get a big section

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.570
prev med school you'll get a big section
 

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.569
prev med school you'll get a big section
back and so he's asking what the best

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:30.579
back and so he's asking what the best
 

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:33.060

way to check whether you are past that

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.070
way to check whether you are past that
 

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.090
way to check whether you are past that
or not and and if you are save the

later so my original sort of fought with
this was if you want to commit the

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:44.860
this was if you want to commit the
 

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.650
this was if you want to commit the
transaction later anyway one lunch you

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.690
a scrollview um yeah if you are going to
do that you're going to need to handle

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:09.700
do that you're going to need to handle
 

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.210

yeah when people use the Play Store and

yeah when people use the Play Store and
uh we believe that the Play Store stats

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480
uh we believe that the Play Store stats
 

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.299
uh we believe that the Play Store stats
are more relevant for android app

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:19.309
are more relevant for android app
 

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.610
