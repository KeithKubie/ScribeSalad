00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.750
After being in orbit for almost 28 years,
the Hubble space telescope might be coming

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.410
to its end, but does it really have to be?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.799
Hubble is expecting a companion soon known
as the James Webb space telescope.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.270
Hubble’s mission is expected to last into
the 2020s, and the young new James Webb is

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.840
expected for launch in 2019.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.830
Which means, for that one year, the two observatories
will be working hand-in-hand in collaborative

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.830
data.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640
But when Hubble comes close to its end, what’s
next?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.280
Hubble has been in space for almost three
decades!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.480
The equipment has been highly exposed to solar
radiation in Lower Earth Orbit...

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.539
The fine-guidance sensors, which are some
of the original electronics from the very

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.149
start of the mission, are beginning to degrade
due to those high radiation levels...

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.660
… Hubble’s had 5 service missions.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.210
AND its camera housing has been hit many times
by space debris--like, it actually has impact

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.210
craters.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.640
So, obviously Hubble has been through quite
lot.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.550
And now here comes James Webb..

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.769
Which isn’t REPLACING Hubble, but instead,
complementing it.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.460
These observatories are very different from
one another.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.780
Hubble’s images and data are found mainly
in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.610
Its lead to discoveries like supermassive
black holes being the center of most, if not

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.070
all galaxies,
And even confirmed the expansion of the universe...

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.930
James Webb, however, will mainly focus on
infrared wavelengths, and because the mirrors

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.290
have a six and a quarter (6.25) times more
collecting area than Hubble it will be able

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.000
to see way further into the universe than
Hubble ever could.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.670
That’s including seeing galaxies that formed
in the very beginning of our universe!

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.890
But still, the main question now, is what
to do with Hubble once its batteries die out

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.620
-- which WILL happen, eventually.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.890
We’ve got some options before then: we could
move it into a safe parking orbit somewhere

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.640
-- kinda making it into a space museum?
or we could send a mission to Hubble to prepare

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.820
it for a guided re-entry and landing to earth.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.790
A lot of scientists feel if we do send a mission
up to Hubble, then why don’t we just refurbish

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.690
and keep it in service instead!

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.350
But now here it is 2018, and there’s no
solid plan for what to do with this telescope.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.960
If by 2020, we decide to crash land the observatory,
we can control it’s landing by 2028.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.380
But according to NASA’s report on it, the
HST won’t naturally de-orbit before 2027

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.430
Otherwise if we just leave it alone, it will
naturally de-orbit itself and crashland somewhere

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.430
on Earth.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.260
I don’t know about you guys but I vote for
Hubble being put in service again.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.860
With an ever expanding universe we can use
all the incredible instrumentation that we

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.800
have to discover more in our cosmos.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.980
De-orbiting is not a huge deal, there’s
a very low chance it would hit anyone, but

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.810
Hubble is really big, how big?

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.310
Find out in Trace’s video here!

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.050
Remember when Hubble needed fixing after it
launched?

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.600
Its optical issues were obviously repaired,
and now this technique they employed is used

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.450
today in mammograms to detect breast cancer
months sooner than other methods.
