00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:07.020
This is a Minuteman 3 Missile, capable of
carrying up to three thermonuclear warheads.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.130
They range from 3-5 hundred kilotons.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.260
That’s more powerful than 6 hundred million
pounds of dynamite.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.500
And this is a cutting edge computer from the
early 1990s.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.920
And is used as the system processor to launch
the Minuteman 3 Intercontinental ballistic

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.250
missiles.This is how we would conduct nuclear
war, on eight inch floppy disks.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.529
This is an 8 inch floppy disk.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.710
It holds just under 250 kilobytes.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.770
It’s only good for text documents, a super
low-res photo or a song.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.950
Right now there are over 450 Minuteman three
missiles buried deep under fields in the sparsely

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.820
inhabited regions of the United States.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.030
They are connected by a spider-web of thousands
of miles of cables, ready to strike at top

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.469
secret targets faster than you can get a pizza.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.160
Welcome to F.E. Warren Air Force Base, home
of the 90th Missile Wing.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.799
They command 150 of these Minuteman III missiles.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.180
It's hard to imagine a weapons system more
powerful than the one we operate.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
And yet, these missiles, their launch control
centers and their command capsules all operate

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.700
on this antiqued technology.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.659
That processor that it uses to basically run
the operating system, is about a 386 equivalent,

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.070
so you are looking at early 90s technology.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.270
There is a cursor, it’s a square.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.369
Like an old Atari 2600.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.299
We use a trackball not a mouse.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.130
It has 100 megabytes of hard drive memory
and it has about 16 megabyte of ram.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.130
The missiles itself, that guidance computer,
uses an operating system about the size of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.130
an 8 inch floppy disk.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.789
It’s about 200 kilobytes of memory and one
channel of communication uses that floppy

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.189
disk to tell the system how to operate.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.469
It was cutting edge technology back in 1971.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.179
Old technology is not necessarily bad thing.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:12.069
With an older weapons system like the Minuteman
3, which really was designed in the late 60s

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.180
early 70s, if it still works, and it provides
us some good benefits, let’s leave it in

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.159
place and not mess with it.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.450
There are benefits to old technology.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.709
Modern networked computers can be easily hacked
and compromised with malware, and with these

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.159
machines, that’s more difficult.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.060
We don't use modern technologies such as I
say wifi, WiFi’s been around for decades,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.270
Wifi, Bluetooth.. there's no cloud for the
Minuteman III operating weapons system, we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.959
don’t use those technologies and that gives
us a certain amount of security because it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.549
reduces the number of vulnerabilities we have.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.340
To say anything is hackerproof, absolutely,
100% is, that’s dangerous and we would never

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.519
say that we are 100% hacker proof.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.519
We take a great amount of effort to ensure
that we are mitigating every potential vulnerability

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.989
that we can identify.

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.680
While these computers may be from the 70s,
the missileers who run these facilities, skew

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.859
a bit younger.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.980
Most of them are too young to remember the
Floppy Disk, not to mention Pac Man or Pong.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.879
In fact the disks they're handling are (in
some cases) older than they are.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.599
The missileers look for false alarms and fake
intruder signals caused by stray deer and

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.599
bad weather.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.220
The combination of old technology and humans
is what has kept the Minuteman 3 safe so far.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.180
Look, they're old, and we know that, but a
lot of the obscure technology that we use

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.650
still works.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.239
So if we don’t need to upgrade it, then
we don’t.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.489
With the Minuteman weapons system, because
it is so important and so vital, and the destructive

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.989
power of the weapon’s system is so vast.

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.870
Above and beyond anything else we need to
ensure that this weapons system is safe and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.870
secure.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.610
And I can tell you right off the bat, I have
complete confidence in the safety and security

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.049
of our weapons system and the nuclear weapons
that we use on the nuclear weapons system.

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.519
So although these machines might be antiquated,
this is still arguably one of the most powerfully

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.409
impactful computer systems in human history…

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.189
So, any changes they're going to make will
have to be really well thought out, and top,

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.889
top secret.
