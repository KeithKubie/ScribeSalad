00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.870
We now have a definite
integral going

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.790
from x equals 0 to x
equals square root of pi,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
of x sine of x squared dx.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.730
So the first thing that you
might want to ask yourself

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.300
is whether u substitution
is appropriate here.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.790
And if it is, what would
you set u to be equal to?

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.490
I'll let you think
about that for a second.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.400
Well, we see here this
expression, x squared.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.990
And if we were to just take
the derivative of x squared,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.910
it would be 2x.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.430
We have an x here,
so it's almost a 2x.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.930
To turn this x into 2x we
could multiply it by 2.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.150
But we can't just
only multiply it by 2,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.620
because that would
change the value

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.110
of this entire expression.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.290
We'd also have to
multiply by 1/2.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.550
So all I've done so far is I
multiplied by 2 and by 1/2,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.980
which is the same thing
as multiplying by 1.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.480
I have not changed the value of
this entire definite integral.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.470
Now, let's do our
u substitution.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.640
If we set u as
equal to x squared,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.545
we now know that du is
going to be equal to 2xdx.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.910
And so, what can we see here?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.330
Well, we have our u there,
that's how we defined it.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.700
And our du is going
to be 2x times dx.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.040
So this entire
inside, or the thing

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.080
that we're taking the integral
of, the definite integral of,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.830
is going to be-- we can rewrite
it as sine of x squared.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.080
But x squared is
just u, so sine of u.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.320
And instead of 2xdx, we
know that 2xdx is now du.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.820
So the thing that we're taking
the integral of in terms of u

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.940
could be expressed in this way.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.440
And so we have our integral.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.650
But these boundaries
of integration

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.430
were written in terms of x.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.570
We could have written
this as x is equal to 0,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.150
to x is equal to
square root of pi.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.286
Now we want to write
them in terms of u.

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:07.210
And let me not forget that I
had this 1/2 sitting out here.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.449
So how do we write
it in terms of u?

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.690
So when x is equal to 0, what
is u going to be equal to?

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.510
This boundary is
when x equals 0.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.100
Well, when x is equal to
0, u is also equal to 0.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.100
So this is from u equals zero,
this is the same boundary.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.030
When x is equal to
0, u is equal to 0,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.060
based on how we defined u.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.260
Now what about here?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.690
What is u equal to when x is
equal to the square root of pi?

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.470
Well, u is equal to
the square root of pi

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.520
squared, let me write this down.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.400
u is going to be equal to the
square root of pi squared, when

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.950
x is equal to the square root of
pi, which is just equal to pi.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.640
So this is going to be from
u equals 0, to u equals pi.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.900
I didn't have to explicitly
write this u equals here,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.525
but that makes it a
little bit clearer.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.673
Our boundaries are now
written in terms of u.

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:08.740
And so we are now
ready to evaluate

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.570
this indefinite integral.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.410
So this whole thing is going
to be equal to 1/2 times

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.190
the expression.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.760
Well, what's the
antiderivative of sine of u?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.160
Well, the derivative
of cosine of u,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.680
let me write it over here.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.900
ddx-- or maybe I should
write in terms of u--

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.370
d/du cosine u is equal to
negative sine, negative sine

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.220
of u.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.960
So the derivative of
negative cosine of u

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.790
is equal to sine of u.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.086
So the antiderivative of sine
of u is negative cosine of u.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.500
And we're going to evaluate
that from, at u equals pi.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.510
And from that we're going to
subtract it, evaluate it at u

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.130
equals 0.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.930
u equals 0.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.550
So this is going to be
equal to 1/2 times--

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.190
well, what happens when we
evaluate it at u equals pi?

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.410
Negative cosine of pi.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.579
Cosine of pi, if we
just-- and I always

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.040
have to redraw my unit circles
here-- so cosine of pi.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.780
We're at this point
on the unit circle.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.180
Cosine is the x-coordinate.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.460
Cosine of pi is-- let
me just write it down--

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.490
it's going to be
negative cosine of pi.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.180
And then from that, we
are going to subtract

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.350
this evaluated when u equals 0.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:46.740
So minus negative cosine of 0.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.640
Not cosine of theta.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.280
That's what it's
going to be equal to.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.180
And now we're ready
to evaluate it.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.502
Cosine of pi is -1.

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.210
But then we have this
negative out front,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.310
so this whole thing
will evaluate to 1.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.940
Cosine of 0.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.010
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.460
And then we're
subtracting a -1, which

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.190
is the exact same
thing as adding a 1.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.360
So this whole thing
also becomes a 1.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.210
And so in here we have
1 plus 1 times 1/2.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.540
So this whole thing simplifies
to-- ready for our drum

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.590
roll-- 1.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.600
And you see, when we
did u substitution

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.250
with a definite
integral, as long

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.790
as we changed our
boundaries in terms of u,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.500
we didn't have to go and
then undo the substitution.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.760
We didn't even have to go
and convert back into x.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.020
We were able to evaluate
the definite integral

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.860
in terms of u.
