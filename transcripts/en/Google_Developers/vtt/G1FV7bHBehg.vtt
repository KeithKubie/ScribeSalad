The Google Cloud platform
now has their own podcast.

happening on Google Cloud.

and their recent mobile app
has over 500,000 downloads

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.050
and a 4.4 rating

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.750
your users with

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160
If you watched last
week's show, you

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.210
know David East is always
ready to talk about Firebase.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.050
And in this
interview, David talks

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.900
to Laurence Moroney
about what he calls

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500
the holy grail of development.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.820
