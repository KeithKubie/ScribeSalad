00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.290
SASCHA PRUETER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.296
Wow.

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:12.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.790
Didn't do anything.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.010
Already got applause.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.962
It's a pretty good start.

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:19.417
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:22.610
SASCHA PRUETER: [LAUGHS] I
see a lot of familiar faces.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.890
But the stage is getting
bigger every year.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.915
So hey, my name
is Sascha Prueter.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.540
I'm on the product
team for Android TV.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.260
BENJAMIN BAXTER: I'm Benjamin
Baxter, DevRel for Android TV.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.810
SASCHA PRUETER: And thanks
for joining the Android TV

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.484
session at Google I/O. The
session is called What's New,

00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:41.150
but we're also talking
a little bit what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.590
has happened in the last year.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.230
So thanks for joining.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.700
And yeah, let's get going.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.970
So last time most of us talked
was last year at Google I/O.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.570
And the Android TV
ecosystem since then

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.440
has grown significantly.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
And we are, obviously,
really happy about that.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690
So we have now more
than 100 partners

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.140
working with us on
Android TV devices.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.700
And as you can see, we
are doubling that, so far,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.370
every year.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.870
And as you can see,
the growth comes

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.880
from a number of devices
and device categories.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.770
We have-- maybe you heard
at CES earlier this year--

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.970
a bunch of new partners in
very different smart TV price

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.760
categories launching
Android TV devices.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.450
So we are in the
very lucky position

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.670
that we can't even list all
partners on one slide anymore.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850
So if you're here,
if you're working

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.220
with us on Android TV devices
and your logo is not here,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.720
sorry.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.670
We are running out of space.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.450
But also in the
set-top box space,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.750
and specifically when it
comes to pay TV operators,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.700
we see significant growth.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.530
And we're very happy about that.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.150
So we already have, I think,
around 30 partners worldwide--

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.340
so pay TV operators, cable,
satellite, IPTV, shipping boxes

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.330
with Android TV.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.500
And we have more than 50
additional ones coming.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.030
So we are really happy.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.540
And we see good growth there.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.870
But it's not only
about hardware,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.310
it's also about software.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.090
And that's why I'm really happy
that the TV app ecosystem is

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.317
growing significantly as well.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.650
And I think this is the fifth
time I said significantly,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.400
so I will stop doing that.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.800
But all of you are
contributing to apps.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.830
Having developers here at
I/O over the last few years

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.460
actually pick up Android TV and
build cool media experiences,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.580
games or completely new
stuff we didn't think about,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.020
is really awesome.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.290
When we started
the TV Play Store,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.820
I think, in 2014, we
had 25 apps or so.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.040
Now we are approaching 4,000.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.954
And the thing, because there are
a lot of app developers here,

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.370
we wanted to
mention, because it's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.190
a little bit under the
radar, we have also

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.024
launched DCB on Android TV.

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.940
A lot of you, if you're
developing for mobile,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.760
you know direct carrier
billing already on mobile.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.520
So if someone buys an app, if
someone does an in-app purchase

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.800
or buys a cool
new car in a game,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400
you can charge it to your
mobile bill in a lot of cases,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.740
if you don't have a
credit card or you don't

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.180
want to use the credit card.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.180
And the same concept has
launched also since last Google

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.150
I/O on Android TV.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.340
And we're working with more and
more partners, pay TV operator

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.170
partners, that you can do
charges from the Play Store

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.880
or the Play ecosystem in
general to your cable,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.330
or satellite, or TV
subscription bill.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.390
But then also, one
of the things we

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.390
have started putting
more emphasis on

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.520
is the Google Assistant.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.130
You heard us briefly
talking last year

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.870
at Google I/O about this.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.660
And since then, the
ecosystem and the services

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.990
that the Google Assistant
brings to Android TV have--

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.440
not only to Android TV,
but to devices in general--

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.579
has grown.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.390
So we see a lot of use
of the Assistant on TV.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.700
We think it's a
great additional tool

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.310
to make use and consumption
of media services and apps

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.430
a lot easier on TV by just
interacting with voice--

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.960
discovering content by
simply talking to your TV,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.050
having a very natural interface,
not having to remember,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.540
what was that
search phrase again?

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.890
Just natural.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.750
And it's easy, and it works.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.220
But it's not only
about finding content,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.400
it's also about looking
up answers to questions

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.780
you might be interested in.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.210
It might be who that actor is.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.080
Or it's also control of
other devices in your house.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.110
The Assistant on Android
TV gives you all of that.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.660
And so because we think
it is so important,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.890
we are this year putting
a lot of priority

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.860
on getting the Assistant
into more countries.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.360
We want to make
sure we do it right,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.670
so we don't want
to rush anything.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.370
But since we have launched
in the US in late 2017,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.000
we are [? bringing ?]
this year, as you can see,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.980
a lot more countries
into the Assistant

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.360
ecosystem on Android TV.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.624
But even if you are in a country
or a language that is not yet

00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:40.790
Assistant enabled and you
have to wait a little bit,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.980
we refresh our voice
search experience

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.184
even in those countries.

00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:49.600
So I mentioned
earlier that we are

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.620
really happy about all the
apps and more and more apps

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.240
in the Play Store.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.250
And we, last year
here at Google I/O,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.650
gave you a little bit of a sneak
peek of the new Android TV home

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.020
experience, and the
system UI, and how

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.280
apps can integrate with that.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.710
Back then, it was a sneak peek.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.090
It was a preview.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.680
It has launched
with Android Oreo.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.610
And we now have a lot of
partners starting to roll this

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.249
out to Android TV devices.

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:18.790
So we thought it's
a good opportunity

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.870
to go into more detail
how your apps can actually

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.510
take advantage of this
content first experience

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.940
that we are trying to
achieve with Android TV.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.040
And Ben is going to
talk a little bit

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.540
about what it actually means
to have a content first app.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.410
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Thanks, Sascha.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.300
So we really wanted to
redefine this experience,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.850
wanted to be very content
first, content-driven.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.860
If you're familiar with
the previous screen,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.590
we have one row for
recommendations, a double row

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.570
for apps, double row for games.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.730
We've changed that, as
you can clearly see.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.340
So apps are still important.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.050
We have one row for apps.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.060
It's just your favorite apps.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.570
Your users can customize and
add your app to this row.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.330
It's up to the
user's discretion.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.300
That recommendation row
from Android N and below,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.310
we've broken it up into several
different responsibilities.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.719
So we have a Play Next row
where you can add content.

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.260
And we'll talk more
about this later,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.700
but you can add content to
be picked back and engaged

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.220
with the user later.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.870
The next thing we did
was we broke out--

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.100
and each app can have
their own channel.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.740
They can have their own
surface on the home screen.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.320
We're trying to really push
this content first design.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.680
And every app can
contribute to it.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.090
As Sascha mentioned
earlier with the Assistant,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.940
the Assistant is also
on the home screen.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.430
It's not specific to
Android O or Android P.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.220
It's actually supported
from Android M and above.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.650
So this is here to enhance
search and keep pushing

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.790
that content first design.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.970
OK.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.240
I keep saying content first.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.439
It's like my favorite
phrase all of a sudden.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.230
But let's look at some
really good examples

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.690
before we dive into the
technical details about what

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.700
builds a content first design.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.560
So here, we have
Google Play Movies.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.030
And this is from
the home screen.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.540
And you can see everything
about their details.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.474
It's as if the
movie detail screen

00:08:08.474 --> 00:08:10.890
is right there on the home
screen to help build and engage

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.290
an experience.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.760
This is great for users.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.400
They don't have to go into
the app and hop back out.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.150
They can make decisions right
there from the home screen.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.570
If we take it a step further,
we have video previews.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.790
So if you have a
movie, a trailer

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.700
makes a great video preview.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.810
If you're an audio
app, 10-second clip

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.610
is a great audio preview.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.650
We've found that
having previews is

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.287
very engaging for users
and drives engagement

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:36.870
into your app.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.140
I said earlier about
the Play Next row.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.750
This is a great
place for you to add

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.730
content to bring users back in.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.650
If you're watching
a really long movie,

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.470
you add a little
bit extra metadata,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.370
we'll make a beautiful progress
indicator to add more context.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.190
And the users are able
to hop back into the app.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.669
And I said channels.

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:01.210
You're not just limited to one
little row in the home screen,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.710
you can have as many
channels as you want.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.790
If we look here, we have
channels like Featured,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.080
Top Free.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.350
These are great channels that
you know are going to be fresh.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.740
These have indications of being
updated daily, even hourly.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.550
OK.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.680
So now that we have a
nice context about what's

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.200
on the home screen, let's
dive into how you guys can

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.520
build this experience.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.900
So what is a channel?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.170
A channel is just
a logo and a name.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.980
That's all it is.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.882
It's a container for programs.

00:09:34.882 --> 00:09:36.340
This is going to
be where you theme

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.449
your content and customize
everything deeper

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:40.115
in the programs.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.750
To build a channel, we
have a support library.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.340
It just uses the
builder pattern.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.100
Super easy, super
convenient for you.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.070
Everything on the home
screen should be clickable.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.160
So if you click on a logo, it
should open back into your app.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.230
So just set the App
Link URI, and this

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.670
will let you open up your
app from the home screen.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.860
The next thing that's important
is the internal provider ID.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.610
This is an ID for your app to
tell the home screen, hey, keep

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.570
track of this.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.950
I know what this ID is.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.110
And when I go to query
my channel later,

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.990
I can synchronize my channel
with what the home screen knows

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.630
about my app.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.365
And that's it.

00:10:20.365 --> 00:10:23.200
It uses a content provider.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.150
And we have convenient methods.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.630
For those of you that know
the joys of content providers,

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.880
you know that there can
be boilerplate code.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.330
We've abstracted all of that
into the support library.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.360
And we make it really easy for
you to build a content provider

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.880
API.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.630
Those also familiar
with content providers

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.570
know that URIs are kind
of tedious and cumbersome

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.670
to manage.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.790
The support library manages
all of that for you.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.710
It's just a simple
insert statement,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.960
and you get back a channel ID.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.400
Like I said earlier with
internal provider ID,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.670
you can use the channel ID
and the internal provider

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.500
ID to make sure,
when you synchronize

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.120
and update your
channels later, you'll

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.260
have all the keys you need.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.530
OK, channels, like I said,
they're just a shell of a row.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.240
The programs are
what really matter.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.990
So let's look at an
example of a program.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.510
In this program, we have a
bunch of stuff happening.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.460
We have a thumbnail image.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.950
We have a title, a description.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.830
And anything else you
know about this program

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.010
can be added to the home screen.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.420
The more metadata you add,
the richer the experience,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.280
the better the user engagement.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.340
So anything that's
in your Details page,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.340
it's perfectly natural
to put on a home screen.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.520
Again, builder pattern.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.490
This time, you want to set
the channel ID on your program

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.790
so the home screen knows where
to put it on the home screen.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.970
And if your program has more
than one channel it can be in,

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.700
make sure to add a
unique identifier.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.346
The home screen will look at
this identifier and say, hey,

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.470
we already know about this
program on this channel.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.090
And it's also on this channel.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.130
We can have deduping
logic so that the user

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.900
doesn't see duplicates and adds
a cleaner, smoother experience.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.430
You also want to set the type.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.660
In this example, we
set the type to MOVIE.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.570
But the type will drive
the metadata that's

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.390
shown on the home screen.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.470
And I showed you with Red
Bull earlier, video previews.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.630
It's as simple as
just adding a URI.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.710
So you just say, hey,
my video preview's at

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.540
https//www.myvideo.com.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.460
And the home screen will
play the video for you.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.520
It uses ExoPlayer
under the covers.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.970
So all of the supported video
formats from ExoPlayer are

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.860
supported for you
out-of-the-box.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.490
If you have DRM or you have
a bit more complex use case,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.100
we do support a
solution where you can

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.069
draw your video on a surface.

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:45.610
Come see us in Office
Hours tomorrow,

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.235
and we can go in more
depth about that.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.060
This looks very
similar to channels.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.850
You know, you convert
them to content values.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.950
And then from your content
values, you'll need the URI.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.370
The URI is dynamic,
since you're trying

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.960
to insert a program
into a specific channel,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.130
so use the support library.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.860
After you insert, you'll
get back a program ID.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.330
Now your program
is in the channel,

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.090
and you have a program ID,
and you have a channel ID.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.940
You have all the tools you need
for synchronizing, updating,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.920
and deleting later, when you
go to update your content.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.920
OK, I told you how
to make the channel.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.590
Just use the builder pattern,
add it to the content provider.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.840
But when do you make it?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.120
When is very important.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.070
We put a lot of time
trying to figure out

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.690
how to get you started.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.630
And so we ended up
with a new intent.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.032
So there's INITIALIZE_PROGRAMS
that will get triggered.

00:13:41.032 --> 00:13:42.490
And this can happen
before your app

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.940
starts, which isn't a bad idea.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.180
Your app just gets downloaded
onto a TV, or it gets updated.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.700
And all of a sudden, you have
content on the home screen.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.710
Great entry way for users
to come into your app.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.062
So just listen for this
INITIALIZE_PROGRAMS,

00:13:57.062 --> 00:13:59.270
and just set up your channels
and start your process.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.140
OK, the last thing we talked
about was the Google Assistant.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.010
I think the Google Assistant is
a pretty fantastic experience.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.250
It pushes that content
first approach even further.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.930
Things you can do to
integrate the Google Assistant

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:21.350
is to implement search,
support deep links,

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.330
and handle playback controls.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.290
So let's look further.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.160
When you perform a search
with the Google Assistant,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.360
the Google Assistant keeps
this content first design--

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.740
search for my favorite
movie, "Big Buck Bunny."

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.870
Hope it's your favorite too.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.260
And you'll see a bunch of
information-- the thumbnail,

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.080
the description, the title.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.670
And if your app
matches, you know,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.810
if it matches on the title,
duration, year, at the minimum,

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.120
with the metadata
returned, it will show up

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.940
in the list of apps
that it's available on.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.080
How do you match this?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.360
What happens under the covers?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.490
We use more content providers.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.470
This time, your app is providing
data to the Google Assistant.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.960
The Google Assistant will
just pass a URI for you

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.760
to perform your search on.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.220
In this content provider, you
can do whatever you want--

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.710
local database
calls, network calls.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.850
Whatever you need to do
to perform your search,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.366
you can do it.

00:15:18.366 --> 00:15:21.070
This URI contains
the raw search string

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.010
from the Google Assistant,
but it will be sanitized.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.980
So if you say something
like, play "Big Buck Bunny,"

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.810
it's going to send
you "Big Buck Bunny"

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.060
and realize that
Play is a command.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.551
So just be cognizant
that the URI you get

00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:35.800
is going to be the key for
what you should search for.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.280
OK, controlling
playback-- if you guys

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.310
are familiar with Media Session,
you don't have to do anything.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.860
Your app already supports it.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.550
But we'll just
take a closer look.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.580
If you want to support
the Google Assistant

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.120
and do different commands while
watching shows, for example,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.510
hey, Google, pause the
movie, in your app,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.400
you just implement
Media Session,

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.261
supply a callback with this
function onPause or onPlay.

00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:08.010
And the Google Assistant
will trigger that

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.590
through Media Session.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.530
onPause, onPlay-- yeah, you can
just hit the Pause/Play button

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.190
on the remote.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.640
Maybe not the most useful
feature, but it's there.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.860
And it's actually a
really cool experience.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.150
My favorite one is onSeekTo.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.422
You just say, hey, Google,
fast forward five minutes.

00:16:26.422 --> 00:16:28.380
And the Google Assistant
actually does the math

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.470
and says, hey, your Media
Session has a state.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.020
I know the current
position in that state.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.910
You said, fast
forward five minutes.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:40.080
That's 300 seconds, so I'm
going to send the new position

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.197
to your app.

00:16:41.197 --> 00:16:42.780
If you're familiar
with Media Session,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.882
you know that there's
onRewind and onFastForward.

00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.590
You should still
implement those methods.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.347
But the Google
Assistant ignores those

00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:51.180
since it already does
the math to figure out

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.680
where to send the user to.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.350
This next one is more
useful for audio apps

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.100
more so than video apps.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.115
But if you say, hey,
Google, play the next song,

00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:04.310
or OK Google, go back and
play the previous song,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.680
all you have to do is just
implement onSkipToNext

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.313
and onSkipToPrevious.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.609
So to recap, what are some of
the best practices on the home

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.579
screen?

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.619
You should listen for
INITIALIZE_PROGRAMS.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.470
This is the gateway for
creating your programs

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.670
and building that experience
on the home screen.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.310
When it comes to metadata,
you cannot have enough.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.010
The more metadata
you add, the richer

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.560
the experience, the better
engagement from users.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.340
Keeping on that theme of
engagement, add previews.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.540
It's going to really
drive engagement and build

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.875
a nice experience for users.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.190
Keeping content fresh--
if you have stale content,

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.750
you might lose trust with users.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.741
If you have a channel
on the home screen

00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:55.740
and you haven't updated
it in a year-- you know,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.450
once the user watches
all those programs,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.630
they don't have too much
of a reason to go back in.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.910
So you want to keep
that content fresh.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.690
And that depends on your app.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.050
If you're an app like
YouTube or Haystack

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.270
and you have user
curated content,

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.790
maybe update every
couple of hours.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.950
If you're an app like
Google Play movies

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.750
where the content's
already controlled,

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.890
maybe update once a day
or twice a week or so.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.970
The goal is to keep the content
fresh so users have something

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.552
to engage with everyday.

00:18:27.552 --> 00:18:29.010
And when it comes
to the assistant,

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.874
the Media Session
is your friend.

00:18:30.874 --> 00:18:32.790
Anything you want to do
with Google Assistant,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.570
Media Session is the key.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.690
The good news is, all of
this stuff, you can do today.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.356
It's live on Android
O. And I'm going

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:45.480
to turn it back over to
Sascha to talk about things

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.140
you guys can do in the future.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.730
Thank you very much.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:49.652 --> 00:18:50.610
SASCHA PRUETER: Thanks.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.130
Thanks, Ben.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.304
It's interesting to see
also the different reactions

00:18:57.304 --> 00:18:59.720
in the audience, like some
people taking notes, and taking

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.030
photos, and discussing
the code slides,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.500
and other people like, dude,
just launch some devices.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.720
So we'll talk a little
bit more about what's new.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.000
You heard this morning already
from Dave Burke and some others

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.140
what's the new stuff on
Android P. And of course,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.650
Android TV will also get some
new additions in Android P.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.730
So I will only highlight a
few areas we're investing in.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.070
One is definitely performance.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.920
We have done a lot
of work in Android P

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.020
to actually make Android TV
perform better, faster, even

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.760
on entry level hardware.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.690
So even on some of the very
affordable smart TVs you might

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.850
have seen or set-top
boxes, we want

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.820
to make sure everything's
zippy, its fast.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.690
And we have invested a
lot in that in Android P.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.930
And as a developer, some
things to take a look at

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.980
is think about your app
and your app behavior.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.860
Is there maybe something, like
some animation, some feature,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.120
you might want to disable or
tweak on low memory devices?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.770
We see that's one of the most
common problems for some apps

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.870
on entry level hardware.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:21.290
So take a look at
the isLowRamDevice

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.050
and tune your app
behavior to that.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.019
Play around a
little bit with it.

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:27.560
Maybe it's some
tweaks to animations.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.890
Or maybe on certain
devices, disable

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.520
animations or take a
look at certain features.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:41.540
Also, use the Memory Profiler
to really check your app profile

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.600
and see where it might
run into some bottlenecks,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.020
because we see that still
being some of the most

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:53.060
common behaviors that an app
suddenly has a drop in FPS.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.560
And also, then,
use Android Vitals

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.570
to monitor the performance
of your application.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.500
But again, you should see
Android P on Android TV devices

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.000
perform much
faster, much better.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.630
And we will see more devices
because of the reduced hardware

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.690
envelope.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:14.390
But we also obviously wanted
to update some things for users

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:18.320
and make it even easier to get
to a fully set up Android TV

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.550
experience.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.010
I mean, let's be honest.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:27.350
Not everyone enjoys necessarily
setting up a new device.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.200
And we wanted to make
the whole experience

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.070
from un-boxing the device to
have everything readily set up

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.110
be a lot easier, faster.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.250
And you don't have to
deal a lot with it.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.430
So in Android P, the
whole set up process

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.490
is a lot more streamlined.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.290
I think we reduced
the overall time

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.740
it takes you to go through
there by almost a third.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.670
And we also have some
additional cues in there

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.160
where the phone
integration is better.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.930
If you have an
Android phone, you

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.090
will get setup
notifications so you

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.180
can transfer account details.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.560
For example, your
Google account,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.290
you can easily transfer
that to the TV.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.920
Also, we have improved
the browser sign-in

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.430
for non-Android devices.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:17.120
So iOS devices or maybe a
laptop, we improved that a lot.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.870
It's a lot faster.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:19.950
It's a lot easier.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:25.220
And so we should get you
through setup a lot easier.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.160
But that's only setting up
the device with your account

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.810
and making sure all
the settings work.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.002
What you also want on a
smart TV or an OTT box,

00:22:36.002 --> 00:22:37.460
you also want all
your apps, right?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.140
You want all the content.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.780
So as part of the
setup process, we also

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.960
have the next generation
of Play Auto Installs.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.120
And we already
recommend you apps

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.400
that you have installed on
other Android TV devices,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.030
on past Android TV devices,
or maybe on your phone,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.000
if a corresponding
TV app exists.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.805
So we automatically
suggest that to you

00:22:58.805 --> 00:23:00.500
as part of the setup flow.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.900
And you can select there,
yes, I want all these apps.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.800
Or maybe say, oh, I
want only a few of them.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.010
Just a few clicks,
check boxes, you say go,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.620
and everything is being
downloaded and installed

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.460
automatically.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.290
No more manual
search in the Play

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.160
Store after you have
set up a new device.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.290
But downloading and
installing an app

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.690
is only one piece that
we wanted to optimize.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.850
What's also not a great
experience is going into an app

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.670
and then discovering that you
have to sign in with a username

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.490
and password and having
to awkwardly enter

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.920
that with your remote control.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.050
And so that's why we're
introducing also Autofill

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.990
with Google on Android TV.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.010
So if you have ever
entered your credentials

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.560
on one of these apps on
another Android device,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.070
we're automatically
suggesting those to you.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.680
Just say, yes, and all the login
credentials are being added.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.890
You're logging in automatically,
without entering any usernames

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.912
or passwords.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:03.550
So that's setup.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:08.080
But also, one of the areas
where we saw a lot of users

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.560
spend a lot of time in searching
for stuff and, obviously,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.130
not really enjoying
it, is settings, right?

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.760
Sometimes, you need
to tweak stuff,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.160
or you have skipped a certain
setup step when setting up

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.500
your new device, or you want
to change your audio settings,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.280
or add a different account,
or something like this.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.970
And we have revamped
settings on Android TV

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.660
to be a lot more streamlined,
a lot less cluttered.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.720
And we will automatically
suggest to you settings

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.410
we think you are looking for.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:47.800
And for example, when you
skipped account log-in,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.750
we, as you see in
the animation here,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.920
will already highlight that.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.620
Or when we saw you tweak
around with some apps,

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.620
and something wasn't right,
and you go into Settings,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.360
we will maybe highlight
the app setting for you.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.360
We want to make it as
easy to quickly get

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.880
in, get the stuff tweaked
you need, and get out again.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:14.055
So there was a lot about Android
P. You can download the Android

00:25:14.055 --> 00:25:15.850
P preview SDK.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:21.256
And you can play around
also with the TV emulator

00:25:21.256 --> 00:25:21.880
and try it out.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.629
There are some other
neat things in there,

00:25:23.629 --> 00:25:25.390
for example, external
camera support.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.210
So you could start
writing camera apps for TV

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.065
if you want to.

00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:32.000
So you can start
playing around with it.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.200
We're also going to release
a lot more documentation

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.410
around the performance aspects
of TV apps in the near future,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.080
but we wanted to talk
about two more things.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.370
I mean, we talked a lot
about software so far,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.140
but we also thought about what
are cool hardware experience,

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.650
what are cool devices
that could expand

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.172
the experience in
the living room?

00:25:53.172 --> 00:25:54.880
And one of the questions
we ask ourselves

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.520
is, how would a really
cool living room

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.400
experience with a device
being the center, the hub

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.360
of the living room with
Assistant integrated, very

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.840
easy to use, controlling
all my other devices,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.400
and bring me the best Android TV
experience onto my TV screen--

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.400
how would something
like that look like?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.330
And the outcome of
that, the answer to that

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.354
was something like this.

00:26:22.354 --> 00:26:23.695

- Here is some information
about "Star Trek, Discovery."

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.660
- Discovery.

00:27:20.179 --> 00:27:20.970
- I meant the show.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.120
- I know.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.250
- Hold up.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.270
Hey, Google.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:30.098
Dim the lights, turn off the TV,
and play some music on Pandora.

00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:31.592
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.580
- Ooh.

00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.062
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:39.062 --> 00:27:40.556
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:46.034 --> 00:27:48.440
SASCHA PRUETER: So as you
might have seen already,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.200
starting yesterday on
some media outlets,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.750
we announced, together
with our partner JBL,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.590
the JBL Link Bar,
powered by Android TV.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.290
It's an awesome sound bar.

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.290
It has Google
Assistant integrated.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.280
And because we put farfield
microphones into the device,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.760
you don't even need to
pick up the remote control.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.180
You just sit on the sofa,
start talking to the device,

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.120
and can control the
whole experience.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.730
It has really awesome sound.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.390
There will be an
optional subwoofer

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.410
that you can order
with it as well.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.430
And what I think a
really cool feature

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.670
is are the three HDMI-ins.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.880
And you might think,
well, why is that so cool?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.140
You really can control your
whole home entertainment

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.100
experience with this.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.260
Because a lot of you
might have actually--

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.630
well, you might have a
Playstation or an Xbox, right?

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.850
Or you might still have
that Blu-ray player,

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.010
or whatever other, or
maybe that cable set-top

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.290
box you still really like.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.010
So you can connect all these
devices to the JBL Link Bar,

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.720
and then use the
Assistant to control--

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.500
for example, you want to
switch to the Playstation,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.570
and it just magically happens.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.296
And also, if-- let's
say you're playing

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:06.920
a game on the
Playstation, and then you

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.600
have a question
for the Assistant.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.860
You just ask the Assistant,
and the Assistant can answer,

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.900
can show you the answer cards
over your current HDMI input.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.180
So it's not just a
pass-through HDMI.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.806
These are active inputs.

00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.180
And it really
shows you the power

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.345
of the Assistant and Android
TV as a living room platform.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:34.220
And the other cool
thing here is that we're

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.750
working to get this into a
speaker-only mode as well.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.280
Because sometimes, you don't
need the TV screen, right?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.100
To listen to audio,
to listen to music,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.220
to maybe just ask
something, really,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.850
turning this down into a
very low key smart speaker

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.900
is also cool.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.025
So this device can do
all of those things.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:58.400
And maybe sometimes
you just want

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.420
to send some music via Bluetooth
or a cast audio to the device.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.590
Works as well.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.770
It's your one-stop shop
for the living room.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.760
You can control everything.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.130
It's super easy.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.180
It will also come
with a remote control.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.410
But if you prefer to
just use it with voice,

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.410
well, it is really easy.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.700
You should check it out.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.980
We have it in our Android TV
sandbox here in sandbox C.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:29.990
And ask some of the folks from
the team to give you a demo.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.830
It's really cool.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.360
It sounds good.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:38.080
And it will launch in fall 2018.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.070
So I said two more
things, right?

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.020
So one other thing.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.690
We talked a lot about
Android P earlier.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.100
And as a developer, you want to
follow all the things Ben just

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.540
told you.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.360
And you might ask,
yeah, you told me

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.350
I can download the Android
P SDK, preview SDK, and work

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.540
with the emulator,
but I really would

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.260
like to have actual
hardware for this.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.230
So I don't know who
of you was around

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:12.510
at Google I/O 2014 at Moscone
Center in-- oh, lots of hands.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.140
OK.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:19.020
Some of you were already
in Moscone in 2014.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.140
And they might remember we
launched a device back then

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.646
to introduce Android TV.

00:31:23.646 --> 00:31:24.645
It was called the ADT-1.

00:31:24.645 --> 00:31:26.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.750
So we thought-- well, you
can applaud if you want--

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:37.210
but we thought it's time for
another developer device.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.750
So we are introducing ADT-2.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.971
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.230
So you might want to write
down that sign-up form link,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.900
because you're the first people
to actually see this and be

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.390
able to sign up for this.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.770
All the smartphones.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.354
It's actually a pretty good test
for Google Lens, the actual--

00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:58.436
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.436 --> 00:31:59.620
SASCHA PRUETER: Anyway--

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.370
BENJAMIN BAXTER: If
they go to the sandbox

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.340
later and check out the sound
bar and you [INAUDIBLE],,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.627
you'll also get an email
with this link as well.

00:32:06.627 --> 00:32:07.460
SASCHA PRUETER: Yep.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.420
Good point.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.620
So this is a neat
little HDMI dongle.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.180
It will come with
a BTLE-enabled--

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.580
sorry, a voice-enabled
remote control.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.160
So you can try out all the
Assistant integration tips

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.930
that Ben just talked about.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.020
It will run an Android P
developer preview release.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.110
We will send updates
to the device.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.500
By the way, we're also sending
updates to the sound bar.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.560
Google, the Android TV Team
will send the system updates

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.230
and new Android versions
right through the device.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.214
And so you can use this device
to try out all the cool things.

00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:47.630
It's a limited edition device,
so you know about it first.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.830
Sign up.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:54.900
We will actually start to send
this out later this summer.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.974
And it's a neat little device.

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.640
We are actually really
excited about it.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.070
And sign up for it.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.060
And build cool apps.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.272
That's kind of it, already.

00:33:08.272 --> 00:33:09.230
I said two more things.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.310
It was two more things.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.570
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Right.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.010
SASCHA PRUETER: We have--

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:14.450
if you're working
on apps, we have

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.190
some more interesting
events that you

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.120
might be interested in.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.870
Ben, I don't know if
you want to mention--

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:20.786
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Yeah.

00:33:20.786 --> 00:33:22.160
Come visit us in Office Hours.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.800
We have back-to-back app
reviews in Office Hours.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.710
We're going to be, down
the road a little bit,

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.480
where the Office Hours tent is.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.387
If you have questions,
come bring them.

00:33:31.387 --> 00:33:33.470
If you're bored and you
still want to do TV stuff,

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.280
we have two new code labs
in the Code Lab section.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.380
One focuses on just
the Play Next row,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.010
and the other one focuses on
an overview of the entire home

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.510
screen.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:47.310
We look forward to seeing you,
and bring your questions there.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.170
SASCHA PRUETER: Yep.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:54.620
And talking about questions,
well, obviously, we

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.580
want feedback from you.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:34:00.530
But also, if you
have questions--

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.000
you see those microphones?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.870
We're not using them
because of timing.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.670
We will get shuffled
out here very soon.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.969
But Ben and I will be over right
after this talk in the Android

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.110
TV sandbox.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.020
Come over, talk to
us, ask us questions.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:20.520
And I will most likely point to
Ben to answer those questions.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.050
Thank you, very much.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.239
Build cool TV apps.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.335
And I hope we'll
see you next year.

00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:26.460
BENJAMIN BAXTER: Thank you.
