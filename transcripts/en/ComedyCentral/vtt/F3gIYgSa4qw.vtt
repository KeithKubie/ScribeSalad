<i> ["Hail to the Chief" playing]</i>

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.275 align:start position:0%
- Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.544 align:start position:0%
You remember my anger
translator, Luther.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.279 align:start size:41% position:59%
- Why, hello.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.082 align:start position:0%
- Now, I've told Luther
that he can join me

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.418 align:start position:0%
for this last address,
but that his being

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.586 align:start position:0%
on his very best behavior
is crucial

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.622 align:start position:0%
to healing the divide
in this country.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.424 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Keep it chill, Luther.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.360 align:end position:100%
Go against
every natural instinct

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.029 align:end position:100%
in your body.
[inhales deeply]

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.564 align:start position:0%
- Since we last spoke,

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start position:0%
the country has voted
for a new president.

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.672
- Trump!

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
- Here we go.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.810 align:end position:100%
- Oh, man. Come on.
Come on. Really?

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.812 align:start size:66% position:34%
Talk about the Trump!

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start size:78% position:22%
How did this happen, man?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.782 align:start size:47% position:53%
Get the fuck...

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.451 align:end position:100%
Y'all gonna vote for the dude
that's gonna

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.053 align:start size:75% position:25%
make America hate again?

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.354 align:start size:66% position:34%
Don't you understand?

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.557 align:end position:100%
This is how
"The Hunger Games" starts!

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.459 align:start position:0%
- Now, uh, it's true.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.360
We all have to accept--
- Damn!

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:04.864 align:start position:0%
- That...gonna have someone else
calling the shots.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.567 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Vladimir Putin, y'all!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.036 align:end position:100%
We got a naked Russki
on horseback

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start size:78% position:22%
gon' be runnin' the show.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.539
<i>Spasibo,</i> Russian motherfuckers.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.542 align:start position:0%
- It was a close election, but
the people have spoken.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.678 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, they voted for
Hillary Clinton,

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.380 align:end position:100%
but then this outdated Electoral
College mumbo jumbo

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.783
voodoo bullshit--I can't even
make sense of this--really?

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.252
- Now, it's more imperative
than ever...

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.121
<i> - Come on!</i>
 - That we move on

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.423
as a country united.
- United in the fact that

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.191 align:end position:100%
we can't fucking
stand each other.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:34.760
- Even as the country
adopts new policies,

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:38.464
uh, on trade, immigration...

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.900 align:end position:100%
- New policy:
the only good immigrant

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.535 size:84% position:58%
is a smokin' hot white one.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:46.139
- Who plagiarizes speeches.
- Ooh.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start size:56% position:44%
I said, "Bitch..."

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.511
- Now, I have greatly enjoyed

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.812 size:81% position:41%
my time as your president.

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.447 align:end position:100%
- Except when, um,
you know, um,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.882 align:end position:100%
let me think about,
let me think--

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.517 align:end position:100%
when the Republicans wouldn't
let me do shit,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.919 align:end position:100%
and then that one dude said
I wasn't born here,

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:02.021 align:end position:100%
and then y'all elected him,
so you know what?

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:03.489
Didn't love that part so much.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:04.824
So pretty much the beginning,

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.627 align:end position:100%
middle, and the end sucked!
It sucked, man.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.196 align:start position:0%
- I have met with
President-elect Trump

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.299 align:start position:0%
and have pledged my support
in his transition.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:17.403 align:end position:100%
- He doesn't even want
the job, y'all.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.805 align:end position:100%
I saw it in his eyes.
The dude was shook.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:22.141 align:start size:69% position:31%
The only reason he ran
is because his factory

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:24.911
in China made too many red hats.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.213 align:start size:50% position:50%
It's the only...

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.416 align:start size:22% position:78%
reason!

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.151
- I assure you

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:35.221
that if he succeeds,
we all succeed.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:36.989 align:end position:100%
- Unless he succeeds with
all the shit

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.391 size:88% position:56%
he promised to succeed with.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.760 size:84% position:58%
In that case, we're fucked!

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.863 align:start position:0%
- And now,
a time-cherished tradition

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.765
is that the outgoing president--
- Don't say "Outgoing!"

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.567 align:end position:100%
Don't say "Outgoing!"
♪ La, la, la, la ♪

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.905
- Leaves the incoming president

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.308 align:start position:0%
a little note in the desk
of the Oval Office.

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.577 align:start position:0%
Of course, it's completely
confidential--

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.613
- "Go fuck yourself."
- Until now.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.148 align:start size:16% position:84%
- Oh.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.951 align:start size:44% position:56%
That's my bad.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.886
- To all of you out there

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.589
who are afraid that your
way of life is under attack,

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.858 align:start position:0%
remember that progress isn't
always a straight line.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.794 size:84% position:58%
- No, 'cause sometimes it's
a line that goes like this.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.329 align:start size:63% position:38%
It goes: [gibberish]

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.130 align:end position:100%
and then just goes
straight down

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.632 align:start size:72% position:28%

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:23.803 size:75% position:38%

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.405 align:end position:100%

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:37.183

It's been real.
It's been good.

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.755 size:88% position:44%
But it ain't been real good.
