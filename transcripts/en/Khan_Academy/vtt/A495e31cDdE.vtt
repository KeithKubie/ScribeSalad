00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.216
- [Voiceover] So, just as a bit of review.

00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:04.235
If we take the members
of a certain species

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:06.487
that share the same area,

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.654
we call that a population.

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:11.189
Population.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.558
All of the organisms in
this particular population

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:15.404
will be members of the same species.

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:16.669
There could be other
members of that species

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.132
that aren't in that same area,

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:21.406
and they wouldn't be a member
of this particular population.

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.997
And a certain area won't have just one,

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.377
or it doesn't tend to have
just one species in it.

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:27.629
So, we could call this population one.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.545
You might have other populations there

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:30.927
of a different species.

00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:33.562
So, this is another
species right over here.

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.783
All of them combined in the same area,

00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:38.833
we could call this population,

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.616
population two.

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:41.677
And if you take...

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.988
And we could, obviously have
many more populations there.

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.555
And if you take all of the populations

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.680
in a given area,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.781
there's flexibility on
how you define that area

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.255
or define that region,

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:52.145
you take those together,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.846
so you're really taking
all of the living things

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:58.513
in a certain area, we
call that a community.

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:02.358
A community of populations.

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:05.040
Now, the community only
consists of living things,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.840
the biotic factors.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.314
So, let me write that down.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:12.110
Biotic referring to the living
things in a certain area.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.305
But if we want to think about
not just the living things,

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:16.883
but also the non-living
things in that region.

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:19.481
So, I'll write abiotic.

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.933
Let me do that in another color.

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.227
So, let's take the abiotic factors,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.477
or the abiotic environment.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:31.558
And, once again, we're
sharing the same region,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.379
and that is flexible on
how you define that region.

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:36.678
You put all of these things together,

00:01:36.678 --> 00:01:39.127
and then you get your ecosystem.

00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:41.101
Your ecosystem, once again,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.610
it could be a very small region,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.178
it could be a very large region,

00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:45.687
but it's made up of all living things,

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:48.613
the biotic factors, and
the non-living things,

00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:50.540
the abiotic factors.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.887
Now, what we're gonna
think about in this video

00:01:51.887 --> 00:01:54.336
is just the types of
ecosystems that you might have.

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:55.973
Think a little bit about it,

00:01:55.973 --> 00:02:00.146
and also begin to think about
how the different factors

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.639
interact with each other.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.497
How there's conservation of matter

00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:06.135
where, within an ecosystem,
matter tends to go

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:07.607
from one form to another.

00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:10.196
You also have a flow of energy.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:13.175
Energy tends to enter an ecosystem

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.710
in form of light, and that
energy gets transferred

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.591
from one organism to another,

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.356
and, sometimes, even involving
the non-living things,

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:21.523
eventually, getting turned

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:24.847
into actual heat.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:26.531
Now, in terms of the types of ecosystems.

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:28.899
I already mentioned there's
a lot of variety there.

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.117
This, right here, is a
picture of a tide pool

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.450
at Half Moon Bay, not too
far from where I live.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.364
I've actually been to the
tide pools at Half Moon Bay.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.766
And you could consider
one particular tide pool,

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.460
both the abiotic factors, the water,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.043
and the rock there,

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.686
as well as the biotic factors,

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:49.344
the starfish, the sea anemones,

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:51.782
and whatever else might be living there.

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:54.731
Those combined, that
could be an ecosystem.

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:57.158
You might say that the
entire beach is an ecosystem.

00:02:57.158 --> 00:02:59.747
You might say that the entire
region is an ecosystem.

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:02.557
Once again, it depends
on how much you want

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.948
to zoom in or how much
you want to zoom out,

00:03:04.948 --> 00:03:06.411
and you can zoom out a good bit.

00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:08.436
This rain forest, right over here,

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:10.080
this is the Amazon rain forest.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.762
You can consider the whole
rain forest an ecosystem,

00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:14.329
or maybe you just want to study,

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.966
maybe you just want to study

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.996
what's happening in this exact
region, right over there.

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:21.051
You can also consider that an ecosystem.

00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:23.129
You can consider what's
happening in the river, itself,

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.705
an ecosystem, or, maybe,
one part of that river.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.039
And, as you notice, I'm
talking about some ecosystems

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.465
that are on land, and
some that are in water,

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.937
and that is a general way,
one way of classifying them.

00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:37.886
So an ecosystem, you
could have it on land.

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:41.044
You could have it on, near, in the water.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.389
So, you could say it's aquatic.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.585
And then, if within aquatic,

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:46.012
you could have ones that...

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.892
You have salt water, or
partially salty water,

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:50.657
and these are called marine,

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:52.085
and the main marine ecosystem,

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:56.160
we're thinking about the
oceans and things like that.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.971
And then, you have freshwater ecosystems.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.096
Like if you are in the upper-Amazon,

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:02.232
that is freshwater that is flowing.

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:05.030
So we could say fresh, freshwater,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.363
non-salty water.

00:04:08.176 --> 00:04:10.208
And even though it looks
like rivers are big

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.531
and there's a lot of freshwater around us.

00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:13.459
Obviously we need freshwater to live,

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.895
most of the aquatic ecosystems are marine,

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:18.288
are not involved freshwater.

00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:21.028
Freshwater is a very small subset.

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.327
Now, this is just a few examples.

00:04:23.327 --> 00:04:25.742
Even your body, you could view your body

00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:26.926
as a whole ecosystem.

00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.109
You could view parts of
your body as an ecosystem.

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:30.583
You could look at just...

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.429
You could look at just a fraction of...

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:35.599
If this is my hand right over here,

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.213
you could take just a
little square, there,

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.198
and you could consider that an ecosystem.

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:41.404
You can think about the different bacteria

00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:43.529
that are there, other
types of microorganisms

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.340
that are there, and
how they're interacting

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.173
with the non-living things, the air.

00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:51.830
How they're interacting
with the oil on your skin,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.676
with the dead skin cells, and also,

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.649
how they're interacting
with the living skin cells,

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.577
and you, yourself.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:05:01.536
Now, since we're in
the, since we're focused

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:03.628
on how we can classify ecosystems,

00:05:03.628 --> 00:05:05.030
one thing that's often done

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.732
is classifying land ecosystems
into various categories.

00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:12.899
And, right over here, we have depicted

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.060
the major types of land ecosystems

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.143
on our planet

00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:20.274
and where you might find them.

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:22.991
And these different
types of land ecosystems,

00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.510
these are called biomes.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.613
Biomes.

00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:28.506
And as you can see from this diagram,

00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:31.060
tropical forests, you can
find it right over here.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.778
This is the Amazon rain forest.

00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:33.893
You can find it in Africa.

00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:36.064
You can find it in Southeast Asia.

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:39.405
You can find it in
Central and even Southern

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.046
or North America.

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:43.030
You have boreal forests which you'll find

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.423
in more northern latitudes.

00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:47.383
Savanna, desert, tundra,
chaparral, polar ice,

00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:49.856
temperate forest, temperate grasslands,

00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:50.797
and these are just helpful

00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:54.326
for thinking about roughly
the types of ecosystem,

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:57.948
or ecosystems we would
find in those regions.

00:05:57.948 --> 00:06:01.199
And it's typically most determined by

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.116
temperature, moisture, the climate.

00:06:05.253 --> 00:06:07.480
Actually, the climate and the terrain

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.489
and the types of minerals
that you would find there,

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:12.107
that tends to be a pretty good indicator

00:06:12.107 --> 00:06:14.992
for what it will be like,
what the life would be like.

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:16.385
But even with that said, there could

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:18.289
still be a lot of variety.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.532
For example, the Sonoran
Desert, that is right over here

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:23.792
in the southwest United States,

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.207
in the northwest Mexico.

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:29.290
This is a desert, and there's deserts

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.244
all over the rest of the planet,

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:33.556
but they won't have...

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:34.996
They might be similar in a lot of ways,

00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:37.260
but they won't have
the exact same climate,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.046
or the exact same abiotic factors,

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:42.391
or the exact same biotic factors.

00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:44.284
So, for example, right now
I'm gonna show you a picture,

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:46.792
pictures of the Sonoran
Desert and the Rock Desert

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.347
that's on the island of Boa Vista.

00:06:48.347 --> 00:06:49.484
Boa Vista is right over there.

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:50.317
You really can't see it.

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:53.073
It's a very small island
off the coast of Africa.

00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:57.125
And, as we see in these
diagrams, or in this picture,

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.990
you don't have to be an
expert to recognize that,

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.457
okay, these are both deserts.

00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:01.687
They both look dry.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:03.278
There's not a lot of water here,

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:05.611
but they are also very different.

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.841
The Sonoran Desert looks to have

00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:09.814
at least a lot more life,

00:07:09.814 --> 00:07:11.660
than the Rock Desert have here.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.785
It's appropriately named the Rock Desert

00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:15.375
because it seems, at
least to the naked eye,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.691
it looks like all you can see is rock.

00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.147
So biomes, once again, it's a very rough,

00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:23.351
high-level way to
classifying land ecosystems.

00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:27.018
But even the same biome
can be very, very...

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.271
Two things that are
categorizing in the same biome

00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:31.879
could be very different.
