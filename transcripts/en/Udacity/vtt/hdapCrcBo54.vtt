00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.340
Encryption is the most often
used cryptographic operation.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.200
It is a process of
converting data into a form

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.600
that is unintelligible to
the unintended or unauthorized party.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.890
The authorized party can
reverse this process.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.090
That is, converting the data
into the intelligible form.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.110
Record the readable data,
the plaintext and

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.590
the unintelligible data, the ciphertext.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.209
So encryption, then, is the process
of converting plaintext data into

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:41.270
ciphertext, and
decryption is the reverse operation.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.790
That is converting
ciphertext into plaintext.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.450
Notice that,
in order to perform decryption,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.988
the authorized party needs
to have the decryption key.

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:58.220
There's a one-to-one mapping between
a plaintext and a server text, so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.629
that the decryption process can always
get back the original plaintext.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.010
Encryption protects
data confidentiality,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.990
because only the authorized
party with the proper secret,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.117
we call it a key,
can decrypt and read the data.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.160
Encryption also provides
other security services.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.585
These include integrity checking,

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:26.920
that is to make sure that
there is no tampering of data.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.160
It can also assure
authenticity of message.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.780
That is it can verify
the authorship of the message.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.550
It can also provide authentication.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.260
That is, to make sure that the party

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.710
that you are communicating
with is not an imposter.
