00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.700
Now we're going to actually
install our workshop

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.220
which is the Android Studio program.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.080
I suggest you watch me so that you
can have a sense of what the process

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.950
looks like and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.180
Also keep in mind that
these are large files.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.700
You're going to want to have a strong
and stable internet connection.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.790
For students with slower and
more unreliable Internet,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.350
you might want to consider finding
a wired Internet connection.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.540
I've created the walk through for

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.020
how to download Android Studio on
two different operating systems.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.730
I have instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.006
I'll give you a moment, go ahead and
click on which one applies to you.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.679
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.990
Okay, I'm going to be installing
Android Studio on a Windows machine.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.280
Please note that this screencast
was done on April 7th, 2015.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.590
And I say that just because
sometimes the screens or

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.960
the icons that you might see
while installing Android Studio

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.040
could change depending
on what version it is.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.090
We're going to give you a text version
to go along with the screen cast, and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.340
since it's easier to change
the text version than to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.950
go through re-recording
an entire screen cast

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.390
that will be a little bit more up
to date than the screen cast will.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.600
All right so to start off go ahead and
open a web browser and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320
go to the Android Studio website.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.010
It's a link to the instructor notes,
you do not have to type this in.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.630
All right, so once you've arrived at the
site, you should see a big green button

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.190
that's pretty obvious, that says
Download Android Studio for Windows.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.070
So go ahead and click that.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.070
All right, and that's going to take
you to the license for Android Studio.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.690
You're welcome to go ahead and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.630
read that I'm going to scroll to
the bottom, sign my rights away, and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.970
then click this Download Android Studio
for Windows button.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.470
All right, we did want to download this,
so we do want to keep it.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.090
I'm going to press Keep.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.390
Okay, and if you look right here, this
is a little bit less than a gig of data.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.820
And that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of reasonable

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.710
quality, so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.960
you can judge how long this will take
based on your Internet connection.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.690
Okay, once it's finished downloading,
go ahead and double-click the file.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.500
We did in fact want to run this,
so click run.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440
Yes, we did want to allow
it to make changes.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.320
All right.
And now we're at the Android Studio

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.830
set up wizard.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.390
This is going to guide you through
a collection of screens to set up

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.760
Android Studio and pretty much always
we're going to just select the defaults.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.870
All right.
So, I'm going to hit next,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.910
I want all these boxes checked.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.230
Note that this requires 3.8 gigabytes
of space and we only download about

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.980
a gigabyte, so after this, there's
going to be even more downloading.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.595
I'm going to hit Next.

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.490
So license agreement here.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.690
You can go to read it if you'd like.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.260
I'm going to go ahead and hit, I Agree.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.790
Yes!
I agree more.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.910
Okay, I'm all right with all of
these standard install locations.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.640
Right, going to say next on the emulator
set up, we'll talk about this later.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.850
Sure, let's make a Start Menu folder and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.170
I'm going to hit install which
will bring me to the screen.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.040
Okay, so this is another loading bar
which might take a little bit of time.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.400
All right, it looks like it completed.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.740
I can go ahead and
take a look at the show details and

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.160
I'm not seeing anything
here about huge errors.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.750
So that's good.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.210
All right I'm going to go ahead and
click next.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.450
Okay, so
the install looks like it finished.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.970
I'm going to click finish.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.990
This is the little loading screen for
Android Studio when it starts up.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.550
Okay, now this is asking if I have some
settings from a previous version of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.350
Android Studio.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.940
And I'm pretty sure that you don't, so
you probably want to hit the I don't

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.950
have a previous version
of Android Studio, or

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.530
I don't want to import my settings.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.410
Go ahead and hit okay.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.970
And just go ahead of downloading
a few more components for me.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.780
Now once you see this screen you
know that you've got Android Studio

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.120
up and running.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.640
But the real test to see if
you did everything correctly

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.610
will be if you can make
your first app using it.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.160
All right so this completes
the installation video and

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.370
now you're going to do
this process on your own.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.700
All right, I'm going to download
Android studio on a Mac.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.780
Note that the screencast
was study April 6, 2015.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.040
And the reason I'm saying that is

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.030
because sometimes this
process will change.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.520
We will always provide you with text
instructions for the install process.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.730
And we will keep those
instructions up to date.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.470
So if things look a little bit
different here and there don't worry,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.000
check out the text install instructions.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.959
All right, and with that little
mini note, let's get started.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.980
Okay so the first thing you're going to
do is click the link in the instructor

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.220
note below to get to
the Android Studio homepage.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.610
Don't try typing this out, just click
the link in the instructor notes.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.190
Once you're here there's going to be
a pretty obvious button that says

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.310
Download Android Studio,
and it should say for Mac.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.560
Go ahead and click it.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.310
At this point you'll see
a license agreement.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.630
You can read it if you like and then
go ahead scroll down, click that you've

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.800
read it and then click this download
Android Studio from that button.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.430
Okay, so
it started downloading here for me and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.830
you should be able to see that this
download is a couple hundred megabytes.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.610
Once it's downloaded go ahead and
double-click it.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.970
You should see this big beautiful
screen that says Android Studio.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.000
And, as with most applications,
you're going to go ahead and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.200
click Android Studio and

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.040
drag it into your Applications folder,
that'll copy over.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.660
After you've successfully done that,
you can go ahead to double click

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.280
Android Studio which will try
to actually open Android Studio.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.590
You might get a warning about it being
downloaded from the web but we did mean

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.980
to download this and we did mean to
run it so go ahead and click open.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.848
All right,
in this little screen should appear to

00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:19.190
load up the installation process.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.785
Alright and
here we are at the walk a wizard.

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:26.330
What follows is going to be a list
of screens and licenses and

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.120
you pretty much just want
to keep the defaults.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.470
And click Next.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.310
This is a screen asking me where
my Java development kit is.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.110
Now we just installed that and

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.980
it's actually making
a guess about where it is.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.390
If it isn't guessing,
you can click the Detect button, and

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.860
if that isn't working, you can try
navigating your file system to go

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920
exactly to where you downloaded it.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.430
If you're having trouble with this step
It probably means that there were issues

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.720
with downloading the Java development
kit, you might have downloaded the wrong

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.760
file, or just something may
not be configured right.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.670
Try going through
the instructions again,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.490
or checking out
the troubleshooting documents.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.010
Everything seems to be working here, so
I'm going to go ahead and click next.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.660
Now we're not doing anything too crazy,
so

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.350
I'm going to choose
a standard installation.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.770
Here are some of the licenses
that I was talking about.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.256
Go ahead and click on the first
license and say accept.

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:19.090
That accept all the these
licenses down here.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.870
You'll have to click on
the next license set here and

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.170
also hit accept and this will let you
finish the Android Studio set up wizard.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.237
Okay, when I click finish it's actually
going to download a lot of stuff and

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:35.640
what all of this entails is downloading
a couple gigs of data, which is sort of

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.730
a huge amount of stuff to download, so
be patient this might take some time.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.710
If you see this window, go ahead and
type in your password and

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.150
the candy cane stripes here mean
that this is close to done.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.960
Awesome, and once you're done,
you should see this screen.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.535
Hopefully there's a lot of positive
language like successfully,

00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:59.680
installation pass, successfully created.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.000
If you see any errors here,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.600
it could mean that there
are errors with the installation.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.500
But things look good, so
I'm going to go ahead and click Finish.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.060
Now, once you see this screen,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.660
you know that you've got
Android Studio up and running.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.349
So, great job.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.290
But the real test is going to be seeing
if we did everything correctly enough

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.920
that we can create our
own apps using it.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.600
All right, so
now you've watched me do the steps once.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.000
I want you to go ahead and
download Android Studio yourself.
