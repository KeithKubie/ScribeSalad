[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.430
FARNOOSH BROCK: Imagine this--

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.080
what if we could do
business without selling?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.840
What if we could
have all the results

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.010
we want in our professional
careers or businesses

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.290
without ever having to sell?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.900
Hi, I'm Farnoosh Brock.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.190
And it is a privilege to be
here at Google with you today,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.250
talking about my book,
"The Serving Mindset."

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.010
We're going to
talk about how you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.810
can change your conversations
from selling to serving,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.840
to achieve anything you want.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.300
I come from an academic family.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060
I studied electrical
engineering in college.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.350
I wrote a master's thesis on
spread spectrum code division

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.470
multiple access for
wireless communications.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.220
I tell you that to
show you how far I

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.190
was from the world of selling.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.560
And I liked it that way.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.580
All my life, the way I
had been experiencing

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.230
traditional selling--

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.540
the way people had
pitched their agenda

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.780
to me-- had really
turned me off of selling.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.380
And so when I went to
the corporate world

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.300
to start my career, I wanted to
build a nice protective shell

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.210
around myself to avoid selling.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.330
And to keep my attitude and
distance around selling.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.440
And I was lucky.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.500
My technical roles
allowed me to do that.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.910
There were those
occasions when I

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.400
had to sell myself to
my management-- which

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.810
I did very poorly.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.650
But otherwise, I was
able to make a living,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.130
and still keep my
distance from selling.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.730
Until 2011, when I
decided to quit my job,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.890
and start my business.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
And that is when my nice
protective shell cracked open.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.090
I couldn't keep that
distance or attitude

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
around selling because
I was in business now.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.910
And yet, how could I go out
there and be selling when

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.540
I couldn't stand being sold to?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
That's when I felt this
was a real dilemma.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.960
And yet even then,
deep down, I felt

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.470
there was a way I
could stay in business

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.440
and maybe even thrive
in my business,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.730
and be true to my
character and my values.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.640
And like who I was by
the end of the day.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
So that curiosity led me
down a path of research,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.940
which later became the
foundation of the book,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.340
"The Serving Mindset."

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.920
In that research, I found--

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.270
much to my relief--

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.850
that I am far from
the only one having

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.460
this dilemma around selling.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.840
Smart, talented, highly
educated professionals

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.860
and entrepreneurs, like us,
struggle with this every day.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.230
Why?

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.940
Because nobody likes
to be sold to, not even

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.180
your most eager
buyer in the world.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.120
And yet, we feel
we have to sell.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.040
Because we need to
create the results

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200
that we want in our
careers and our businesses.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.240
And so from that
perspective, selling

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.990
becomes the necessary
evil in the equation.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.290
And I've seen two
paths emerge from that.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.280
One is for those of
us who feel, well,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.920
what's a little compromise
around my values?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.470
At least I'm being responsible.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.920
I am doing what I need
to do to get my job done.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.710
Even as I feel
conflicted about it,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.830
even as I apologize for
the selling I'm doing--

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.450
I do what needs to be done.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.440
There is the other
path for those of us

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.870
who feel I can't stand selling.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.620
I am not a salesperson.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.310
So then we need to build
that protective shell,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.380
and find a line of
work that allows

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.030
us to keep that distance.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.650
Because at least, at
the end of the day,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.670
you don't have to do the
nauseating work of selling.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.370
You're being true
to who you are.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.019
Now, neither of those
two paths serves us.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.399
Because in both of them,
we compromise something.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:25.260
And I found, maybe we don't
have to do the compromise.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
Do we really have to
compromise between our values

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.780
and our profits?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.170
Or our characters
and our bottom line?

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.750
I found with the
serving mindset,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.250
you don't have to do
that because I remove

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.805
selling from the equation.

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:45.180
We're not going
to talk about how

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.060
to sell more compassionately,
or more gently, or with empathy.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.990
No.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.010
We are going to remove
selling from the equation.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.050
And yet, still achieve
the results that we want.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.580
Now before I go further, let
me define selling and serving

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.160
so that we are on the same page.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.280
The way I define
serving is this--

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.140
well, no, let me
start with selling.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.120
Selling is when you have your
own highest agenda at heart.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.800
You have your
agenda, your goals,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.450
and you're going after them.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.100
When you sell, you win.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.630
When you don't sell, you lose.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.640
Serving is when you
have your prospect,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.960
your would be customer or
client's highest interest

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.820
at heart, regardless
of outcome for you.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.420
When you serve,
you can only win.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.890
When you serve, if they buy
from you right away, you win.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.980
If they don't buy from you, but
buy from you down the road--

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.440
sometimes months and
years down the road--

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.040
because of how you treated
them, you still win.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.100
Sometimes your prospect
never buys from you,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.450
but they refer you.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.710
They endorse you.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.120
They speak highly of you because
of the way you served them.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.900
So that's the way I define
selling and serving.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.920
Now, I said earlier--

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.070
we are going to remove
selling from the equation.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.650
Let's see how we can do
that, and get away with it,

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.300
so to speak.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.270
So to do that, we start
by looking at our mindset.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.200
Our mindset is our
perspective onto the world.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.450
It's our version of reality.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.870
Your mindset is a
collection of beliefs

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.030
that you have accumulated
over the course

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.220
of your life, your upbringing,
your relationships,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.350
your education.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.490
And it's your truth on
certain subject matters.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.340
Now having lived
life, you may also

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.660
know that after some
transformative experiences

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.630
you may emerge with
a shift in mindset.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.100
A shift in perspective.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.180
So your mindset
isn't set in stone.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.360
What we want to
explore together today

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.247
is that mindset around selling.

00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:07.830
Even if you've never
thought about it,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.030
you have a current
mindset around selling.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.980
What I want to explore with you
is, is that mindset accurate?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.180
Is it true?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.830
And is it helping you do your
greatest work in this world,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.500
and serve yourself and those
that you hope to impact?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.810
So we're going to do that by
exploring the three guiding

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.690
principles of the
serving mindset.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.780
The first principle says,
stop selling, start serving.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.260
In this principle,
you'll rewire your brain.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.070
And you'll remove selling
from your inner dialogue,

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.290
from your inner voice.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.820
So your inner dialogue
becomes I am not

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.890
having sales conversations.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.890
I am having serving
conversations.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.080
I am not in a sales role.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.300
I am in a serving role.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.730
I do not need a
selling strategy--

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.050
thank you very much--

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.200
I need a serving strategy.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.670
When you do this--

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.780
when you start to remove selling
from your inner dialogue,

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.630
you feel a sense
of ease and calm.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.700
I see this when I
work with my clients.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.370
They immediately
feel a sense of ease

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.380
because instinctively,
you are wired to help,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.830
to be of genuine
help and service.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.429
You feel you have to do more,
hence the pressure of selling.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.179
But instinctively,
you are wired to help.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:44.100
So when you give yourself
permission to remove the words

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.540
selling from your
inner dialogue,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.600
you feel a sense
of ease and calm.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.570
So if years down the
road, you remember nothing

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.730
else from this talk, except I
am not selling, I am serving--

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.970
every time you enter
those conversations,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.280
you will have taken
away the golden nugget.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.210
But we're going to continue.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.360
Let's look at how
we can do this.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.780
Let's make it more
practical and tangible.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.920
To do that, you need to be
willing to set aside something

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.680
that you've been carrying
with yourself for a long time.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.520
And that is your agenda.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.230
We all have an agenda.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.070
Whether your agenda is to get
promoted to that vice president

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.340
role, or to get a
yes on that contract,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.890
or to bring on board
10 more clients--

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.080
you have an agenda.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.150
Now, there's nothing
wrong with an agenda.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.770
But when your mind
is on an agenda when

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:46.000
you are in a conversation
with your prospect,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.730
it pulls you out of the present
moment with your prospect.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.870
It is impossible to be
100% present with someone

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.140
and have your mind on an agenda.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.100
Now, why do you want to
be 100% present with them?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:09.970
Because that is the only way we
can form a genuine connection.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.560
It's the only way you can truly
listen to what's being said,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.540
and to hear someone.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.960
And then to respond accordingly.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.350
You cannot do that when
your mind is on an agenda

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.040
of your own.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.290
But when you do that--

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.760
when you set aside your agenda--

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.000
you can create deep trust
in that slowing down and in

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.460
that listening place.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.490
And so as you do
that, you are starting

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.240
to go into the serving mindset.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.500
Let's make this practical.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.740
I'll share with you an
example from one of my clients

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.970
who learned how to do this.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.610
So my client, Patricia, runs a
successful IT consulting firm.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.940
And she's very good
at what she does.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.820
Now, as an introvert
and a techie,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.130
she was feeling awkward,
tense, and uncomfortable

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.300
when she would step into her
prospecting conversations.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.220
And so she came to me
because she hated selling.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.830
So we started to work together.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.850
And we gave her some tools and
techniques to overcome this.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.590
Now as she learned how
to set aside her agenda--

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.800
which she hated anyway
because she hated selling,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.080
but she felt she
had to have it--

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.650
she was suddenly more
comfortable in her own skin.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.190
And as a result, she
was more confident.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.460
And then, she was stepping
into those conversations

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.080
from that place.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.320
And finally, she was
able to really hear

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.330
what her prospects were saying.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.240
And really, really
listen and get

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.080
to the real challenges,
the real problems.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.080
Not just the surface level ones.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.220
As she did this over
time, something remarkable

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.260
started to happen.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.940
Her prospects were now
leaning into Patricia

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.580
to ask her how they
could work with her.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.570
How they could hire her
in a business capacity.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.230
So she learned how to go
from selling to serving

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.370
by setting aside her agenda.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.020
And she was creating real
business opportunities

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.270
as a result.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.120
Now when you learn
to do that, you

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.500
find at the heart of the
serving mindset two things--

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.660
deep caring and deep
curiosity for your prospect,

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.030
regardless of outcome for you.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.520
So when you do this, you start
to create that connection

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.630
we talked about.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.220
You start to lay the
foundation of deep trust.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.360
And not only that, you
do this because you

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.400
have a solution for them.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.030
You have something that could
help with their problems.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:07.060
But until you have gone deep
into those conversations,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.980
you cannot know for a fact
whether your genius solution is

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.030
what they need.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.540
And I think, it's safe to say
we've all been in a place--

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.840
especially as an engineer,
where I love to solve problems--

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.070
where someone comes to
you with their challenges,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.230
and your intention
is to help them.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.960
But you're not sure whether
your solution is right.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.250
But you put it forth, and it's
not quite well-received yet.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.770
We don't want to offer
our solution before we are

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.690
sure it's the real solution.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.290
And you do that by going
deep into a conversation

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.750
with deep caring
and deep curiosity.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.470
Now let's look at how this
would look in a corporate life

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.820
example.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.020
I spent 12 years in
the corporate world.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.660
And since then, I've
had the pleasure

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.330
of working with many
corporate professionals

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.610
from all walks of life.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.190
When your average
corporate employee

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.690
reaches a certain level of
experience, qualifications,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.650
and expertise, they want to
advance to that next level

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.290
and get promoted and
move up the ladder.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.320
So when similar opportunities
present themselves

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.350
in their organizations,
they want to secure it.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.560
So the next natural step
is having a conversation

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.450
with their manager.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.530
Here is how those
conversations usually unfold.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.110
The corporate employee
shares how much

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.840
they want that
promotion, how well

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.250
qualified they are for it, and
maybe, maybe that they even

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.580
deserve it.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.300
They've worked really,
really hard to get here.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.040
The manager agrees,
shows polite interest,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.620
and might even
make some promises.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.610
They have a great
conversation together,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.550
and then absolutely
nothing happens.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.600
It's very frustrating, because
the corporate employee is

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.000
wondering, what else
do I need to do,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.660
how much harder
do I need to work.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.920
And it's not about that.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.510
It's about the value positioning
in that conversation.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.880
So what the employee is
doing is justifying why

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.350
they are the best candidate.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.250
They may very well be,
but that's their approach,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.020
and that's not serving.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.550
So let's see how this
conversation would be different

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.600
if they were to come to it
from a place of serving,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.880
and deep caring,
and deep curiosity.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.540
They would set aside their
agenda, which in this case

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.230
is to get promoted.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.530
They would step into
that conversation

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.310
and be really curious
about their management's

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.210
real challenges, about
their real problems,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.570
about the organization's
real goals and struggles,

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.700
and what a real solution
would look like.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.080
So they would ask
different questions.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.960
Some of those questions
might be, well, you know,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.610
John or Janet--

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.570
please say your manager's name--

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.220
I've been doing
some research, and I

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.360
believe these are the three
top challenges in our project.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.970
I would like to explore
those further with you.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.330
Would you be open to that?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.570
Or, here is what I see to be the
top challenge we have coming up

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.560
for the organization
in the coming year,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.980
and I have some
ideas on how I can

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.040
be of value toward a solution.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.400
Would you be open to
exploring that with me?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.250
Now, this line of
questioning shows

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.320
that you are deeply
curious and you

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.860
care about your
management, your company.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.930
You're not an individual
contributor now.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.460
You are a leader.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.390
You are having a different
conversation altogether,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:59.430
and that welcomes a different
response from your manager.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.620
Now, you may not get promoted
from this conversation

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.930
the next day, next month,
or even the next year.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.180
But what happens is that
you change the perception

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.819
of your management on you.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.540
They begin to see you
as value, as an asset

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.430
to the organization,
as a leader.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.140
And I have seen this
shift in conversations

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.740
change people's careers,
the course of their careers,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.700
and invite unexpected
opportunities.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.210
So we use deep caring
and deep curiosity.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.200
We set aside our agenda, and
we enter those conversations

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.310
from that place.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.180
Now, I talked earlier
about how instinctively, we

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.540
all want to be of
genuine help and service.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:51.610
Sometimes, we confuse
serving with pleasing.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.000
So we're going to explore
that a little bit.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.340
Pleasing is when you are
talking to your prospect.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.740
And I use the word prospect--

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.380
I mean your prospective
employers, partners, customers,

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.890
clients, what have you.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.850
And you feel you have to
agree to everything they say.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.390
You have to be nice.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.260
You tiptoe around
delicate topics.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.500
You don't speak your mind
because it might upset them,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.170
or it might not be
something they want to hear,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.630
even though it
would benefit them.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.970
So that's pleasing.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.030
That is not the same as serving.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.710
Remember, with serving, we have
our prospects' highest interest

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.790
at heart.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.550
We need to be
willing to tell them

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.500
something that would
be of benefit to them,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.200
even if it may not
be well received.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.800
So the distinction between
pleasing and serving

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.410
is what I want to demonstrate
in my next example.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.890
So one of my other
clients, Danielle,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.780
is a scientist by training.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.730
Very good at what
she does, again.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.360
She recently got promoted to
the role of chief marketing

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.570
officer, CMO, at her company.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.610
In this role, her job was
to form key partnerships

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.360
with other companies, and
she was having some struggle

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.960
doing this.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.910
So as we worked together, we
saw that her real challenge

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.680
was she didn't feel comfortable
telling her prospects exactly

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.240
what she wanted to tell them.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.290
She felt she had to please
them and agree with everything.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.910
So as a result, she was having
surface level conversations,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.030
and she wasn't getting
responses to her messages.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.820
She wasn't getting invited
to other conversations.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.910
Her relationships were
not moving further.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.650
So as we worked together,
we gave her several tools

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.060
to overcome this.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.990
One particular tool that
she was really able to use

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.320
was the art of
asking permissions.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.800
So when she came to a
place in the conversation

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.160
where she felt, I really
need to go deeper,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.680
but her personal
boundaries weren't making

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.890
her feel comfortable,
she would say,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.680
would it be OK to ask you more
questions around this challenge

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.760
you shared with me?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.000
Would you be comfortable with
us exploring that deeper?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.430
That way she respected
her own boundaries,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.690
but she stopped pleasing
and went deeper.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.390
She did the work of serving.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.120
As a result, she got way
more than she bargained for.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.340
So not only were her prospects--
prospective partners-- more

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.610
than happy to tell her
their challenges at length,

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.730
she was able to move forward
in those relationships.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.220
Why is that?

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.170
What did she do?

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.670
Danielle created this safe
space for her prospects

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.550
to feel comfortable
with her, to know

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.030
they wouldn't be judged if
they shared a particular fear

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.810
or something they were ashamed
of or their real challenges,

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:57.450
and they were able to be
vulnerable as a result.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.170
So she was able to
lay the foundation

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.060
of real relationships.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.050
She was able to get to the real
challenges of her prospects

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.160
and offer her solutions
if she saw fit.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.490
So Danielle went from
pleasing to serving.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.550
So in this first
guiding principle--

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.280
I am not selling, I am serving--

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.190
we saw how you go from
selling to serving,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.900
how you go from
justifying why you're

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.960
the best candidate to
serving, and how you

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.420
go from pleasing to serving.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.180
Right.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.330
Let's talk about the
second guiding principle

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.280
of the serving mindset, and
that is charging appropriately

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.570
for the value that you deliver.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.770
So the value you
deliver could be you

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.370
as a genius asset in your
organization in a company,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.670
or it could be a professional
service that you deliver.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.910
Charging appropriately
for that value.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.010
Again, in my research, I
found smart, talented, highly

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.230
educated professionals
and entrepreneurs

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.340
like us tend to bet
very low on ourselves.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.160
We think our value
is really small.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.080
Why is that?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.410
Well, it came to three main
reasons, and all of them

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.190
fall under the umbrella
of negative thinking.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.870
The first reason--
scarcity mindset.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.810
There simply isn't enough
opportunities out there for me,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.560
so I have to grab
whatever comes my way.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.070
So if you're in a job
interview process,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.670
you feel, I have to say
yes to this job because it

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.890
could be the last one.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.170
If you are prospecting
clients, you

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.260
feel you have to close the
one before you because it

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.120
could be the last one.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.490
There simply isn't enough
opportunities out there for me.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.360
Excuse me.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.240
I did this early in
my coaching practice.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.330
I priced my professional
coaching services

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:02.580
so low because I had to attract
all those few opportunities out

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.690
there.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:09.040
Well, as a result, I attracted
the most unfit clients.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.200
Not only were they not
the right fit for me,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.770
I certainly wasn't the
right fit for them.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.760
Nobody was served
well in this scenario.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.200
Scarcity mindset-- number one
reason we bet low on ourselves.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.710
The second reason we
bet low on ourselves

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:31.110
is lack of worthiness, or rather
confusion around worthiness.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.000
We just don't think
we're worth it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.450
We don't think we are
worth the high salary

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.150
we should be asking,
or the high prices

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.250
we should be charging
for our services.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:45.810
Now, I found with worthiness
we tend to confuse it

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.330
with arrogance and greed.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.800
We tend to think we would come
across as arrogant and greed,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.180
and who wants that?

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.750
None of us.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.560
So we keep it safe.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.670
I'll give you an example here
to see how this worthiness

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.180
issue can be a
complete deterrent

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.350
of your opportunities.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.770
So I have a friend who is
a professional speaker.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.970
He's brilliant, and he
really has a good message.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.910
He wanted to secure
this particular event

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.570
because he felt his message
would be of great value

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.220
to his audience.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.560
Well, he also didn't
think he could possibly

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.650
be worth more than
$1,500, so that's

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.220
what he quoted for
his speaking fee.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.150
The organizers came back to
him and said, we're sorry,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.390
but we don't put anyone
up on that stage who

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.360
charges less than $5,000.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.610
Now, the speaker not only
disqualified himself,

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:53.370
he robbed his would be
audience of his great message.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:58.210
Worthiness did not serve
anyone in this equation.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.200
The third reason we tend
to bet low on ourselves

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.060
is because we don't
think they'll say yes.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.950
We think people will say no.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.720
And so we make sure we keep
it really, really safe.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.680
Now, in eight years of being
in business and being a coach

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.590
and having worked with people
from all walks of life,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.580
I can tell you, every
time I try to guess

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.860
who is willing to invest what--

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.090
every single time--

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.530
I was wrong.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.560
And not only that, it's none
of my business to guess.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.070
My business is to serve
and to charge appropriately

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.650
for the value that I deliver.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.340
So some reasons why we
bet low on ourselves.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.330
But no matter what
your reasons, here

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.250
is the real kicker when
you have low prices.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:54.450
Low prices associate you
with low quality of work.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.030
We established you are
no longer a beginner.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.350
You are a professional.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.330
You have years of
experience, expertise,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.720
and qualifications behind you.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.160
When you charge low
prices for your value,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.410
you send a very confusing
message to your target market.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.760
Your ideal prospect knows
the value of your work.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.330
They know what they are
willing to invest in you.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.860
Your low prices confuse
them, and they associate you

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.210
with low quality of work,
which is not fair to you,

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.630
and it certainly isn't the
right message to send out.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.760
So now that we are sufficiently
motivated to charge

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.970
appropriately,
yes, let's see how

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.310
we can turn this around
and bring you back

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.120
to the serving mindset.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.240
We're going to use our power
to choose our thoughts here.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.960
Number one-- the
abundance mindset,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.830
which I'm sure you've guessed,
says there is more than enough

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.780
opportunities out there for me--

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.360
more than I can imagine.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.490
Now, I know it's easy
enough for me to stand here

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.560
and say, OK, choose
the abundance mindset

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.950
over scarcity.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.210
But I will give you a
really good reason for it.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.800
Just as you cannot prove
to me this is the last job

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.500
that's coming your way, this
is the last prospective client,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.140
you also cannot prove
there aren't 100 more great

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.910
opportunities out there.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:28.720
Can't prove either one.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.520
So why not choose the
more empowering thought?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.680
Because the minute you do that,
you feel a surge of confidence.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.950
Imagine going into
your conversations

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.720
from a place of confidence
instead of a place of neediness

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.700
or desperation.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.170
You will have different results.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.260
The second reason we're
going to bring you back

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.620
to the serving mindset is
to clear up this whole issue

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.720
around worthiness.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.880
Your worth does not
fluctuate with your prices.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.550
Your worth has nothing
to do with your prices.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.110
It is who you are as a person.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.760
It is your character.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.070
It is how you live your life.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.750
So what we need to do
is separate worthiness

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.370
from the equation.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.740
When you learn to
do that, you can

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.850
think rationally and
logically about the value

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.910
that you deliver and charge
appropriately for it.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.160
So three ways we can bring you
back to charging appropriately

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.070
for it because when you charge
appropriately for the value

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:40.330
you deliver, you are serving
yourself and your prospects.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.250
Low prices can hurt you.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.960
We need to charge appropriately.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.810
Now, this dovetails nicely into
our third guiding principle--

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:54.190
welcoming and
addressing objections.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.230
This is my favorite,
and this is one

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.300
that takes a bit of
courage, but nothing

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.340
that we can't muster here.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.080
First, I'd like to
define objection.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.690
An objection is-- let's say
I've had a great conversation

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.710
with my prospect, John, and
he says to me, Farnoosh,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.730
you're great.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:13.960
Love to have you.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.750
You're the best.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.470
We'd love to hire you, but--

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.580
everything that follows
the but is an objection

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.770
in my prospect's mind.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.190
It's the gap between where
we are right now together

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.140
and a resounding yes.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.240
We may or may not get there.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.920
Now, what happens when we
normally receive an objection?

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.200
We feel a sense of rejection.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.280
It's normal.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.900
Somebody just said no.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.020
Especially if it's preceded
by a bunch of compliments.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.670
It hurts.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.020
And after the rejection,
what is our next response?

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.140
We tend to go into a
bit of justification

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.030
and self-defense mode.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.940
Let me tell you why you
really should hire me.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.560
No, this is not
what you understood.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.880
This is why I can really be of
value, et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.960
That thinking pulls you away
from the serving mindset

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.870
because now you're
focused on yourself.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.780
Now, before we go back
to the serving mindset,

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.470
I'll give you a really good
reason around rejection

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.450
even though I totally get it.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.120
It's not nice to feel rejected.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.230
But here is why it's
impossible to be rejected.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.870
Remember, we are
no longer selling.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.060
If you're with me, we
are no longer selling.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.020
We're only serving.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.950
So if you're not
selling anything,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.290
what are you being rejected for?

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.510
You simply put an
offer on the table,

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.190
and you received a response.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.330
So if it's impossible
to be rejected,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:50.440
there is no need to go into
the justification mode.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.770
Now, how do we come
to the objections

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.200
from a place of serving?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.850
Well, first we need to be
able to welcome, receive,

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.040
and explore the objections.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.030
We may or may not
overcome every objection.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.000
Overcoming means that
is no longer an issue

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.560
on our prospect's mind.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.010
But sometimes your prospect
gives you great information.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.220
It may make you think,
oh, you know what?

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.680
Maybe it's not a good
idea to engage right now.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.090
Maybe it's not a
good idea for me

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.230
to come on board at this time.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.710
So we cannot always
overcome the objection,

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.500
but our job is to explore them.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.460
Why do we do this?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.310
Because we want to get
to the real objection.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.590
So the first reason
your prospect

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:43.690
gives you is not always the
real reason they are saying no.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.570
To get to that real
reason, you need

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.790
to have a deep level of
trust in that relationship.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.460
And our job is to get
to the real reason

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.270
because the real reason helps
us decide if we are indeed

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.590
the right solution for them.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.390
So when you have your prospect's
highest interests at heart,

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.100
and you are helping them arrive
at a smart decision for them,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.920
you learn to welcome
and address objections

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.260
so that we can get to
the real objection.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.010
And then we can see whether
we can overcome it together.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.660
Let me go back to my
example with John.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.020
Let's say he says to me,
Farnoosh, you're great.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.270
We'd love to hire you, but we
don't have the budget for it.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.140
The world's oldest excuse
around business propositions.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.110
And I call it an excuse
because sometimes it's

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.640
the real objection--

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.070
often, it is not.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.150
Now, how would I
respond to John here?

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:47.840
I would say, first, John, thank
you for sharing that with me.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.540
I thank him.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.920
Would it be OK if I ask you
more questions around that?

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.980
I ask permission
before I probe further.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.500
Now, I've never had anyone
say, no, you may not

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.090
ask me any more questions.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.110
It may yet happen, but let's
assume he says, yes, go ahead.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:09.400
And then I would say,
John, I am curious.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.530
What budget did you have in
mind relative to the value

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.420
I would be delivering?

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.120
Remember, we just learned
to charge appropriately

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.880
for the value we deliver.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.980
A budget doesn't
exist in a vacuum.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.370
It needs to be relative
to the value you

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.220
deliver to the organization
or to the project.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.630
Now, John may still
shrug off the example.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.610
He may still not answer me.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.850
We have a fixed budget.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.740
I don't know.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.680
My job is to stay grounded in
who I am, to know my value--

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.730
so don't go into
discounting mode.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.620
In fact, don't even
talk about the budget.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.590
Go back to discussing value.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.470
I might say to John, you
know, John, I'm curious.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.070
How do you see the value I
would be adding to the project?

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.780
What is your vision of
us working together?

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.090
How do you see me helping you
towards your desired outcomes--

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.220
your desired results?

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.150
You go back to making sure
your prospect understands

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:14.500
the value that you are going
to bring to their work,

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.420
to their business,
to their careers.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.540
Now, again, I may not
get a straight answer,

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.870
but what you are doing
is creating space

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.080
for your prospect
to confide in you.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.139
Very few are willing to go here.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.840
Your ego mind is telling
you I don't like this.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840
This is uncomfortable.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.210
Get me out of here.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.679
Don't listen.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.630
Stay present.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:42.340
Create space for your prospect
to be honest with you,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.620
to tell you the real
reasons they may not

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.320
be able to hire you right
now, to work with you.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.000
And then help them arrive
at the best decision based

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.530
on that information.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.949
Now, those are the
occasions when your prospect

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.440
is nice enough to tell
you why they don't

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.870
want to work with you just yet.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.660
Sometimes we get a
different response.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.910
I'm willing to bet
we've all had this one.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.890
You've had a great conversation.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.480
You feel like everything
went really, really well.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:16.180
And then they say, so Farnoosh,
we'd love to hire you,

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.690
love to work with you.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.410
We're going to think about
it and get back to you.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.770
And then I hear nothing.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.380
They just disappear.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.480
And I'm feeling,
should I follow up?

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.960
That whole awkward follow
up after a conversation

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.990
because we don't know
what really happened.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:33.950
We weren't clear.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.030
So that's when your
prospect obviously

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:40.330
had an objection because we're
not sitting on a yes here,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.230
but they didn't feel
comfortable sharing it with you.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:49.650
So again, if you go back to
deep trust and deep caring

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:54.060
and explore that, you might
just get them to share.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.900
Something you might say
would be, you know, Janet,

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.940
I think we've had a
great conversation, too.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.630
I totally respect that you
have to go and think about it.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.380
Tell me, are there any
concerns right now on your mind

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.860
that I can address for you?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.020
Might you have any questions
as to what I would be doing,

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.880
how we would be
working together,

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.610
as you make your decision?

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.790
They may or may not still
give you the real objection,

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.610
but again, you've created space.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.510
You have shown your prospect
you truly care about them

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.420
and you are there to help
them make a decision that's

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.850
right for them.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.350
So this does require courage
because, like I said,

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.330
your ego mind wants you to run.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.020
But if you stay with it,
this is a golden opportunity.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.570
If you learn the
skill of navigating

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:49.190
this part of the conversation,
and create space and trust,

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.860
you will see that you
are laying the foundation

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.830
for a different kind of
relationship altogether.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.790
So we explored three
guiding principles

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.380
of the serving mindset--

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.760
stop selling, start serving,
charge appropriately

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.090
for the value that you
deliver, and welcome

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.200
and address objections.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.720
Now, I know as
professionals that you

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.670
know how to have conversations.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.590
You've been doing
it for some time.

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:20.860
You know how to go into a
conversation and ask questions,

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.700
and I'm sure you do.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.630
But I believe the
only opinion that

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.690
matters when we are having
prospecting conversations

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.120
is that of our prospect.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.020
So to that end, might you be
willing to take a mental quiz

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.068
together?

00:37:36.068 --> 00:37:37.360
You don't need a pen and paper.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.850
All right.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.520
Good.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.440
I'm getting nods.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.820
So bring to mind your
warmest prospect--

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.060
your prospective employer,
partner, customer.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.120
Somebody with whom you've
been having conversations,

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.070
you have been doing
due diligence,

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.900
you feel as if you have a
good relationship going,

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.800
and you're working
toward a decision.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:05.830
Now, if I were to call your
prospect anonymously and ask

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.920
them on a scale of 1 to 10--

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.220
where 1 is poor and
10 is excellent--

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:18.310
what rating might they give
you on how well you understand

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.940
their real challenge?

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.710
Their real fears
and frustrations?

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.220
Their real goals as it
relates to your context?

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.900
What rating might they give you?

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.600
If it's less than
a nine, you don't

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.520
have to share it with
anyone, but there

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.840
is room for you to go deeper
in that beautiful relationship

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.930
you're building.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.970
This is a golden opportunity
to deepen that trust

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.020
and to see that you can, indeed,
change the course of outcomes

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.460
of those conversations.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.790
So my challenge to
you is next time

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.910
you have a prospecting
conversation

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.350
to set aside your agenda--

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.990
no agenda-- to go into it
from a place of deep caring

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.190
and deep curiosity,
regardless of outcome for you,

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.030
and to see what happens,
to see what experience

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.660
unfolds for both of you.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.410
I think you might be
pleasantly surprised.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:25.680
So as you think about this
and bring the serving mindset

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.200
into your
conversations, you will

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.740
find that you are developing
a deeper level of relationship

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.800
altogether, that
you are creating

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.760
different results for yourself,
and that in the process,

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.350
you are feeling joy and
fulfillment in the work.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.420
I hope I've given you
some good insights today,

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.857
and now we can go into
a Q&amp;A if you like.

00:39:50.857 --> 00:39:52.440
AUDIENCE: And I
really love your story

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.870
of how you went from
the corporate world

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.240
to kind of creating your
own profitable business

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.320
in the past 18 months.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.920
It's really amazing.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.760
So for me, I actually run my
own kind of career consulting.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.550
It's called [INAUDIBLE],, and
I do these workshops and kind

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:09.040
of webinars for students
on the university level.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.580
And so this year I've actually
done about 16 of them,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.340
so it's been a really
good experience,

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.610
but I struggle with kind of--

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.650
only one has been paid,
so most of them are free.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.562
So it's really fun to do.

00:40:22.562 --> 00:40:24.270
It's really fun to
bring value to people.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.180
But for me, I kind of struggle
to find a price point,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.520
or find a price point
for the value I bring.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.620
So my question
would be, how do you

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.240
go from basically
free prospects,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.080
or doing these free
workshops, to paid workshops?

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.580
And then also, when
do you know when

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.740
it's time to leave
the corporate world

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.970
and then go pursue
entrepreneurship?

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:43.920
FARNOOSH BROCK: OK.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.130
So great questions.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.650
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.100
So I would say the pricing.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.900
The pricing really,
again, comes down

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.310
to the value you're delivering.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.830
You've been doing this
work for free-- great.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.890
You have already experienced
and you have created--

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.920
I trust-- results
for your clients.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.930
Look at those results.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.260
Look at the impact you had
creating those results,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.420
whether it was
tangible or intangible.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.690
So tangible is when you
helped somebody get a raise

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.420
and it's measurable
in dollars and cents.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.590
Intangible is when you help
someone have more confidence,

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:23.100
have more courage, make
a difficult transition

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.090
in their lives.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.750
Both of those are value that
you have helped deliver.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.445
And then look at that--

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:31.320
and there is different
ways to go about this.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.920
I mean, when you don't
have any baseline,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.720
you can just start somewhere.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.390
I know it sounds
random, and it's not,

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.050
but you start somewhere.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.980
The range for coaching
services is from $50 an hour

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.880
to $1 million a year,
some coaches charge for.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.540
It's a large range, right?

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.140
So you start somewhere.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.290
And I think questions
I like to ask

00:41:55.290 --> 00:42:00.510
myself is, when I get paid for
this amount, is this worth it?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.510
Is this worth the energy
and time on my part,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.910
or will I be resentful
for putting all this

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.550
and feeling like I'm not
getting enough, you know?

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:12.210
And I think that's personal
for all of us-- that number.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.460
And then, another
thing you can do,

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.770
since you've already done
due diligence for people,

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:20.190
is go to your past customers--

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.780
and you've done it
for free for them,

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.580
so maybe they can
owe you a favor--

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.040
and say, look, I'm
wondering, what would you

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.560
have paid for the
value I delivered

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.720
to you-- for the work we did?

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.180
So get some numbers
and see whether you

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.270
can get some ideas as
to what was the value

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.910
and what is it that people are
willing to pay-- especially

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:42.190
in hindsight because now they
see the value in their lives,

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.550
in their education,
in their careers.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.310
And think about how
that might give you

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.900
an idea of where to start.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.600
And then from there,
I think, again,

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.010
look at the energy you put
in, the time you put in,

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.260
the differences that you make.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.830
And, of course, with
experience, your impact grows,

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:02.790
and so your prices should be
adapting to that over time,

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.440
naturally.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.620
And your second
question was, gosh,

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.080
when do you know that it's time
to leave the corporate world?

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.610
And I think that's a very
personal one for all of us,

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:18.120
and it really comes down
to your values, you know.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.520
If you value a
sense of happiness,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.550
joy, wellness,
health, and if you

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.000
feel like you're sacrificing
that by keeping your job,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.370
or the culture at
the workplace doesn't

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.350
align to your personal values--

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.750
family could be a big value.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:37.140
At some point, we
reach a tipping point

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.350
where we just don't
want to continue

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.180
because it's not worth it.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.200
Life is short.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.510
We want to have a sense of
alignment to our values,

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.870
so we enjoy life.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.470
And so that tipping point
came for me at a certain time.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.210
It came for my clients
at different times.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.060
And I think also
being responsible

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.863
around that decision,
right, because we still

00:43:59.863 --> 00:44:00.780
have responsibilities.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.370
We still have bills to pay.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:06.660
And how to plan around that
and maybe adapt our lifestyle

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.290
so we create a cushion so
that we allow the next thing

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:14.230
we're going to do-- our business
to flourish, to catch up.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.740
So if I were to give
you a short answer,

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.000
it comes down to values--

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.735
what really matters to you.

00:44:19.735 --> 00:44:21.360
And if you feel, at
the end of the day,

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.340
your corporate job
allows you to do

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.270
that, or with some shifts,
some changes and priorities,

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.300
you can still do that,
then maybe you're not

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.040
at a place to quit your job.

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.963
And in some places, some
locations, you might be.

00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:37.630
I hope I'm not giving
you vague answers.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.505
These are big topics,
so hopefully giving you

00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:40.810
some insights to think over.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.090
Thank you for your question.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.590
Yeah, you bet.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.050
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you come

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.420
and maybe you've got
a prospect that you're

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.420
going to be speaking to.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.470
Do you have a ritual or anything
that you say or visualize

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.890
prior to that and that
you're able to really connect

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:56.880
in that way?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.050
Curious what works for you.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.377
FARNOOSH BROCK: Yeah,
not so much that,

00:45:01.377 --> 00:45:02.460
but what I like to do is--

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.070
I mean, over time, I
think more than anything

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:09.270
is knowing that I
am good at what I

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.940
do if it's the right prospect.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.560
Knowing the value you deliver.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.110
Being really grounded in that.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.710
So having clarity around what
you do and what you do well,

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.540
and then going into
that conversation

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.920
and being open to learn.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.090
So I don't have a ritual
before, but coming

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.520
to this place of
being really grounded,

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.590
really knowing what
am I about, what

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.930
is my sweet spot, how
I can help people,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.460
and knowing that I can--

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.910
and it helps to have those past
clients, like Jonathan has,

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:42.330
to show that, look, there
is actual experience here.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.690
And keeping that in mind.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.460
But also being open
to explore and, again,

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.710
seeing whether there is a fit.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.340
And it always helps to maybe
have some quiet time before,

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.530
to learn more about
the person, and to have

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.660
a framework for the
conversation so you

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.980
are leading that conversation
even as they are sharing,

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.550
exploring with you.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.700
I think that's maybe helpful.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.130
And you know where it's going
because they are inquiring

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:12.540
of your services, and you
are kind of leading that

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.647
to where you want it to go.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:15.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.530
I have a question regarding
sort of the genesis of this.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:24.720
So typically, when we talk
about sales and influence

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.670
discussions, a lot
of the emphasis

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:34.380
is on techniques,
frameworks, scripts.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.390
But I think what's
interesting about what

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:40.720
you've shared with us is
that it is about the mindset.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.430
And I'm just kind of curious
as to how you discovered

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:49.320
that mindset is what
unlocked the greater

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.048
success in those conversations?

00:46:51.048 --> 00:46:52.590
FARNOOSH BROCK:
Sure, great question.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.920
Yes, I mean, to give you more
context, the first few years

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.670
in my business, I did all the
traditional selling techniques.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.230
And I had moderate success.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.430
It didn't feel good.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.440
Like, this strategy,
and this question,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.410
and this scarcity mindset,
and this manipulation.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.320
I did them, just to experiment,
and I had moderate success,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.710
but it didn't feel good.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.550
And so then I started
to just, again,

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.160
get more confident
in what I was doing

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.953
and the results
I was delivering.

00:47:18.953 --> 00:47:20.370
And then I just
started to go down

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.030
to the human touch,
the human dynamics.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.680
I mean, I don't have
a complicated system.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.470
I have a methodology
around the serving,

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.740
but it is really about
how you make someone

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.930
feel heard and understood.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.990
It really is about being of
genuine help and service,

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:40.290
and then knowing your own value
if there is an opportunity

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.860
for us to work together.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.820
So I might have one conversation
with one person, another

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.870
with another.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.900
I take into account their
personalities, their styles,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.210
because for me, the
most important thing

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:54.885
is to connect with
the individual

00:47:54.885 --> 00:47:56.760
because we do business--
we don't do business

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.840
with faceless companies.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.180
We do business with people.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.810
Even if you are a B2B, you
do business with people.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:06.910
And so it's all about
connecting with people.

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:08.670
It's not about
manipulating them.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.390
It's about building a deep
relationship through trust,

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.760
through listening,
through slowing down,

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.140
through setting
aside our agenda,

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.990
but still knowing that
we have goals to achieve.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.520
And if this is the
right fit, we are

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.580
going to put a nice
proposal on the table.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.120
And really comes down
to the relationships.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.870
So again, how did I discover it?

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.310
Experimentation.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.850
Tons of conversations with
many different people--

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.260
people who would come to me--

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.140
and learning from
people that I respect.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.390
Watching people
have conversations

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:44.850
and seeing what
resonates with me, right,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.350
because it has to
resonate with you.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.910
You can't fake it.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:51.630
So whatever you take away has
to be something you really want

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.480
to embody in that conversation.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.990
And I think experience
is the best lesson.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.390
So you take what I
shared here with you,

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.280
you bring it to a
conversation, and you

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.650
have firsthand experience,
whether that works better

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:06.510
for you or not.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.170
Thank you.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:07.670
Great.
