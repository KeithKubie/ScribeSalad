00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.470
Back in 1603, Queen Elizabeth I passed away.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.889
She had ruled England for 45 years, was well-loved,
and provided a sense of stability and security

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:13.969
during her reign.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.140
Described as “neither a good protestant
nor yet resolute papist,” she was able to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.970
provide a relatively happy medium between
the two warring sects.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.000
Having had no children of her own, though,
the throne was open to King James VI of Scotland,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.890
who became King James I of England upon her
death.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.340
England had been at war with Scotland on and
off over the years.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.370
James’ own mother, Mary, had been beheaded
by Elizabeth.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.580
Still, many people saw the rise of a new king
to be the opportunity for religious reform

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.040
that they had been waiting for.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.090
On his journey south to his English coronation,
King James was stopped by a delegation of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.140
Puritans who presented him with a list of
grievances and proposed reforms.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.480
It was signed by over 1000 clergymen—10%
of England’s clergy at the time—and was

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.250
subsequently called the Millenary Petition.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.840
They addressed things such as banning the
use of wedding rings and wearing a cross,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.990
but didn’t mention anything about a new
bible translation.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.630
The new King James called for a meeting at
Hampton Court Palace to address the concerns

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.570
in the Millenary Petition, which took place
in early 1604.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.439
The Puritans weren’t allowed to attend the
first day of the conference, and James largely

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.649
disregarded most of their requests.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.270
In fact, James was happy with the set-up of
the English Church, having been extremely

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.149
frustrated with the Scottish Presbyterian
model.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.020
Eventually, Dr. John Reynolds, the lead Puritan
voice at the conference, brought up the idea

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.009
of a bible translation because “those which
were allowed in the reign of King Henry VIII

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.470
and King Edward VI were corrupt and not answerable
to the truth of the original.”

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.119
James, who hated the popular Geneva bible
for its anti-royalty message, agreed that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.569
a new translation would be for the best.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.189
And despite the other outcomes of the conference,
the Puritans were happy because they believed

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.380
they would have a say in the new translation,
perhaps enabling them to bring about some

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.009
of the reforms they wished for anyway.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.509
The translation of the bible didn’t begin
until 1607.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.349
Fifty-four bible experts (only forty-eight
were recorded, as some died before the translation

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.900
was finished) gathered at Oxford, Westminster,
and Cambridge to discuss the translation.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.000
They came from all levels of religion and
had different ideas about the reform that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.160
they wanted to see.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.629
They had to follow 15 rules for translation,
including making no notes in the margins of

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.510
the Bible and keeping the language accessible
to the common people (many of whom were wholly

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.209
illiterate at the time).

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.900
The translators were broken into subcommittees.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.150
Each translator independently translated the
same section of the bible, which he then brought

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.340
back to the subcommittee.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.879
All of the translations were compared, and
one was selected to be sent to the general

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.079
revising committee.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.829
The revising committee listened to the translation
rather than read it; because much of their

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.200
audience was illiterate, they wanted the bible
to sound right more than look right.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.850
If the translation didn’t sound good, the
general committee would debate and revise

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.780
the passage until it did.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.620
Afterwards, they would send their approved
passages to a few Bishops, who would then

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.080
send the passage on to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who would send it to King James who had the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.220
final say in the approval of the new translation.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.750
The new translation was finally completed
in1610, but didn’t become available to the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.620
public until the following year.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.700
It was printed by Robert Barker, King James’
personally appointed printer.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.159
Unfortunately, the new translation had been
so anticipated that Barker rushed to the printer

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.719
and many mistakes were made.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:36.090
Barker had paid £3,500 for the right to publish
the bible, and spent even more trying to fix

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.909
mistakes and fend off pirating publishers.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.860
By 1635, he ended up in debtor’s prison
where he would later die.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.180
Aside from printing two different versions
of the bible at the same time and allowing

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.430
their pages to get bound up together rather
than separately, major typos were discovered

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.720
in the 1631 printing, which later became known
as “The Wicked Bible.”

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.019
Among other discrepancies, “God’s greatness”
was misprinted as “God’s great asse”

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.319
and the word “not” was left out of the
commandment “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.180
Because of this, it isn’t exactly a mystery
as to why the King James Version wasn’t

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.299
popular from the start.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.970
Over time, the King James Bible underwent
a number of revisions from the original translation.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.160
Typos were corrected, new chapter summaries
were included, and marginal references were

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.350
added and verified for accuracy.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:50.060
The revisions opened the door to increasing
the King James Version’s popularity.
