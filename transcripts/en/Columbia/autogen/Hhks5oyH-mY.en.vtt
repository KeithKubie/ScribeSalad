you know the guilty look which is this

01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400
you know the guilty look which is this
 

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.359
you know the guilty look which is this
more ethnographic frame in which would

01:34:35.359 --> 01:34:35.369
more ethnographic frame in which would
 

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:37.850
more ethnographic frame in which would
be deemed appropriate for some for such

01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860
be deemed appropriate for some for such
 

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:38.950
be deemed appropriate for some for such
subject matter

01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960
subject matter
 

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.770
subject matter
you know as I think that and then I

01:34:41.770 --> 01:34:41.780
you know as I think that and then I
 

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:45.280
you know as I think that and then I
think also it needs RM Williams time

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:45.290
think also it needs RM Williams time
 

01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:46.900
think also it needs RM Williams time
it's a structure the feeling that can

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:46.910
it's a structure the feeling that can
 

01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:50.800
it's a structure the feeling that can
also be attached and 2 d's kind of

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:50.810
also be attached and 2 d's kind of
 

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.380
also be attached and 2 d's kind of
moments as well and so does way in which

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:53.390
moments as well and so does way in which
 

01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:57.700
moments as well and so does way in which
one is kind of plain these themes

01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:57.710
one is kind of plain these themes
 

01:34:57.710 --> 01:35:00.610
one is kind of plain these themes
through and also I think there's a way

01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:00.620
through and also I think there's a way
 

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.500
through and also I think there's a way
in which one is also trying to challenge

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:02.510
in which one is also trying to challenge
 

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:06.430
in which one is also trying to challenge
of course um the sort of more consensual

01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440
of course um the sort of more consensual
 

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.770
of course um the sort of more consensual
assumptions about how certain debates

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:08.780
assumptions about how certain debates
 

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:11.800
assumptions about how certain debates
are sort of placed you know so they

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:11.810
are sort of placed you know so they
 

01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:13.870
are sort of placed you know so they
divide between aesthetics and politics

01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880
divide between aesthetics and politics
 

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:20.650
divide between aesthetics and politics
between beauty and sort of truth yeah so

01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:20.660
between beauty and sort of truth yeah so
 

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.680
between beauty and sort of truth yeah so
I think there's that of aspect which I

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:23.690
I think there's that of aspect which I
 

01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:27.220
I think there's that of aspect which I
too in a way deliberately want to bring

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:27.230
too in a way deliberately want to bring
 

01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:30.750
too in a way deliberately want to bring
into kind of bricolage um in the work

01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760
into kind of bricolage um in the work
 

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:34.570
into kind of bricolage um in the work
and I think you know that's because of

01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:34.580
and I think you know that's because of
 

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.840
and I think you know that's because of
the position that one is trying to make

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:37.850
the position that one is trying to make
 

01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.810
the position that one is trying to make
the work from blur as opposed to making

01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:40.820
the work from blur as opposed to making
 

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.430
the work from blur as opposed to making
the work about certain things so I think

01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440
the work about certain things so I think
 

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:53.620
the work about certain things so I think
there's that different as well

of your works with us tonight I thought
that was a very rare and inspiring

01:36:00.339 --> 01:36:00.349
that was a very rare and inspiring
 

01:36:00.349 --> 01:36:04.250

small boats and then also ten thousand

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:16.050
small boats and then also ten thousand

distinct trajectory of evolving

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719
distinct trajectory of evolving
 

01:36:21.719 --> 01:36:24.470
distinct trajectory of evolving
techniques and multiple perspectives and

01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480
techniques and multiple perspectives and
 

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.049
techniques and multiple perspectives and
then also new nuance layers of meaning

01:36:27.049 --> 01:36:27.059
then also new nuance layers of meaning
 

01:36:27.059 --> 01:36:30.609
then also new nuance layers of meaning
and I'm wondering given this palpable

01:36:30.609 --> 01:36:30.619
and I'm wondering given this palpable
 

01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:34.180
and I'm wondering given this palpable
evolution how you may be currently

01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:34.190
evolution how you may be currently
 

01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:37.399
evolution how you may be currently
experimenting with the aesthetic and

01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:37.409
experimenting with the aesthetic and
 

01:36:37.409 --> 01:36:40.310
experimenting with the aesthetic and
technological aspects of your digital

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320
technological aspects of your digital
 

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.919
technological aspects of your digital
communication or perhaps how you may

01:36:42.919 --> 01:36:42.929
communication or perhaps how you may
 

01:36:42.929 --> 01:36:45.319

imagine them evolving and transforming

01:36:45.319 --> 01:36:45.329
imagine them evolving and transforming
 

01:36:45.329 --> 01:36:52.100
imagine them evolving and transforming
in the future well I think there's a way

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:52.110
in the future well I think there's a way
 

01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:55.640
in the future well I think there's a way
in which um that the way that the

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:55.650
in which um that the way that the
 

01:36:55.650 --> 01:36:58.490
in which um that the way that the
digital has as it were kind of been part

01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500
digital has as it were kind of been part
 

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.979
digital has as it were kind of been part

is that you know every day everybody's

01:37:03.379 --> 01:37:03.389
is that you know every day everybody's

on the computer on Facebook you're

01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:05.190
on the computer on Facebook you're
 

01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:07.700
on the computer on Facebook you're
emailing so this kind of question the

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:07.710
emailing so this kind of question the
 

01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:10.430
emailing so this kind of question the
multiscreen aspect is something that

01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440
multiscreen aspect is something that
 

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.740
multiscreen aspect is something that
we're all involved in you know so we're

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:12.750
we're all involved in you know so we're
 

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:15.020
we're all involved in you know so we're
all involved in its kind of visual

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:15.030
all involved in its kind of visual
 

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:17.600

intertextual playing as a world so I

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:17.610
intertextual playing as a world so I
 

01:37:17.610 --> 01:37:19.609
intertextual playing as a world so I
think that is obviously something that

01:37:19.609 --> 01:37:19.619
think that is obviously something that
 

01:37:19.619 --> 01:37:22.370
think that is obviously something that
seeped into the kind of display of the

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380
seeped into the kind of display of the
 

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.310
seeped into the kind of display of the
work and obviously i think in

01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320
work and obviously i think in
 

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.450
work and obviously i think in
relationship to UM the image you know

01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460
relationship to UM the image you know
 

01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:31.669

the movement from film to digital to

01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679
the movement from film to digital to
 

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:35.240
the movement from film to digital to
files and i think there's a way that

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:35.250
files and i think there's a way that
 

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:38.419
files and i think there's a way that
certainly within computerization that is

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:38.429
certainly within computerization that is
 

01:37:38.429 --> 01:37:43.010
certainly within computerization that is
some very exciting possibilities but for

01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020
some very exciting possibilities but for
 

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.750
some very exciting possibilities but for
my next work i'm quite interested in the

01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760
my next work i'm quite interested in the
 

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.410
my next work i'm quite interested in the
use of 3d but not in the way in which

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420
use of 3d but not in the way in which
 

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.439
use of 3d but not in the way in which
it's used in the kind of conventional

01:37:51.439 --> 01:37:51.449
it's used in the kind of conventional
 

01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:53.240
it's used in the kind of conventional
sort of hollywood cinema contacts

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:53.250
sort of hollywood cinema contacts
 

01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:56.330
sort of hollywood cinema contacts
because it tends to always use 3d as a

01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340
because it tends to always use 3d as a
 

01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:59.750
because it tends to always use 3d as a
way of invading the space thats Sarah

01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760
way of invading the space thats Sarah
 

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.180
way of invading the space thats Sarah
spectator but really the use of it in

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:02.190
spectator but really the use of it in
 

01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:05.180
spectator but really the use of it in
terms of deep focus and long shots and

01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:05.190
terms of deep focus and long shots and
 

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:06.830
terms of deep focus and long shots and
in this kind of

01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840
in this kind of
 

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.459
in this kind of
and so I think this is very interesting

01:38:10.459 --> 01:38:10.469
and so I think this is very interesting
 

01:38:10.469 --> 01:38:13.399
and so I think this is very interesting
and I'm knifing already there is the

01:38:13.399 --> 01:38:13.409
and I'm knifing already there is the
 

01:38:13.409 --> 01:38:15.859
and I'm knifing already there is the
kind of shift between the ways in which

01:38:15.859 --> 01:38:15.869
kind of shift between the ways in which
 

01:38:15.869 --> 01:38:18.770
kind of shift between the ways in which

but i think this question of translation

01:42:40.579 --> 01:42:40.589
but i think this question of translation
 

01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:44.989
but i think this question of translation
of always having knowledge and access is

01:42:44.989 --> 01:42:44.999
of always having knowledge and access is
 

01:42:44.999 --> 01:42:50.750
of always having knowledge and access is
not possible as well you know so you

01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760
not possible as well you know so you
 

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.329
not possible as well you know so you
know in a way I think this question of

01:42:53.329 --> 01:42:53.339
know in a way I think this question of
 

01:42:53.339 --> 01:42:56.079
know in a way I think this question of
things of the information to be

01:42:56.079 --> 01:42:56.089
things of the information to be
 

01:42:56.089 --> 01:43:00.290
things of the information to be
translated in a ways in some aspects

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:00.300
translated in a ways in some aspects
 

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.049
translated in a ways in some aspects
goes against I think some of the

01:43:03.049 --> 01:43:03.059
goes against I think some of the
 

01:43:03.059 --> 01:43:06.259
goes against I think some of the
synthetic choices and in some ways

01:43:06.259 --> 01:43:06.269
synthetic choices and in some ways
 

01:43:06.269 --> 01:43:08.149
synthetic choices and in some ways
political choices are making in the work

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159
