00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.060
Hey guys!

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.080
I'd like to introduce my girlfriend, Jessica.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.760
Hi guys!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.260
Hi.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.820
Oh, Jessica we've heard a lot about you.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.460
Takes a lot to hang with this wild man.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.780
C'mon guys.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.800
We were gonna play "Never Have I Ever."

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.140
Oh, what's that?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.500
You've never played?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.080
Uh, no.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.440
Oh, it's super fun.  So everybody puts their hands up.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.300
And somebody says something they've never done

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.660
and if you've done it you put a finger down.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.800
Okay I'm going to go first.  Never have I ever

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.920
been skydiving.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.920
Woa, both of you?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.680
I never knew that about you.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.120
Yeah, it's super awesome.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.800
Oh, she's a badass chick.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.240
Yeah.  Uh, okay so.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.460
Never have I ever had sex on the beach.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.280
Oh Brad, we've got a wild cat over here.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.840
It was in Ibiza for Spring Break.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.960
You don't have to explain yourself.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.720
We've all been young once, right?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.860
Okay I have never been arrested.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.540
Uh, never have I ever had a PB &amp; J.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.060
Not even once?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.120
No.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.460
Never have I ever peed on someone.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.540
Okay, never have I ever set a public library on fire.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.300
Never have I ever put slugs near but not on

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.540
my vagina.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340
Never have I ever eaten 4 pounds of dog food.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200
Never have I ever read someone's lines

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.420
and discovered that their lives were crossed with mine

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.040
inextricably and killed them.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.000
Never have I ever worked a Summer Program

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.980
for At Rest Teens and convinced them all

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.640
to continue their education.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.340
Never.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.840
Have I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.420
Ever

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.140
President

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.860
Hand model

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.920
Pay for tickles

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.640
Red nephew

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.520
Woa.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.160
You're like the coolest chick I know.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.660
Yeah, I don't know how to process all of this information.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.820
Oh, well you don't have to.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.740
Why?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.040
Uh, never have I ever robbed a bunch of idiots.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.900
Give me your money.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.840
Give me your money.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.160
I like just overdrew my account.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.300
Babe--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
Give me the money.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.720
Okay, all right.  I just took you out to Yogurtland, I--

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.880
Give me.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.740
I can have my dad PayPal you.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.620
That's fine.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.140
My grandfather took this from the war.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.700
Fine I'll take it.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.200
Ok.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.540
Call me.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.880
Wait, me?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.560
Call me!

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.820
Oh...Okay.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.280
You better call her.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.760
Is she gone?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.020
Hey guys!  So that sketch was weird.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.640
But you know, can't be an Anna video without a prop gun in there.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.560
I just wanted to say a few things

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.200
Ghost and Stars was on the red carpet for the Streamy Awards.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.680
VH1 called me one of the best dressed.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.980
And actually you can't see but there's studs on this jacket.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.080
So I have a bunch of new stuff coming out in Fall on Ghost and Stars.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.680
So you should check it out because VH1 really likes it.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.480
Also I have a bunch of new Stand Up shows coming out

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.460
but the one I hope you really come to is on October 6th

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.980
at the Ontario improv.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.520
So this is actually my show.  It's "Anna Akana presents Show and Tell."

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.560
It's all of my favorite Asian female comedians and of course Brad for diversity.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.320
But it's actually like a test run and if it goes well

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.840
I may go on tour across the United States and possibly other countries.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.740
So yeah if you've always wanted to see me do some Stand Up, come on down and check it out.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.680
And finally I want to say thanks so much to Squarespace

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.620
And someone asked me to do it in Marcel The Shell

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.860
so here she goes!

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.040
I want to say thank you to SquareSpace for sponsoring today's episode.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.840

I'm Marcel the Shell.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.200
Oh there's a cat here.  I'll go sit next to the cat and pet it.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.520
I hope it doesn't eat me.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.620
Never have I ever slept inside a refrigerator.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.360
Never have I ever fallen through a skylight when I was spying on my neighbor.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.160
Never have I ever won funniest home videos by getting my balls punched.
