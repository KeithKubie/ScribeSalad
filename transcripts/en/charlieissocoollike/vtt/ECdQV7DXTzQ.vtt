00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
And last but not least in this final installment of Collab Week, 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.850
I am joined by the superlative adjective Tomska, 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.580
and we will be collaborating through the medium of song. 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.470
TOM: I would love to write a song about Google Plus, 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.710
but a song about how we like Google Plus. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.940
CHARLIE: That's not bad. I like the idea that we would write a song 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.740
positively about Google Plus, but we would just be-- 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.320
we can make the subtext of the song of doing it begrudgingly. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.760
TOM: Because we have to. Yeah. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.070
I thought we could use quite a fast and happy song. 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.970
This is quite sad. Google Plus...why? 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.410
[GUITAR PLAYING] Yeah like that.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650
CHARLIE: Writing a song, sometimes that takes all day. 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.580
How long have we got now? 40 minutes. 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.100
TOM: I need you to know that this is the first time I've ever tried to write a song. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.740
CHARLIE: Okay, that's fine. 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.980
TOM: So we're off to a good start. 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.250
So all the metaphors that I can come up with is like 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.160
Google being the guy at the party who keeps like changing the song, 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.620
but it's Google's party so we kind of have to just do it any way. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.590
What was that like do doo da do doo do doo do. 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.350
♪Google Plus. Something, something, something, something. 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.250
CHARLIE: That may be the song. 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.160
TOM: Something, something, something, something. Something fuss? 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.090
CHARLIE: ♪Google Plus. TOM: ♪Something, something, something, something such a fuss.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.480
No that's a start. Maybe we should mention Emma Blackery in this song?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.000
CHARLIE: Yeah. ♪Sorry Emma Blackery made such a fuss.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.320

TOM: Okay. Google Plus. Sorry Emma Blackery made such a fuss.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.680
So we now need to do another "us" thing. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.680

Aw fu-- we're going to have to rhyme "plus" again though. 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.160
