[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.900
JACQUELLINE FULLER: So
I am Jacquelline Fuller,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.740
and I'm president of Google.org,
which is Google's philanthropy.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.380
But I'm here today mostly
because I'm a friend of Justin

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.310
Dillon's.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.500
And so I have the
honor of giving

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.990
just a brief introduction
before we bring him on

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.930
to talk to all of us.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.380
So Justin is one of the coolest
guys I know, and he started out

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.800
as a musician.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.440
He's an artist.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.680
He's also a change agent
who has thought very deeply

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.200
about the issue of
slavery and trafficking

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.989
among poverty and many others.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.030
And we actually partnered
together and really got

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.730
to know each other
when Google.org helped

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.230
with Slavery Footprint, which
was something that his team put

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.400
together to help create a
movement around modern day

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.480
slavery.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.210
And it was just a very simple
tool that allowed consumers

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.200
around the world--

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.810
over 30 million
people, is that right?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.350
To find out how many slaves
were involved in just

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.510
making our lifestyles happen.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.610
What I love about
Justin is, on a topic

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.690
such as that I work with
people across the board,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.290
from policy folks to people
who are on the ground in India

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.320
thinking about issues
like modern day slavery.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.560
But Justin's the kind who comes
to that sort of challenging

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.860
questions and thinks, how can
we address this in the most

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.620
creative way
possible, so that we

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.490
can reach deeply into
everyone's story,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.370
into everyone's
narrative and think

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.870
about inviting them
into a day with purpose,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.610
a life with meaning.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.340
And so that we're not just
talking at them about an issue,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.250
but we're inviting them down
this path and this journey

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.410
where their life also
finds meaning while they're

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.210
helping with this issue.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.440
And that's the topic of the book
that he has written recently.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.860
I read it when it was in the
galley stages and I thought,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.410
this is so incredible.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.740
This book really,
I think, resonates

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.610
with where a lot of us are.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.890
And, in fact, if you look
at happiness research, which

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.464
is kind of a
new-cottage industry--

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:19.630
it's just looking, what
does the data say about what

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.270
makes us content, what
gives us well-being

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.760
and happiness as human beings.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.660
A lot of what we're
learning is actually

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
reflected in that book, and it's
about finding deeper meaning,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.380
about finding purpose in
life through serving others,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.350
through being part of
movements, by being part

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.240
of taking on global challenges.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.140
So I think it's an
incredibly timely book.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.430
I've given it as
gifts to many people,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.110
including my daughters who
are both recently graduated

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.740
from college and really
thinking about vocation in life.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.580
But I'm just really excited
to welcome Justin to the stage

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.420
today, on behalf of Bennett and
many other friends of Justin's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.170
across Google.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.211
JUSTIN DILLON: Thank you.

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:04.830
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Thanks.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.710
JUSTIN DILLON: Awesome.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.580
Thank you so much.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.094
Can you hear me OK?

00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:11.760
I appreciate it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.894
One of the things that I
appreciate most about Google

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.560
is not just your
products, but the phone

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.726
calls that I get to be on,
because every one of them

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.190
is 30 minutes long.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.980
And so I am going to give
that promise back today.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.810
I'm going to do
everything I can to keep

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.560
all of this amazing information
I'm about to give you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.946
within 30 minutes.

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:30.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.720
And we can do Q&amp;A afterwards,
but it's really not going

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.520
to hurt my heart if we don't.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.310
Today we're going to
talk about a few things,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.200
but I promise you
that today we're

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.760
going to tell two stories.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.310
We're going to talk about two
different types of poverties.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.643
And I'm going to offer you
three takeaways for your life

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.780
that actually do
affect your life.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.580
Because I know the
topic of purpose

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.410
seems very meta and out there.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.930
It actually has much more
to do with how you run

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.960
your life than you might think.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.020
I actually believe that the
most powerful force in our lives

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.390
is the lens through
which we see ourselves.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.960
How we view our lives in
relation to how the world works

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.420
is actually nuclear.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.404
It's very, very important
about how we look and see

00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:14.820
how we not only
operate our lives,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.162
but how our lives matter
to those we've never met.

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:19.120
So we're going to talk
a little bit about that.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.390
But first, I want to talk about
one of my most favorite topics,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.990
which is live music.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.150
And I often think, you
know, if there was one show

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.360
that I could have been at,
that I was either too young

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.180
or was not living
in the right time

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.140
and place, what
would that show be?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.530
You know, for me it
was seeing, like,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.920
Led Zeppelin at the Forum,
or getting to see, like,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.170
the Beatles anywhere.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.130
Right?

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.730
Who else?

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.180
What's a show--

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.760
Daniel, I know you.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.500
Who would you--
who didn't you get

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.552
to see that you would
have loved to have seen?

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:53.577
AUDIENCE: Jimi Hendrix.

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:54.410
JUSTIN DILLON: Yeah?

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.010
Where?

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.452
Monterey Jazz, or--
like, the guitar on fire?

00:04:58.452 --> 00:04:59.076
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:59.076 --> 00:04:59.888
Probably Monterey.

00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:00.700
JUSTIN DILLON: OK.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.310
Anyone else?

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.768
Is there a show
that you would have

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:04.700
loved to have seen that
you didn't get to see?

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.500
Yes?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.118
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:09.451
JUSTIN DILLON: Also my favorite.

00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.617
AUDIENCE: Actually, I bought
tickets for my parents,

00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:14.512
but they didn't get
to see [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:16.595
JUSTIN DILLON: There's a
lot of grief in the room.

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:17.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.530
Yeah.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.957
We're going to get through that.

00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:20.290
We're going to get through that.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.873
Well, there was one
show in particular

00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:24.350
that I wish I could have seen.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.530
It was at a place
called Examination Hall,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.840
which is Trinity College
in Dublin, Ireland,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.310
specifically on
October 21, 1977.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.380
And Trinity Hall-- excuse me.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.300
Examination Hall
at Trinity College

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.940
isn't necessarily--
it's not the Forum.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.990
It's not Monterey Jazz.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.610
It's not Oakland Colosseum.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.042
It's actually a room
where students take tests.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:47.500
And it was the room of a very,
very, very important concert

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.000
that actually effected my
life and affected the lives

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.424
of many people that I know.

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.590
And when you think about a
room like this it's like,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.870
got large cathedral halls, it's
very narrow, it's very boring.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.440
But inside this room
on October 21 in 1977

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.444
about 1,200 Dublin
teenagers came in from--

00:06:06.444 --> 00:06:07.110
Dublin, Ireland.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.520
I'm sorry if I didn't tell
you it was Dublin, Ireland--

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.620
but Dublin teenagers
came in to see

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.500
what was to become the
very first punk rock

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.540
show in Ireland.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.649
Now, these kids have given
way-- like every kid,

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:20.440
they're looking for
context in their lives.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.939
They're looking for a way to
express themselves against what

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.280
was going on around them.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.070
And frankly, they
were tired of, like,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.950
handlebar mustaches and
disco polyester pants,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.300
so they did something new.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.120
And they decided
to tear those pants

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.510
and do, like,
Cleopatra-inspired mascara,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.410
and do Anglo-European Mohawks
to be able to go to this show.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.210
It was a big, big, big event.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.580
And more importantly, what
was important to understand

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.500
at the time in Dublin, Ireland--
what was happening in Ireland?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.570
It was a place that was trying
to find its national identity,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.800
really, once again.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.430
You know, just about 88 miles
north of the venue in Belfast

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.620
was a place of, as
many of you know,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.860
fantastic sectarian violence.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.360
There was terrorist attacks,
like, Molotov cocktails,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.910
gunshots.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.520
That was an average Tuesday
for people in the north.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.710
So really Ireland,
at this point,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.080
was a place of trying to
find itself through violence,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.580
through nationalism.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.680
I don't know of any that
sounds familiar to you at all.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.780
But inside this
room these students

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.580
were trying to figure
out who they were.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.320
And the band that was
coming on stage in 1977

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.380
was a new punk band
called The Clash.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.880
Now, if you're under
40 you probably

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.980
don't know who
they are, but this

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.750
was a band that had
only been around

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.150
at this point for
just, like, one year.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.706
And the lead singer--

00:07:42.706 --> 00:07:43.580
I'm not sure if-- oh.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.705
He's the guy in the middle.

00:07:44.705 --> 00:07:46.040
His name is Joe Strummer--

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.620
had actually been born
a child of privilege.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.350
You know, Joe Strummer was a
diplomat's son whose parents

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.420
dropped him off at a--

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.345
basically to be raised
by another school.

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:58.220
And he realized that
privilege wasn't the way

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.540
that he wanted to live.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.270
So when he got
out of high school

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.260
he started living in the
south side of London.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.360
He lived with the
disenfranchised

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.790
and the minorities, and
actually became an advocate

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.540
in his own way.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.630
And his advocacy was to
find a way to play music.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.840
And that's how The
Clash got started.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.140
And so when Joe got
started, really it

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.822
was a way of being able to
express what was inside of him

00:08:20.822 --> 00:08:21.780
and bring it to others.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.730
And punk rock really became
the recipe and The Clash

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.340
were just the chefs.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.400
Now, it's important
to note that what

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.490
was happening behind the band.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.230
And this is obviously
Belfast in 1977.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.690
But this is a
picture of the tour

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.760
in which they were playing at
this time on October 21, 1977.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.220
And what was behind
the band is a backdrop

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.570
of a picture of a
race riot in London.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.200
And this is where
black communities

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.470
were coming together to be able
to stand up for their rights.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.450
And these disenfranchised
minorities

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.540
were really a big part of
who Joe was standing up for

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.100
and The Clash were
standing up for.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.440
In fact, really what's
interesting about the clash

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.740
is that they were a white band
playing to white audiences

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.450
about black music.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.690
And when Joe stepped up to
the mic for the first time,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.684
the crowd went wild because
he yelled out "white riot."

00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:17.225
I'm going to-- I'm
not going to sing.

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:17.750
Don't worry.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.970
Because you don't want that.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.710
But I'm going to
read them to you.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.430
"White riot.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.600
I want a riot.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.000
White riot, a riot of my own.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.190
Black people got
a lot of problems,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.200
but they don't mind
throwing a brick.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.392
White people go to school,
where they teach you

00:09:33.392 --> 00:09:34.100
how to be thick."

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.210
You see, what Joe is saying
to this mainly white audience

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.090
was that black
people have to riot.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.790
They have to riot to survive,
but white people don't.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.290
And as a person who has grown--
he had grown up with privilege.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.040
His message was, if you can't
find your own riot, if you

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.990
can't stand up for
something, you're

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.580
going to live a half life.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.100
You're just going to be
another, in his words,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.980
another "thick" bloke.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.650
His message to everyone,
and our message today,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.930
is to find your riot.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.820
Find something to stand up for.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.330
Find something
bigger than yourself.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.640
Now, back in the back
of Examination Hall

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.220
were four teenagers
who were taking this

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.820
all in as if it
was, like, you know,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:27.177
a messianic prophetic preacher
at a tent evangelist show.

00:10:27.177 --> 00:10:28.760
They were just looking
at this as just

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.970
being blown away at everything
that they were seeing.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.376
And they realized inside
of them that this--

00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:34.640
this was it.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.510
This was their message.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.060
They were going to
find their riot.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.325
And again, you know,
anyone under 40 years old

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:41.700
probably won't
know who they are,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.850
but they were just
here a few months ago.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.730
They went on to become U2.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.230
This band found
their riot, and they

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.110
realized that it wasn't
just about what you do

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.010
and how you live
and what you get,

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.240
but it's about how you leverage
who you are and what you are

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.050
and what you're good at for
the problems of other people

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.700
who can never repay you.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.740
Purpose isn't
happiness, and we're

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.150
going to talk a little bit
further about that today.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.992
But these lads were
able to find it,

00:11:14.992 --> 00:11:16.200
were able to find their riot.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.440
"Purpose" is a big
word, and it's one

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.290
that I think we don't
pay enough attention to.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.590
I actually believe that we're
living in a global purpose

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.700
crisis.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.610
Only today we have infinite
suitors coming at us

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.050
at all times of the
day promising purpose,

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.120
but in reality we're just
being offered amusement.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.210
You see, many of us have
reached the very top

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.780
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs
and we're no longer foraging

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.490
for food and for shelter.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.800
We're forging for something
that matters in our lives.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.760
I think this guy said it best.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.302
"He who has a why
can endure any how."

00:11:58.302 --> 00:12:01.074
And I actually believe that
standing up for something

00:12:01.074 --> 00:12:02.490
that you want
changed in the world

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.150
is actually not noble
or selfless or otherly

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.010
or something to be respected.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.640
It's actually selfish, and
it's actually survival.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.640
Because the only way that
you're going to be able to find

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.770
true purpose is to take
on the problems of others.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.270
You see, in this equation
purpose is our why to live,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.390
not just our how.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.250
We're handling
everythings every day.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.095
The promise is how to be helpy--

00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:33.450
the promises how to be happy--

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.870
and helpy-- and these are
our how, but they're not--

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.330
they're not our why.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.990
And the pursuit of happiness
is pretty straightforward.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.760
It's found through
acquiring and achieving.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.725
But how do we find our why?

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:47.850
How do we find our purpose?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.950
I've had a book out
for a few months

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.804
and, you know, you don't
really pay attention

00:12:55.804 --> 00:12:57.720
to the people who you
don't know that read it.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.200
You pay attention to the people
who you do know who read it.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.987
And specifically you
really pay attention

00:13:02.987 --> 00:13:05.070
to the people who you do
know who haven't read it,

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.653
because that's where
it gets personal.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.540
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.287
And one person in particular--
and I actually have to say,

00:13:11.287 --> 00:13:12.620
this friend of mine is someone--

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.520
I won't say who he is--

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.645
he's actually someone I
kind of wrote the book for.

00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:19.040
Like, the archetype,
the type of person.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.650
And he told me-- he's like, you
know, this is great and all,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.464
but I've got,
like, bills to pay,

00:13:23.464 --> 00:13:25.130
and I've got kids to
get through school,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.510
and I've got all the rest of it.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.760
And purpose and
meaning, frankly--

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.650
they sound otherly.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.824
They sound meta.

00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:32.490
I hear people tell
me this all the time.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.100
It's like, yeah, I'll--

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.680
eventually I'll buy a Tesla,
but it's not for right now.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.900
That's what purpose is.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.790
It's a Tesla in
most people's lives.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.890
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.310
This is because we think
of an understanding

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.620
that the why of our life,
the pursuit of meaning,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.920
is somehow extra, something
that we can figure out

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.440
once we have our how,
once we have everything

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.170
that we feel like we need.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.670
There's lots of
definitions for purpose,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.310
but this is the one that
I find the most helpful.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.350
Purpose isn't how much you can
give or what you can donate

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.880
or what cause you're
associated with.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.860
Listen to this.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:15.730
It's finding what the world
needs from you, finding out

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.040
what the world needs from you.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.650
Here's the thing.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.870
Charity is going to tell you--

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.850
and I've run one for 10 years--

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.480
will tell you that
the world needs

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.610
you to give to support that.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.860
I actually don't believe that.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.080
They need you to give, and
it is extremely important

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.820
that we all support charities.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.660
But that's not purpose.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.930
You were designed to fix
problems in the world.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:44.120
If you aren't fixing your own
needs of just having to put

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.490
a roof over your head
and food on the plate,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.620
you're actually designed--
and your purpose--

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.830
is to fix the needs and
fix the problems of others.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.910
It's not ancillary.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.770
It's actually a big,
big part of your why.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.840
So the point of my book
and the point of my talk

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.890
is to try to solve a
lot of problems at once.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.840
What if we could change the
world and improve our lives?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.480
You see, my friend who
doesn't have time for this,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.840
he just needs to make them--
he's got problems in his life.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.900
Those are more important.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.270
And frankly, I don't
argue with him.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.360
But he's missing out,
because he doesn't know

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.710
what the world needs from him.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.070
What if we could solve
our "how to live" problems

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.640
while also solving our
"why am I here" problems,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.520
while also solving
the problems of others

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.700
who can never pay us back?

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.130
In my book I propose
a model to be

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.840
able to help us understand this.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.610
And I've actually
arranged all of humanity

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.990
into two different groups, two
different types of poverties.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.030
The first poverty is
a poverty of means.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.900
This is the poverty that
most of us are familiar with.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.300
This is the poverty
that we see on our feeds

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.710
and we see in the news.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.240
We know what this
poverty looks like.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.907
But I've put a word next to it
that I think is helpful for us

00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:05.490
to understand.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.470
And Jacquelline was
talking earlier about,

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.720
in some ways, how
I see the world.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.140
The word "means" is very,
very important here.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.670
"Means" actually means
an action or a system

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.550
by which a result
is brought about.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.050
OK.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.850
So to bring that down,
a "poverty of means"

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.210
simply means that there's
an action or a system that's

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.790
missing.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.880
Poverty is no longer
just about a condition.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.640
Right?

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.170
It's that something's missing.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.400
So when we say that there's
844 million people who

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.640
don't have access to clean
water, what we're saying

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.990
is there's a poverty of means
to wells to offer clean water.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:52.499
When we say there's 400 million
people that are suffering just

00:16:52.499 --> 00:16:54.290
for basic health, we're
saying that there's

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.610
a poverty of means to medicine
and care to that health.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.330
When we say that there's 40
million people plus living

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:07.081
in slavery today, it's a
poverty of means of justice.

00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:08.680
Now, this is the
poverty of means

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.480
that I wrestle with every
day, the poverty of justice.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.970
We're missing an
action or a system

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.740
where there should be one.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.800
My day job is to build a
means and to fix a system that

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.380
allows children to be
exploited every day in order

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.800
to support our lifestyles.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.310
Slavery is reprehensible.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.030
And it actually needs
more than our attention

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.770
and our care and our reposts.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.080
It's a thriving business
and it's a moral outrage,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.670
because it's a
system that works.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.160
So it needs an action or a
system to make it stop working.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.880
This is extremely evident
when I visit places

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.400
like Ghana out on Lake
Volta and I meet little boys

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.390
like this, Ebenezer, who
works on a boat every day

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.536
for 17 hours a
day to catch fish.

00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:03.410
He's controlled by a.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.420
Master Ebenezer is suffering
a poverty of means.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.400
And so is his little
brother, who's

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.780
asleep at the top of the boat.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.580
And when I talked
to his master--

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.230
who is in the red
shirt-- and I ask him

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.680
why is this little
boy working and not

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.160
in school, his answer to
me is, if he doesn't work,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.380
I don't eat.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.090
I'm sorry, but that's
also a poverty of means.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.070
So you can get how slavery
is a hot mess on this planet,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.170
and it needs more
than just donations.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.520
It needs a system, and it
needs an action to break it.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.990
And it's heartbreaking.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.400
But our breaking
hearts aren't enough.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.530
It actually needs us to step in.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.390
The other poverty that
I want to talk about

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.480
is also fantastically-insidious.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.080
It's a poverty of meaning.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.690
This is a poverty
that many of us--

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.060
some of us, and certainly
people we know--

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.490
are living beneath
its poverty line.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.810
It's not one that people
talk about very often,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.544
but it still claims lives.

00:19:06.544 --> 00:19:07.710
I'm going to say that again.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.670
It claims the lives of
thousands of people every year.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.410
It causes disease,
uproots communities,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.040
and has even played a role in
creating a few wars or two.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.290
While it doesn't rob us of
food or water or medicine

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.220
or justice, it steals something
that's very valuable to us all.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.900
We already saw it.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.150
It steals our why.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.810
It takes away our why to live.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.380
And as we learned earlier,
it's difficult to know

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.400
how to live if we don't
have a why, if we don't know

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.190
what the world needs from us.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.340
What's scary is that many of us
are scraping by in our lives,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.120
unaware that this poverty
is eating at our heels.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.160
While it doesn't take
nearly the amount of lives

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.970
a year that the poverty of
means takes, it's still lethal.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.100
And we can see it.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.220
Maybe not directly, but
indirectly in the data,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.700
where 50% of people on social
media between 18 and 34

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.300
feel ugly and
worthless and otherly.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.290
And 30% of those people feel
extreme amounts of loneliness.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.540
In fact, one in five
people in America

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.110
feel extremely and
debilitatingly lonely.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.110
And all the data that's
coming out on loneliness

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.230
is directing-- is saying
to us, that it's actually

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.850
creating health problems,
heart disease, diabetes.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.680
These things are connected.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.930
Meaning and health and
wealth and how we live

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.460
are all connected.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.530
If we don't know
our why and we don't

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.250
know what the world wants from
us, in some ways we perish.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:51.080
Not just existentially,
literally perish.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.130
If anyone understands this
existential and physical

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:00.410
perishing best it's Dr. Frankl.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.010
Dr. Frankl understood this
need better than anyone,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.780
because he wrote in
his popular book,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.670
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.649
If you read it you'll learn
that he was a psychiatrist.

00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:11.690
It's a very popular book.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.356
You might have already
actually read it.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.860
He was a psychiatrist around
World War II that ended up

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.270
in a concentration camp.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.910
And he tasked himself
to save the people who

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.590
were killing themselves.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.960
And he knew he could
tell when someone

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.860
was going to kill themselves
because they started

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.960
smoking their cigarettes.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.790
You see, cigarettes
in concentration camps

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.610
were currency.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.600
You didn't smoke them.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.720
You traded them for things
you needed like food or a day

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.420
off from work.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.450
But when you started smoking
the only thing of value

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.370
you have in your
life, Dr. Frankl

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.290
knew that they were close
to committing suicide.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.760
And his primary argument
with every one of them

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.790
was that the world needed
something for them.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.260
There was still something that
the world needed from them.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.010
It was his main argument
inside of a concentration camp

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.300
to help people understand
not just a poverty of means,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.450
but their own
poverty of meaning.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.860
His message, like
Joe's, is the same.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.960
The world wants
something from you.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.070
The world wants your riot.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.830
It wants you to know.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.890
It wants to know what you
care about, and actually

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.751
wants you to act on it.

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:35.250
If we don't find our riot, we
suffer and the world around us

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.000
misses a chance to improve.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.040
Your riot is the voice
inside of you that says,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.060
I wish something was
different in the world.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.350
Now, I found my
riot later in life.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.660
I came upon the issue
of human trafficking

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.080
and it hijacked my heart.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.790
And I had every opportunity to
keep moving with what was then

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.610
a music career.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.410
But I said, you know, I just--

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.937
I'm going to give this
thing that's inside of me

00:22:59.937 --> 00:23:00.770
a little bit of gas.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.580
Not a lot.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.060
I don't want to change my life.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.460
I don't to do this
for 10 years--

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.360
even though I have.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.429
I don't want to do that.

00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:07.220
I'm just going to--

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.960
I'm just going to lob
one over the fence.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.340
I want to try something.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.370
Because what I saw working
around this issue 10 years ago,

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.794
what I saw people doing,
frankly didn't seem like enough.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.960
And at the time I was a
part of the music community.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.230
I'm like, well, can't have
a movement without music.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:22.880
Let's get it on.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.090
And so I pulled a bunch of
musicians together during

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.530
Grammys week in 2007
and I said, let's--

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.520
here was my business plan.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.550
Let's make some-- let's
film some performances

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.399
and then let's give them away,
and we'll talk about slavery

00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:37.940
on top of it.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.050
That was my business plan.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.120
And actually people agreed.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.540
And so people came to a
studio in Santa Monica

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.790
and filmed these beautiful
performances for me

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.410
that I had no idea
what to do with.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.450
And after two days of
filming I'm like, wow,

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.500
that went really good.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.000
Like, people really
love doing this.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.830
Guess what?

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.260
People actually love doing what
they're good at to help others.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.680
I think we're on to something.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.440
And so I decided to do it again.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.420
I did it in New York, and
then in Austin, in London.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.550
And all these musicians
started coming together.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.470
And then I thought, well, we
should get some smart people

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.460
to talk about it.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.800
So let's call up Nick
Kristof and Dr. Cornel West

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.380
and Madeline Albright.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.690
And I quickly learned how,
you know, films like Borat

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.730
get made because no one checks.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.650
They let you in to
interview people.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.640
It's amazing.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.570
They check now.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.100
But no one checked
back then, and I

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.230
was able to interview
these very important people

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.700
and learn something
and allow them

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.850
to contribute their voices.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.020
We made a movie, and the
movie went through theaters.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.270
Now I'm two years in.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.720
My music career is way
behind me at this point.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.250
And then we make some websites,
like Slavery Footprint.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.710
And then we make
some documentaries,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.090
and on and on it goes.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.830
And people continue
to get involved.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.530
And then we made
something really exciting,

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.740
Enterprise Software.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.310
(WHISPERING) Oh my gosh.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.140
Enterprise software that
helps businesses identify

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.320
forced labor in
their supply chains.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.870
In 10 years.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.950
Folks, I used to count to
four and rhyme for a living.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.870
That was music.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.960
When you reach out and you
take a step towards your riot,

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.080
you have no idea what
you're capable of.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.160
You have no idea how
powerful your how

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.740
operates in this world.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.290
That is how you find
purpose, by taking

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.640
on the problems of others who
can not ever possibly pay you

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.300
back.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.161
I want to talk about
how to find your riot.

00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:43.660
You know, we hear
this all the time.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.609
It's like, that's great,
find your purpose,

00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:46.400
all the rest of it.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.620
Not very many
people give us a way

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.900
in which we can take
a step towards that.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:58.900
And I want to introduce you
to someone who, to me, just

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.847
lives finding a riot
better than anyone else.

00:26:00.847 --> 00:26:02.680
It's probably someone
you've never heard of.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.810
Her name is Alice
Harris, and she grew up

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.700
in the late 19th century.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:12.250
And her dream-- her dream was
to be a missionary to Africa.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.140
She met a man,
John, and they got

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.140
sent to what was then the free
state of Congo, which happened

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.240
to be a territory in Africa
that was not yet colonized,

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.930
one of the largest territories
in Africa around 1900.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.740
And there they did their
missionary work, very noble

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.361
work.

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.110
Actually, it was a
part of a larger system

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.060
because at the time
there was a lot of work

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.070
to be able to help
educate and bring science

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.790
to the region, which actually
turned out to be a ploy.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.040
But they were doing their bit.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.664
They were doing what
they were good at,

00:26:44.664 --> 00:26:47.070
and they were doing their
life the way they saw fit.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.580
And one day when John
was away on business,

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.730
her husband was
away on business--

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.770
they had no children.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.220
When John was away on business
one of the local tribes-people

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.097
came to her door and said,
I really want to see you.

00:26:58.097 --> 00:26:59.430
I want to see you, specifically.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.140
His name was Nasala.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.140
And Nasala came up and said,
I have something to show you.

00:27:07.402 --> 00:27:09.860
And she came and he set it out
and he brought this plantain

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.900
leaf, and he set it
out onto her veranda.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.590
He's like, I need you
to see what's happening.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.490
And so she walked
up and it's really--

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.470
let me go back here.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.310
As she came upon the
open plantain leaf

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.060
that Nasala brought she realized
that it was the severed hand

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.710
and foot of his daughter.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.680
I'm going to stop there and
tell you why that happened.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.630
See, over in Belgium
there was this mad King

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.850
called King Leopold II.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.170
And he was very jealous of all
the other leaders in Europe

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.020
because everyone else got to
colonize Africa and he didn't.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.470
And actually, colonization
at this point in history--

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.150
people were starting
to look down on it.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.640
Slavery is kind of illegal-ish.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.310
And so he had to figure out a
way to get his own land grab.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.650
So he created a
company, basically

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.260
an institute, that was able
to go in and quote unquote,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.995
"bring science and education"
to this entire region.

00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:09.230
But what it really
was was a ploy

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.290
to be able to start pulling
out the natural resources that

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.520
were in the Congo.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.660
And he named it the Free State
of Congo, believe it or not.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.310
And what he did was he set up a
police force called the "Force

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.950
Publique" who would
go out and take land

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.840
from local tribes-people
and then force

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.810
them to work the land.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.090
And, in fact, what
they were really

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.190
finding was-- one of the
hottest commodities that

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.800
was coming out of Congo
at this time was rubber.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.990
And rubber was in big
demand because bike tires

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.540
and automobiles were just
really getting started.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.910
And basically what
Leopold was doing

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.910
was creating this illicit
business in slavery

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.430
and just making a fortune.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.590
But he was a total cheapskate.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.450
Total cheapskate.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.720
He wanted an accounting
of every single bullet

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.220
that his force used.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.240
So he required them--

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.740
because he was
afraid that they were

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.323
going to go out and use bullets
to go hunt game for themselves

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:02.287
and whatnot.

00:29:02.287 --> 00:29:04.620
So what he required-- if
you're going to shoot a bullet,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.900
I need to see a hand
or a foot to prove

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.139
that you killed someone.

00:29:09.139 --> 00:29:11.180
And the Force Publique
got kind of smart about it

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.990
and so they figured, well, let's
just get ahead of the game.

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.120
Let's go hack off hands
and feet and get ahead.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.786
That way our accounting
system will work

00:29:16.786 --> 00:29:19.180
when we come back at the end.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.370
And that's how you
get Nasala's story.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.240
So here Alice is looking at
what's happening on her door,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.920
on that veranda, on those
steps, in that moment

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.630
she found her riot.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.920
She found her purpose.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.210
And here's the takeaway.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.800
This is what she did.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.830
She walked back inside, she
grabbed the coolest thing

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:44.310
she had, which was a Kodak
brownie camera, which

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.200
was the coolest piece of tech
you could have at the time,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.007
and it was affordable,
that she took that picture.

00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:52.840
I'll show you again.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.900
And she didn't stop there.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.920
She went on taking
more and more pictures.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.020
And she started documenting
the atrocities that

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.270
were happening all over Congo.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.552
No one else was doing
this at the time.

00:30:09.552 --> 00:30:13.560
And she realized that something
inside of her was happening.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.960
Guess what she didn't do?

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.260
She didn't ask
anyone's permission.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.090
Don't you think
you'd want permission

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.150
to go try to take down
a European leader?

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.710
That sounds like
something you would

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.790
want to call in a professional
for, or get something

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.920
a little bit bigger than a
demure missionary from England.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.310
But she kept going.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.650
And then she realized, in
order to get the word out--

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.606
because Leopold was fighting her
left and right in the papers,

00:30:40.606 --> 00:30:42.230
keeping her pictures
from getting out--

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.530
so she said forget it.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.180
I'm going to go
on a magic lantern

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:49.960
tour-- which is essentially the
1900s version of PowerPoint.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.752
And she took her pictures
all around America, all

00:30:52.752 --> 00:30:54.210
around England,
and started getting

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.330
the attention of Mark
Twain and the president

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.860
and the Queen of England with
a very short amount of time.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.930
His entire reign was
shut down, and he

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:09.240
was no longer able to
exploit the people of Congo.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.190
This one woman found her
riot, and took a step,

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.870
and was able to change an entire
system, a poverty of means,

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.770
purely because she was
able to do something

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.080
without permission.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.477
So the takeaway that
I give you today

00:31:27.477 --> 00:31:29.060
is that, when you
look for your riot--

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.090
my right is obviously
human trafficking.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.984
Our riots don't need to
be in a faraway place.

00:31:34.984 --> 00:31:36.650
Your riot-- the thing
that could bug you

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.870
is the fact that not enough
kids in your neighborhood

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.129
have parents helping
them with their homework

00:31:41.129 --> 00:31:43.670
because they all work and have
two jobs and they're too busy.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.440
That's a riot.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.590
It doesn't have to be
something this big.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.270
And if it's a thing
that bothers you,

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.100
if it's a thing inside
of you that says,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.490
I wish the world was this
way, I want to challenge you.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.140
You might be the one to fix it.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.560
She could have left Nasala
on the porch and said,

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.670
I'm so sorry.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.910
I'll go write a letter.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.320
I'll do what I can.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.260
Instead, she grabbed
what she already had,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.590
the talent and the skills
and the possessions

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.870
that she already had, and
started working on it.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.640
Anyone-- anyone in here
can find their riot

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.040
and act on it as long as they
don't ask permission and just

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.310
choose to use what
you already have.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.580
When Dr. King gave his
message at Oberlin College

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.560
he spoke to this
need for meaning.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:39.560
He called it an inescapable
network of mutuality.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.160
And he said that, I am not who
I am supposed to be until you

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.834
are who you're supposed to be.

00:32:44.834 --> 00:32:46.250
And you're not who
you're supposed

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.860
to be until the
person next to you

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.690
is who they're supposed to be.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.480
And in a global village
like we live in today,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.370
that axiom is true
on a global scale.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.120
We actually find ourselves
when we give ourselves

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.710
away to people's problems
who can never pay us back.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.710
That is your path
to purpose, and that

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.145
is how you find your riot.

00:33:10.145 --> 00:33:12.520
And I want to thank you all
for letting me have this time

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.436
to be able to do this.

00:33:13.436 --> 00:33:14.314
Thank you so much.

00:33:14.314 --> 00:33:17.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.090
So thank you.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.880
So, Ben is the one
that set this up.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.030
Thank you so much.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.631
Your love.

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:29.130
This is somebody
who found his riot,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.510
and is a living
example of someone who

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.800
makes a difference
every day, and I

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.930
want to thank you for that.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.090
You know, shake it off.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.207
You're just doing--

00:33:35.207 --> 00:33:37.592
AUDIENCE: Any questions
for the author here?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
and for the very inspiring

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:46.870
talk.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.100
I wanted to get your
perspective on kind

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.460
of finding the right riot and
kind of the anaylsis paralysis

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.700
of waiting for the right
one, or just doing something.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.730
And it comes from
the perspective of,

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.640
one's life gives you
a lot of training.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.040
Sometimes it takes long to
find something that says, hey,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.940
this is really using the
most leverage that I got.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.000
So I struggle a lot-- and
probably others-- like,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.820
sometimes I feel like I'm
waiting for that bigger thing.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.270
And the motivation for
that is, like, maybe it

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:22.215
is wasted that I just
help in some capacity that

00:34:22.215 --> 00:34:24.600
didn't use all their
unique skills and stuff

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.969
that life has given me.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.510
So I just wanted to
get your thoughts

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:33.870
on how do you feel one can
maybe go through that process

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:38.229
where ultimately you end up
using all of what you've got.

00:34:38.229 --> 00:34:39.270
And how do you get there?

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.730
Like, do you start very
small and then grow to it?

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.929
Or do you--

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:44.502
I don't know.

00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:46.710
I keep on thinking of, quote
unquote, your "strategy"

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.260
and your large-scale,
high-impact

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.159
so on-- and so forth.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.380
So I was just curious how--

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.889
Or, if you think, hey,
maybe you shouldn't

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:56.030
use all of your skill.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.330
It's OK just to underutilize
maybe what life has given you,

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.180
and it's also OK.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.930
So--

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.763
JUSTIN DILLON: Yeah.

00:35:01.763 --> 00:35:04.990
Those are great questions.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:08.200
I actually believe that
change happens at small scale.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.990
Part of the thing about writing
a book and putting movies out--

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.500
it just-- it makes it
seem really glamorous.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.477
And I'm fortunate to have my
favorite person in the world,

00:35:17.477 --> 00:35:18.310
my wife, here today.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.434
And she can attest to you
that there is just, like,

00:35:20.434 --> 00:35:25.150
very little glamor in
trying to change the world.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.700
It is a million small steps in
trying to make a difference.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.590
And also doing things that
you are interested in, but

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.672
aren't necessarily good at.

00:35:34.672 --> 00:35:37.130
I mean, does Google still have
that thing where you-- like,

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.450
what, 20% or 30% of time to
work on things that-- really?

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.521
Do you use it?

00:35:42.521 --> 00:35:45.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.480
Because, you know,
some great things

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.799
have come out of that model.

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:52.340
And I would argue that there's
some very, very talented folks

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:52.840
here.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.740
And if you've got that
level and that wide

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.240
of a berth of the
opportunity to try things,

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.420
I think you can create
some wonderful things here

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.360
with this network.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.840
But again-- and I know it's
weird to say this to Google,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.830
but I really do think
you have to think small.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.330
You know?

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:13.190
Like, people come to me all the
time, like, let's do a concert,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.410
or let's create an
app that ends slavery.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.230
It's like, you know, let's
just get a few companies

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.040
to look at their supply chain.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.330
Wow, that's boring.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.719
My goodness is it so impactful.

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.010
We're not, like, playing with
thousands of dollars now.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.970
We're playing with billions.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:29.470
You know?

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.230
But it's not-- it's
not as sexy as, like--

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.330
so I think that we really
do need to scale back

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.199
our ambitions around what
something looks like and put

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:38.740
more of our ambition
on, like, what's

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.035
something that can
just help out a little?

00:36:41.035 --> 00:36:44.200
You know, helping out a
kid with their homework

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.420
seems like a little,
but it's a lot.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.729
It's fantastic.

00:36:47.729 --> 00:36:49.270
So I think we have
to kind of divorce

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:54.010
ourselves from the idea that
all change is glamorous.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.510
I was just wondering how
you measure your impact?

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.180
Is it, like, in a
financial system

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.810
as we are currently used to?

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:11.190
You know, like, by quarter by
quarter, this kind of stuff?

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.670
Or do you base as well
with public policies,

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.985
implementations, for example?

00:37:14.985 --> 00:37:17.610
With sustainable development
goals for the UN--

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.790
I used to work for the UN and
then I moved to go Google.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.920
I did some partnerships
back in Brazil

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.090
with indigenous communities.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.080
But then I see our public
policies going backwards.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.740
You know?

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.340
Like, I see the indigenous
rights in Brazil, for example,

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.470
you know, being disrespected.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.559
So I'm glad to hear from
you as well about that.

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:38.392
JUSTIN DILLON: Yeah.

00:37:38.392 --> 00:37:43.740
I think change is juggling
chainsaws and walking.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.450
That's what it looks like.

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.570
Because one chain
saw is public policy,

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.290
one chain saw is
the marketplace,

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.350
one chain saw is the
economy of attention.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.460
It's very expensive to get into.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.990
It isn't just one thing.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.120
And over the last
10 years we've seen

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.110
enormous growth, an enormous
difference made around slavery.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.030
But I can't tell you
how many rooms I've

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.360
been in-- important
rooms, like, you know,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.100
rooms you've heard
of where people

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.800
slam their hand on the table and
say, you're not doing enough,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.860
and then they go back to
their pulpit or they go back

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.520
to their desk and go
back on with their job.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.870
Because people expect, when
something's really bad,

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.680
like slavery, that it should
just be fixed very easily.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.340
It's entrenched in
everything we do.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.350
And so it requires some move--

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.990
a little bit of
movement on policy.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.760
Some movement in
the marketplace.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.970
Some movement around consumers,
I mean, in the work that we do.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.040
And I would assume it's
the same everywhere else.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.142
For us we had to, like, roll
it all back as a company.

00:38:46.142 --> 00:38:48.350
We had to roll it all back
to, like, what does change

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.230
look like for us?

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.730
Oh.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:50.510
Guess what?

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.800
It's really boring.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.870
It actually means
how many companies

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.000
are looking at how
many of their suppliers

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.500
and measuring where slavery
might be in that supply chain?

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.056
And it turns out
that, as we started

00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:04.430
moving towards that as a
company and trying to figure out

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.638
how to measure that-- because
you can't fix a problem

00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:07.430
you can't measure.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:12.110
And to my knowledge there has
been no census on slaves since,

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:15.130
like, maybe 150 years ago.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.849
So how do you
measure a problem--

00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:18.640
how do you fix a problem
you can't measure?

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.830
So we're measuring
it for companies

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.960
and actually giving them a way
to be able to step forward.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.280
[SNAPS] Now the lights went on.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.810
Now we can actually
look at how we

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.180
can fix a problem that's
been with us for a long time

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.960
and probably will continue.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.725
So it does take a
bit of iteration,

00:39:30.725 --> 00:39:32.100
but I think
sometimes people just

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.860
go hard on public policy
being-- oh, if we can just get

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.570
a law passed, that'll be it.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.270
And it's just-- that's
just one chainsaw.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.160
My opinion.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.100
Did all of those, like,
weird metaphors help at all?

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.060
Because I have a--

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.600
I don't get the sense they did.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.390
We can sidebar.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:51.290
Yeah.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:55.130
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.200
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
the supply chain for companies.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.510
Where is your company
going and where do you

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.540
need the help in
your company itself?

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.090
JUSTIN DILLON: We just
need as many companies

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.335
using our software as possible.

00:40:08.335 --> 00:40:09.710
We're the only
software out there

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.350
that can measure slavery
beyond the first-tier supplier.

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.689
And actually most
people will say, oh,

00:40:14.689 --> 00:40:16.730
we're talking to all of
our first-tier suppliers.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.470
There's 10,000 or 20,000.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.320
They're all good.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.200
It's usually not where
the problems are.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.300
We actually need
to be able to use

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.040
optics, the optics
we provide, to be

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.860
able to push beyond tier-one
and understand where

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.440
the problems are, and get those
relationships between buyer

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.380
and seller to kind of push
further and change behavior

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.400
in the supply chain.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.010
And we're seeing it happen
at a very large scale.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.010
But it is going to take the
coalition of the willing,

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.710
so to speak, in the marketplace
to all work together.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.264
And in a competitive marketplace
where one company doesn't

00:40:45.264 --> 00:40:47.930
want to share all their secrets,
this isn't something you want--

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.030
I'd like for people to be
competitive on slavery.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.880
But competitive on
knowing where it is

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.810
and ending it-- that's the best
way to be competitive on this.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.570
Yeah.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.170
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:00.930
Thanks everyone
who are watching.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.340
If you want to get the book--

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.640
there's some books in the back.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.760
There's books online.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.820
"A Selfish Plan to
Change the World."

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.566
Thanks, man.

00:41:07.566 --> 00:41:08.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Justin.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.381
JUSTIN DILLON: Thank you.

00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:12.160
[APPLAUSE]
