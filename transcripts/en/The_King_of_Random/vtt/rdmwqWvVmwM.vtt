We've got a cool experiment coming
to us from a YouTube comment

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.860
We've got a cool experiment coming
to us from a YouTube comment

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.940
from someone using the
name Rick Harrison asking,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.180
"What would happen if we pour
liquid nitrogen onto lava?"

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.240
I have no idea if this is the actual
Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.070
but we're going to try it
because it's cool experiment,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.320
not because of who asked.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.240
[Music]

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.989
We've got our arc furnace all set up.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.150
We've got some pieces of lava rock,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.239
and we've got a dewer
full of liquid nitrogen.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.489
I've got a safety mask,
thick old gloves,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.580
and everything is set up
to try and make some lava.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.340
The idea here is pretty simple.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.890
We're gonna melt down some
lava rock in our arc furnace,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.340
and then we're going to try
pouring it into a bowl of liquid nitrogen.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.100
After that, we'll melt
down a little bit more,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.200
and see what happens if we pour
the liquid nitrogen onto the lava.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.760
Grant has had some
other videos showing

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.649
how he went about
making this arc furnace,

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.089
but the basic idea
is that when it's turned on,

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.640
when you get these
two leads together,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
they begin to arc,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.789
and you can then control where it
blasts thousands of degrees of heat,

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.629
and it's enough to melt down most
kinds of metal and most types of rock.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.820
We've had one experiment before where
we did melt some of this lava rock down,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.680
and were able to pour it
out into some sand,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.360
and that's basically
what we want to do again,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.180
except this time,
instead of pouring it in the sand,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.940
we want to pour it
into liquid nitrogen.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:20.820
[Music]

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.800
All right,
let's melt some lava rock.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:02:02.700
[Music]

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.060
We kind of go through
those little glass dishes.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.780
They're cheap.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.780
That was cool.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300
All right, so that was...

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.300
I don't know.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.360
Looks like about
half a teaspoon of lava

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780
being poured down
into some liquid nitrogen,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.440
and it definitely made
the liquid nitrogen

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.780
start boiling like most things do.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.880
Then of course,
it hit the glass,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.140
and there is a huge heat difference

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.880
between the hundreds of
degrees below zero nitrogen,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.580
and the probably thousands of
degrees above zero liquid lava,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.200
and the glass couldn't
take quite that much stress.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880
All sorts of fun noises
from our crucible

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.840
as the lava inside
cools back down,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.560
and contracts a little bit.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.310
We tried pouring a little bit of
our lava into some liquid nitrogen,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.980
and it cooled it down rapidly,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.220
broke the container it was in,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.450
but now we're going
to try the opposite,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.020
and try pouring some
liquid nitrogen into our lava.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:20.020
[Music]

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.800
Lava and liquid nitrogen.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.630
Obviously, we only have the ability to
create very small amounts of lava

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.959
with the tools we have here,

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.390
but I'd be pretty interested
to see this experiment scaled up

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.780
to the point where
we could really pour

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720
a good amount of
lava into something.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.840
You're gonna have to
research the best way to do that.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.780
Pouring our lava into the liquid nitrogen,

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.680
it cooled down rapidly forming
these little black glass beads,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.420
and pouring the liquid nitrogen
onto our lava, it did cool down,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.240
but not as fast as I thought it would.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.990
I went through about a cup of
liquid nitrogen pouring it on,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.660
and the lava inside was solidified,
but it was still glowing orange.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.640
So it had a ton of heat in it.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.280
Keeping in mind that so far,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.660
we only had the ability to
make very small amounts of lava,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.080
are there any other things
you'd like to see us do with it?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.080
We can get maybe a teaspoon
of lava to pour out of this thing.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.400
One of the main restrictions is
that as we use the arc furnace,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.720
it heats up the carbon rods,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.959
and then the heat even begins
to go into the vice grips

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.620
that the carbon rods are attached to.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.920
So after not too long,
it gets too hot,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.200
even through my thick
leather furnace gloves.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.840
That limits how long
we can keep it going,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.440
and how much lava we can make.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.600
But with that amount of lava,

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.150
is there anything cool you'd
like to see us pour it on to?

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.100
