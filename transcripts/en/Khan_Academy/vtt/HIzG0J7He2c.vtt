00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
All right, we are on
problem number 17.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.600
I think my pen is too thick.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.380
There you go.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.310
We were on problem 17, and I
think I did a good job of

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.800
confusing you at the end
of the last video.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.870
So I'm going to, to some degree,
start from scratch.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.750
So I've left what I drew last
time where we had this graph

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.610
that they did on problem 17.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.840
And they said that this is the
graph of y equals f of x.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.330
And they said, which of the
following could be used to get

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.050
the graph of y is equal
to f of x plus 2?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.410
So they want us to graph,
essentially, y is equal to f

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.460
of x plus 2.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.480
And just so we don't get
confused with the y's and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.510
stuff, I'm going to define a
new function called g of x.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.850
Hopefully this will not confuse
you and just simplify

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.530
some things.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.900
And I'll call it g of x is
equal to f of x plus 2.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.570
And I did that because I
didn't want 2 y's here.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.410
I want you to realize that this
is a different function,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.860
and these aren't the same
function or the same y.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.300
So I'm going to define a new
function called g of x is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.070
equal to f of x plus 2.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.660
So first let's just write a
little table that maybe we can

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.210
understand a little
bit about f of x.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.570
We know a couple things.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.250
When x is 0, f of x is 1.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.910
When x is 1, f of x is 0.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.990
We know that, right?

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.195
So let's do another
table for g of x.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.240
So let's do x, g of x.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.290
So now let's think about it in
a slightly different, almost

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.940
in a reverse way.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.100
We know a couple of values.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.320
We know what f of 0 is, right?

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.070
We know f of 0, and we
know f of 1, right?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.720
We're given it right here.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.710
We know f of 0 is equal
to 1, and we know f of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.330
1 is equal to 0.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.890
Now what value do I have to
stick into g of x for

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.990
x to get f of 0?

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.860
Well I said g of x is equal
to f of x plus 2, right?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.330
So to get f of 0, I need to
put a negative 2 in here.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.990
g of negative 2 is equal to f
of minus 2 plus two, which

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.060
equals f of 0, right?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.180
So this is g of minus 2.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.280
It's the same thing as f of 0.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.740
And so x is just minus 2.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.310
So when x is minus 2, g of
x is equal to 1, right?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.180
x is minus 2. g of minus 2 is
the same thing as f of 0

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.680
because you get the minus 2 plus
2, and that equals one.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.890
So there we go, g of minus
2 is equal to 1.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.660
Then what value do I have to
put into g to get f of 1?

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.510
So what do I have to put here
for this expression right here

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.580
to be equal to 1?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.410
Well it has to equal negative
1, g of negative 1.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.330
If you put negative 1 into g,
you get negative 1 plus 2,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.330
which is 1.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.185
That's the same thing as f
of 1, so that equals 0.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:15.980
So when x is at negative 1,
g of negative 1 is 0.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.310
So let's draw g.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.490
When x is equal to-- I'll draw
it in this color-- when x is

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.720
negative 2-- so this is negative
2-- we have g of x is

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.920
equal to 1.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.190
So this right here is a point.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.270
So this is at negative 2, 0.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.140
And then we also have the
point negative 1, 0.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.065
So we also have this point,
negative 1, 0.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:49.230
Negative 1, 0 is that point.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.510
And so we see what happened is,
is that g of x is actually

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.280
a shift to the left by 2.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.580
So g of x is going to look
something like this.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.890
It's going to look like
the other graph, just

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.140
shifted to the left.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.200
Esstentially, we just took the
other graph and we shifted it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.170
to the left.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.380
And we didn't do it with
all the points.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.769
We could have done it with more
points, but we did it

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.250
with the two points that we know
definitely are defined

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.490
for f of x, right?

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.710
And those two points
definitely were

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.330
shifted to the left.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.100
This is actually a little
bit complicated.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.790
And a very simple way of
thinking about this problem

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:38.190
is, in general, if I have f of
x, then f of x plus anything--

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.000
f of x plus 2 in this case-- is
going to be the same graph

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.410
of f of x, except I'm shifting
it to the left.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.490
And it's a little unintuitive
that I'm adding 2, but I'm

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.850
shifting to the left.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:58.420
And the intuition behind that
is, whatever value f of 0 was,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.280
now that's going to happen when
I put a negative 2 in.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.930
So that's the intuition why
you're shifting to the left.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.900
The old 0 is now the
new negative 2.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.540
Similarly, f of x minus 2, if
I wanted to draw that, would

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.890
look something like this.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.010
It would go like this.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.930
And it would come down, and
it would go like this.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.620
So that would be shifting
to the right by 2.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.420
And shifting up and down is
actually much easier.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.660
If we have f of x and we want to
shift it up, say by 2, then

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.200
we'd have f of x plus 2.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.010
We just change the
y intercept.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.690
Or if we wanted to shift
it down, we'd have

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.650
f of x minus 2.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.110
Hopefully I didn't confuse
you with all this jargon.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.860
And the easy way to think about
it is really just what I

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.220
told you, you know, this rule.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.730
But I don't want you to
just have the rule.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.630
I want you to, hopefully, have
a little bit of intuition on

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.520
how the shifting works.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.890
Let's move on to the
next problem.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.510
Oh, I didn't tell you which
choice that was.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.120
Well if you just shift it to
the left two, it looks like

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.610
choice number C.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.000
All right, we're at number 18.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.365
And they have this figure.

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:12.615
This is a triangle.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.320
It's like that.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.995
And then within that, there's
another triangle.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.220
It looks like that.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:43.400
And then we have A,
B, C, D, E, F.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.180
It says, in the figure above,
AB is equal to BC.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.640
So AB, so this big triangle.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.400
Maybe I'll draw it
in this color.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.080
So this side, AB,
is equal to BC.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.850
So both sides are equal.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.110
Now what does that immediately
tell us?

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.920
If we have 2 sides equal,
that means that the

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.940
base angles are equal.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.200
That means that this angle
is going to be

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.210
equal to this angle.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.960
What else do we know?

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.720
And DE is equal to EF
is equal to DF.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.940
So we also know-- I'll switch
colors-- that DE is equal to

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.210
EF is equal to DF.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.190
And that immediately
tells us this is

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.280
an equilateral triangle.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.600
All the sides are the same,
so all the angles

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.390
have to be the same.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.910
So this angle has to be equal to
this angle, which has to be

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.200
equal to this angle.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.740
And they're all going
to be 60 degrees.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.430
They're all going to be
equal to 60 degrees.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.730
OK.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.910
Now what else are
they telling us?

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:48.690
If the measure of angle ABC--
so this angle is 30 degrees,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:58.430
that's what they're telling us--
and the measure of BDE is

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.580
50 degrees, so this
is 50 degrees.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.450
They want to know what DFA is.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.530
So we want to figure out
this angle right here.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.190
So this is the angle
game again.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.990
So a couple of things.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.180
If this angle up here is 30,
what are these base angles

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.210
going to be?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.740
Well they're going to have to
add up, all of them combined,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.640
add up to 180, right?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.090
So that means that these two are
going to add up to 150--

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.990
because you know 180 minus 30--
and they're the same.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.160
So they're the same and
they add up to 150.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.980
They're both going to have
to be 75 degrees.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.740
So that's 75 degrees, and that
is 75 degrees, right?

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.650
And then what else do we know?

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:46.190
Well we know if this angle is
50, if this angle is 60, what

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.560
is this angle right
here going to be?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.140
Well these three angles are
going to have to add up to 180

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.600
as well, right?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.330
So 180 minus 50 is 130
minus 60 is 70.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.680
So this angle is 70 degrees.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.030
And now if I were to draw this a
little bit bigger, it'd look

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.720
something like this where this
is A, this is D, this is F.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.490
I'm just drawing this
triangle right here.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.930
And so this is 75, this is
70, and so what's this?

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.160
Well 180 minus 70 minus
75 is what?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.660
That's 180 minus
180 minus 145.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:34.390
And so that should be 35
degrees, and that is choice B.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.190
I will see you in
the next video.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.870
And the important thing to
realize, this is just the

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.460
angle game, which I've
made videos on.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.880
And you just have to keep saying
oh, the angles of the

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.260
triangle add up to 180, or
there's supplementaries to

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.180
that after 180, or you just have
to remember that if the

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.490
sides are equal, then the
base angles are equal.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.343
And then you can figure them out
because you know what the

00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:53.210
third angle is.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.210
I'll see you in the
next video.
