But there is a difference. Institute 1 used many fewer data points than Institute 2.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In fact, if someone when all the way to ask 2000 potential voters,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
yet derived the exact same 0.55 then all the predictions look alike,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but if you were to trust one of the three the most, which one would you choose?

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Choose exactly one of the three.
