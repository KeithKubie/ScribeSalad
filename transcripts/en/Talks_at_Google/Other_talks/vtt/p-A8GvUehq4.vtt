00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.009
[applause]

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Thank you. Shannon told me before
that you guys have these talks to get exposed

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.570
to new kinds of learning outside your core
competency and this is probably about as far

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.710
outside your core competency --

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.710
[laughter]

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
as you're gonna get.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.410
So I'm gonna give a talk today about a theory
about sexual desire that we describe in our

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.240
book A Billion Wicked Thoughts written by
me and my co-author Sai Gaddam, he lives in

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.640
India so that's why he's not here with me
today.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.899
So I'm gonna talk about our theory of sexual
desire.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.710
I've always thought the best and most useful
scientific theories are ones that explain

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.300
diverse phenomena using a single simple theory.
For example, atomic theory can explain why

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.300
copper is heavier than helium and it also
can explain why copper conducts electricity

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.030
better than helium. This is why atomic theory's
so powerful it explains a diverse phenomena

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.719
of electrical conductance in mass than a single
theory.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.840
So I'm gonna try to do the same thing today
with our theory and show how our theory of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.479
sexual desire explains what are the most popular
erotic interests for women and what are the

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.970
most popular erotic interests for men.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.410
And this is what we're gonna use --

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.410
[laughter]

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.970
one of the most popular erotic interests for
women is Edward Cullen, the vampire from the

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.350
Twilight series of novels by Stephenie Meyer
also in the movies. I have the text behind

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.370
to emphasis that he's a textual character,
a fictional character.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.450
And I'm also gonna explain one of the most
erotic, most popular erotic interests for

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.890
men which is Shemale Porn. You may or may
not be surprised to hear that Shemale Porn

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.130
is one of the most popular kinds of erotica
for heterosexual men all around the world,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.800
in every country in the world. And it's favored
by heterosexual men not gay men, gay men are

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.100
not very interested at all in Shemale Porn.
Some bisexual men are interested, but it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.140
definitely dominated by heterosexual men.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.600
So we're gonna explain today how our theory
shows, explains why heterosexual women like

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.860
Edward Cullen and why heterosexual men like
Shemale porn. And at the end you can tell

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.119
me if I was successful in persuading you or
not.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.119
[laughter]

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.530
So who are we and what did we do? We are both,
I and my collaborator are both computational

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.170
neuroscientists which means we view the mind
as software. Researchers in our field try

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.889
to figure out the brain software behind higher
functions of the brain like language, memory,

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:25.889
and vision.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.120
But we thought we would use the techniques
and methods of computational neuroscience

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.189
to try to figure out a lower function of the
brain, sexual desire, which is something none

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.769
of our colleagues had taken a look at yet
mainly because it is controversial and political

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.769
nature.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.129
And so we set out to try to figure out okay
what's the most basic software of the sexual

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.280
brain in terms of how it processes sexual
desire. To do so we needed data and we immediately

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.439
realized there is a vast, untapped source
of data about everyday people's sexual behaviors

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.319
and this is the Internet. It turns out that
nobody in the field of sex research had turned

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.200
to the Internet yet and tried to use it to
understand people's sexual interests and sexual

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200
behaviors.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.040
So we decided to use online data and combine
that from findings of neuroscience, animal

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.880
studies, psychology experiments, evolutionary
theory, combine all these together to try

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.319
to come up with a model of sexual desire in
men and women's brains.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.299
And you might be surprised to hear that the
only systematic study by scientists of people's

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.920
sexual desires was done more than a half century
ago that's Alfred Kinsey his famous or notorious

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.170
Kinsey Reports. He surveyed about 18,000 people
mainly middle aged Caucasians in the American

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.629
Northeast and asked them face to face about
their sexual interests. And this is the only

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.590
systematic scientific attempt to try to figure
out what do men and women actually like, what

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.129
actually turns on men and women.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.659
And as you can imagine most people are not
very comfortable sharing their most intimate

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:06.430
private sexual details with a stranger, so
until now the only data we've had on what

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.719
men and women have liked has been survey data.
So online data finally give us an opportunity

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.049
to see what people really are doing behind
the anonymity of their laptops and desktops.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.049
[laughter]

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.500
And many of you here who are engineers probably
already have a very good sense of it.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500
[laughter]

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.310
So we tried to gather as much online data
as we could that would reveal something about

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
people's sexual behaviors.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.750
So gathered Web searches, search histories,
we downloaded a million erotic stories, a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.040
half million erotic videos, we looked at online
personal ads. OkCupid the online dating site

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.970
shared data on about six million users, but
that's all anonymous data.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.600
A couple, more than a couple, a number of
porn sites were kind enough to share some

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.540
of their internal data with us. For example,
Porn hub which is, I don't know if it is at

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.600
this moment, but it's been the most popular
adult video site in the world, they shared

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.720
some of their internal data.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.290
One of the most popular porn sites for women
shared, Sssh.com, shared their data. So we

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.760
gathered all kinds of data, as much as we
could we looked at Website traffic, porn site

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.240
subscriptions, the biggest billing company
for the porn industry, CCBill, shared some

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240
data with us.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.130
So we tried to gather as much different kind
of online data that we could all to try to

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.220
figure out what do men and women really like.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.310
[pause]

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:31.130
So as a result of our research we realized
that there's something pretty profound about

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.070
the basic way that sexual desire works in
the brain.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:42.330
So we're all born with a finite hardwired
set of taste cues: sweet, salty, savory, bitter,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.020
and sour we're all born with each of these
senses of taste. It's a neural subsystem and

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.981
it also has its own evolutionary function.
For example, we all have a taste for sweetness,

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:58.050
sweetness detects sugar in our food, and sugar
is our source of energy. So there's a neural

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.600
subsystem supporting that sense of sweetness
and the reason we like things that are sweet

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.240
sweet is because it helps us identify if there's
energy in our food.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.280
It turns out, in analogous fashion, that we're
all born with hardwired sexual cues. But unlike

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.670
taste cues men and women share the same taste
cues, men and women's sense of sweetness for

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.990
example is pretty much the same. But men and
women's sexual cues are very different. It's

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.190
almost as if you gave a man and a woman a
peanut brittle and the man might report a

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:36.740
sense of a taste of saltiness and the women
might report a taste of sweetness. Men and

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.430
women respond to the same stimulus in different
ways because they have different cues.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.760
So our goal in our research was to try to
identify the full range of biological cues,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.820
and of course some biological cues are heavily
shaped by culture, but to identify the full

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.490
range of biological sexual cues in men and
women.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.490
[pause]

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.622
So let me tell you in just a quick overview
of the differences between male and female

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:08.920
cues. Male sexual cues are primarily visual
, that should come as no surprise to most

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.870
people. Female sexual cues are primarily emotional
and psychological. Now men do have psychological

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.030
cues but the men's psychological cues are
usually quite different than women's psychological

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:27.060
cues. Another basic difference is most male
sexual cues are external, they respond to

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.590
what their partner is doing or what their
partner looks like.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.520
Female sexual cues are both external, responding
to the partner, but internal, they also have

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.450
some internal cues. For example a woman's
feeling of safety, if she's hungry, if she

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:47.010
feels desired. Internal feelings and internal
physical states affect female sexual arousal,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.700
but very rarely and to a very low extent affect
male sexual arousal.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.180
So let me describe some, give you some particular
examples of male sexual cues, I'm not gonna

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.120
run through the whole range right now.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.550
Some of the most common and prevalent sexual
cues for men are anatomical cues, parts of

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:12.040
the body. And what we found from our research
is that there are four parts of the body that

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.650
men are interested in universally, in every
country we looked at including preliterate,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:22.389
unwired countries as well. Four body parts
that all heterosexual men are interested in

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:29.000
it's breasts, butts, feet, and the fourth
body part was a big surprise to us, something

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.839
we completely didn't anticipate. It turns
out the fourth body part that heterosexual

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:37.029
men are very interested in looking at is the
penis.

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:38.079
[laughter]

00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:43.960
Is that bizarre? We had that reaction at first
as well.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.960
[laughter]

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.270
But the data is pretty overwhelming in this.
So men's search for penises almost as often

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.070
as they search for vaginas.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.350
If you look at all of the top porn tube sites,
these are pornographic sites that are knockoffs

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.050
of Youtube, they always have a category for
large penis porn. We looked at the top 35,000

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.080
most popular adult sites in the world and
a thousand of those 35,000 were devoted to

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.020
large penises, heterosexual sites with large
penises, devoted to men.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.060
Eye tracking studies they showed images of
clothed men and clothed women to men and women,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.290
the men look at the crotch of the men much
more often than the women do. Men are interested

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.540
in penises, especially large penises.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.540
[laughter]

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.030
Women are not so interested in the penis --

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.030
[laughter]

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.990
and as Congressman Weiner's recent scandal
--

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.060
[laughter]

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:41.740
We looked at romance novels and erotic stories.
In romance novels, even erotic romance novels,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.370
the penis is rarely just described and when
it is described it's usually described in

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.890
emotional terms rarely in physical terms.
When men write erotic stories they always

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.510
spend lavish detail describing the penis --

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.510
[laughter]

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.700
to the nearest half inch, to the nearest quarter
inch --

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.700
[laughter]

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.470
the length, the girth, the veins, all of it.
In male written erotica you'll get every detail

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:05.260
about what the penis looks like. In female
erotica rarely is much attention paid to it.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.620
But we did find one exception in romance novels,
which I wasn't familiar with 'til I started

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.370
this research, when women describe penises
in romance novels they often describe it in

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.620
terms of the blood, which to me as a man was
very strange. The blood coursed through is

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.589
penis, the blood rocketed to his penis, his
penis surged with blood. Men do not think

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:29.730
about their penis in terms of the blood inside
it, but evidently in romance novels blood

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.550
dominates descriptions of the penis.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:40.750
So these are four body parts, anatomical cues
that seem to be, men seem to have a predisposition,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.610
a biological predisposition to pay attention
to these.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:50.180
It's also interesting, we looked at gay porn
and gay erotica as well and gay sexuality,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.480
it turns out for gay men these same four body
parts are just as interesting to gay men.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.100
So all gay men universally are interested
in the chests, butts, feet, and, of course,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.990
penises as well. So the male sexual brain,
gay or straight, seems to be interested in

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:13.390
these four particular body parts. And if we
have time afterwards I can explain why it

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.550
is that these four particular body parts are
so interesting to men.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.550
&gt;&gt;male #1: Where is the vagina in the top
ten?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.550
[laughter]

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.940
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: The vagina's interesting but we
had trouble analyzing with the same specificity

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:33.750
for two reasons. One is that the most common
word for vagina, pussy, is also slang for

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:38.390
a woman in general, so it's hard to distinguish
when a man's searching for hot pussy if he's

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.630
searching for that particular body part or
for women in general.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:50.140
And also all pornography shows the vagina
in some form, close up or not, so it's very

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.779
hard to distinguish, take that out and to
identify is a man specifically interested

00:11:54.779 --> 00:12:00.460
just in the vagina or something else. So it's
hard to gauge exactly the popularity of that.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.960
So that may be the most popular we can't say.
But the order of popularity if you're curious:

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.190
breasts are most popular, then penis, then
butts, then feet. Vagina's in there somewhere,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:15.960
probably near the top, but it's very hard
to tease apart and that's interesting that

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.300
is an anatomical part.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.870
So penis and male cues.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.290
Let me talk about some female cues now. And
again I'm not gonna cover them all just a

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.130
few to give you a sense of it.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:31.580
Perhaps the most prominent and common female
sexual cue is the confidence of the man: a

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.380
man's social confidence, his leadership, his
dominance; alpha males are very popular in

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:44.830
romance novels. In fact if you analyze the
incidence of heroes in romance novels the

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.600
ten most popular heroes in romance novels
are all alpha males: kings, princes, doctors,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:57.930
sheriffs, generals, knights; all confident,
strong leaders.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:03.930
Another sexual cue for women is a man's competence:
his skills, his ability to get things done.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.330
For men not so important; whether the woman's
a waitress or the CEO of Google --

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.330
[laughter]

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.370
It doesn't make much difference in terms of
sexual arousal. But when a man's a waiter

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.720
or the CEO of Google it does make a difference
to many women's sexual attraction to him.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:26.440
Another fundamental difference between male
and female cues. For men going on to online

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.300
erotic sites is a solitary enterprise. Men
don't typically talk about their erotic experiences

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.279
online with other men. And if they hear about
their friends' interests online that does

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:41.810
not influence what they look at, what they're
interested in. Knowing that your buddy likes

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.100
porn stars, Jenna Jameson or Stoya will not
influence your opinion of whether they're

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.100
attractive or not.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.640
This is not the case with women, women are
influenced by the opinions of other women.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.830
Women seek out the opinions of other women
in erotic content, in erotic opinions as well

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.630
as relationship opinions of course.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:07.510
The most popular erotic community for women
online is the FanFiction Community. If you're

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:12.399
not familiar with FanFiction this is an online
community. It did exist before the Internet

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.209
but it absolutely exploded on the Internet.

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:20.760
This community's dominated by women and it
consists of amateur authors who write stories

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.430
about popular books, characters in popular
books, movies, and TV shows. For example the

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.030
most popular kind of FanFiction is Harry Potter
FanFiction followed close behind by Twilight.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:37.390
Buffy the Vampire Slayer used to be one of
the most popular fandoms in FanFiction, The

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:44.170
Lord of the Rings, just about any TV show,
movie, book, even there's FanFiction about

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:49.910
bands, about professional wrestlers, just
about anything, but dominated heavily by books.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:54.399
So in the FanFiction community women write
stories about the characters or the settings

00:14:54.399 --> 00:15:00.120
of these fandoms . It's not always romantic
or erotic but the vast majority of the stories

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.110
in FanFiction are romantic and erotic.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:07.250
So an amateur woman, will write a story, post
it online, and then there'll be discussion;

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.650
people comment on the story, they talk about
it, they talk about what turned them on in

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.750
the story, whether the story was authentic
or not, whether the emotions were authentic

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.100
or not, the characters are valid, and the
talking goes back and forth, long dialogs

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:24.020
hundreds and hundreds of comments about stories.
And in fact there's even a part of FanFiction

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.080
called Meta which is talking about the process
of talking about the stories.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.160
[laughter]

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:37.890
So for women, erotica is a social enterprise;
for men it's a solitary enterprise.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.480
[pause]

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.201
And women respond to other women's opinion
of a guy. The more women that are attracted

00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:48.950
to a man increases the attraction of that
man. So the phrase, "The best men are always

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:54.000
taken," is doubly true. If a man is taken
by definition he's more attractive and appealing;

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.860
if a man's alone and isolated and solitary
and nobody's interested in him that will reduce

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.980
his appeal just by virtue of not being taken.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:09.380
So, let me think if there's any other female
sexual cues I should cover. That's probably

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.350
good enough now. I can talk more, add some
more later.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.440
So these are some of the cues there's many
more.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.149
Let me talk about how the differences between
the male and female brain process these cues.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:28.880
So the male sexual brain responds to any single
sexual stimulus. If a computer engineer was

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880
designing the male sexual brain ?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880
[laughter]

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.880
he would use an or-gate

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880
[laughter]

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.030
because any single stimulus will turn on a
man whether he sees a nice chest or sexy,

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:44.360
older woman walking by, or if he's a fan of
BBW or BW images; any single stimulus will

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360
trigger arousal.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.060
The female sexual brain does not work that
way. The female sexual brain if it was designed

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:54.660
by a computer engineer would be and-gate.
The female sexual brain requires multiple

00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:00.240
stimuli simultaneously or in quick succession
before arousal is triggered.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.589
Another fundamental difference between the
male sexual brain and the female sexual brain:

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:09.860
the male sexual brain's physical arousal and
psychological arousal are united. So if a

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.370
man is physically turned on it's a pretty
safe bet he's mentally turned on as well.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:19.130
Not the case in women. The female brain is
designed to separate physical arousal and

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:24.210
psychological arousal. So a woman can be physically
turned on but mentally turned off which is

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.870
something that many men find a bit baffling,
but it's a common phenomenon.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:37.049
So this evolved over time apparently to help
protect women from cruel, sneaky, and incompetent

00:17:37.049 --> 00:17:42.130
men [audience chuckles] that they've been
faced with over the eons.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.050
So these are two basic differences between
the male and female sexual brain the way they

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.180
process the cues: the male sexual brain is
or gate , the female sexual brain is and gate

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.790
[ ]; the male sexual brain psychological and
physical arousal are linked; they're detached

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.559
in the female sexual brain harder to get them,
takes more work to get them to come together

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.430
in the female brain than in the male brain.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.170
So these are some of the basic elements of
our cue theory of sexual desire.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:14.630
Now I wanna take what we've learned to apply
it to Edward Cullen and Shemale Porn.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.650
[pause]

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:24.530
So the reason cue theory can explain both
Edward Cullen and Shemale Porn is that they're

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:29.380
both examples of erotical illusions, what
we call erotical illusions. Let me explain

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.700
to you what an erotical illusion is. Computational
neuroscientists love to analyze optical illusions

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:40.280
and these are two optical illusions that in
my department we analyzed or spent a lot of

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:47.770
time trying to figure out because optical
illusions reveal the software of visual perception.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.980
Optical illusion the whole is greater than
the sum of the parts so like the one on the

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:58.030
left that's called an Ehrenstein disc, you
see a brighter white disc, the bright white

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.730
button in the center. Here you see an illusory
triangle. The triangle seems to pop out. So

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.430
these I think, these are inputs that are tricking
the brain into seeing things that aren't quite

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:08.430
there.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.430
And there's another one ?

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.430
[pause]

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:16.570
nothing is moving but if you stare at it it
looks like things along the periphery are

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:23.080
moving. This is tricking the movement perception,
the movement software, movement perception

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.410
software of the visual cortex.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:31.530
And these work by combining different visual
cues in novel ways, different geometric and

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:37.070
color cues, in novel combinations in ways
that kind of trick out the software designed

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.200
for visual perception.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.780
The most --

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.570
[pause]

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:52.380
that's Mona Lisa, very dim unfortunately.
The most popular of optical illusion in all

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:58.929
of art is probably Mona Lisa's smile which
you can't see too well here; Mona Lisa's smile

00:19:58.929 --> 00:20:07.720
famous for being enigmatic, mysterious. And
the reason it's so bewitching and enigmatic

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.799
is because Leonardo da Vinci painted it an
optical illusion. It was first figured out

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:16.440
by Margaret Livingstone she's a computational
neuroscientist at Harvard.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:22.419
So our brain processes high resolution information
separately from low resolution information,

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:27.200
there's two separate circuits. In our fovea
in the center of our retina we process high

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.590
resolution information and that gets sent
down one circuit, in the periphery of our

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.320
vision we process low resolution information.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:39.960
So if you look at the mouth of Mona Lisa,
if you look directly at the mouth it seems

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.799
calm and tranquil, but as soon as you look
away to her forehead and eyes, I'm sorry this

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:49.919
is not brighter, as soon as you look away
from the mouth it looks like she's smiling

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:55.440
and teasing. And the reason is Leonardo da
Vinci painted it so the high resolution version

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.059
of her mouth is flat, her mouth is almost
a horizontal line, but the low resolution

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:06.360
goes up to the cheekbones and it's kind of
grin like the Joker in Batman, very strong

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.360
grin.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.510
So the brain's simultaneously processing these
in different streams in the brain; one stream

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:16.400
is saying it's smiling, one stream's saying
it's not and that gives it this magical, enigmatic

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.660
quality. Again it's by combining two separate
visual cues in this new way kind of tricks

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.660
the brain.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.790
So that's something very similar to what's
happening with the sexual brain with an erotical

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.720
illusion. An erotical illusion combines different
sexual cues in new combinations to trick out

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.740
the sexual brain.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:42.330
So let me talk about Shemale Porn. Again this
is very popular among heterosexual men; gay

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:48.340
men are not interested in Shemale Porn. This
was a surprise, when we went into this we

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.090
had no idea that Shemale Porn was going to
be so popular. Obviously this is something

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:58.340
that men aren't comfortable talking about
but the data is quite overwhelming about that

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.540
this is universally popular, immensely popular.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:10.500
So why are straight men so interested in Shemale
Porn? And this actually has clinical implications

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.980
too. I've been talking with sex therapists
as a result of our research, and sex therapists

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:21.090
have had no idea what an interest in this
meant. One of the fears that wives of men

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:26.330
had when they discovered this on their husbands'
browsers was that maybe their husband's gay.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:31.850
And the clinicians had no idea of that was
true or not and no way to think about it so

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.600
we think the answer is no, there's nothing
gay about liking Shemale Porn; it's an erotical

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:44.240
illusion. It combines the female anatomical
cues that we talked about breasts, butt, feet,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.980
all the curves of a female body with the other
cue of a penis. [audience giggles] Which we

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:54.010
now see the penis is a cue that triggers sexual
interest in men and it combines them into

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.950
a single gestalt. If you talk to fans of Shemale
Porn they usually say something like, "Oh

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:03.080
she's very beautiful, she's very lovely, and
there's an extra something that just pops

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
out of my brain and

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080
[laughter]

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080
I can't really describe it."

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
[laughter]

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.309
And there's always a sense of the inexplicable
when they talk about it.

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:10.309
[laughter]

00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:12.450
"There's something magical and strange, I
don't really know what's going on." It's very

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.650
similar to the way people talk about the Mona
Lisa's smile and about optical illusions too.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.000
There's just a sense that there's something
that they can't quite put their finger on

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.400
even though there is something that they definitely
can put their finger on.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400
[laughter]

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.450
We know that this is a visual tricking of
the brain and not something more psychological

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:38.429
because as we even see here at first it was
all actual transsexual Shemale Porn consisted

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:43.130
all of transsexual and oh I should say please
don't call your transsexual friends Shemales.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:47.070
Shemale's a derogatory term, it implies that
you're working in the sex industry. So Shemale's

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.210
a standard term within the adult industry
but you shouldn't use that with any transsexual

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.630
friend that does not work in the adult industry.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:01.559
Shemale Porn was originally all human transsexuals,
live transsexuals but eventually erotic artists

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:06.970
started drawing transsexuals, started drawing
Shemales and that made it very clear exactly

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:13.940
what men were interested in because the art
was exactly all of the female, all of the

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:21.100
sexual cues for men that they find arousing:
young women, busty, small feet, butts. Here's

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:28.530
some more erotic Shemale art, hard to see
but that might not be so bad.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.530
[laughter]

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:35.419
Young women, high school girls in school outfits
a lot like anime but always with a very large

00:24:35.419 --> 00:24:42.750
package down below, the specific visual elements
that arouse a man. In fact pornographers have

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.490
recently learned that they don't even need
to use actual transsexuals. What they've done

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.470
now is they use women, usually buxom women,
and have them wear very realistic strap on

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:57.480
penises. And then there's websites devoted
to this, there's one site called futanari.com,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.490
that was the first to do this and became very
popular.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:05.380
So by having real women with realistic but
fake penises they don't have to get actual

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:11.070
transsexuals to do it, but men are still interested
showing that there's not some underlying psychological

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:17.470
thing going on, it's just pure visual trickery
of the male sexual brain.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:24.710
So what's interesting about erotical illusions
is an erotical illusion for a man does not

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:29.870
work on women, and erotical illusions for
women does not work on men. So imagine for

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:37.770
a second the opposite of the Shemale, maybe
a man with a bald head, big muscles, tats

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.360
all over, a cigar, and a vagina. So --

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360
[laughter]

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:50.790
there is such a [ inaudible ] hard to see.
This is Buck Angel the most popular and perhaps

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:57.060
the only porn star who is a female to male
transsexual. It's hard to see but he does

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.490
have muscles, tats all over his body, he's
smoking a cigar, he's got bald head, a beard,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.280
and he still has his vagina.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:11.450
So heterosexual women do not show sexual interest
in Buck Angel. There is a group of people

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.491
that are very sexually interested in Buck
Angel and that's gay men which is what we

00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:20.570
would predict from cue theory. Gay men are
interested in Buck Angel, heterosexual women

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:26.250
aren't. There may be some out there, we did
a brief survey and weren't able to come up

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:32.360
with any in the traffic to Buck Angel sites
there was no women visiting Buck Angels porn

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.360
sites.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:40.230
So let's look at the erotical illusion for
women. Andrew Cullen is a vampire, he's a

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.340
vampire in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series
of novels.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:50.080
Over the past decade paranormal romance, as
a sub-genre of romance novels, has just exploded.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.100
It's the most popular kind of romance novels
now, paranormal romance, dominated by authors

00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:01.799
like Stephenie Meyer, Laurell Hamilton, Charlaine
Harris who wrote the series of True Blood

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:08.110
based upon J.R. Ward; many, many authors,
many books about paranormal romance. They

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:14.690
feature heroes who are supernatural: vampires,
werewolves, wizards, things like that.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:22.460
Definitely the king of paranormal romance
is the character Edward Cullen. So he is an

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.230
erotical illusion, a female erotical illusion
'cause he combines a number of different female

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.480
psychological cues into this novel concoction.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:38.570
For example, he's 100 years old so he's experienced,
he's confident, he's competent but he's in

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.730
the body of a hot teenager. So he combines
the experience and maturity which men are

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:50.780
attracted to with a hot young body. All the
girls at the high school where he goes are

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.840
very interested in him but he shows no, he
pays no attention to all the girls at high

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.490
school, he only pays attention the heroine
of the series, Bella. He is the ultimate alpha

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:07.400
male. Whenever human boys, near-human boys,
bully his girlfriend, Bella, he can swoop

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.789
in, literally swoop in, --

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:09.789
[laughter]

00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:16.870
and beat the crap out of all of them without
breaking a sweat. In fact he is also an alpha

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:25.310
among alphas because he is pretty dominant
among other vampires as well. So he's an ultimate

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.920
alpha male.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.230
[pause]

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:35.039
There's a few more. The great thing about
paranormal romance and the reason it's exploded

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:40.500
in my opinion is because it allows female
authors to manipulate all these cues in new

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.950
ways to exaggerate certain qualities. Oh and
another really important one.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:52.409
So Edward Cullen lusts after Bella with a
powerful desire because he lusts after her

00:28:52.409 --> 00:28:56.370
blood. He's a vampire, he wants to drink her
blood so he's got this powerful, overwhelming

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.990
attraction to her, but he proves his love
to her by never giving in to it. So it's almost

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.400
an adolescent, female fantasy because he's
always desiring her, endlessly, powerfully

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.169
desiring but he always holds off. So it's
endless desire without consummation. To point

00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:16.690
out people think that it's just adolescents
interested in this; no women 20's, 30's, 40's,

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:22.960
we saw many women in their mid to late 40's
who are just absolutely sexually obsessed

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.030
with Edward Cullen. So it's not just something
that appeals to younger women.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.030
[pause]

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.220
The reverse of this is not true. Men are not
interested, for the most part, in Twilight

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:42.159
novels or similar novels and romantic, erotic
stories about female vampires, there isn't

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:49.770
any that has broken out among men. Men don't
find this particularly interesting.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.890
So there's many, many other erotical illusions,
I'll just mention a few that people often

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.039
wanna hear about.

00:29:56.039 --> 00:30:02.490
Facials. Facials, which women for the most
part find disgusting. We know that from, we

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:07.280
talked to some of the female erotic sites
and they always have surveys about what women

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.780
wanna see in erotic videos and facials is
always at the very bottom of the list; for

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.650
men it's usually at the top of the list. Why
are men interested in it? It's an erotical

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:21.541
illusion. It combines psychological cues with
visual cues in ways that aren't possible with

00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:28.799
any other place. They're almost like emoticons
expressing emotion, having emotional connection

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:32.870
with the visual moment.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:38.450
Another, this is a Humantauria, another erotical
illusion for men. This one's not so common

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.830
but it kind of reveals the nature of sort
of erotic trickery.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:48.830
Another erotical illusion for women is Slash
fiction. Slash is a sub-genre, I shouldn't

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.640
even say sub-genre 'cause it's just about
as big as Fanfiction, the parts of FanFiction

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.400
that aren't Slash.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:03.360
Slash fiction are stories about two men, usually
two strong, dominant, masculine men who share

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.659
their emotional side with each other, fall
in love, and have sex; not always have sex,

00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:12.600
having the emotional sharing is the important
part just like it is in a romance novel.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.799
Here's a representation of Slash Edward Cullen
the vampire and Jacob Black the werewolf from

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:22.730
Twilight a very popular pairing within Slash
fiction.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:28.840
This is erotical illusion for women; it combines,
the reason women read romance novels is because

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.580
their stories of men revealing their tender
side, their emotional side of strong dominant

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.100
revealing the tender side. So this just basically
doubles up all the cues; this is analogous

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.600
to men like looking at lesbian porn, two women
making out and kissing regardless of their

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.400
personality and character.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.299
In Slash fiction, the emotions of the two
men, the revealing of emotion of sharing their

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:55.250
secret parts with each other, that's always
the focus. The sex is in there too, sometimes,

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.670
depending on the author, but it's always the
emotional connection; Slash is very emotional.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:05.919
You'd never make, mistake Slash fiction for
erotica written by a gay man.

00:32:05.919 --> 00:32:11.940
So these are some erotical illusions and one
thing worth considering is just how different

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.720
these are, just how different Edward Cullen
is from Shemale Porn or the Humantauria is

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.090
from Slash fiction.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.020
The male and female sexual brain, down at
the most basic operation we're talking, of

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.630
course, now just its fundamental level not
talking about sexual relationships which are

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.909
far more complex and complicated, but just
at the basic level of how our sexual brains

00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:40.299
work. The male and the female brain are very,
very different.

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:41.779
[pause]

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:46.220
And that's it.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.700
[applause]

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:56.710
&gt;&gt;male #2: So I'm curious about, so for example
you said that let's say the Shemale Porn was

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:01.059
of interest to heterosexual men. How can you
tell that from the kind of data that you were

00:33:01.059 --> 00:33:02.059
able to collect?

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:03.059
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Sure.

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:04.059
&gt;&gt;male #2: Billing data or whatever?

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:11.570
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: So the most common way is we talked
to people that run Shemale sites and we talked

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:17.280
to Shemale porn stars and they say their fans
are heterosexual men from interacting with

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.280
them.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.140
There was actually an academic study that
went into a Shemale bar in Chicago and interviewed

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:27.529
the men there to ask their sexual preference
and I think about 70 percent were straight

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:31.580
men and 30 percent were bisexuals and there
were no gay men at the bar.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:36.880
Also from search histories, if you look at
search histories, people that search for Shemale

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:45.659
Porn either search for heterosexual stuff
in addition or bisexual stuff. There's not

00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:48.391
any clear indication of somebody searching
for Shemale and gay porn. There is once in

00:33:48.391 --> 00:33:54.580
a while but it's very rare compared to somebody
searching for Shemale Porn and hot teens for

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:55.580
example.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.580
[pause]

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.400
&gt;&gt;male #3: So in these videos does Shemale
usually like attracting the male or attracting

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:07.950
the female? Does that have an effect on like
whether bi men watch it or straight men watch

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.950
it?

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:13.010
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: There may. So we haven't, that's
something we haven't disentangled the point.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:18.349
We mainly tried to look at just the images
themselves. But you're right there's some

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:23.110
Shemale Porn they're having sex with men,
some Shemale Porn they're having sex with

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:29.440
other Shemales. And who those different variations
appeal to we didn't look at that yet, but

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:37.210
probably bisexuals are probably interested
in the interaction. Whereas a lot of Shemale

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:43.639
erotica now is just images like those images
I showed you so I would speculate that you

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:46.339
can see a difference between what straight
men and bisexual men are interested in but

00:34:46.339 --> 00:34:48.379
we don't know.

00:34:48.379 --> 00:35:00.619
&gt;&gt;female #1: Do you have anything like cultural
studies like where [inaudible] --

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:02.670
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yes.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.670
&gt;&gt;female #1: and then like also if you looked
at a lot of Asians, like Asian idols are a

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.670
really big thing?

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.670
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yes.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.670
&gt;&gt;female #1: If you look at their idols and
all the guys they're really [inaudible] ?

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.670
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yes. So I wanna talk about Japan.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.849
The important thing about Japan is so Internet
came up there was erotic art from all around

00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:16.900
the world and Japanese erotic art has just
dominated the Internet because in our opinion

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:24.430
they do the basic visual cues that interest
men the best. An anime girl, young, busty,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:31.400
round butts, curvy, small feet, high pitched
voice, all the biological cues that interest

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.760
men across cultures. We think that's why Japanese
anime has just crushed all other erotic art

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.690
and there's actually erotic art in just about
every country in the world, but only Japanese

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:47.020
erotic art rose to universal popularity.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.180
Also another interesting cultural difference,
so I talked about the four body parts that

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:58.770
are universal: breasts, butt, feet, and penises
but depending on the culture other body parts

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.890
are also interesting. So in Japan, for example,
men are very interested in something called

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:08.070
the absolute territory which is a strip of
thigh here below a skirt and above a thigh

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:14.599
high stocking; was like the most popular fetish
for awhile, might still be, while we were

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:17.290
doing our research it was the most common
search absolute territory.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:23.500
In India the belly, the stomach is an erogenous
zone; lots of searches for bellies in India

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.950
probably because they present the belly as
erotic interest.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:31.960
In Victorian England supposedly the ankle
was considered very erotic.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.630
So there is cultural variability in even what
men, the anatomical parts that men are attracted

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:45.170
to but breast, butt, feet, and penises do
seem --

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.530
[sound of bells]

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:51.460
In Japan, another interesting thing about
Japan for the women is there's probably greatest

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.320
comfort with reading gay stories, stories
about two gay men among heterosexual women

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.470
in Japan, very popular and usually –

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.470
[pause]

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:08.570
comic books or TV shows will put out a special
Slash version, a gay version, of the characters

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:13.980
even if they're not gay in the actual original
series to appeal to this. But there's much

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:20.710
more comfort among girls and women in Japan
reading stories about two men falling in love

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:28.560
as well and often having more feminized boys
in some of these stories as well.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.560
[pause]

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560
Another question.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.600
&gt;&gt;male #4: Uh, yeah, you talked about the
last major study being done as being Alfred

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600
Kinsey.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.600
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yes.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.650
&gt;&gt;male #4: Where is the work of Masters and
Johnson in the 60s, and 70s fit in?

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.110
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: They focused on the physiology
of sex.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.110
&gt;&gt;male #4: Okay.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:51.070
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: They had people come into the
lab and have sex and watched like anatomical

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:56.910
changes things like that. They focused on
the actual physical process of intercourse

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.390
rather than what turned people on.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.950
Though one finding that we thought was pretty
interesting is based on what they saw and

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:11.540
this is a bit subjective, it has to be subjective,
they think gay people have better sex than

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.410
straight people, that gay people have more
satisfying sex.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:17.410
And they had gay couples in the lab they always
accorded greater sexual time and they seem

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:23.010
to be more comfortable and have a better time
than men and women. So there might be some

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.210
sexual benefit to sharing the same sexual
cues with somebody else perhaps it's just

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:32.490
a greater familiarity with the anatomy. It's
not clear exactly what that might be but other

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.380
surveys too that have asked about sexual satisfaction
tend to find that gay people find sex more

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.380
satisfying.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:43.951
But yeah Masters and Johnson focused on the
physiology they didn't look at are people

00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:44.951
attracted to animals or Shemales or anything
like that.

00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:45.951
[pause]

00:38:45.951 --> 00:38:52.801
&gt;&gt;male #5: You mentioned the four body parts
and then you mentioned those people who are

00:38:52.801 --> 00:38:58.290
into lesbian porn which seems to go together.
There is one missing body part.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.859
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: The vagina?

00:38:59.859 --> 00:39:06.050
&gt;&gt;male #5: No you said there were four body
parts: breasts, bottom, penis which is obviously

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.720
missing in this lesbian porn. So why is that
still very popular.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.210
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Well you don't need all the cues.
Remember any single cue --

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.210
&gt;&gt;male #5: Oh it's ignored.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.440
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yeah any single cue is enough.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.490
Just a pair of breasts and nothing else --

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.490
[laughter]

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.849
can be, go to completion let's say.

00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:26.849
[laughter]

00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:35.040
It's very rare women like to look at a man's
chest and nothing else and manage to get to

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040
completion.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.040
[pause]

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.040
&gt;&gt;female #2: So you talked about gay and straight
men.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Yes.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040
&gt;&gt;female #2: What did you find out about lesbians?

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.510
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: We did not focus on lesbians as
much unfortunately. We only wanted to report

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:52.380
results if we could talk to actual fans of
the erotica. So we talked to a lot of gay

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.690
men. In fact I personally watched a whole
lot of gay porn with my gay friends just to

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.030
get familiar with it. [chuckles].

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:04.240
And for the Shemale Porn we found people who
are fans of that. But the truth was we tried

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.030
to approach lesbians but they were always
uncomfortable sharing their sexual reaction

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:15.970
and sexual experiences with us, I'm a heterosexual
man. I have a few lesbian friends but I wanted

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.030
to go outside just my friends for that because
that's what we did for everything else.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:26.461
But having said that, we can see a few conclusions.
What lesbians are interested in is very different

00:40:26.461 --> 00:40:33.080
from what gay men are interested in. Also
before I say anything, homosexuality in men

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.540
is almost certainly biological, like you're
born gay if you're a man. With women it's

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:46.420
much more ambiguous. Some women are born gay
but women, by the nature of their sexuality,

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.859
can also become lesbian.

00:40:48.859 --> 00:40:52.080
One reason is because their cues their sexual
cues are not tied to physicality they're tied

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:58.950
to the emotions, their tied to the psychology.
So like Anne Heche she was married to a man,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:05.050
after she was married to a man then she dated
Ellen Degeneres for awhile and then she went

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:09.440
and married another man. Very, very rare to
find the opposite where there's a guy with

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.830
married to a woman, is gay for awhile and
then goes back; very rare, I don't know of

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:19.270
any. But the reason is because female sexuality
and lesbian sexuality are much more fluid,

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:24.520
much more dynamic. In fact, female sexuality
in general is much more fluid and adaptive.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:31.050
Men's sexual interests are formed during adolescence
roughly between ages 12 and 22 roughly and

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:36.050
then they're fixed pretty much for life. What
a guy likes when he's 20 is almost certainly

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.190
what he's gonna be liking at age 40.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:43.660
Not the case with women. Women's sexuality
is designed to be fluid, flexible, adaptive.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.750
What a woman likes at age 20 might be very
different than what she likes at age 40.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:54.890
The reason for this fundamental difference
is because the information men and women need

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.380
to determine a good sexual partner is very
different.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:03.810
For a man what he's interested in is a healthy
body, a body that can have children and so

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:09.200
a single glance provides enough basic information
to know is the woman healthy and capable of

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.900
having children. And that doesn't change.
What's a healthy woman when a guy is young

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.940
is the same as what a healthy woman is when
he's 40.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.660
But for a woman she needs a man who's going
to be committed, who's gonna stick around,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:25.730
who is going to be kind to her and her kids,
who's gonna be competent enough that he can

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.050
take care of her and provide for her. And
the kind of man that is capable of doing that

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:35.490
does change; it changes from culture to culture,
it changes from age to age.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:40.339
So a woman needs to be a little more flexible.
Also that's another reason why women are so

00:42:40.339 --> 00:42:43.670
interested in the opinions of other women
because to determine what makes a good man

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.470
is a much more difficult project, much more
complicated project.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:52.970
We say in our book and I believe it the female
brain is more sophisticated than the male

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:57.589
brain because it has to do more sophisticated
long term planning. It has to figure out if

00:42:57.589 --> 00:43:02.410
a guy is going to be good over a long period
of time which requires a lot more sophisticated--if

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.420
you're writing a computer program, if you
are writing robot, creating a robot for a

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.680
male brain and a female brain it would be
much, much harder to program the female brain

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680
--

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680
[sound of something dropping]

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.680
than the male brain.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680
[pause]

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.040
&gt;&gt;female #3: Well what's special about the
feet?

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:22.859
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: So that surprised us. I mean we've
all heard of foot fetishes and before we did

00:43:22.859 --> 00:43:27.270
our research there was no conventional wisdom
about it, there was no theory about why men

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:32.260
were interested in feet. It wasn't even known
how popular it was but it turns out to be

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:36.100
very popular in every culture, also both gay
men and straight men.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.390
One of the theories about feet has been that
since women wear fancy shoes and high heels

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:42.740
that attracts the men's attention to it. But
of course gay men aren't attracted to men

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:50.520
who are wearing fancy shoes and gay men are
just as interested.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.540
But there's also a study, a guy went into
some preliterate cultures in Iran, Brazil,

00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:00.040
New Guinea, cultures that aren't on the Internet,
and found out in all cultures men are always

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.780
interested in smaller than average feet, smaller
than average. Women are interested in average

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:09.040
size feet, but men are interested in smaller
than average feet in all cultures. And that's

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.660
what we see in online foot erotica too. The
feet are almost always smaller.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:20.589
The reason we think all of the body parts
that men are attracted to are connected with

00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:26.760
estrogen. Estrogen indicates a woman's health
and fertility because it's connected with

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.780
her level of energy.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.690
So if a woman's not getting enough nutrition
and she's not getting enough health her estrogen

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:38.210
levels drop and if her estrogen levels drop
her anatomical parts don't necessarily grow

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:44.170
as much as a woman who is getting healthy
nutrition. So breasts, butt, they're both

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.609
connected with estrogen.

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:52.500
It turns out estrogen also controls bone growth;
it determines when the end of a bone stops

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.180
growing, so estrogen controls the length of
the foot as it turns out. So we think that's

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.770
yet another reason men are interested in feet.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:05.320
It's also the case that when women get pregnant
their feet get larger. So for a man a pregnant

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.829
woman would not be a good sexual object because
you're not going to be able to reproduce obviously

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:16.690
so a larger foot would be an indication of
a less likely for a woman to be fertile as

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:17.690
well.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:23.910
So there's some biological reasons I think
to explain it but our book is the first to

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.050
really lay this out so it's gonna need some
more research from other people.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:32.530
It's clearly the case men are interested in
feet all around the world like Rex Ryan, coach

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.890
of the New York Jets.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.890
[laughter]

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:38.660
&gt;&gt;female #4: What about the kink communities?

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.070
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: What?

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.430
&gt;&gt;female #4: The kink communities.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.310
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: So, do you have any particular
in mind?

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.310
[laughter]

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.580
&gt;&gt;female #4: BDSM would be a good place to
start.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:52.350
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: What's that BDSM?

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:58.070
&gt;&gt;female #4: Yes, BDSM.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:45:59.120
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: So --

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120
[pause]

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.070
BDSM, so there are many, we now know, before
we did the research it wasn't known the popularity

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:10.480
of different kinks, it was just all guessing.
Now we actually have from our research clear

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.600
idea of what kinks are common and what are
common.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.490
So now we know Shemale Porn, from example,
common, BDSM also very common.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:24.420
We think what's going on behind BDSM, so this
is something very new that is not in the research

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:31.050
before we did ours and not in literature.
One of the most fundamental aspects of human

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.740
sexuality in the male and female brain is
dominance and submission.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:40.430
We all come wired to prefer dominance over
submission. This basic fact explains so much

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.720
erotica, male erotica and female erotica,
but it's absolutely not mentioned at all anywhere

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.000
in the scientific literature.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.710
But from our research it became very clear.
So BDSM is a piece of that but so much male

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:57.431
pornography is determined whether it's dominant,
showing a man dominating a woman, or is it

00:46:57.431 --> 00:47:00.480
a man getting dominated by the woman?

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.270
So it appears that the majority of heterosexual
men come born, come wired to prefer sexual

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:11.880
dominance, to be the one to be on top. A minority
of men, a very large minority of men, however

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:18.680
come wired to be sexually submissive, they
prefer submission porn.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:25.250
This reflects what we see in rats and chimpanzees
too. It turns out in the rat brain and chimpanzee

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:29.020
brain we've identified there's a part of the
brain that controls sexual dominance and there's

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.119
a part of the brain that controls sexual submission.
But the fascinating thing is that both the

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:37.510
dominance and submission parts of the brain
are in everybody, they're in both males and

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.510
females.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:43.760
So it appears to be the case in humans as
well that we all come with the ability to

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.060
be sexually dominant or sexually submission
but one of them get wired up.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:52.000
Interestingly gay men are much more likely
to be sexually submissive. The majority of

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.080
gay men are likely to be sexually submissive;
the majority of straight men are likely to

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:01.010
be sexually dominant. In fact the only difference,
the only difference we could find between

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:05.980
gay sexuality and straight sexuality, besides
the fact that gay men like men and straight

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:11.089
men women, the only difference is that gay
men are more likely to enjoy sexual submission

00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:13.609
and straight men are more likely to enjoy
sexual domination.

00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:17.760
In every other way gay pornography and straight
pornography are absolutely indistinguishable.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.880
Gay interests and gay behaviors align, absolutely
indistinguishable from straight men. Gay men

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:28.140
do not behave like women online at all, they
behave even more like men than straight men

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.140
do.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.140
[laughter]

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.140
[pause]

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:36.930
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Well thank you so much for coming.
I think we'll go ahead and sign some books

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.930
--

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:38.930
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Oh sure.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:43.079
&gt;&gt;Shannon: and feel free to chat and get some
lunch.

00:48:43.079 --> 00:48:44.400
Okay, thank you.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.160
&gt;&gt;Ogi Ogas: Thank you.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.599
