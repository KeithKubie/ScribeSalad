Jeff Nunokawa:
This is your first home here at Princeton

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.350
Jeff Nunokawa:
and we do a great deal, we all of
us do, each of us in our own

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.160
Jeff Nunokawa:
way, to make it feel like home.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.630
Jeff Nunokawa:
To make you feel like there's
a place for you here, no

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.490
Jeff Nunokawa:
matter where you're from,
and no matter

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.690
Jeff Nunokawa:
where you want to go.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.850
Sanjeev Kulkarni:
Each of the colleges is having

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.970
Sanjeev Kulkarni:
a Master Chef night.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.610 position:63%
Sarah Paige:
Well, Butler always has wonderful events

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.750
Sarah Paige:
going on, but the master's dinner

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090
Sarah Paige:
is definitely wonderful.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.710 position:64%
Jeff Nunokawa:
It kind of touches on what we think of as

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.440
Jeff Nunokawa:
the mission of the college, and
that's to make people feel

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.040
Jeff Nunokawa:
lively and at home.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.980 position:72%
Eduardo Cadava:
What the way the college is envisioned as is a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.720 position:75%
Eduardo Cadava:
place to bring together undergraduates, graduate

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.130
Eduardo Cadava:
students, and faculty in a place
where students live, in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.350 position:70%
Eduardo Cadava:
order to enhance the life that you have here.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.120
Sanjeev Kulkarni:
Each of the colleges has

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.790
Sanjeev Kulkarni:
roughly about 500 students.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.280 position:59%
Eduardo Cadava:
Part of my charge is just to make sure

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.780 position:64%
Eduardo Cadava:
that where the students live
continues to be a place where they learn.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.590 position:77%
Sarah Paige:
Well, I think that the residential colleges are a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.390 position:81%
Sarah Paige:
really special part of the Princeton experience that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.600 position:81%
Sarah Paige:
allow you to really get to know an extremely diverse

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.690 position:70%
Sarah Paige:
community, but in a much more manageable way.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.040
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
I think what I love most about the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.680 position:89%
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
residential college system is the sense of community that

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.470
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
you have. It's when you walk
into the dining hall and you

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.990
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
can sit down with anyone you know.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.060
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
It's when you're walking along
the paths of your college, and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.200
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
you find yourself saying,
"Hi," to so many people.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.550
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
It's when you're studying in the
study rooms, and everyone

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.050
Adoley Ammah-Tagoe:
has the same sense of community
in the same environment.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.390 position:56%
Katelyn Scanlan:
For me, coming from a small town, it

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.890
Katelyn Scanlan:
seemed like such a big place.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120
Katelyn Scanlan:
But once I got here and got into
the residential college

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.980
Katelyn Scanlan:
system, into the residential
campus life, it really becomes

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.490
Katelyn Scanlan:
a small community and I was
really surprised by how

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.570
Katelyn Scanlan:
tight-knit our groups can be.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.990
Katelyn Scanlan:
And I've made of my best friends in

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.080
Katelyn Scanlan:
the residential colleges.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.300
Katelyn Scanlan:
So it's something really
unexpected and really, really

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.040
Katelyn Scanlan:
nice to have here at Princeton.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.380
[music]

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.840
Simon Krauss:
We have six residential colleges.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.840
Simon Krauss:
You're assigned, and you stay
there for at least your

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.190
Simon Krauss:
freshman and sophomore year.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.320
Katelyn Scanlan:
How you're sorted into residential

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.010
Katelyn Scanlan:
colleges, it's not like you can
put a sorting hat on your

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.020
Katelyn Scanlan:
head, like in Harry Potter.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.420
Katelyn Scanlan:
It's done completely randomly.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.150 position:61%
Jessica Johnson:
Well I like that, in a sense, that it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.620
Jessica Johnson:
not just one demographic.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.460
Jessica Johnson:
Because part of the reason why
you want to come to college is

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.070
Jessica Johnson:
so that you meet people that
aren't in your typical group

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.380
Jessica Johnson:
of friends.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.680 position:56%
Katelyn Scanlan:
Three residential colleges have just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.780
Katelyn Scanlan:
freshmen and sophomores.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.170
Katelyn Scanlan:
And then other residential colleges

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.670
Katelyn Scanlan:
are four-year colleges.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.660 position:81%
Katelyn Scanlan:
For instance, Mathey is the sister college of Rocky.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.260 position:58%
Katelyn Scanlan:
Rocky has freshmen and sophomores and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.010
Katelyn Scanlan:
Mathey has all classes.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.220
[music]

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.590
Victoria Hoss:
A lot ofupperclassmen are also

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.200
Victoria Hoss:
choosing to stay in Butler
because it's so nice.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.390
Victoria Hoss:
So that I think, as a different
dynamic-- because

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.080
Victoria Hoss:
you don't just have sophomores
and freshmen-- you get to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.190 position:73%
Victoria Hoss:
interact with upperclassmen who
can help you out with Org-O (organic chemistry)

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.200
Victoria Hoss:
and stuff like that, which
is really helpful.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.690
Jennifer Yeh:
Living in Butler
is wonderful, which is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.170 position:56%
Jennifer Yeh:
actually the reason that I'm
still in Butler as an upperclassman.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.580
Jennifer Yeh:
And so you have a social and
academic network that's there

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.320
Jennifer Yeh:
backing you up the entire time.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.350
[music]

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.230
Katelyn Scanlan:
Each residential college has some

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.790
Katelyn Scanlan:
kind of character.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.970
Katelyn Scanlan:
And it's usually a reflection
of the Master of the College

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.730
Katelyn Scanlan:
and the kind of character of
the students that happen to

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.740
Katelyn Scanlan:
make up a certain class.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.760 position:81%
Yien Hao ("Mark") Lock:
What I really like about Whitman is the dining hall.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.260
Yien Hao ("Mark") Lock:
I've been here for four years
and every time I come here,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.780
Yien Hao ("Mark") Lock:
there's always people I know.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.450
Malavika Balachandran:
You can walk into a study room, and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.080
Malavika Balachandran:
it's always filled with people
and you know that you're never

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.010
Malavika Balachandran:
really alone.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.200 position:66%
Lauren Schwartz:
Forbes used to be a hotel, and it's really

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.730
Lauren Schwartz:
neat because some rooms even
have their own bathroom.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.200
Lauren Schwartz:
So it's kind of like being
Eloise at the Plaza, only it's

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.190
Lauren Schwartz:
not so much pink.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.080 position:63%
Charquia Wright: It has beautiful views.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.010 position:64%
Maxim Botstein:
It's really interesting, architecturally,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.960
Maxim Botstein:
so it's really fun to
walk down the halls.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.810
Maxim Botstein:
And you can see how it
changes from a new

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.290
Maxim Botstein:
wing to the main Inn.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.230 position:61%
Owen Knights:
Well, I think Wilson College is special

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.520 position:80%
Owen Knights:
because we have some tremendous academic resources.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.150
Daniel Yeboah-Kordieh:
I'm from Ghana, Accra,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.590
Daniel Yeboah-Kordieh:
and I'm an international
student living in Wilson College.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.180
Eduardo Cadava:
Well, it was the first college.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.280 position:75%
Eduardo Cadava:
In the late '50s, some students got together and
went to the then-president,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.270 position:58%
Eduardo Cadava:
President Goheen, and made a case for
an alternative to the eating clubs.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.280
Eduardo Cadava:
It was a place where students
could gather

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.170 position:86%
Eduardo Cadava:
together with faculty. They would invite faculty and it
was a kind of template for

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.970
Eduardo Cadava:
the residential college systems.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.440 position:59%
Alesia Dechkoskaia:
It's next to Frist Campus Center where
you can get late meal and do homework.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.430 position:56%
Alesia Dechkoskaia:
It's close to some of the libraries.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.900 position:88%
Daniel Yeboah-Kordieh:
Trust me. If you're in Wilson, you're in the best place.

Akshata Shirahatti:
Rocky's just, in my opinion, the most
beautiful part of campus.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.910 position:66%
Akshata Shirahatti:
The Gothic architecture really makes for a
great place to live.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.690 position:69%
Sean Drohan:
The best thing about living in Rocky is that
you live in a castle.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.350
Akshata Shirahatti:
Jeff Nunokawa, our
college Master is great.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.770 position:61%

My favorite part about being in Mathey is the

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.330
Sascha Brown:
activities that they put on for us.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.190

Wicked, and one to The Lion King.

We're from all over the world.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.760

Sanjeev Kulkarni:
particularly friendly, collegial,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.920

Victoria Hoss:
We're all usually

Victoria Hoss:
outside playing or studying.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.740

We're a pretty active group.

Most people who graduated will tell you

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.410
Jessica Johnson:
that they were greatly impacted
by their time in the

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.150
Jessica Johnson:
residential college, whether
they choose to live there as

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.280

They stay really attached to
their residential college

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.110

because of the really close
nature of their friendships,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.400
Yien Hao ("Mark") Lock:
starting in their freshman
and sophomore years.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.220

Princeton tries to make us all
into a community and form

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.570

friendships that are going to
be meaningful to us for the
