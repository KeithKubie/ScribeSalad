[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.650
SCOT PANSING: Our guest today
is William Knoedelseder.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.090
Full disclosure, he's
a friend of mine.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.170
So going to be calling
him Bill, William,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.120
a little interchangeably.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.530
Bill worked at the LA
Times from 1977 to 1989,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.240
where he was part of the
whole music industry payola

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.670
situation, helped
to blow that up.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.770
And that resulted in his book,
"Stiffed: A True Story of MCA,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.500
the Music Business,
and the Mafia."

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.760
His latest book is called
"Bitter Brew: The Rise and Fall

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.440
of Anheuser-Busch and
America's Kings of Beer,"

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.234
of which he has already been
to Google to speak about.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:48.150
You may remember that.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.520
And that is on the
YouTube channel.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.460
In 2010, "I'm Dying Up Here:
Heartbreak and High Times

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.230
in Stand-Up Comedy's
Golden Era,"

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.801
was released, which is
now a Showtime show.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:01.800
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.340
So without further ado,
please welcome back

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.920
to Google William Knoedelseder.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.060
The book, I have to say,
Bill, is an amazing document

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.040
of the rebirth
and transformation

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.090
of American stand-up comedy.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.550
So again, thank
you for being here.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.200
I feel like it's kind
of an "On the Road,"

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.990
or maybe "Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test" for comedians,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.530
or at least people interested
in stand-up comedy.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.790
But I'm going to throw you
a real softball here first.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.400
But it's an important softball.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.440
Bill, what is the
biggest difference

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.670
between your book and the
show, "I'm Dying Up Here?"

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.220
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Mine is true.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.230
And theirs is fictionalized,
based on the real events.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.201
But they didn't do
the real characters.

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:54.450
And there's a reason for that.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.870
And I wasn't surprised.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.540
And I was supportive of that.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.350
The story in the book
basically takes place

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.000
in about a year
and a half's time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.789
And it involves all these
real life guys, and women,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.700
mostly guys, who went on to
considerable fame and fortune.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.370
But the TV series,
they want the TV series

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160
to be on for five years.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.750
And so do I.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.410
They had to be able to
have the creative license

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.520
to make up things.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.436
And they didn't want to
have things coming out

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.030
of David Letterman's
mouth at age 27

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.830
that David Letterman didn't say.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.505
So to keep it tightly to the
story in the book limited

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.080
the ability to have five
years' worth of material.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.390
So that's what they do.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.200
That's a normal
thing in Hollywood.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.700
So that would be
the big difference.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.320
You're not going to see David
Letterman or Leno or any

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.620
of the guys and gals
who are in the book.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.782
SCOT PANSING: We see
some, like Johnny Carson,

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:52.740
or certain people are--

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.240
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Carson, he's the only person.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.370
Richard Pryor, they have
a Richard Pryor in there.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.211
SCOT PANSING: And the "Let's
Make a Deal" host, Monty Hall.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:02:59.960
He's real, though.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.010
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Yes, I know.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.940
But I could sit there
and see all myriad things

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.939
that they got from the
book that so-and-so said,

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.980
but they're coming out of
this character's mouth.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.521
And it happened this
way in the book,

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.340
but they've changed it to this.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.670
And the world that they create,
and the relationships they

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.800
create are all accurate.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.155
I mean, they're all from
that world, in that time.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.300
SCOT PANSING: Yeah, it
seemed like they sort of--

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.822
I noticed that some things that
were maybe the same character,

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:36.780
they would take those
anecdotes and spread them

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.100
among two separate characters.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.980
Or this character, this happened
to him and now this other thing

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.188
happened to him from another.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.772
But it still all kind of works.

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:43.905
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Right.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:45.600
And their idea going
into this, and I

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.830
knew this from the outset,
was that they wanted to-- this

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.800
was Jim Carrey's
idea, that he went

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.070
through this same
system of club comics

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.600
out here, the same place.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.710
He went through about 10 years
after the events in the book.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.430
And he was fascinated
by doing a TV series

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.080
about the dark side of comedy.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.700
And there is
definitely a dark side

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.480
to these people who get
up on a stage like this

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.970
with a microphone
and they try and get

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.040
that audience to love them.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.890
And they bring a lot of
baggage to the stage.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.340
There's a reason that they
were compelled to do that.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.300
So that all comes out.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.021
So their idea was
that it was going

00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:27.270
to be the dark side of comedy.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.820
That was the way they'd
sold it to the network.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.760
So it's a little
darker than in my book.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.800
But that's fine.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.080
I mean, when the book--

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.160
when the real events
took place, 30 years ago,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.880
you didn't see comics
everywhere all the time.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.200
Comics weren't ubiquitous.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.200
Matter of fact, the only place
you saw comics in America

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.180
is you saw them on
the Ed Sullivan Show,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.340
or you saw them on the
Johnny Carson Tonight Show.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.000
That was it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.700
And if they didn't
get on those shows,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.740
they didn't have a career.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.100
And if you wanted
to see a comic live,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.930
you had to go to two clubs.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.090
One was in New York
and one was here.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.490
And there were no videotapes
that were being sent around.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.910
There was no channel to watch
comics on, wall to wall.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.640
So it was a much
smaller profession.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.450
And they were young
and desperate to get

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.170
in front of some sort of media
so they would have a career

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.570
and they could make
money being funny.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.162
And it wasn't as easy--

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:32.120
not that it's easy now.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.086
But there's
certainly much more--

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:35.461
SCOT PANSING: A
few more avenues.

00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:38.670
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: --outlets
than there was back then.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.670
SCOT PANSING: They
definitely captured, I think,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.720
in the show, the sort of
control that Goldy or Mitzi--

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.904
Goldy's a real person
in the show, too,

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:51.570
although the name's
just changed, right?

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.819
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Exactly.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.880
SCOT PANSING: But where she
doesn't even pay them at first,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.901
and she's like, look,
this is access to Carson.

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:00.400
And that's what
you're getting here.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.270
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
That's how it worked.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.920
What happened was, the
history of this was--

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.670
and my role then, I
was a junior reporter

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.380
at the Los Angeles Times.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.260
And my editor called me in
one day and said, you know,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.570
there's something going on
here with these young comics

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.820
here in town that feels like
Greenwich Village in the 1960s.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.360
And would you like to
cover the comedy beat?

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.730
So he decided that we
would have a comedy beat,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.124
when I was the exact same
age as all these people.

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:29.540
And I thought,
there's going to be

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.790
a comedy beat for
the LA Times, and I'm

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.300
going to get to cover it?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.350
And so it was like
the dream job,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.410
because they were all 26 or 27.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.050
And what happened was in '73
or '74, the Carson Show, which

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.629
was the only place
you could see comics,

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.420
he decided he wanted
to live in California.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.419
He didn't like New York.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.300
So he moved the show to Burbank.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.000
And what happened was that all
the comics lived in New York,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.030
because you had to be someplace
where the talent scouts

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.120
for the Tonight Show walked into
the club and saw you and said,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.560
yeah, you can be on the show.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.280
Well, you could hear the
suitcases of all the class

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.060
clowns packing.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.060
The minute he moved out
here, they literally-- there

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.450
was this invisible
immigration of class clowns

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.050
that just within a couple years,
packed up, left home, and came

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.980
out to-- and moved into
crappy little apartments

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.110
in West Hollywood.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.350
And they formed this
sort of community.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.850
And I got the amazing job
of, OK, you cover that.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.280
Find out what's going
on with those people,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.600
because it's a really
unusual art form.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.820
Who's happening?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.390
Who's funny?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.490
What's different
about them that's

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.800
different from the other guys,
the Bill Cosbys and the Bob

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.300
Newharts?

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.977
So what's different
about these people?

00:07:42.977 --> 00:07:44.810
And who's going to
happen next and all that?

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.350
That was my job.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.240
And I got to sit there,
right there in the front row,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.600
as all these people
walked up on the stage,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.240
sometimes for the first time,
and tried to make people laugh.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.940
And it was the best
gig I ever had.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.440
SCOT PANSING: Sounds
pretty awesome.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:00.920
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
So yeah, it was great.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.253
So 30 years later, here you
are, still talking about it.

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:07.670
Because at the time, my
editor, who was my mentor--

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.260
he's passed on now--

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.000
he had a sense that there were
something meaningful going on.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.720
And it was.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.450
There was something really
meaningful going on.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.950
And I didn't realize
it at the time,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.820
because I was fresh from
St. Louis, my first gig.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.460
They were trying out a
whole new kind of comedy

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.760
that wasn't just set-ups
and one-liners and the stuff

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.040
that you saw Bob Hope do.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.530
Bob Hope never made me laugh
one time in all my life.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.250
I would watch him and I
just never chuckled once.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.049
So these kids were
making up new stuff.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.900
And they were talking about
sex, and their mothers,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.449
and blah blah blah, and it was
all a different kind of humor.

00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:47.740
SCOT PANSING: It's that
transition from the suit comic,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.710
like Carlin in a suit
to Carlin in a sweater.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.960
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Exactly.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.500
Carlin changed the
thing in mid-sentence.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.360
And Richard Pryor did, too.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.340
I mean, they had both
been the suit comics on--

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.010
and they would do the
traditional jokes.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.964
They were doing-- the big guy
was Bill Cosby and Bob Newhart.

00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:05.630
It was routines.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.250
And they were funny.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.326
But they didn't relate to
people who were 10, 12, 15

00:09:11.326 --> 00:09:12.325
years younger than them.

00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:13.326
They didn't.

00:09:13.326 --> 00:09:14.700
And the other
thing was is that--

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.410
and this comes into
play in the show now,

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.130
they did pick up on this--

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:26.840
at the time, in America, young
women weren't class clowns.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.570
I was never in a class where
the girl was the funny one.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.560
It was always the guy.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.700
They weren't given license to
be funny and speak up in class.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.050
And they didn't have
any role models.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.570
With role models they saw, they
would see these older women

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.050
who sort of did this
self-deprecating, harried

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.040
housewife camera.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.050
And it didn't relate
to them at all.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.690
So they didn't really
want to be comics.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.170
So there wasn't a
wealth of people,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.450
women packing up their bags
and moving to Los Angeles.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.300
At one time, we
calculated that in 1978,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.750
when I started doing this,
there was 300 stand-up comics

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.380
in Los Angeles.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.713
Well, that's the most stand-up
comics that at that point

00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:06.810
had ever been anywhere.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.800
And probably 20 of them women.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.940
The ratio was that--

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.480
the discrepancy was that big.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.790
So it was a guy thing.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.040
And they get that in the show.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.954
That's one of the things
they cover in the show.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.370
SCOT PANSING: The
character Cassie

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.291
seems almost like a cross
between like Elayne Boosler

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.040
and Sandra Bernhard
or something, at least

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.180
with the struggles of
the women back then.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.255
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Right, right.

00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:30.350
I think it's mostly--

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.960
I mean, they-- in
the show, she's

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.730
the only woman who's among them.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.110
That would be
Elayne, because she

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.290
was the only woman among
the group of guys that

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.170
went to Canter's and all that.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.920
That's all fairly
accurate, although she's

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.307
not at all like Elayne.

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.640
SCOT PANSING: But again, there
are fictional characters.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.800
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah, it
doesn't matter to the audience.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.000
They didn't see Elayne.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.055
SCOT PANSING: I thought
they did a really good--

00:10:51.055 --> 00:10:53.846
you mentioned all the suitcases
coming across the country.

00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:55.220
I think they did
a good job with,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.140
I think the actor's Clark
Duke and his friend.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.420
But the two guys from Boston.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.450
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Yeah, but that was--

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.410
SCOT PANSING: Sleeping
in the closet.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.960
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
You know how it works.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.724
They have these two characters.

00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:03.890
And they made them two guys.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.300
They come from Boston.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.174
But all the background
that you see of them

00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:09.590
is why they leave Boston and
what they're doing in Boston.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.850
That's Jay Leno.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.730
That's Leno's playing in The
Combat Zone with strippers

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.160
on the stage and all that.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.050
They took Leno's
background from the book

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.090
and then gave it to
these two characters,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.300
because it served their dramatic
needs more than just one guy,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.800
I guess.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.930
I mean, I wasn't--

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.500
I'm not part of the show.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.990
My job was to write the book
and accept money for that

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.420
and from them.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.210
And I was happy.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.080
SCOT PANSING: It's a good job.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.140
But what is it like?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.720
Can you take us through
a little bit of--

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.080
the book comes out in 2010.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.124
And you mentioned to
me a long time ago

00:11:42.124 --> 00:11:43.790
that Jim Carrey had
optioned the rights.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.951
So at least can you tell me
what happens from that point?

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:49.576
What happened--

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:50.360
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: You
want the whole 30-year book?

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.990
SCOT PANSING: What happens--

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.920
no.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.810
What happens when
they option your book?

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.392
And what happens from there?

00:11:55.392 --> 00:11:56.850
Did you speak to
Jim Carrey at all?

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:56.878
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Never.

00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:56.950
I've never spoken to him.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.050
SCOT PANSING: I also know that
he played Andy Kaufman in "Man

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.670
in the Moon."

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.800
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: He did.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.310
SCOT PANSING: And you have
an Andy Kaufman connection.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.380
But you never worked
with him on that movie.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.474
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:08.390
The way it worked was
that the book came out--

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.098
I can't remember when
the book came out--

00:12:10.098 --> 00:12:12.490
and they very quickly
optioned the book.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.920
And optioning a book
means they pay you

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.440
so that they can then hold
the rights while they go out

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.871
and try and make a deal.

00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:21.620
And then nobody else
is trying to sell it.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.110
So they pay you some
amount of money.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.280
It's not usually
very much money.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.180
And I found out-- this was
my first experience going all

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.130
the way through the process--

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.560
I've since had it happen again--

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.010
but this is my first ride--

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.380
how long it takes
to get everything

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.020
that you need to get together
to get something on television.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.330
Somebody has to be willing to
sign on to be the show runner

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.850
and do all this, and maybe
spend the next four or five

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.175
years of their life
doing this at the price

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:56.300
that they're being offered.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.690
And the network has to--

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.630
and it literally took, I
guess four years for them

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.400
to set up a thing at Showtime.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.280
And then it took another year.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.230
So it was all
totaled, six years,

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.220
I think, from the time the book
came out to where we are now.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:12.920
Or maybe more.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.730
SCOT PANSING: Seven, I think.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.060
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Seven.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.790
SCOT PANSING:
That's a long time.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.498
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
That's a long time.

00:13:16.498 --> 00:13:18.500
Fortunately, I had
other things to do.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.292
And it wasn't my
headache, because I didn't

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:21.458
have to deal with any of it.

00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:22.800
They were just off doing it.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.960
And they had to go
hire all these people.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.890
And it's a difficult
thing to do.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:33.630
They have to hire people who can
write bad comedy intentionally.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.940
Bad comedy in 1970, so
it has to be authentic.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.691
But these are supposedly young
comics doing stuff and bombing

00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:43.190
on stage.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.670
Well, someone's
got to write that.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.160
And you've got to be able to
get what they were going after

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.510
and why it missed or
it doesn't make sense.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:49.820
SCOT PANSING: It still
needs to be entertaining.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.111
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Well,
I can't imagine doing that.

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:53.790
That's a very hard thing to do.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.165
SCOT PANSING: I'd
like to go back

00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:57.340
a little bit to your
time with the LA Times,

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.210
and during this era that
is touched on in the book,

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.202
but I've only seen
three episodes so far.

00:14:02.202 --> 00:14:03.660
I'm not sure if
they bring this in.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.600
But talk to me a little
bit about Andy Kaufman

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.020
and how you got to
basically ride shotgun

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.115
during his experience
with Tony Clifton.

00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:13.740
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
As I said, my job

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.540
was to go find out who
was the next big person.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:23.057
I mean, I was there the first
night Robin Williams broke big.

00:14:23.057 --> 00:14:25.140
And nobody had ever seen
anything quite like that.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.279
He jumped up on stage and
everybody's mouth just dropped.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.820
And he was up there
doing this stuff.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.770
And it was like, oh my god.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.750
There was no template for that.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.330
And there was no template for
what Andy Kaufman was doing.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.430
And so they were all
coming out and arriving.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.980
Andy came from New Jersey
somewhere, Colts Neck or White

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.240
Plains or something like that.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.400
He came out of nowhere.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.750
And he was just bizarre.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.694
He didn't really--
he did it on a stage,

00:14:50.694 --> 00:14:52.110
but he wasn't a
stand-up comedian.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.950
He did performance art.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.960
And so I wanted to--

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.366
he had a character who
was an alter ego of his

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:03.240
that he had never admitted
was his character.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.620
And his name was Tony Clifton.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.010
And he was this terrible,
abusive lounge singer.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.990
And Andy portrayed him.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.698
He would go on stage,
but he would always

00:15:10.698 --> 00:15:12.050
deny that that was him.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.870
It takes a kind of personality
to make that work with everyone

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.280
and never break character,
even though you all

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.180
know it's really him.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.630
He would never admit it.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.560
And when he was on
the show "Taxi,"

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.650
he convinced the executive
producer of a hit network

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.820
show to hire Tony
Clifton in a role.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.500
And you understand, it's not me.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.370
I just know Tony.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.954
He's telling these Hollywood
producers in the studio.

00:15:35.954 --> 00:15:37.620
So they think this
might be a funny bit.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.300
So they hire Tony.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.640
And Andy was a vitamin
gulping, vegan, nonsmoking guy.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:51.180
And Tony was-- as Tony, he was
a whore-mongering, drunken,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.260
porno-consuming asshole.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.757
So they hired Tony.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.340
And of course, Andy
was off that week.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.173
And they hired Tony.

00:16:00.173 --> 00:16:03.750
And he was going to portray
a character on the show

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.520
with the rest of the cast.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.440
Now the rest of the cast
wasn't OK with this,

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.270
because Tony was an asshole.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.460
And he had a
trailer out in back.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.640
And he drank all day.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.430
And he had hookers
in the trailer.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.110
And he was abusive
to all the women,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.700
because that was the character.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.740
So it was really untenable.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.160
And they decided--
they couldn't talk

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.890
to Andy, because Andy wouldn't
admit that he was Tony.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.600
So they had to fire Tony.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.500
These are executive
producers of a major hit show

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.570
down at Paramount,
on the Paramount lot,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.430
who are going, what we do?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.890
OK, we'll fire Tony.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.630
We'll just let him go.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.080
And Andy's cast, they
were furious at this guy,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080
because he screwed
up everything.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.190
And so of course, Andy's
got something going on here.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.030
He tells his manager to call
up the guy from the LA Times,

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.114
because I was the LA Times
guy who covered comics.

00:16:53.114 --> 00:16:54.946
And they wanted to get
in front of me really

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.430
badly, because I'd
write about them

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.750
and they'd be in the LA Times.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.130
So I was important.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.950
So they invited me.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.700
They said something's going
to happen on the set today.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.329
And they made sure
that I was there.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.579
And I didn't know what it was.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:06.960
But I was doing a story.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.940
I was in the middle
doing a story on Andy.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.300
I went down and I had my camera.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.589
And I was sitting
there in the stands

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.079
as this whole thing unfolds.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.010
Tony comes.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.980
He comes onto the set where
they're all getting ready.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.119
And the other players are
all there glowering at him.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.490
And he's got these two hookers.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.620
And he's reeking of booze.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.369
But he's got presents
for the whole staff.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.760
And he's handing them out.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.672
And the executive producers
tell him he's fired.

00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:34.380
Andy, I'm saying.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:34.880
It's not Andy.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.440
It's Tony.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.560
I forgot.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.480
They fire him and he goes crazy.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.470
And they have to call
in the security guards.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.470
He starts fighting them.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.011
And I'm sitting
there with my camera.

00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:46.260
So I just start taking
pictures of this.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.010
And they struggle.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.260
They get him out in the alley.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.220
And I'm out in the
alley taking pictures.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.235
And then the security guards
set upon me and grab my camera

00:17:53.235 --> 00:17:54.030
and take my camera.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.145
I mean, this is--

00:17:55.145 --> 00:17:56.850
and they haul Tony,
and they literally

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.304
throw him off the lot.

00:17:58.304 --> 00:17:59.970
And I'm sitting there
without my camera.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.350
And I'm on assignment
for the LA Times

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.766
and they've
confiscated my camera.

00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:04.020
I get it back.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.340
And that was it.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.340
I mean, that's how they
got rid of Tony Clifton.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.092
But the pictures that I took
still are on the internet.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.050
And they're famous now.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.750
I get a call once
or twice a year.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.400
Somebody realizes that I own
the rights to that picture.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.380
Can they buy the
rights to reprint

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.527
the picture, a famous picture of
Andy Kaufman, as Tony Clifton,

00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:25.110
being thrown off the
lot at Paramount?

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.880
But it was bizarre.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.210
And then what happened was
after that they called me--

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:35.370
somehow Andy's people got my
camera back from the guards--

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.710
and they said that Tony
would like to meet me

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.130
that night, just the two of us.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.130
And I said, that's fine.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.630
OK, I said, we'll do that.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.789
So I met Tony at this bar on--

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:49.080
I think it was on Hollywood
Boulevard, some sleazy bar.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.840
Oh no, I met him at a motel
on Sunset, a hooker motel.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.350
Oh my god.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.256
And we went for a drink
across the street.

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:58.380
It's a place that I picked.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.890
And he started hitting
on the owner's daughter.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.500
This guy, who was
going to kill us.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.061
But Andy would not break
his character at all.

00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:07.560
He wouldn't.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.829
He just stayed with
the guy, with Tony.

00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:11.370
And I finally had
to leave, because I

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.340
thought that we were going
to get in really bad trouble.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.090
And that was fine.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:15.881
I was a journalist.

00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:18.530
But I don't have to go to jail
with him to get the story.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.472
You go ahead.

00:19:19.472 --> 00:19:20.610
That was it.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.729
So I wrote that story up.

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:23.520
And then, of course,
some of that, I guess,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.262
ended up in the book years
later with Jim Carrey.

00:19:27.262 --> 00:19:28.970
SCOT PANSING: I mean,
didn't he perform--

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.595
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
He was very good.

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:33.040
SCOT PANSING: --for you
at your house, as well?

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.250
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
[INAUDIBLE] while I was

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.650
preparing, before this
evening happened--

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.270
so I knew Andy was odd, I
was going to interview him

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.230
for this profile.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.240
I was going to do the
first big major newspaper

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.652
profile on this guy
named Andy Kaufman,

00:19:47.652 --> 00:19:49.110
the world really
didn't know about.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.120
They knew something
about him, but not much.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.320
He had just appeared
on this TV show.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.350
So he was a guy on a TV
show, but nobody really

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.810
knew what he was other
than that weird character.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.720
So I was going to interview him.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.140
And a couple of nights
before that was to happen,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.360
days, a couple days before,
I get a call at 7:00

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.090
at night, 8:00, whatever, and
he says, hi, this is Andy,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.190
can I come over?

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.370
And I thought, to my house?

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.140
Yeah, OK.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.420
I said, well, yeah, OK.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.930
So he shows up a
half an hour later.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.490
He comes walking into my
house, this crazy comic,

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.537
with a suitcase full of--
like an old vaudeville

00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:24.330
suitcase full of clothes.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.300
And he proceeded to do
his whole act in pantomime

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.910
out on my patio.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.282
And then he would go
change into another outfit

00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:33.990
and then come back
out and do the whole--

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.412
Oh, yes-- oh, yeah.

00:20:37.412 --> 00:20:38.370
I'm waving this around.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.995
And I'm supposed to
be talking into it.

00:20:39.995 --> 00:20:40.830
Imagine that.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.040
So anyway, that was
another bizarre thing.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.260
And then he left.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.270
So I became sort of the
resident world expert

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.750
on Andy Kaufman for years.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.010
And the weird thing
is that I have

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.930
a son who's 25 who has a picture
from that night where he-- oh,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.009
the rest of the night that he
was on my patio, he had it,

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:02.550
he changed into his
wrestling outfit.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.800
And he wanted to
wrestle my wife, who

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.520
was then eight months pregnant.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.330
And I have a picture of him.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.030
And she was like five
feet tall and pregnant.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.010
And he wanted to wrestle her.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.600
So the pictures
from that night are

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.570
on my son's wall in his room.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.550
And every time one of his new
friend comes in, they go, whoa,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.070
you got a picture
of Andy Kaufman.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.560
I wouldn't have imagined
that anyone 25 would

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.960
know who Andy Kaufman is.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.640
No, they all know
who Andy Kaufman is.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.722
And they cannot believe that
Colin's dad actually knew Andy

00:21:35.722 --> 00:21:37.680
Kaufman and actually had
an encounter with him,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.200
because he's that legendary.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.660
SCOT PANSING: Well, no one
believed him when he got sick.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.910
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Exactly.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.390
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
It's crazy.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.734
People still think
he's still alive.

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:48.900
So anyway, but I'll hold it.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.025
SCOT PANSING: Thanks for
sharing that part with me.

00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:53.550
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: That's
one of my brushes with fame.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.550
SCOT PANSING: I think I even saw
on maybe Don Cheadle's Twitter

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.060
or something where it's a
caricature of Donald Trump,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.700
but he's pulling off a costume,
and it's actually Andy Kaufman.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.960
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Yeah, it's Andy Kaufman.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.340
No, he definitely did die.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.607
The weird thing was he died
of some kind of lung cancer

00:22:08.607 --> 00:22:10.440
or something like that,
and he didn't smoke.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.590
Didn't drink, and
had vitamins lined up

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.410
in his kitchen for miles.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.702
So just goes to show
you, be careful.

00:22:20.702 --> 00:22:21.660
SCOT PANSING: For sure.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.243
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I think
it was vitamins that killed him.

00:22:24.243 --> 00:22:25.660
SCOT PANSING: Too many vitamins?

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.970
Maybe.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.000
You talked about Robin Williams,
seeing him before he blew up,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.380
before "Mork and Mindy."

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.570
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: It
was right at that time.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.480
He wasn't really imprinted.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.690
I think it was like a week
or two before that hit,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.940
but he was just
like a normal guy.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.680
And then it became huge,
because if you think about it,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.280
the way things are
now, "Mork and Mindy"

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.630
was the TV show that he went on.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:49.526
He was unknown.

00:22:49.526 --> 00:22:51.150
"Mork and Mindy" was
watched every week

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.340
by 57 million people.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.170
That's the kind of audience.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.870
A hit show now, you
have 10 million people.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.210
They got 57 million people.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.480
So he became so famous, so fast.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.300
It wasn't like he got recognized
when he went out on the street.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.280
He would get mobbed
out on the street.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.830
And two months before, he'd
just been some comic working

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.611
at The Comedy Store for free.

00:23:14.611 --> 00:23:16.110
SCOT PANSING: And
Richard Lewis also

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.670
had a big part in the book.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.190
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Richard Lewis.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.150
SCOT PANSING: And
you're friends with him.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.510
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I got
to know Richard pretty well.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.870
I got to know some of them.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.330
They were different.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.820
I was a journalist, and
they were the performers.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.380
So there was a--

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.840
SCOT PANSING: His story is
pretty central in the book,

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.220
though, with his friend
Steve and whatnot.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.210
And I see them working parts
of that also into the show,

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.460
but in different ways.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.190
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah,
that was a story line.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.220
The thing about the book,
the way it happened was I

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.930
did all this, I covered
this whole thing

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.190
for a couple of years.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:52.700
And then there was an event
that happened in mid-1979.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.400
It was a tragedy occurred to
one of this group of people.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.640
And it was really upsetting.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.480
But it was an amazing story.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.334
And after that was
done, I'd been doing it

00:24:03.334 --> 00:24:04.250
for a year and a half.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.900
And I literally
asked my editor--

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.170
I said, I feel like
I'm done with this.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.450
I feel like I'd rather
move on to another--

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.220
because it was getting kind
of heavy, because it was real.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.197
They were trying
really, really hard.

00:24:16.197 --> 00:24:17.780
And a lot of them
were living in cars.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.613
And they were broke.

00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:20.150
And it was a very
emotional thing.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.330
And I was seeing
the dark side of it.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.595
They were so desperate.

00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:25.970
And there was a
lot of-- and they

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.430
would call me in the middle
of the night and want to talk.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.080
And they were very funny.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.090
But there was a sad side of it.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.010
So I asked off the comedy beat.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.320
I was probably put on
the organized crime

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.146
beat, which was a relief.

00:24:42.146 --> 00:24:44.960
Oh, they have so
many less problems.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.760
They're just brutal.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.810
They're direct about it.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.435
They're brutal.

00:24:48.435 --> 00:24:51.430
That's all right.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.360
But then what happened
was-- but that story,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.830
the story about what happened
was a big story that people

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.385
remember years later.

00:24:59.385 --> 00:25:01.400
And I'd have
somebody mention it,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.467
because we did a
really big long form

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:06.050
article in the
calendar section, which

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.570
had never been done before.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.300
And I always remembered it
as a big thing in my career,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.780
because it kicked off
my narrative career.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.200
And then one day, about
27 years after all that

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.760
happened, I was
reading the paper

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.024
and I saw an obit of a
comedian named George--

00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:28.190
SCOT PANSING: George Miller?

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.360
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.560
George Miller,
yeah, George Miller.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.860
See, you forget a name like--

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.290
SCOT PANSING: That's
why I'm here, Bill.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.456
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: You
forget a name like Miller.

00:25:33.456 --> 00:25:34.490
It's forgettable.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:35.990
And George had died.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.080
And I remember George, because
he'd been a source of mine

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.750
back when all this
stuff was happening.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.670
And he was a great guy.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.760
And it said that he'd been--

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.380
and I knew George
back at the time.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.990
He was David
Letterman's best friend.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.790
And they lived right
across the street

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.680
from The Comedy
Store and all that.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.740
And the article
said that they were

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.010
having a public memorial
for him at The Laugh

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.020
Factory on Sunset on Sunday.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.179
So I thought, wow, you know
what, I'm going to go to that.

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:07.970
Because I haven't seen
those guys in years.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.178
And we were all the same age.

00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:11.030
We were all 26, 27 years old.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.550
So years later,
one of them died.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.890
And I thought that maybe
they'll all come back.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.730
It'll be like a
Big Chill moment.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.910
And so I went over there
on a Sunday afternoon.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.230
And sure enough, they all did.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.860
All of a sudden, all these
people came walking back in.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.230
Richard, and the
only one who didn't--

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.860
Leno, and now we're all 50, and
a little thicker and gray hair.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.880
But to a person,
when they got up

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.360
to talk about George,
this guy that they

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.800
had known for all these
years, every one of them,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.320
their reference point
was this four-year period

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.290
between 1975 and '79,
when they were all

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.180
working at The Comedy Store.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.330
Some of them in the room had
gone on to lead huge lives

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.220
and make millions
of dollars and were

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.930
recognized wherever they go.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.440
But the time of their
life that they remember

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.710
were these four years when
they were working on this strip

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.430
here with this crazy little
woman who owned the club, who

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.989
had dominion over their lives,
and they were making no money

00:27:09.989 --> 00:27:11.030
and they were struggling.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.770
Looking back, that's when
they became who they are.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.740
That's what they think.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.690
And they all talked
about that four years.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.000
All their memories were settled.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.990
And I left there that afternoon
and thought, wow, boy, there's

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.670
a really great book in this.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.840
Because looking
back on that now,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.190
as they do, middle-aged
people, through the rosy glow

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.920
of memory, they have a
much better perspective

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.090
on what happened back then.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.190
Back then, they were all
just going through it.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:41.720
Now they had-- so I literally
sold the book like that

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.530
to my publisher.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.930
And everybody who I talked to
at 27, I was talking to at 55.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.510
And it was a great story.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.930
SCOT PANSING: And you were
able to go back and talk

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:51.200
to many of them.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.540
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: So I
mean, the whole thing was--

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.347
I researched the book
for 30 years, basically.

00:27:56.347 --> 00:27:57.930
And then it all sort
of came together.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.935
And it was fairly easy to
write, because I knew--

00:28:00.935 --> 00:28:04.490
and I still had notes from
27-year-old Richard Lewis,

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.540
from an interview I did back
on my back porch in 1979,

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.820
because I kept all that stuff.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.502
So it was a great experience
being able to do that.

00:28:13.502 --> 00:28:14.960
SCOT PANSING: One
other name I just

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.480
want to mention before we
get a little more current

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.460
is someone I wasn't too
familiar with until I

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.914
read the book was Tom Dreesden?

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:22.580
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Tom Dreesen, yeah.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.160
SCOT PANSING: And
he sort of became

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.326
the rep of the younger guys.

00:28:25.326 --> 00:28:28.670
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Well, he's
sort of the hero of the book.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:33.680
Tom was a comic who was a few
years older than most of them.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.010
He'd come from a very poor
background, where a lot of them

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.319
were upper middle class
kids, went to college

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:44.610
and they were all college
graduates and all that stuff.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.730
So Tom was three or
four years older.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.230
And he'd grown up really poor
and kind of worked his way up.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.660
And he was married
and had a family.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.800
And even though they were
27 and Tom was 32, 33.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.750
So he was like a father
figure to a lot of them.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.580
He was making
money and all that.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.327
So what happened--

00:29:07.327 --> 00:29:08.660
I have to talk about the strike.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.880
What happened is after
a couple of years

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.630
of working for Mitzi
Shore at The Comedy Store,

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.630
and she didn't pay them.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.130
The idea was, no,
this is not-- this

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.255
is not a place to get paid.

00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:20.630
I'll give you my stage and
you get hired in the business.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.460
So you work for me for free.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.150
And that's one of the things
that's in the TV series

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.467
that they build on.

00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:30.800
And they were willing to do
that, because that was true.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.780
If you got on the stage
at The Comedy Store,

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.370
like Freddie Prinze
did one night,

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.202
the next week he had a TV series
and he was rich and famous.

00:29:37.202 --> 00:29:38.660
So that's what they
were all doing.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.360
So she didn't pay them.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:46.220
But as 300 people converged
on town, not all of them

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:46.790
got famous.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.081
And the rest of them were
out here working for nothing.

00:29:49.081 --> 00:29:50.300
And they were desperate.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.841
And they were eating
out of dumpsters

00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:54.740
and living in their cars
and selling this and doing--

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.770
and it got kind of--

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.510
And actually, it was Leno
who sort of broached the idea

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.010
one night.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:03.620
They had just all been
played on a New Year's

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.610
Eve at the main room.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.110
And there had been
all these people.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.526
And Mitzi had made
all this money.

00:30:07.526 --> 00:30:12.120
And he said, shouldn't
we get paid for this?

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.525
It took four of us to pack
the room, but we packed it.

00:30:15.525 --> 00:30:17.900
And so he started talking--
and he didn't need the money.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.733
He was making money.

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:21.890
So what they did was they
formed a quasi-union.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.620
And the leader of it, the
guy who was the oldest

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.750
guy, who they--

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.040
Tom, you tell them--

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.850
Tom Dreesen, he became
he became a spokesman

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.470
and he became the leader of the
insurgency that went to Mitzi

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.560
and asked for--

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.250
can you pay us?

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.080
Can you pay us $5 a set?

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.490
And nope, she refused to do it.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.440
And she kept refusing,
kept refusing.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.860
And then finally, they realized
that the only thing they could

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.860
do-- they could keep
asking and getting refused,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.260
or they could throw a picket
line around that place

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.400
and go on strike.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.560
So that's what she did.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.680
And for me as a reporter,
I'd been covering these guys

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.540
as artists and comedians.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.629
And it was all fun and
games and all of that.

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.170
And all of a sudden
there was a story

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.110
that comedians are going on
strike at The Comedy Store.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.230
They have picket lines.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.110
And it was kind of
funny, a funny idea.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.270
So I went over to cover it.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.440
And all the networks were there.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.830
And they all covered
it for a day or two.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.746
And then they went on,
because they covered it

00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:20.380
for the goof of it.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.680
The comics are down there.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.430
They're picketing.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.600
And then they moved on.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.010
But they still
had the situation.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.650
And they had all risked
their careers by doing this.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.920
Because she was going to
punish them, they figured.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.570
And that's when the incident
occurred that I won't tell you

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.570
about, because I don't--

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.960
SCOT PANSING: Yeah,
don't ruin the book.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.660
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
I mean, I don't know

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.785
if you're going to read it.

00:31:38.785 --> 00:31:41.540
But if you do read it, you'll
be happy that I didn't tell you.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:48.350
And Dreesen, it's his legacy.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.430
And he did something.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.030
And now when Tom, he
tells me all the time,

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.570
because of the
book, he'll be out--

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.850
Tom works all the
time-- and he'll be out,

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.530
and some young comics will
come up with him and say,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.510
you know, man, I got
paid the first time

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.210
I walked on stage,
thanks to you,

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.160
because you went on
strike back then.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.000
And you got us paid.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.340
I don't get paid a lot.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.170
They actually get paid
less now than they

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.700
got paid after the strike.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.870
But they get paid.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.940
So Tom's this guy that
they all appreciate.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.690
SCOT PANSING: Sort of
set up the structure

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.137
for the '80s, where in Ohio,
there's Ha Has and Laugh-In.

00:32:24.137 --> 00:32:25.970
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Right after the strike

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.180
is when the whole comedy
thing broke wide open.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.460
And all of a sudden,
there was comedy channels

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.340
and there was syndicated
shows, improv this.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.340
And they got paid.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.970
If they hadn't done this, had
this incident not happened

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.019
and this strike taken place
in the spring of 1979,

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:44.810
maybe it would have
happened at some point.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.989
Somebody would have
done something.

00:32:46.989 --> 00:32:48.530
But this is what
caused it to happen.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.680
Because they shut down The
Comedy Store on Sunset Strip.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.420
They shut it down for weeks.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.670
And they made it so that
she could not operate.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.040
And they forced her
to negotiate with them

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.472
and begin paying them
for their services.

00:33:01.472 --> 00:33:03.180
I mean, she was paying
everybody else who

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.160
worked in the club,
the people who

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.030
cleaned the toilets,
the waiters, everybody.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.970
But she wasn't
paying the people who

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.330
were bringing in the crowds.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.700
And she literally,
legitimately--

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.840
in her mind, anyway--

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.570
her feeling was, no, this is--

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.860
and there was some truth
to what she was saying.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.230
She just wouldn't
see their side,

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.680
that she was making a lot of
money and driving a nice car

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.282
and they were getting nothing.

00:33:28.282 --> 00:33:29.740
But the minute the
strike was over,

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.820
the union went
away, because comics

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.177
and a union don't go together.

00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:35.010
They're not really--

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.819
SCOT PANSING: But it did set
the stage, really, for the '80s.

00:33:37.819 --> 00:33:39.235
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Oh, totally.

00:33:39.235 --> 00:33:41.510
SCOT PANSING: And I
know you don't really

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.710
say you like a lot of current
comedy or stand-up comics

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.490
very much, I know.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:47.750
But do you have--

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:48.200
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Oh, I do, but I just

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.366
don't want to pick them out.

00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:50.930
But I can tell
you who I do like.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:51.850
SCOT PANSING: Who do you like?

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.180
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I
think Louis C.K.'s brilliant.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.180
SCOT PANSING: Louis C.K.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.150
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Jim Jeffries.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.840
There's a lot of
them I don't know.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.541
Who do I think of that I like?

00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.040
SCOT PANSING: Do
you like Bill Burr?

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.850
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
I like Bill Burr.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:05.390
I know who he is.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.473
At least I know who he is.

00:34:06.473 --> 00:34:08.030
Amy Schumer, of
course, is great.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.980
She can be pretty raw at times.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.090
Sarah Silverman I love.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.000
SCOT PANSING: Do you go down
to the clubs ever still at all?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.916
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I
do every now and then.

00:34:18.916 --> 00:34:21.650
It's the only place I'm famous.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.815
SCOT PANSING: You
wrote the book on it.

00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:25.190
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
I think 2/3

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.750
of the copies of "I'm Dying"
ever sold were sold to comics.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.190
They all have a copy.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.199
And so if I go into a club,
it's like, oh, that's the guy.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.790
And they'll want to meet me.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.489
It's funny.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:37.489
It's a very small world.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.040
But it's good to be famous in
some little controllable group,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.590
I guess.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.000
So I enjoy going to comics.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.179
It's still very hard for me,
like it is hard for anyone

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.699
to watch a comic who's bombing.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.409
SCOT PANSING: It's
very uncomfortable.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.825
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I can't
bear it, because I feel bad.

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:57.440
And then every now and
then, like recently,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.800
I happened to be at The Improv,
meeting a friend for something.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.680
And because someone said,
oh, that's the guy that wrote

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.570
"I'm Dying Up Here,"
we got escorted

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.500
into the back room of The
Improv and seated at a table.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.560
And out walks Dave Chapelle
and does an hour off

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.240
the top of his head.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.160
Hysterical.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160
I mean, just hysterical.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.201
We were like slack jawed.

00:35:17.201 --> 00:35:19.880
I'd never seen
Dave Chapelle live.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.970
And he's just brilliant.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.890
I mean, he was as good that
night as I ever saw Pryor.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.540
I mean, and if you talk about
who do I think-- for me?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.790
SCOT PANSING: Top of all time.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.623
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
For me, Richard Pryor.

00:35:30.623 --> 00:35:32.530
He was the van Gogh
of stand-up comedy.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.030
There's never been
anybody better.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.010
There's van Gogh and
Pryor and all the rest

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.551
of them, which is not to say I
didn't like George Carlin, who

00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:40.700
I knew.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.560
But Richard Pryor set
the bar real high.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.097
And I think that if you really
did a poll, majority of them

00:35:51.097 --> 00:35:53.180
would come out that Richard
Pryor was the greatest

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.180
stand-up of the last
50, 60 years, anyway.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.080
SCOT PANSING: Sort of the
accepted, critically acclaimed.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.300
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Yeah, I would think.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.030
I could be wrong.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.070
There could be all
kinds of young people

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.195
say I don't know anything,
and they might be right.

00:36:03.195 --> 00:36:04.010
But I don't know.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.237
There's so many comics now.

00:36:05.237 --> 00:36:06.320
You can't keep up with it.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.740
Back then, there were not that
many to have to know about.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.616
Now there's hundreds.

00:36:10.616 --> 00:36:12.781
SCOT PANSING: Well, they
have so many channels, too.

00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:14.760
They can go on at
midnight on a game show.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.750
They have a lot of stuff to do.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.958
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
There are people

00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:17.647
I find out who are
doing very well

00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:19.730
and have very big careers
who I've never heard of.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.050
And I stay up on pop culture.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.220
That's always been my business.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.737
And so it's hard to keep up.

00:36:25.737 --> 00:36:28.070
SCOT PANSING: Well, Bill,
thank you for talking with us.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:29.653
I want to open it
to a little audience

00:36:29.653 --> 00:36:35.180
Q&amp;A. Adam has this cool
new furry microphone

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.120
that if you raise your hand,
he will throw it to you.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.380
You catch it.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.430
And you can speak
into the blue box.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.850
Does anyone want to
catch the microphone?

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.390
Come on, please.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.979
There we go.

00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:48.770
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
And I have a question

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.560
about that in a minute,
Adam, when we're done here.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.520
The thinking behind throwing
something that's a box shape.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.680
SCOT PANSING: But it's
like a stuffed animal.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.040
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
I understand.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.730
But like, round.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:59.540
SCOT PANSING: It could be round.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.560
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
You know what I mean?

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.570
I would think you'd
make it round.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:01.720
But OK.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.480
SCOT PANSING: Good feedback.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.813
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I digress.

00:37:03.813 --> 00:37:04.490
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.650
I really enjoyed your
story about Andy Kaufman

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.350
and the sidebar with
Tony Clifton, of course.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.100
Tony Clifton's still around
and you still see the act.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.895
Most recently, just
this year alone--

00:37:14.895 --> 00:37:16.120
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
How did that happen?

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.120
AUDIENCE: How does this happen?

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.536
Sort of where my
question's going.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:22.310
So he was on Jeff Ross Crowd
Control within the last year.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.720
I think that's on Seeso.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.440
And he was at House of Blues
something like a decade

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.500
ago here in Los Angeles.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.340
Have you seen any of those acts?

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.720
How would you think it compares?

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.450
And who is that?

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.337
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Well, I know who that is.

00:37:38.337 --> 00:37:39.670
SCOT PANSING: I think I do, too.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.545
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
And I can guarantee you

00:37:41.545 --> 00:37:42.790
that it's not Andy Kaufman.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:49.460
But it's somebody who was
with Andy the whole way who

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.590
portrays that character.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.090
And I don't know if I
should say the name.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.090
But I know who it is.

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.010
And it keeps the
legend of Andy alive.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.070
And they still play with the
idea that Andy still is alive.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.240
Maybe he is.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.180
It's like Elvis impersonators.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.875
It's all a tribute to Andy.

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:08.000
And he does it out of love.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.810
And he makes money doing it.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.650
And I don't know if
the joke works anymore.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.600
I mean, I guess the people
who know Andy Kaufman know

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.620
who Tony Clifton is.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.439
I mean, Andy's popularity
was inexplicable then--

00:38:19.439 --> 00:38:21.230
and I'm not saying that
he wasn't talented,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:23.000
because he did a
thing that nobody did.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.340
And he was absolutely
dedicated to it.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.750
You could not get Andy to
break character no matter what.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.577
You could have threatened
to shoot his children

00:38:32.577 --> 00:38:34.160
and he wouldn't have
broken character.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.160
He was that dedicated to it.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.660
There's something about it.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.890
It's still alive.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.110
My kids are in awe that
I knew Andy Kaufman.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.840
I knew all kinds of
more famous people,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.170
but Andy Kaufman matters.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.832
The others don't.

00:38:48.832 --> 00:38:49.540
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.960
SCOT PANSING: Thank
you for the question.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.650
Follow-up or no?

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:52.900
Or do you wanna throw the box?

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.880
AUDIENCE: Well, just that on the
Jeff Ross show, he was booed.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.236
If anything, the crowd
was mostly silent.

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:00.110
And this was a show
where the whole point was

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.290
to ratchet up the irritation
of the audience as much

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.830
as possible.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:04.280
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Sure.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.780
AUDIENCE: And Tony
Clifton continues

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.050
to go as far over
that line as possible.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.060
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: But you
understand, to the Tony Clifton

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.762
character, who's ever in the
costume, that's applause.

00:39:13.762 --> 00:39:14.720
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.500
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
They're not there

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.060
to get anyone's,
isn't this great?

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.560
They're there to make everybody
as uncomfortable as possible

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.160
and get them all upset
and then realize later

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.230
that boy, that was really weird
what we just participated in.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.040
That's what it is.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.610
It's an odd kind
of entertainment.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.960
But it's still-- awful
lot of really good comics

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.060
are not working anymore.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.740
But Tony Clifton's still
making appearances.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.590
Anyone else?

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.000
SCOT PANSING: Anyone
else for the blue cube?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.920
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Throw a box?

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.200
SCOT PANSING: In the back.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.307
Nice catch.

00:39:45.307 --> 00:39:45.890
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.610
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Hey.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:49.220
AUDIENCE: So there's a Mitch
Hedberg joke about something

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.790
you were talking about,
which is that the success

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.844
path for comedy is that
you're good at stand-up

00:39:52.844 --> 00:39:54.260
and then people
with money show up

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.844
and ask you to do other things,
like write a book or be in TV.

00:39:56.844 --> 00:39:58.593
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
I guess that's true.

00:39:58.593 --> 00:40:00.471
AUDIENCE: Did these
guys back in the day

00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:02.220
do this because they
wanted to do stand-up

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.180
or because they wanted to
be on a TV show, or both?

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.889
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Well, it depends.

00:40:07.889 --> 00:40:09.680
There was clear
differences between people.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.870
There were people who came
out here, like Letterman,

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.950
for example.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.650
Letterman wanted to be a
writer and a performer.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.840
And he was born to do that.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.880
And he did not come out
to be a stand-up comic.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.290
But he looked around,
and he saw real quickly--

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.750
and this is in the book--

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.544
he says, well, I can
attract the attention

00:40:27.544 --> 00:40:29.960
of people on the "The Tonight
Show" by going on that stage

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.370
and writing funny stuff.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.170
And he was going to
write jokes and be

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.210
a writer, because he was a funny
weatherman back in Indiana.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.350
And he was sort of
a local popular.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.850
And there were other people,
like Michael Keaton, whose name

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:41.974
was Michael something else.

00:40:41.974 --> 00:40:45.170
Michael Keaton, the
actor, came out,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.990
and he changed his
name to Michael Keaton,

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.610
because there was somebody else.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.920
And he was brilliant
at stand-up comedy.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.090
He was really funny.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.410
He had a really funny act.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.780
But he really wanted
to be an actor.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.930
And there was a lot more work,
and a lot more better paid

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.300
work if you could
be an actor, if you

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.940
could go become a comedian--

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.160
I mean, there's a difference.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.777
The people at "Saturday Night
Live" were not stand-up comics.

00:41:07.777 --> 00:41:09.860
There was a place on the
show for stand-up comics,

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.240
but stand-up's its own thing.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.580
It's funny, but
it's its own thing.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.540
It's not being a comedy actor.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.920
That's a whole different game.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.290
And it's a different
profession, in a way.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.760
But you can make a lot more
money being in a sitcom.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.150
And a lot of stand-ups
weren't good actors.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.680
Jay Leno would probably-- he
wouldn't admit it back then,

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.150
but he eventually-- he
wasn't a good actor.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.950
It's not what he was
comfortable doing.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:38.375
He was naturally gifted
at being a comedian.

00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:41.780
And believe me, when Jay
Leno was 27, 28 years old

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.340
and he was performing
on The Comedy Shop,

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.610
he was fall down
funny all the time.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.920
And he could get up
there and talk and go off

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.630
the top of his head for hours.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.720
He was amazing.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.370
The guy you saw on "The Tonight
Show" all during those years,

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.220
he was doing that show
for them, for NBC.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.460
But Leno on stage
in a comedy club

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.000
is a different thing altogether.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.446
And he was really good at that.

00:42:04.446 --> 00:42:05.570
And he wasn't a good actor.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.610
And Letterman was great
at being a broadcaster,

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:09.235
and talking to people,
and being funny,

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:12.350
and he was great at that.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.380
And a lot of them
became actors and they

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.700
became writers, and producers.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.380
And they were in the
business of funny.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.440
But they didn't go
on with the stand-up.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.650
And a whole bunch of them
that you don't ever know,

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.809
after this strike was
over and they started

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:29.350
getting paid, went on the road
for the next five or six years

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.962
and made pretty good
money, traveling around

00:42:31.962 --> 00:42:33.420
until they got
tired of doing that,

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.640
and doing one-nighters in
little water tank towns

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.290
around America, because comedy
was real simple and real

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.030
inexpensive to put on.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.370
You needed a couple of chairs,
a couple of microphones.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:44.880
That's all you needed.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.087
You didn't need a sound
system of any particular.

00:42:47.087 --> 00:42:48.420
You didn't need to pay the band.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.400
You didn't need
to pay for music.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.480
This was it.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.870
So the comic walked away with
most of the performing money.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.310
So they'd get paid pretty well.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:01.115
And it's what they
were compelled to do.

00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:03.240
And most of them-- and I
would say that all of them

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.030
were compelled to do it, meaning
there wasn't any way that you

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:07.650
could have stopped
them from doing it,

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.880
as hard as some people tried.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.110
SCOT PANSING: Any
other questions?

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.180
I think we have time for
a couple more, if anyone--

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.690
anyone want to
catch the blue cube?

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:19.850
Here we go, up front.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.840
Make it a good toss.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.430
Nice.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.922
AUDIENCE: So can you expand
more on "High Times?"

00:43:25.922 --> 00:43:27.380
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
"High Times."

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.838
AUDIENCE: On the
title of the book.

00:43:28.838 --> 00:43:32.370
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Oh,
well, yeah, there was drugs.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:36.420
Although this was-- again,
comedians at the time,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.340
they weren't getting paid.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.410
So there wasn't a lot of
coke that you can buy.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.960
And this was sort of right
when coke was coming in.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.440
And all of them
pretty much that--

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.944
if you hung out
around Mitzi, and you

00:43:50.944 --> 00:43:52.360
were part of her
favorite, and you

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.530
were part of the crowd
around Richard Lewis,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:56.582
you got free coke.

00:43:56.582 --> 00:43:57.540
And that's in the book.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.665
I don't want to go into it.

00:43:58.665 --> 00:43:59.910
That's not a major story.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.830
But I mean, you couldn't
stand outside the Comedy Store

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.954
for very long without
somebody handing you a joint.

00:44:06.438 --> 00:44:11.140
But when coke came in, it
was kind of a separator.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.770
And I was in Hollywood
and show business,

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.110
around it anyway,
back at the time.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:20.430
And there was a changeover from
marijuana to coke back then.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.664
I mean, marijuana, you
hand that around to people.

00:44:22.664 --> 00:44:25.080
Nobody handed around coke,
because you couldn't afford it.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.880
So if you wanted to do coke,
you went in the bathroom

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.588
with your best friend,
and everybody else

00:44:28.588 --> 00:44:31.480
was kind of pissed.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.080
There was no camaraderie
around doing cocaine.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.780
So it wasn't a big thing with
the comics, because again,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.220
most of them couldn't afford it.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.345
SCOT PANSING: And it's
touched on in the show, too.

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:41.160
Pretty prevalent--

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.826
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
And you know what?

00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:47.160
All of Mitzi's-- this is not
me doing some sort of 12-step

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.980
thing, but most of them
who got involved with coke,

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.460
it didn't end well.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.970
They all ended up in rehab.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.730
It all derailed all their lives.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:02.520
Richard Pryor ended up dead
and burned himself half to--

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.270
very short time after this,
you could see it coming.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.780
So it didn't help anybody's
comedy, that's for sure.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.840
Marijuana, I don't think
it had any effect one

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.548
way or the other.

00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:18.557
But maybe it helped some.

00:45:18.557 --> 00:45:20.348
SCOT PANSING: It helped
Rodney Dangerfield.

00:45:22.922 --> 00:45:25.380
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I had a
seat with Rodney Dangerfield.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.150
I was sitting in
The Comedy Store

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.630
talking to Rodney
Dangerfield and Joey--

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.560
remember the guy from
"Car 54, Where Are You?"

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.060
Ooh, ooh.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.530
That guy, he was an actor.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:35.640
Anyway, but they were--

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.270
SCOT PANSING: I'm not that old.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.590
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I
was the LA Times reporter

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.410
and they handed me a joint.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:40.990
And I had to go, thanks, but I--

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.850
and I handed it on.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.654
Sort of a weird moment.

00:45:43.654 --> 00:45:45.070
SCOT PANSING: With
those two guys?

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.670
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah, with
those two guys, in The Comedy

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.590
Store, with people
all around them.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.694
So I had that happen a
lot of times, but later.

00:45:52.694 --> 00:45:53.360
I never inhaled.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.680
SCOT PANSING: Anyone else?

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.940
We have a few, or we
can call it a wrap.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.453
Does anyone have another
question for the fuzzy cube?

00:46:02.453 --> 00:46:03.994
AUDIENCE: I just
want to correct you.

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:06.328
It was Big Jay Oakerson, not
Jeff Ross, the show where--

00:46:06.328 --> 00:46:08.410
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Oh,
I know who Jeff Ross is.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.910
I don't know who
the other guy is.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.010
SCOT PANSING: Big Jay Oakerson--

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.280
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to get his name out there.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.255
SCOT PANSING: --was the show
where Tony Clifton performed.

00:46:14.255 --> 00:46:15.660
AUDIENCE: It was the show
where Tony Clifton was on.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.691
SCOT PANSING: Thank you.

00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:18.190
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
It's not Andy.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:19.560
Just so you know.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.940
Whoever it was, that's not Andy.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.360
Andy is dead.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.040
SCOT PANSING: We can't
reveal who he is?

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.870
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: I'm not
saying he won't come back.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.280
SCOT PANSING: I think you
can Google it and find out

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.030
who it is.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.196
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Donald
Trump became president.

00:46:29.196 --> 00:46:31.080
So Andy Kaufman could come back.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:31.500
SCOT PANSING: Google it.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.190
You can find out who it is.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.120
I don't want to--

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.410
or find me after.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.010
OK, yeah, leave the mystery.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.700
Great.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.158
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Anybody else?

00:46:39.158 --> 00:46:40.560
This is your last chance.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.144
SCOT PANSING: Going
once, going twice.

00:46:42.144 --> 00:46:43.559
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Nobody wants

00:46:43.559 --> 00:46:45.250
to know what my
favorite craft beer is?

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:45.930
No.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.860
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.160
SCOT PANSING: Oh,
before we do-- stop it--

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.060
what is your next
project, your next book?

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.060
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: My
next project is a book.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.643
It should be out
within the next year.

00:46:55.643 --> 00:46:59.970
It's called "Fins" and it's
about the birth of the car

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.050
business as told through
the life of a guy named

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.160
Harley Earl, who invented
the profession of automobile

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.719
styling.

00:47:08.719 --> 00:47:11.010
And he took General Motors
from being this little bitty

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.343
company to the most successful
corporation in the world,

00:47:13.343 --> 00:47:15.990
because he figured out a way
for them to change their cars

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.210
every year, the look of them.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:23.133
And he also was the guy who
put fins on cars in the 19502.

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:24.439
That's the--

00:47:24.439 --> 00:47:25.230
SCOT PANSING: Nice.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.670
When is that?

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.910
When do you expect that to be?

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.955
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
It's supposed

00:47:26.955 --> 00:47:30.380
to come out in January of
2018, if I can finish it

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.580
in the next couple days.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.500
All right, All right, well,
we'd better let you go, then.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.230
Thanks for coming.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:35.110
We'll let you go finish
your new latest book.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:35.190
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Thanks, guys.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.080
Thank you, everybody.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080
SCOT PANSING: All right.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.580
Thank you.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.330
[APPLAUSE]
