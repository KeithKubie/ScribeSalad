00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
[sad music]

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.700
Why, hello. I didn't see you there.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.060
GET OUT!!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.960
What are you doing sneaking into a guy's place?!

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.460
I'LL CALL THE CO-

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.600
Hello again.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.100
Welcome to Channel Awesome's Youtube channel.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.680
Where you can watch me as The Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.660
Reviewing anything and everything relating to your nostalgia.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.500
But it's so much more than watching me as The Nostalgia Critic. (Not really)

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.800
You can watch me as Chester A. Bum on Bum Reviews,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.720
Dominic on Video Game Confessions,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.280
And my most challenging character, Doug Walker in various sketches, Vlogs, and review shows.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.080
If you don't like watching my face though, I pity you.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.420
But also recommend a vast variety of other shows that we have.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.640
Including ones that sometimes have my face in it.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340
So you won't have to panic too much.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.880
Or if you want to check out even more people, you can check out channelawesome.com

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.600
Home to some great reviewers and comedic talent that are not me.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.660
But for not being me, they're pretty good.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.980
So search around and find what you enjoy.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.280
All are welcomed here,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.880
especially the elephants that are flying around my face.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.440
What is in this shi-
