00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.690
What we're going
to do in this video

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.060
are some real quick tests to see
if these three random numbers

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.260
are divisible by any
of these numbers here.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.080
And I'm not going to focus a
lot on the why of why they're

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.830
divisible-- we'll do that in
other videos-- but really just

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.690
to give you a sense
of how do you actually

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.110
test to see if this is
divisible by 2 or 5 or 9 or 10.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.570
So let's get started.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.220
So to test whether any of
these are divisible by 2,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.230
you really just have to
look at the ones place

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.620
and see if the ones
place is divisible by 2.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.840
And right over here,
8 is divisible by 2,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.210
so this thing is going
to be divisible by 2.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.150
0 is considered to
be divisible by 2,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.426
so this is going to
be divisible by 2.

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:40.050
Another way to think
about it is if you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.800
have an even number
over here-- and 0

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.640
is considered to be
an even number-- then

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.710
you're going to
be divisible by 2.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.110
And over here, you do not have
a number that is divisible by 2.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.110
This is not an even
number, this 5,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720
so this is not divisible by 2.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.990
So I won't write any 2 there.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.830
So we've gone through the 2s.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.240
Now, let's work through the 3s.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.600
So to figure out if
you're divisible by 3,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.720
you really just have to
add up all the digits

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.735
and figure out if the
sum is divisible by 3.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:07.720
So let's do that.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.185
So if I do 2 plus 7 plus 9
plus 9 plus 5 plus 8 plus 8,

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:18.560
what's this going
to be equal to?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.870
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:27.910
9 plus 9 is 18, plus 9 is 27,
plus 5 is 32, plus 8 is 40,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.530
plus 8 is 48.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.120
And 48 is divisible by 3.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.010
But in case you're not sure--
so this is equal to 48-- in case

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.100
you're not sure whether
it's divisible by 3,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.970
you can just add
these digits up again.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.734
So 4 plus 8 is equal to 12, and
12 clearly is divisible by 3.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:49.150
And if you're not
even sure there,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.566
you could add those
two digits up.

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:55.950
1 plus 2 is equal to 3, and
so this is divisible by 3.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.969
This right over here,
let's add up the digits.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.010
And we can do this one in
our head pretty easily.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.130
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.774
11 plus 7 is 18.

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:07.160
18 plus 0 is 18.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.700
And if you want to add the 1
plus 8 on the 18, you get 9.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.430
So the digits add up to 9.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.795
So these add up to 9.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.425
Well, they add to 18, which
is clearly divisible by 3

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.300
and by 9, and these two
things will add to 9.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.280
So the important
thing to know is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.116
when you add up all the digits,
the sum is divisible by 3.

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:35.987
So this is divisible by 3
as well, divisible by 3.

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:37.820
And then finally, Let's
add up these digits.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.680
1 plus 0 plus 0 plus 7 is 8,
plus 6 is 14, plus 5 is 19.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.472
So we summed up the digits.

00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:51.912
19 is not divisible by 3.

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.370
So this one, we're not going
to write a 3 right over there.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.180
It's not divisible by 3.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.540
Let's try 4.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.505
And to think about
4, you just have

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:01.296
to look at the last
two digits and to see--

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:03.570
are the last two
digits divisible?

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.360
Are the last two
digits divisible by 4?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.610
Immediately, you can look
at this one right over here,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.640
see it's an odd number.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.020
If it's not going to
be divisible by 2,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.000
it's definitely not going
to be divisible by 4.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.010
So this one's not divisible by
any of the first few numbers

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.848
right over here.

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:21.730
But let's think about one, 88.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.130
Is that divisible by 4?

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.505
And you can do
that in your head.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:25.860
That's 4 times 22.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.530
So this is divisible by 4.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.370
Now, let's see.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.600
4 goes into 60 15 times.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.210
And then to go from 60 to 70,
you have to get another 10,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.250
which is not divisible by 4.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.590
So that's not divisible by 4.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.780
And you can even try to
divide it out yourself.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.980
4 goes into 70,
let's see, one time.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.996
You subtract, you get a 30.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:49.320
4 goes into 30 seven times.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.966
You multiply, then you subtract.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:55.490
You get a 2 right over
here as your remainder,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.915
so it is not divisible by 4.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.990
Now, let's move on to 5.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.100
Now, you're probably already
very familiar with this.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.810
If your final digit is a 5 or
a 0, you are divisible by 5.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.280
So this one is not
divisible by 5.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.850
This one is divisible by 5.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.600
You have a 0 there, so
this is divisible by 5.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.070
And this, you have a
5 as your ones digit.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.880
So once again-- finally-- this
is divisible by something.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.910
It's divisible by 5.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.060
Now, the number 6.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.310
The simple way to think
about divisibility by 6

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.070
is that you have to be
divisible by both 2 and 3

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.810
in order to be divisible by 6,
because the prime factorization

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.260
of 6 is 2 times 3.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.860
So here, we're
divisible by 2 and 3,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.556
so we're going to be
divisible by-- let

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:45.055
me do that in a new
color-- so we're

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:47.290
going to be divisible by 6.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.000
Here, we're
divisible by 2 and 3,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
so we're going to
be divisible by 6.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.830
And if you were just divisible
by 2 or 3, just one of them,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.371
then you wouldn't
be able to do this.

00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.012
You have to have
both a 2 and a 3,

00:04:57.012 --> 00:04:58.220
divisibility by both of them.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.450
And here, you're divisible
by neither 2 nor 3,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.970
so you're not going
to be divisible by 6.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.150
Now, let's do the test for 9.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.390
The test for 9 is very
similar to the test for 3.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.690
Sum up all the digits.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.565
If that sum is divisible
by 9, then you're there.

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:17.040
Well, we already summed
up the digits here, 48.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.640
48 actually is not
divisible by 9.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.890
If you're not sure, you can
add up the digits there.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.810
You get 12.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.530
12 is definitely
not divisible by 9.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.800
So this thing right over
here is not divisible by 9.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.550
And this one over here, if
you added up all the digits,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.700
we got 18, which is divisible.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.200
It is divisible by 9.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.550
And I'm running out of colors.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.660
So this one is divisible by 9.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.352
All the digits added up to 18.

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.810
And this one over here, you
don't even have to add them up,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.810
because we already know
it's not divisible by 3.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.596
If it's not divisible by 3,
it can't be divisible by 9.

00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:49.970
But if you did
add up the digits,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.950
you get 19, which is
not divisible by 9.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.730
So this also is
not divisible by 9.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.330
And then finally,
divisibility by 10.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.870
And this is the easiest one
of all, because you just

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.030
have to see if you have
a 0 in the ones place.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.740
You clearly do not have a
0 in the ones place here.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.520
You do have a 0 in
the ones place there,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.330
so you are divisible by 10 here.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.150
And then finally, you don't
have a 0 in the ones place here,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.579
so you're not going
to be divisible by 10.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.120
Another way you
could think about it,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.950
you have to be divisible by both
2 and 5 to be divisible by 10.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.536
Here, you are divisible
by 5 but not by 2.

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:27.910
But obviously,
the easiest one is

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.660
to just see if you have
a 0 in the ones place.
