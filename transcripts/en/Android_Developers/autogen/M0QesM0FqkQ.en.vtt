now if we actually look at the app
 

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:34.610
now if we actually look at the app
itself in terms of functionality this is

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620
itself in terms of functionality this is
 

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.189
itself in terms of functionality this is
a much simpler maybe you would even say

00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:37.199
a much simpler maybe you would even say

the other apps we're looking at today so
 

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:42.499
the other apps we're looking at today so
the idea here is a pretty simple one it

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:42.509
the idea here is a pretty simple one it
 

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:44.030

recipients and those messages can go out

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.250
recipients and those messages can go out
 

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.819
recipients and those messages can go out
via SMS email or actually using any app

00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:52.829
via SMS email or actually using any app
 

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:55.009

be done to improve the UX and I'll go
into a little bit more detail on that

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980
into a little bit more detail on that
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.620
into a little bit more detail on that
later but they've done some great work

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:57.630
later but they've done some great work
 

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.360
later but they've done some great work
in terms of keeping the functionality

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.370
in terms of keeping the functionality
 

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.910
in terms of keeping the functionality
simple and using intents to make

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920
simple and using intents to make
 

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.530

even more powerful without having to do
 

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.990
even more powerful without having to do
much extra work so the best thing that

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000
much extra work so the best thing that
 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.730
much extra work so the best thing that
they've done is keep it simple and an

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:06.740
they've done is keep it simple and an
 

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.650
they've done is keep it simple and an
app that does one thing and it does it

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:08.660
app that does one thing and it does it
 

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:12.730
app that does one thing and it does it
very well love it so each of these apps

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:12.740
very well love it so each of these apps
 

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.440
very well love it so each of these apps
offers some valuable features to help

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.450

back let's take a look at the key

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.380
back let's take a look at the key
 

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.170
back let's take a look at the key
features we're looking for in a pure

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:20.180
features we're looking for in a pure
 

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.329
features we're looking for in a pure
Android travel assistance app ok so the

00:13:25.329 --> 00:13:25.339
Android travel assistance app ok so the
 

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.490
Android travel assistance app ok so the
the feature the feature set of each of

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:27.500
the feature the feature set of each of
 

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.750
the feature the feature set of each of
these apps are kind of orthogonal

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760
these apps are kind of orthogonal
 

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.370
these apps are kind of orthogonal
they're all really useful for travelers

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
they're all really useful for travelers
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.540
they're all really useful for travelers
but there's very little overlap right so

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:34.550
but there's very little overlap right so
 

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.329
but there's very little overlap right so
that's handy because it helps focus on

00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:37.339
that's handy because it helps focus on
 

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:38.860
that's handy because it helps focus on
how they're achieving some of that

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:38.870
how they're achieving some of that
 

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.889
how they're achieving some of that
magical feature set rather than debating

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:41.899
magical feature set rather than debating
 

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:43.180
magical feature set rather than debating
the relative merits of each features

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.190
the relative merits of each features
 

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.780
the relative merits of each features
exactly so each of these apps needs

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:45.790
exactly so each of these apps needs
 

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.009

anyway the point is that you're you're

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:34.970
anyway the point is that you're you're
 

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.030
anyway the point is that you're you're
not just having nonexistence data or

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040
not just having nonexistence data or
 

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.139
not just having nonexistence data or
expensive data you're having very

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:38.149
expensive data you're having very
 

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.210
expensive data you're having very
intermittent data so when you do have

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.220
intermittent data so when you do have
 

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.750
intermittent data so when you do have
Wi-Fi or wee-fee or waffle or whatever

Wi-Fi or wee-fee or waffle or whatever
it is you probably want to take the most

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.060
it is you probably want to take the most
 

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.730
it is you probably want to take the most
advantage of that exactly and of course

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:48.740
advantage of that exactly and of course
 

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.009
advantage of that exactly and of course
location is key it's particularly

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:51.019
location is key it's particularly
 

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:52.180
location is key it's particularly
important because you want to know where

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.190
important because you want to know where
 

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.280
important because you want to know where
you are but this has to be balanced

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.290
you are but this has to be balanced
 

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.380
you are but this has to be balanced
around the fact that you don't want to

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.390
around the fact that you don't want to
 

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.460
around the fact that you don't want to
be draining the battery getting those

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:57.470
be draining the battery getting those
 

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.199
be draining the battery getting those
location updates all the time so it's

00:14:59.199 --> 00:14:59.209
location updates all the time so it's
 

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:00.639
location updates all the time so it's
really a balancing act of wanting to

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:00.649
really a balancing act of wanting to
 

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.980
really a balancing act of wanting to
have fresh data having constant data

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:02.990
have fresh data having constant data
 

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.720
have fresh data having constant data
working offline accurate location

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:04.730
working offline accurate location
 

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.970
working offline accurate location
without draining the battery when you

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:06.980
without draining the battery when you
 

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.050
without draining the battery when you
know chances are you going to have your

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.060
know chances are you going to have your
 

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.340
know chances are you going to have your
phone you're going to be using it a lot

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:09.350
phone you're going to be using it a lot
 

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.360
phone you're going to be using it a lot
but you're only going to be charging it

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:10.370
but you're only going to be charging it
 

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.280
but you're only going to be charging it
at the end of every

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:12.290
at the end of every
 

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.590
at the end of every
so the final result really does emphasis

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600
so the final result really does emphasis
 

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.490
so the final result really does emphasis
the emphasize the efficiency of apps

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:17.500
the emphasize the efficiency of apps
 

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.910
the emphasize the efficiency of apps

so what I want to talk about a little

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.390
so what I want to talk about a little
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.240
so what I want to talk about a little
bit is use this basically as an excuse

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:31.250
bit is use this basically as an excuse
 

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.750

have done
so there's it's it's kind of simple

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:39.330
so there's it's it's kind of simple
 

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.570
so there's it's it's kind of simple
enough to get location updates for

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580
enough to get location updates for
 

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.639
enough to get location updates for
Android but what Foursquare have done a

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:43.649

really good job of is making sure that

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:46.110
really good job of is making sure that
 

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.320
really good job of is making sure that
that location updates are as low latency

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:48.330
that location updates are as low latency
 

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.759
that location updates are as low latency
as possible so there's a few tricks that

00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:49.769
as possible so there's a few tricks that
 

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:51.409
as possible so there's a few tricks that
you can use to maintain your location

00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419
you can use to maintain your location
 

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.690
you can use to maintain your location
freshness without draining the battery

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700
freshness without draining the battery
 

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.759
freshness without draining the battery
completely so you can significantly

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:55.769
completely so you can significantly
 

00:19:55.769 --> 00:19:57.710
completely so you can significantly
reduce the battery oh sorry you can

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720
reduce the battery oh sorry you can
 

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.419
reduce the battery oh sorry you can
significantly reduce the latency for

00:19:59.419 --> 00:19:59.429
significantly reduce the latency for
 

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:01.549
significantly reduce the latency for
getting your first location fix by

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559
getting your first location fix by
 

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:03.499
getting your first location fix by
retrieving the last-known location from

00:20:03.499 --> 00:20:03.509
retrieving the last-known location from
 

00:20:03.509 --> 00:20:05.810
retrieving the last-known location from
the location manager each time the app

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820
the location manager each time the app
 

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.299
the location manager each time the app
is resumed so if you have a look at this

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:08.309
is resumed so if you have a look at this
 

00:20:08.309 --> 00:20:10.249

code snippet not much just pop that in

00:20:10.249 --> 00:20:10.259
code snippet not much just pop that in

code snippet not much just pop that in
front as well so you can perhaps read

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:11.970
front as well so you can perhaps read
 

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.360

that a little bit more easily

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.370
that a little bit more easily
 

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.710
that a little bit more easily
so in this snippet we're going to

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720
so in this snippet we're going to
 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.659
so in this snippet we're going to
iterate through each location provider

00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:17.669
iterate through each location provider
 

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:19.460
iterate through each location provider
on the device including those that

on the device including those that
aren't currently available and we're

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.210
aren't currently available and we're
 

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.960
aren't currently available and we're
going to seek out the most timely and

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:23.970
going to seek out the most timely and
 

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.480
going to seek out the most timely and
most accurate last-known location so if

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:26.490
most accurate last-known location so if
 

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.009
most accurate last-known location so if
there's one one or more locations

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:28.019
there's one one or more locations
 

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:29.690
there's one one or more locations
available from within the allowed

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700
available from within the allowed
 

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.850
available from within the allowed
timeframe then we can return the one

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860
timeframe then we can return the one
 

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.560
timeframe then we can return the one
which has the most accurate result and

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:33.570
which has the most accurate result and
 

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.299
which has the most accurate result and
if there isn't then we return the most

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:35.309
if there isn't then we return the most
 

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:37.669
if there isn't then we return the most
recent result though if we're just doing

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679
recent result though if we're just doing
 

00:20:37.679 --> 00:20:39.049
recent result though if we're just doing
that the most recent result but it's

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059
that the most recent result but it's
 

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.879
that the most recent result but it's
kind of beyond our latency window it's

00:20:40.879 --> 00:20:40.889
kind of beyond our latency window it's
 

00:20:40.889 --> 00:20:42.710
kind of beyond our latency window it's
pretty good practice to request a single

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720
pretty good practice to request a single
 

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.840
pretty good practice to request a single
location update from every available

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:44.850
location update from every available
 

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.240
location update from every available
provider to try and get a more recent

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:47.250
provider to try and get a more recent
 

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.519
provider to try and get a more recent
result at this point it it doesn't even

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:49.529
result at this point it it doesn't even
 

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:51.590
result at this point it it doesn't even
matter which is the more accurate result

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600
matter which is the more accurate result
 

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.419
matter which is the more accurate result
you just want to get something that's a

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:53.429
you just want to get something that's a
 

00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:55.159
you just want to get something that's a
little more timely so that you get

00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:55.169
little more timely so that you get
 

00:20:55.169 --> 00:20:56.810
little more timely so that you get
something which is in the vaguely

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820
something which is in the vaguely
 

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.549
something which is in the vaguely
correct location and then obviously you

00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559
correct location and then obviously you
 

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.289
correct location and then obviously you
can continue to do your location updates

00:21:00.289 --> 00:21:00.299
can continue to do your location updates
 

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.850
can continue to do your location updates
to try and get something even more

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860
to try and get something even more
 

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.220
to try and get something even more
useful so one thing that I've always

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.230
useful so one thing that I've always
 

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.119
useful so one thing that I've always
wanted to ask you right now about

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:05.129
wanted to ask you right now about
 

00:21:05.129 --> 00:21:06.590
wanted to ask you right now about
location cuz I know you're kind of the

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600
location cuz I know you're kind of the
 

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.590
location cuz I know you're kind of the
location guy so I remember when when I

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600
location guy so I remember when when I
 

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.240
location guy so I remember when when I
first started traveling this is way back

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.250
first started traveling this is way back
 

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.799
first started traveling this is way back
in the Dark Ages when we didn't have

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:12.809
in the Dark Ages when we didn't have
 

00:21:12.809 --> 00:21:15.560
in the Dark Ages when we didn't have
offline maps and we didn't have really

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:15.570
offline maps and we didn't have really
 

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.060
offline maps and we didn't have really
good location providers and I found an

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.070
good location providers and I found an
 

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.970
good location providers and I found an
app called maverick that was mostly for

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980
app called maverick that was mostly for
 

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.590
app called maverick that was mostly for
geocaching and so they they made it work

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600
geocaching and so they they made it work
 

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.749
geocaching and so they they made it work
in the wilderness nice and it turned out

00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:26.759
in the wilderness nice and it turned out
 

00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:28.940
in the wilderness nice and it turned out
that for me anyway coming from the US

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:28.950
that for me anyway coming from the US
 

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.379
that for me anyway coming from the US
London was effectively so what it did

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:33.389
London was effectively so what it did
 

00:21:33.389 --> 00:21:35.180
London was effectively so what it did
was it allowed me to download a bunch of

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.190
was it allowed me to download a bunch of
 

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.740
was it allowed me to download a bunch of
map tiles which may or may not have

map tiles which may or may not have
 

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.990
map tiles which may or may not have
actually been illegal uh it downloaded

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000
actually been illegal uh it downloaded

and then it it would find GPS but it

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:44.790
and then it it would find GPS but it
 

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.430
and then it it would find GPS but it
also kept track of my location through

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440
also kept track of my location through
 

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.610
also kept track of my location through
dead reckoning mm-hm and does it do any

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620
dead reckoning mm-hm and does it do any
 

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.620
dead reckoning mm-hm and does it do any
of the phones we we have now do that

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:51.630
of the phones we we have now do that
 

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.240

no I think the the location providers

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:56.970
no I think the the location providers
 

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.130
no I think the the location providers
that we're using at the moment are

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140
that we're using at the moment are
 

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.740
that we're using at the moment are
fairly simplistic in that it's just GPS

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:00.750
fairly simplistic in that it's just GPS
 

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.620
fairly simplistic in that it's just GPS
or a network network location what do we

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:03.630
or a network network location what do we
 

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.200
or a network network location what do we
call the NLP Network here a network

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:06.210

sorts of things though I think that's

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280
sorts of things though I think that's
 

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.800
sorts of things though I think that's
something which the industry is heading

towards right so it'd be fantastic to
 

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.310
towards right so it'd be fantastic to
see more and more of those sorts of

there's a lot of active research in this
area absolutely I think we've been

00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:38.059
area absolutely I think we've been
 

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:39.909
area absolutely I think we've been
hearing a lot about things like sort of

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919
hearing a lot about things like sort of
 

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.680
hearing a lot about things like sort of
passive background location updates and

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:41.690
passive background location updates and
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.919
passive background location updates and
you can see apps like Google now in fact

00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:44.929
you can see apps like Google now in fact
 

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:46.570
you can see apps like Google now in fact
being able to give you sort of these

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:46.580
being able to give you sort of these
 

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.249
being able to give you sort of these
really cool hints about how far you've

00:24:48.249 --> 00:24:48.259
really cool hints about how far you've
 

00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:52.480
really cool hints about how far you've
walked or you know suggesting things

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.490
walked or you know suggesting things
 

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.100
walked or you know suggesting things
based on your location and those sorts

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.110
based on your location and those sorts
 

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.539
based on your location and those sorts
of stuff so it's kind of cool I'm going

00:24:55.539 --> 00:24:55.549
of stuff so it's kind of cool I'm going
 

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:56.590
of stuff so it's kind of cool I'm going
to talk a little bit about how you can

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600
to talk a little bit about how you can
 

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.299
to talk a little bit about how you can
do some of those things in just a minute

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:58.309
do some of those things in just a minute
 

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:00.279
do some of those things in just a minute
great let's do that so generally I

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:00.289
great let's do that so generally I
 

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:02.139
great let's do that so generally I
prefer to use pending intents rather

00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:02.149
prefer to use pending intents rather
 

00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:04.269
prefer to use pending intents rather
than location listeners when I'm making

than location listeners when I'm making
 

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:05.680
than location listeners when I'm making
my location request and that's because

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:05.690
my location request and that's because
 

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.509

location just like what we mentioned and
 

00:25:16.879 --> 00:25:18.999

potentially even update the list of

seeing some of those smarts and some of
 

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.030
seeing some of those smarts and some of
those and tells you something you could

those and tells you something you could
 

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.760
those and tells you something you could
probably even go further and make it

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:15.770
probably even go further and make it
 

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.080
probably even go further and make it
into something where you kind of know

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.090
into something where you kind of know
 

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.060

trivet is that it's all of your travel

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:28.019

information in one place and it's going
 

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:32.570
information in one place and it's going
to show you the most relevant thing

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580
to show you the most relevant thing
 

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.509
to show you the most relevant thing
first and try and remove all the

00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519
first and try and remove all the
 

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.680
first and try and remove all the

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.440
irrelevant nonsense
so it needs to know what time it is and

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:39.450
so it needs to know what time it is and
 

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.210
so it needs to know what time it is and
it needs to know where you are hmm

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220
it needs to know where you are hmm
 

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.420
it needs to know where you are hmm
so in in this particular case for

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:44.430
so in in this particular case for
 

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.550

we are not in Perth
 

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.230
we are not in Perth
yeah and you could find that in two

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240
yeah and you could find that in two
 

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.580
yeah and you could find that in two
different ways right and so you could

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:55.590
different ways right and so you could
 

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.160
different ways right and so you could
you can find that out either through

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:58.170
you can find that out either through
 

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.080
you can find that out either through
location or by time but probably the

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.090
location or by time but probably the
 

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.730
location or by time but probably the
location is a little safer because the

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740
location is a little safer because the
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.500
location is a little safer because the

you've got there you don't need to see
 

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.090
you've got there you don't need to see
it anymore so it doesn't need to be

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100
it anymore so it doesn't need to be
 

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.990
it anymore so it doesn't need to be
updated

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000
updated
 

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.200

perhaps as frequently as as Foursquare

the other things which I think is really
 

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.190
the other things which I think is really
important is it needs to be able to

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200
important is it needs to be able to
 

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.740
important is it needs to be able to
update you know the sort of this balance

update you know the sort of this balance
because if something does change if my

it's you're gonna be lucky if there's a

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:49.110
it's you're gonna be lucky if there's a

it's you're gonna be lucky if there's a
change once a day if that indeed you

certainly don't want to be checking
every five minutes to see if your

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:54.420
every five minutes to see if your
 

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.910
every five minutes to see if your
flights delayed instead what you really

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:55.920
flights delayed instead what you really
 

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.040
flights delayed instead what you really
want is to know exactly when your

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.050
want is to know exactly when your
 

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.600
want is to know exactly when your
flights delayed and then never worry

00:33:59.600 --> 00:33:59.610
flights delayed and then never worry
 

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.780
flights delayed and then never worry
about it again right so if I was doing

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:02.790
about it again right so if I was doing
 

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.490
about it again right so if I was doing
this with just my airline my airlines

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500
this with just my airline my airlines
 

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.280
this with just my airline my airlines
gonna send me an SMS to let me know that

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:07.290
gonna send me an SMS to let me know that
 

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:08.630
gonna send me an SMS to let me know that
the flights delayed now I don't want

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:08.640
the flights delayed now I don't want
 

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.520
the flights delayed now I don't want
TripIt to send me an SMS because there's

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:10.530
TripIt to send me an SMS because there's
 

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.120
TripIt to send me an SMS because there's
a better way to do that right absolutely

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:13.130
a better way to do that right absolutely
 

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:16.570
a better way to do that right absolutely
you want yeah exactly

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:16.580
you want yeah exactly
 

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.240
you want yeah exactly
in fact I think what we want is to

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:19.250
in fact I think what we want is to
 

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.650
in fact I think what we want is to
hopefully what it does is use GCM

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:21.660
hopefully what it does is use GCM
 

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.580
hopefully what it does is use GCM
exactly so let's let's have a look at

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:24.590
exactly so let's let's have a look at
 

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.110
exactly so let's let's have a look at
some of the things which should be able

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:27.120
some of the things which should be able
 

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.660
some of the things which should be able
to do and do really well so knowing

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:29.670
to do and do really well so knowing
 

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.060
to do and do really well so knowing
where we are is important but it's much

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.070
where we are is important but it's much
 

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.090
where we are is important but it's much
more important that I get my itinerary

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:35.100
more important that I get my itinerary
 

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.640
more important that I get my itinerary
changes as quickly as possible and as I

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:37.650
changes as quickly as possible and as I
 

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.650
changes as quickly as possible and as I
mentioned let me see if I can

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:39.660
mentioned let me see if I can
 

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.860
mentioned let me see if I can
drop this behind us Anita well that

drop this behind us Anita well that
 

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.230
drop this behind us Anita well that
looks a bit weird nonetheless home but

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240
looks a bit weird nonetheless home but
 

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.520
looks a bit weird nonetheless home but
this does set up a conflict and and like

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.530
this does set up a conflict and and like
 

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.920
this does set up a conflict and and like
we said it's it's that idea of you know

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:51.930
we said it's it's that idea of you know
 

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:53.900
we said it's it's that idea of you know
we want things to happen straight away

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:53.910
we want things to happen straight away
 

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:54.830
we want things to happen straight away
but we don't wanna have to do these

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:54.840
but we don't wanna have to do these
 

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.940
but we don't wanna have to do these
manual updates and so what that does is

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:58.950
manual updates and so what that does is
 

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.040
manual updates and so what that does is
that we have I love these graphs that

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.050
that we have I love these graphs that
 

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.110
that we have I love these graphs that
you make because they're they're

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.120
you make because they're they're
 

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.340
you make because they're they're
complete nonsense and to the right

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:07.350
complete nonsense and to the right
 

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.100
complete nonsense and to the right
height up and to the right so it's it's

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.110
height up and to the right so it's it's
 

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.590
height up and to the right so it's it's
a good graph right do the obvious graphs

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:12.600
a good graph right do the obvious graphs
 

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.620

this how do we reduce the latency but
but not have that increase in battery

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:19.830
but not have that increase in battery
 

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.050
but not have that increase in battery

is that the the fresh of the data is the
 

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.550
is that the the fresh of the data is the
more battery cost and why you actually

potentially draining the battery and
 

00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:02.609
potentially draining the battery and
that's because of the way that the the

00:36:02.609 --> 00:36:02.619
that's because of the way that the the
 

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:04.349
that's because of the way that the the
the battery life cycle model works so I

00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359
the battery life cycle model works so I
 

00:36:04.359 --> 00:36:06.479
the battery life cycle model works so I

so if you're you know doing these

00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599
so if you're you know doing these
 

00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:24.029
so if you're you know doing these
updates every minute then yous leaving

00:36:24.029 --> 00:36:24.039
updates every minute then yous leaving
 

00:36:24.039 --> 00:36:25.410
updates every minute then yous leaving
the cell radio on permanently which is

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:25.420
the cell radio on permanently which is
 

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.719
the cell radio on permanently which is
going to destroy your battery life and

00:36:27.719 --> 00:36:27.729
going to destroy your battery life and
 

00:36:27.729 --> 00:36:29.160
going to destroy your battery life and
so this is compounded by the typical

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:29.170
so this is compounded by the typical
 

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.049
so this is compounded by the typical

like now like as soon as it happens but

00:36:36.299 --> 00:36:36.309
like now like as soon as it happens but
 

00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:38.190
like now like as soon as it happens but
it's not going to happen that often so

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200
it's not going to happen that often so
 

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.099
it's not going to happen that often so
how can we optimize those updates and

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:41.109
how can we optimize those updates and
 

00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:44.910
how can we optimize those updates and
minimize the latency well in fact and

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920
minimize the latency well in fact and
 

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.039
minimize the latency well in fact and
the most important answer is to use

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:47.049
the most important answer is to use
 

00:36:47.049 --> 00:36:49.559
the most important answer is to use

that a lot of apps want to do this sort
of thing and so it makes a lot more

we're going to increase it when we're on
Wi-Fi or on 4G or we're going to drop it

your in your morbid preamble this is an
 

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:22.200
your in your morbid preamble this is an
app that has great functionality that's

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:22.210
app that has great functionality that's
 

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.989

something that we really want to own but

00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:24.999
something that we really want to own but
 

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:27.989
something that we really want to own but
maybe not in this exact form yeah

00:43:27.989 --> 00:43:27.999
maybe not in this exact form yeah
 

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:29.729
maybe not in this exact form yeah
exactly so we're gonna give the

00:43:29.729 --> 00:43:29.739
exactly so we're gonna give the
 

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:31.259
exactly so we're gonna give the
developer a chance to share their

00:43:31.259 --> 00:43:31.269
developer a chance to share their
 

00:43:31.269 --> 00:43:32.729
developer a chance to share their
experiences and implementing some of our

00:43:32.729 --> 00:43:32.739
experiences and implementing some of our
 

00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:34.410
experiences and implementing some of our
suggestions and you know if you've been

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:34.420
suggestions and you know if you've been
 

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.489
suggestions and you know if you've been
explaining some of the choices that

00:43:35.489 --> 00:43:35.499
explaining some of the choices that
 

00:43:35.499 --> 00:43:37.229
explaining some of the choices that
they've made in later episodes of

00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:37.239
they've made in later episodes of

they've made in later episodes of
developers strike back so stay tuned for

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160
developers strike back so stay tuned for
 

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.690
developers strike back so stay tuned for
that

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:39.700
that
 

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.839
that
but so let's have a look at the app

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:41.849
but so let's have a look at the app
 

00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:45.720
but so let's have a look at the app
that's do so the the thinking behind

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:45.730
that's do so the the thinking behind
 

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.150
that's do so the the thinking behind
this app is pretty straightforward let's

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160
this app is pretty straightforward let's
 

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.999
this app is pretty straightforward let's
just bring the giant phone up so the

00:43:50.999 --> 00:43:51.009
just bring the giant phone up so the
 

00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:52.259
just bring the giant phone up so the
idea here is that you're going to create

00:43:52.259 --> 00:43:52.269
idea here is that you're going to create
 

00:43:52.269 --> 00:43:54.420
idea here is that you're going to create
a bunch of home screen widgets which all

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:54.430
a bunch of home screen widgets which all
 

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.130
a bunch of home screen widgets which all
have predefined messages which you can

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:56.140
have predefined messages which you can
 

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.039
have predefined messages which you can
set to a predefined audience so in case

00:43:59.039 --> 00:43:59.049
set to a predefined audience so in case
 

00:43:59.049 --> 00:44:01.890
set to a predefined audience so in case
of emergency or you know I've just come

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:01.900
of emergency or you know I've just come
 

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.150
of emergency or you know I've just come
home I've just landed any of those

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160
home I've just landed any of those
 

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.739
home I've just landed any of those
things so you can do it all ahead of

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:04.749
things so you can do it all ahead of
 

00:44:04.749 --> 00:44:06.960
things so you can do it all ahead of
time now what happens when you load the

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:06.970
time now what happens when you load the
 

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.700
time now what happens when you load the
app up the first time is you get this

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:08.710
app up the first time is you get this
 

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.430
app up the first time is you get this
massive screen of options now it is a

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440
massive screen of options now it is a
 

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.319
massive screen of options now it is a
widget app and there is a challenge

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:13.329
widget app and there is a challenge
 

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:14.940
widget app and there is a challenge
associated with widgets apps in that you

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:14.950
associated with widgets apps in that you
 

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.730
associated with widgets apps in that you
can't just have

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740
can't just have
 

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.250
can't just have
the main launcher icon launch the app

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260
the main launcher icon launch the app
 

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.500
the main launcher icon launch the app
widget selector so you have to find a

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:21.510
widget selector so you have to find a
 

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.740
widget selector so you have to find a
way to add meaningful value in that when

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:24.750
way to add meaningful value in that when
 

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.300
way to add meaningful value in that when
you when you first open up the app and

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:26.310
you when you first open up the app and
 

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:27.800
you when you first open up the app and
that's a challenge that we see a lot of

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:27.810
that's a challenge that we see a lot of
 

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.540
that's a challenge that we see a lot of
widgets apps do and so a lot of them

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:29.550
widgets apps do and so a lot of them
 

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.130
widgets apps do and so a lot of them
will do this go straight into the

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.140
will do this go straight into the
 

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.230
will do this go straight into the
configuration screen which isn't a bad

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240
configuration screen which isn't a bad
 

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.720
configuration screen which isn't a bad
idea except as you could see it's kind

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:35.730
idea except as you could see it's kind
 

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.840
idea except as you could see it's kind
of a complicated options menu there's a

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:38.850
of a complicated options menu there's a
 

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.730
of a complicated options menu there's a
huge number of options there some

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740
huge number of options there some
 

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.650
huge number of options there some
information in there as well as some

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660

underneath the rubble precisely I don't

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:09.120
underneath the rubble precisely I don't
 

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.450
underneath the rubble precisely I don't
need all this exactly and so this again

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460
need all this exactly and so this again
 

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.980

there's this ability to set a timer so

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.700
there's this ability to set a timer so
 

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.850
there's this ability to set a timer so
you can say you know said it five

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:16.860
you can say you know said it five
 

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.920
you can say you know said it five
minutes before you use then you control

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:18.930
minutes before you use then you control
 

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.420
minutes before you use then you control
fit out there it kind of moved and it's

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:20.430
fit out there it kind of moved and it's
 

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.700
fit out there it kind of moved and it's
it's really horrible it is and it's it's

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:22.710
it's really horrible it is and it's it's
 

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.020
it's really horrible it is and it's it's
a really useful function so I would

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.030
a really useful function so I would
 

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.900
a really useful function so I would
actually kind of want to have that as

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:25.910
actually kind of want to have that as
 

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.130
actually kind of want to have that as
the main thing so the two main things

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140
the main thing so the two main things
 

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.200
the main thing so the two main things
here is I want send it now send it in a

here is I want send it now send it in a
 

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:33.020
here is I want send it now send it in a
few minutes and edit also maybe so you

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:33.030
few minutes and edit also maybe so you
 

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.640
few minutes and edit also maybe so you
almost want to in flip the importance of

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:34.650
almost want to in flip the importance of
 

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.020
almost want to in flip the importance of
those things so that the editing

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.030
those things so that the editing
 

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.300
those things so that the editing
functionality is up on the top right and

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:38.310
functionality is up on the top right and
 

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:40.190
functionality is up on the top right and
the being able to set a timer is right

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200
the being able to set a timer is right
 

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.290
the being able to set a timer is right
there and also note that yeah so there's

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300
there and also note that yeah so there's
 

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.700
there and also note that yeah so there's
no way to cancel here as well which is

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:43.710
no way to cancel here as well which is
 

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.420
