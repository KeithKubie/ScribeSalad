00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.350
It was June 1931 when the law finally caught
up with Al “Scarface” Capone for good.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.910
After three years of building a case against
Capone for tax evasion, the FBI was finally

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.160
ready to arrest and try the notorious gangster.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.600
In the October of that same year, he was found
guilty on five counts of tax evasion between

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.300
1924 and 1929, two of which were felonies.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.830
He was sentenced to eleven years in federal
prison, plus fines.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.650
Though Capone “grinned as though he felt
he had gotten off easily,” his prison time

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.400
ended up draining the last healthy years of
his life.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.789
He was released in 1939 (after spending only
seven years in prison), but illness and disease

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.239
– most notably syphilis – ravaged his
mental capacity so much that in the FBI report

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.380
it said that he had “the mentality of a
twelve year old.”

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.860
He died in 1947 on Palm Island at the age
of 48.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.820
Here’s the story of how Alphonse Gabriel
Capone became Al “Scarface” Capone.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.760
Alphonse Capone was born January 17, 1899
in Brooklyn, a middle child in a large Italian

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.770
immigrant family.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.100
His family moved around Brooklyn, in order
to make sure they could afford the housing.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.439
This contributed to turning an otherwise smart
boy (when he actually was in school, he purportedly

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.990
maintained a B average, which was more of
an accomplishment then than now) into one

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.579
who regularly played hookey and was mischievous.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.259
His legendary temper was already apparent
at 14, when he hit a teacher that he thought

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.110
was unfairly lecturing him.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.250
He officially dropped out of school soon after,
like several of his brothers.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.439
He took a few honest jobs – at a candy store,
pin boy at a bowling alley, and a cutter at

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.149
a book bindery – but that didn’t last
long.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.789
At 15 or 16 years old, Al joined his first
gang, the South Brooklyn Rippers.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.789
Quickly after, he was initiated into a more
prestigious gang, the Forty Thieves Junior

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.979
– a junior version of the notorious Five
Points Gang.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.609
A later version of the mostly Irish gangs
of Five Points that was depicted in the 2002

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.509
film Gangs of New York, the Five Points Gang
was primarily made up of Italian-Americans

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.460
and led by Paul Kelly.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.100
Born Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli- he changed
his name to Paul Kelly in order not to seem

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.660
so Italian- Kelly was a charmer, a tough guy,
and quite a skilled boxer.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.379
In fact, he was such a good prize fighter
that he earned enough money to open his own

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.190
businesses – mostly brothels and gambling
houses.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.750
His establishments were often frequented by
Tammany Hall politicians.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.379
Soon, him and his boys were “campaigning”
for Tammany Hall candidates, making sure the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.940
right people got elected.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.959
In 1903, Kelly was arrested for assault and
robbery, serving nine months in jail.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.379
Upon his release, he opened the Paul Kelly
Athletic Association, a gym or club for youngsters

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.260
to learn how to box and fight.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.400
This is how Kelly and his cohorts recruited
the next generation of gangsters, like Meyer

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.019
Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Frankie Yale, and Al
Capone.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.360
It was Frankie Yale who recruited Capone to
the Five Pointers.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.090
Six years older than Capone, Yale was known
to engage in a fight or three, most famously

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.860
when he and a buddy “cleaned out” a Coney
Island pool hall with only a pool cue and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.239
a few billiard balls.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.730
Besides fighting, Yale was in and out of trouble
with the law through his late teens.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.049
But like Kelly before him and Capone after,
Yale knew the key to being a great criminal

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.500
was being a good businessman.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.709
He got himself involved in the ice business
(yes, in a time before everyone had freezers,

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.870
ice was big business), selling “protection”
to icemen and enforcing territories.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.989
He made enough money to open a bar in Coney
Island, he called Harvard Inn – as a play

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.840
on his own college-themed name.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.209
He hired Capone to work as a bouncer at that
inn.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.110
Harvard Inn was strategically placed, even
though when Yale opened it in 1917, he didn’t

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.110
know it yet.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.709
Located in an alley between Surf and what
would become Boardwalk, Harvard Inn had exclusive

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.640
access to the water – making it one of the
first bars to serve liquor from the “coastal

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840
rum-runners” during Prohibition (which began
three years later, in 1920).

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.439
Yale, who by 1917 was already rather successful
with the Harvard Inn, a mortuary, betting

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.030
on prizefighters, and a line of cigars, would
become extremely wealthy due to his good luck

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.060
and well-positioned bar.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.180
Being a bouncer at Harvard Inn required a
“certain finesse,” according to Robert

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.930
Schoenberg’s book Mr. Capone.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.020
They had to do it with tact and authority,
but not too much that the customer didn’t

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.440
want to come back.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.460
Capone was quite good and besides becoming
his bouncer, Capone became Yale’s pupil.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.350
Yale considered himself a businessman first,
not a thug or a criminal.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.130
Sure, he extorted, “protected,” and racketed,
but that was just part of business.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.940
If he needed someone beat up or even killed,
he would never do it himself – he would

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.940
hire someone.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.860
In Capone’s early days in the industry,
he often played this role, in addition to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.170
being a bouncer.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.480
When Capone became the boss, he adhered to
this strategy as well.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.400
Yale was also quite brutal, with the legend
being that he beat his own 16 year old kid

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.380
brother so badly for lying to him that his
brother had to go to the hospital.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.530
Capone also picked up on this as well.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.160
New York City was experiencing a heatwave
in early August of 1917.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.580
To escape the heat, many came to Coney Island
to play in the water and sleep on the cool

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.580
beach at night.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.280
For this reason, it was as crowded as Coney
Island had ever been.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.480
And Harvard Inn, due to its location, fans
and cold drinks, was packed every day of this

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480
heat wave.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.410
This brings us to how Al Capone got his famous
scars.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.780
On one particular day during this time, a
small stocky “hood” named Frank Galluccio

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.560
sauntered into the bar with his date, Maria
Tanzo, on one arm and his younger sister,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.700
Lena, on another.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.740
Despite the crowds, Capone, who was 18 at
the time, honed in on Lena.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.560
Watching from afar, he finally got up the
nerve to talk to her, asking her to take a

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.090
walk with him along the beach.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.310
She supposedly said no and Capone walked away,
but that didn’t stop him from continuing

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.590
to watch her.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.150
A little later, he supposedly asked her again
for that walk.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.060
Lena, none too please, informed her brother
of this annoying guy.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.211
She them told him that he was embarrassing
her, but asked Frank to make him stop “in

00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:07.220
a nice way.”

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.630
Galluccio took action, fully aware the situation
could escalate.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.370
As such, he told his female counterparts to
meet him outside.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.470
Before they could reach the door, Capone reportedly
stepped in and told Lena loudly, “I’ll

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.710
tell you one thing, you got a nice a** honey
and I mean that as a compliment.”

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.590
Hearing this, Galluccio demanded an apology
from Capone for the remark.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.750
Capone wasn’t having it, telling Galluccio
he was only joking around.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.670
This is when the situation got dicey.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.130
You see, Galluccio was only five foot six
and slight of build and was now attempting

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.750
to defend his sister’s honor by going toe
to toe with the five foot eleven, very beefy

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.780
Capone.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.300
Being at something of a disadvantage physically,
Galluccio decided to escalate the situation

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.000
beyond fists and pulled out his knife, slashing
at Capone, and managing to get in three cuts

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.620
to Capone’s face and upper neck before Capone
went down.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.900
With Capone on the ground in a pool of blood,
Galluccio ran out of the Harvard Inn.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.860
At this point, Capone was rushed to Coney
Island Hospital where he received eighty stitches

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.310
and was told he’d wear the scars forever.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.190
Galluccio, knowing what he had done and who
he’d done it to, feared for his life.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.210
This came to a head when Frankie Yale demanded
a meeting with both Capone and Galluccio at

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.490
the Harvard Inn.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.970
Sitting them both down, Yale turned Capone’s
head to show Galluccio the giant scars that

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.600
would be tattooed on Capone forever, ultimately
earning him the nickname “Scarface.”

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.280
Galluccio, thinking this was the end of his
life, tried to plead his case.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.590
But Yale never had any intention of hurting
or killing Galluccio.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.500
He was a businessman and simply wanted to
profit from this unfortunate scenario.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.140
He ordered that Galluccio pay Capone $1,500
for his trouble (about $27,000 today).

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.960
In return, Capone had to promise never to
retaliate.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.390
To top it off, Yale would lend Galluccio the
money, making Galluccio indebted to Yale and

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.880
earning interest to boot.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.620
Galluccio and Capone both agreed to this and
the matter was settled.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.270
Throughout his life, Capone would usually
claim his scars were acquired fighting in

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.330
France during World War I.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.840
He rarely owned up to the fact that his nickname
came from a bar fight when a smaller man slashed

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:21.960
his face for making rude comments to 
his sister.
