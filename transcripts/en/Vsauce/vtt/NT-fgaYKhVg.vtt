Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
coming from Kansas for the 4th of July.

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.580
Why Kansas? Well, because out here you can
do anything. You can even put a firework

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.099
store

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.240
next to a gas station. But enough about
the real world, let's talk about DONGs,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.660
things you can do online now guys. 
If your style is minimalist, play Nathan's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.670
recommendation,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.250
the Level Game. It's really simple,
but gets increasingly reliant on

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.500
you being clever. This Wesaucer
asked if there's a way to detect whether

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.510
an image has been

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.810
Photoshopped. One of my favorites is
Error Level Analysis.com

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.989
This site will automatically convert
your image to a known quality

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.870
and then compare. The higher the quality
the jpeg the better.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.790
Here's a picture of Bruce Willis's
daughter with a Photoshopped version on

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.460
the right.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.149
Notice all the activity around her face
and chin. Gotcha,

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.090
a fake. I've been playing a lot of iRunner
lately but for a similar

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.590
browser-based running game,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.239
"Adamdre" says 'Kawairun.'
Jump, slide,

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.280
survive. "FraserGodfrey" pointed me to a
great site where you can choose fun

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.320
ASCII fonts and then it will turn whatever you
type into neat ASCII

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.330
art you can copy and paste into e-mails,
websites, forums, wherever.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.200
The very same site has a typing test,
which I know sounds kinda lame,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
but you can practice your speed and
after the test see a heat map

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.340
of which letters you type the fastest and
which ones are your weakest.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780
If you want some music,
check out 'Undo' from The Half Pennies.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.770
Wait for it. Vsauce. There are some other
references to YouTubers hidden

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.229
throughout

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.589
and if you have time, try to find them all.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.390
If you're sick of flat music videos,
"MegaUltranerd" told me about

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.940
this music video, where you can use your
cursor to click and drag your

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.080
perspective around

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.800
to see other parts of the scene.
But now let's get psychic with

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.340
"Linkfirexs." 'Akinator' is classic,
but he still blows my mind.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.550
Think of a character and
actor, singer, scientist, cartoon

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.260
superhero,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.600
whoever.
Answer his simple questions and watch his

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.150
eerie brilliance shine through.
If you never leave the house, you might like

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.470
Bars of black-and-white,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.030
an awesome point-and-click about a sad
guy who receives a barcode scanner

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.250
that can scan some things you wouldn't expect.
Or

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.100
stay indoors and inside your games with
'Candy Catch,'

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.910
a neat little webcam-based game where you navigate
your body through reversed and flipped

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.830
images to grab the candy and not

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.790
the dangerous pumpkins. Alright, that
does it for games, but on Saturday I went

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.170
down to Joplin, Missouri

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.360
to help out.
It's been more than a month since the tornado hit

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.209
and this is how things look now.
The preciseness of the storm

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.880
is so chilling. On one side of the street
houses are together

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.400
and on the other they're not.
But of course, there are DONGs you can do about

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.880
it.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.610
You can donate and you can also learn
about tornadoes and tornado safety.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.130
Stay safe this 4th of July.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.050
And as always,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.550
thanks for watching.
