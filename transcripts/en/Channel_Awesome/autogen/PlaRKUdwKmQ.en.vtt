what happens I mean again that's a
second<00:05:10.479><c> failure</c><00:05:10.750><c> and</c><00:05:11.080><c> it</c><00:05:11.169><c> you</c><00:05:11.289><c> could</c><00:05:11.440><c> even</c>

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
second failure and it you could even
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
second failure and it you could even
argue<00:05:11.830><c> that's</c><00:05:12.159><c> harder</c><00:05:12.520><c> than</c><00:05:12.669><c> the</c><00:05:12.759><c> first</c>

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 align:start position:0%
argue that's harder than the first
 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.670 align:start position:0%
argue that's harder than the first
failure<00:05:13.270><c> so</c><00:05:13.630><c> I'd</c><00:05:13.900><c> like</c><00:05:14.080><c> to</c><00:05:14.259><c> see</c><00:05:14.409><c> a</c><00:05:14.440><c> little</c><00:05:14.560><c> bit</c>

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
failure so I'd like to see a little bit
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.070 align:start position:0%
failure so I'd like to see a little bit
more<00:05:14.919><c> a</c><00:05:15.460><c> little</c><00:05:16.060><c> bit</c><00:05:16.090><c> more</c><00:05:16.180><c> diving</c><00:05:16.509><c> into</c><00:05:16.900><c> that</c>

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
more a little bit more diving into that

started<00:05:52.569><c> off</c><00:05:52.719><c> you</c><00:05:52.870><c> know</c><00:05:52.960><c> so</c><00:05:52.990><c> very</c><00:05:53.319><c> similar</c>

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 align:start position:0%
started off you know so very similar
 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.950 align:start position:0%
started off you know so very similar
than<00:05:53.949><c> they</c><00:05:54.330><c> sort</c><00:05:55.330><c> of</c><00:05:55.389><c> split</c><00:05:55.599><c> apart</c><00:05:55.750><c> now</c>

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
than they sort of split apart now
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.570 align:start position:0%
than they sort of split apart now
they're<00:05:56.110><c> coming</c><00:05:56.380><c> back</c><00:05:56.830><c> together</c><00:05:57.039><c> again</c><00:05:57.550><c> I</c>

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 align:start position:0%
they're coming back together again I
 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.330 align:start position:0%
they're coming back together again I
just<00:05:57.699><c> I</c><00:05:58.180><c> love</c><00:05:58.630><c> the</c><00:05:58.659><c> way</c><00:05:58.870><c> that</c><00:05:58.900><c> works</c><00:05:59.229><c> out</c>

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 align:start position:0%
just I love the way that works out
 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.430 align:start position:0%
just I love the way that works out
I<00:06:00.430><c> think</c><00:06:01.090><c> it's</c><00:06:01.240><c> obvious</c><00:06:01.360><c> at</c><00:06:01.750><c> some</c><00:06:01.930><c> point</c><00:06:02.110><c> Zuko</c>

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's obvious at some point Zuko
 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
I think it's obvious at some point Zuko
is<00:06:02.500><c> gonna</c><00:06:02.680><c> win</c><00:06:02.949><c> katara</c><00:06:03.490><c> over</c><00:06:04.050><c> but</c><00:06:05.050><c> it</c><00:06:05.169><c> might</c><00:06:05.380><c> be</c>

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
is gonna win katara over but it might be
 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.089 align:start position:0%
is gonna win katara over but it might be
a<00:06:06.039><c> while</c><00:06:06.400><c> and</c><00:06:06.990><c> again</c><00:06:07.990><c> I</c><00:06:08.020><c> like</c><00:06:08.319><c> that</c><00:06:08.500><c> it's</c><00:06:08.830><c> not</c>

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 align:start position:0%
a while and again I like that it's not
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
a while and again I like that it's not
so<00:06:09.279><c> easy</c><00:06:09.310><c> it's</c><00:06:09.940><c> that</c><00:06:10.060><c> was</c><00:06:10.740><c> as</c><00:06:11.740><c> he</c><00:06:11.979><c> put</c><00:06:12.190><c> it</c><00:06:12.219><c> that</c>

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
so easy it's that was as he put it that
 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.909 align:start position:0%
so easy it's that was as he put it that
was<00:06:12.580><c> a</c><00:06:12.610><c> betrayal</c><00:06:13.090><c> that</c><00:06:13.389><c> he</c><00:06:13.719><c> as</c><00:06:14.020><c> she</c><00:06:14.620><c> said</c><00:06:14.800><c> you</c>

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
was a betrayal that he as she said you
 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.070 align:start position:0%
was a betrayal that he as she said you
he<00:06:15.310><c> made</c><00:06:15.490><c> his</c><00:06:15.699><c> choice</c><00:06:16.000><c> and</c><00:06:16.300><c> he</c><00:06:16.479><c> has</c><00:06:16.659><c> to</c><00:06:16.870><c> live</c>

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
he made his choice and he has to live
 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
he made his choice and he has to live
with<00:06:17.259><c> it</c><00:06:17.440><c> and</c><00:06:18.000><c> they're</c><00:06:19.000><c> more</c><00:06:19.210><c> doing</c><00:06:19.569><c> it</c><00:06:19.719><c> out</c><00:06:19.900><c> of</c>

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 align:start position:0%
with it and they're more doing it out of
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
with it and they're more doing it out of
the<00:06:20.650><c> fact</c><00:06:20.860><c> that</c><00:06:20.949><c> they</c><00:06:21.159><c> have</c><00:06:21.400><c> no</c><00:06:21.639><c> choice</c><00:06:21.909><c> in</c>

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have no choice in
 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have no choice in
this<00:06:22.389><c> and</c><00:06:22.659><c> they</c><00:06:22.750><c> need</c><00:06:22.990><c> Aang</c><00:06:23.380><c> to</c><00:06:23.620><c> learn</c>

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 align:start position:0%
this and they need Aang to learn
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
this and they need Aang to learn
firebending<00:06:24.009><c> and</c><00:06:24.550><c> here's</c><00:06:24.759><c> someone</c><00:06:25.000><c> that</c><00:06:25.389><c> not</c>

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 align:start position:0%
firebending and here's someone that not
 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
firebending and here's someone that not
only<00:06:26.319><c> understands</c><00:06:27.219><c> the</c><00:06:27.370><c> craft</c><00:06:27.729><c> but</c><00:06:28.120><c> he</c>

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 align:start position:0%
only understands the craft but he
 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
only understands the craft but he
understands<00:06:28.810><c> the</c><00:06:29.020><c> responsibilities</c><00:06:29.889><c> of</c><00:06:29.919><c> it</c>

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 align:start position:0%
understands the responsibilities of it
 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.379 align:start position:0%
understands the responsibilities of it
now<00:06:30.370><c> so</c><00:06:31.529><c> it</c><00:06:32.529><c> it's</c><00:06:33.520><c> a</c><00:06:33.639><c> good</c><00:06:33.819><c> it's</c><00:06:34.000><c> a</c><00:06:34.090><c> really</c>

now so it it's a good it's a really
really<00:06:34.509><c> good</c><00:06:34.779><c> mesh</c><00:06:35.020><c> and</c><00:06:35.380><c> I</c><00:06:35.649><c> I</c><00:06:35.680><c> really</c><00:06:36.219><c> like</c>

transformation any bit where Zuko is
 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.669 align:start position:0%
transformation any bit where Zuko is
trying<00:06:42.919><c> to</c><00:06:43.279><c> be</c><00:06:43.459><c> good</c><00:06:43.909><c> and</c><00:06:44.329><c> trying</c><00:06:45.289><c> to</c><00:06:45.529><c> make</c>
