00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:12.646
&gt;&gt;Lynda: If students aren't
comfortable with who they are,

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.016
or with their behaviors
in school,

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:15.856
if they're not succeeding
in those kinds of ways,

00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:18.126
then they're not going
to succeed academically.

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:20.736
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: If the child
is not behaving,

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.236
there's a need not being met.

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:27.326
My biggest goal is to make sure
they're getting what they need.

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.976
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Do you ever
have to make a decision?

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:30.006
Do you know what a decision is?

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:31.956
&gt;&gt;Ashley: The approach for
Social-Emotional Learning

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:36.646
within the Tier System mirrors
our approach to learning

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:37.946
in the academic system.

00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:40.536
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Just like for
reading, and just like for math,

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.966
you need a solid
core for behavior,

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:46.846
for expectation,
common language.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.406
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: That's right!

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.436
The difference between
conflict and bullying.

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:52.576
Anybody remember what
the differences are?

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:54.656
&gt;&gt;Lynda: The core instruction
for Social-Emotional

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:56.176
in elementary, a big part

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:58.186
of that is during morning
meetings every day.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.236
That's the way that
the school day starts.

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.686
&gt;&gt;Ashley: You greet each other.

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:05.466
You get to share what's
happened in your life.

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:06.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Put your
thumb on your knee

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.326
when you know what
you want to share.

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:11.106
&gt;&gt;Ashley: Our core
instruction is Second Step.

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:15.576
And that's a program that ranges
from lessons about friendship

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:17.856
to conflict resolution.

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:21.596
And typically that happens once
a week during morning meeting,

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.866
or that could happen during
their whole learning community

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.146
meeting on Wednesday mornings.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:28.376
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Is bullying something

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.446
that happened one time,
or is it repeated?

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:30.836
&gt;&gt;Students: Repeated!

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:34.936
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Is there even
power, or uneven power?

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:35.886
&gt;&gt;Students: Uneven power!

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:38.086
&gt;&gt;Ashley: Then just like
Academic Tiered instruction,

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:40.026
some students need
a little bit more.

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.526
Typically that Tier
2 instruction comes

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.616
from a guidance counselor,
usually within a group setting.

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:50.046
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: I group them by need,
not necessarily by grade.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.256
We have friendship groups.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:55.846
Some students, they don't know
how to initiate a friendship.

00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:59.356
I have a grief group of children
who have lost a loved one.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.426
I have a group for
self-regulation.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:07.316
So they're getting strategies on
what to do with their emotions

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:08.976
when their emotions
become very strong.

00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:11.206
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Do you ever have to
make a really hard decision

00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:14.446
because you're so angry
you don't know what to do?

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:14.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.400
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Yeah.

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:17.766
I'm going to teach
you today something

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:21.336
that is going to help you relax.

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.936
Okay, here we go.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.056
Gently close your eyes,
and take deep breaths.

00:02:30.596 --> 00:02:34.426
&gt;&gt;So the strategy was to give
them a sense of calmness.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.356
Go to their happy place.

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:38.176
Use that self-talk.

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:43.606
&gt;&gt;Go on the cloud in your
mind, and feel how soft

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:45.826
and comfortable it is.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:48.696
&gt;&gt;I find that sometimes
pulling them

00:02:48.696 --> 00:02:50.116
out is not necessarily
the answer.

00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.146
Pushing-in is something
that they started doing more

00:02:52.146 --> 00:02:55.756
so in the last three years
But I wanted to transfer some

00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:59.856
of the skills that we learn
in my office to my classroom.

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.176
&gt;&gt;If you can get them to do
that enough times, they're going

00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:08.836
to feel that success
in the classroom.

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.386
They're going to feel
successful learning.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:16.326
&gt;&gt;Ashley: Some students
need more intensive support,

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:18.766
and so then they would usually
meet with the guidance counselor

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.936
in Tier 3, more one-on-one.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.996
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: For instance, a child
is bullying other children.

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.996
That child wouldn't
be in Tier 2.

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:29.706
Most children that are doing
bullying have very specific

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:32.576
needs, so you would have that
child meet with me individually.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.896
I usually work really
closely with School Psych.

00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:39.576
The trajectory or the
need may be an evaluation.

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:42.026
Then they're more likely to
get involved with that child.

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:43.446
&gt;&gt;Will you let me
know right away,

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:45.806
so that way I can pull him
in, because he did really well

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:47.876
when we put him on that
behavior plan last year.

00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:50.586
&gt;&gt;Ashley: Our student
success team meets every

00:03:50.586 --> 00:03:51.466
four-and-a-half weeks.

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:54.856
And we talk through what types
of support the kids need.

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:56.986
&gt;&gt;Lynda: There are many
people around the table.

00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:58.776
The classroom teachers
are there.

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.796
The learning community leader,
school counseling is there.

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:03.766
Somebody from school
psychology is there,

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.456
an administrator is there.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:08.106
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Decisions are made
of all of us as a group.

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:09.846
So it's not like the
teacher says, "Okay,

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:10.966
I want them in Tier 2.

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:12.666
Put them in there."

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:14.056
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It happens
every time.

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:17.696
Helping him see the pattern of
the people that he sits with

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:20.786
and the pattern of arguments
and frustration that he has.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:22.886
Because I think it's
frustrating for him, too.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:26.596
I honestly don't think that he
really recognizes that pattern.

00:04:26.906 --> 00:04:30.186
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Is he-- and I know that
at one point Peter was refusing

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.026
to take his medication.

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:32.776
&gt;&gt;Based on his behavior he is.

00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:34.046
&gt;&gt;I would say, he
seems like, yes.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:34.906
&gt;&gt;I would say he seems like yes.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:35.746
&gt;&gt;Because it's very noticeable.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.766
&gt;&gt;No, I just put in that Ritzy's
is going to continue to work

00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:42.756
with Peter on these issues,
but also working with Mom.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:46.566
&gt;&gt;Ritzy: Quantifying their
progress is what sets

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:47.316
up a challenge.

00:04:47.756 --> 00:04:51.006
Because how do you
quantify self-esteem?

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:54.566
I usually do some form
of evaluation that I know

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:57.416
that the child is understanding
the message, or the skill

00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:58.486
that they're trying to practice.

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:00.916
Usually there is observations,

00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:05.466
pre and post-teacher
input gives me data.

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:06.406
Parent input.

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:10.496
I use rating skills that
give me information,

00:05:10.496 --> 00:05:11.956
but not necessarily
scientifically

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:12.986
coded information.

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:17.126
We go back and every nine weeks

00:05:17.126 --> 00:05:19.866
at the SSTs I ask do they
still need my services?

00:05:20.276 --> 00:05:22.906
So if this child has made
enough progress, we remove them.

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:26.716
I may do a check-in, I may do
a follow-up, but it all depends

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:30.496
at the need of every
specific student.

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.346
I want to make sure that
every child that walks

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:35.576
through those doors is treated
in a way that's with respect

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.086
and love and kindness.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:38.696
And I want to treat every child

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:40.896
like I would want my
own to be treated.
