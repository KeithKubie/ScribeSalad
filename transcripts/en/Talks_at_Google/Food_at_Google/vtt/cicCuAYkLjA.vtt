&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We are so thrilled to
welcome Chef Anthony Bourdain and

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.350
his team here to Google New York.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.220
You all may know him
from his Emmy award winning show No Reservations

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.040
where he
pretty much does everybody's dream job including

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040
mine.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.919
Of traveling the world and eating whatever
the hell he wants.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.610
Including some things that there's no way
you could pay me enough, I think, that you

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.610
actually
eat.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.610
There you go.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.600
He has a second show debuting on the
travel channel in November called The Layover,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.650
which is
described as a high octane travel series that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.789
follows him to cities around the world as
he gives viewers the

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.249
inside scoop on where to eat, where to drink,
and what to do on the 24-hour

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:36.249
layover.

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:40.770
He has written several books including Kitchen
Confidential, A Cook's Tour, and Medium Raw,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.739
which I see a lot of you guys have in the
audience.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.300
These are
books that made many people, including myself,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.569
decided
never to eat fish again on a Monday.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.899
In case you don't know why, it's because apparently
that's where all the crap from the week before

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.360
goes to the Monday specials, so don't eat
it.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.760
He's joined today by his Emmy award winning
team from No Reservations and the Layover.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
We have, starting right here, Tom Vitale,
an Emmy nominee,

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.430
producer director of No Reservations and on
the Layover.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.120
Zach Zamboni, to his right is a two
time Emmy winning director of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.470
photography for No Reservation and also the
director of photography for the Layover.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.510
And obviously Chef Anthony
Bourdain is right next to him in case you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.380
don't know who
that is.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.031
[audience chuckles] And Todd Liebler to his
right who is a two time

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:28.910
Emmy winning director of photography of No
Reservations.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.040
So we've asked Chef Bourdain to run the discussion
here today so I have no idea what they are

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.110
going to talk about but I have a feeling it's
going to involve food and travel, and possibly

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.590
his girlfriend, Paula Deen I don't know; we'll
see.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.190
[audience laughs] Thanks
&gt;&gt; Chef Bourdain: Now there's an idea.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.190
Thank-you.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.240
So what we'd like to talk about today
is making things.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.950
We make things and with the people on
this stage make -- along with a much larger

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.700
group of
people, equally hard-working, make No Reservations

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.510
and the
new series.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.940
I guess why it's us up here rather than
Lydia Tenaglia or Chris Collins or Sandy,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.940
or Eleanor or all the
people in post production, editing, sound,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.930
color correction
or all these other incredibly [chuckles] vital

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.310
components of the
show.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.510
The reason these guys are up here is because
we

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.880
spend -- we just talked about -- we spend
about 200 days

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.680
a year with each other on the road.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.900
We're the principal
road team for No Reservations.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.130
We spend a lot of miles,
a lot of time, a lot of drinks, a lot of poop

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.130
jokes.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
[laughter] And
so, I thought we'd talk today about how we

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.870
do what we do.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.740
And really, why -- you know, I joke about
it, but I mean

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.740
it.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.240
For me, the worst thing about the show -- in
a

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.970
perfect world, I would not be on it.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.290
I would not be on
No R You see the world as I see it.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.290
I would
go.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.290
I would see it.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.490
I would narrate the show and it
would be told through my point of view , but

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.700
I would really not
like to not see my stupid face up there.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.069
If you imagine
the show without me in it, I think it would

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.250
still be the
best God damned travel and food show on travel

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.890
television ever.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.880
[audience cheers]
And so, the question of the day is, how come

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.060
it's just so
fucking good?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.750
[laughter] Tom Vitale, producer, director,
perhaps you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.400
can explain like the process.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.900
How does it all begin?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.170
Like, a typical show such a thing exists.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.590
&gt;&gt; Tom: Tony is picking on me because he knows
I'm terrified

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.450
of public speaking.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.770
[laughter] How does it all begin.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.090
We start
about a month before we go out.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.300
&gt;&gt; Anthony: Generally I'll pick a
spot.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.140
&gt;&gt;Tom: Tony picks a spot.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.720
You have an idea sometimes a film that reminds
you of a place.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.850
You give us some direction and we go
out find interesting locations, interesting

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.940
people,
interesting things to do and the rest sort

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.889
of takes care of
itself in a strange way

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.020
&gt;&gt;Tony: Really so anybody can do it?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.460
&gt;&gt;Tom: Yes.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.460
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: you can follow Tom Vitale, at

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.460
TV superstar.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.250
That's his Twitter feed, by the way.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.120
At Zach
Zamboni.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.000
&gt;&gt;Zach: Yes, Tony.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.060
&gt;&gt;Tony: Surely it's not that simple.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.300
Come on, the show
looks amazing.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.889
Look at all the other shows that try
to be like us; they suck.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:57.590
The meal scenes, they're all sitting there
like mummies.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.330
Welcome to my home.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.290
Guy.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.949
Please
enjoy our food.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.770
[laughter] You know, they're the photography
is ugly, the lighting if any seems spectacularly

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.860
inept.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.150
There's no human dimension.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.240
It's all
happy horse shit.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.260
Everything's great . Please
help me understand, why are we so damn good

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.480
Zach
Zamboni.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.790
&gt;&gt;Zach: We got heart, man, we got heart.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.040
That's you, me,
these guys, post people, editors -- everybody

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.410
involved's got heart.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.120
We try to do something good,
you know, and we've got skills -- yeah, for

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
sure.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.540
[laughter]
But I think -- I do think we got heart.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.120
We're
trying to do something.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:53.570
&gt;&gt; Tony: Heart explains why, I think, why
particularly, you know, meal scenes with people

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.230
seem
to work a little bit better.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.230
You know what?

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.610
I've
often said, you know, we -- that we take the

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.500
time --
you know, we drink with people.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.730
You know, that
we're not alcoholics -- we're television

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.730
professionals.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.000
[Zach clears throat] [laughter] Drinking with
our subjects and the

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.680
people who host us on the show certainly helps.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.960
But
I think it's a function of -- we spend the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960
time with
the people.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.090
We're not just gang rushing some poor
rice farmer.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.310
You know, and saying, "Okay, the
scene's starting now.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.310
Get Tony out of the trailer.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.310
I go in.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.440
I sit down, I take a couple of bites.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.121
"Mmm, good" and back to the trailer.

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:41.750
The 4-minute scene
represents about how long, what do you think?.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.850
Typically Laos show
for instance.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.770
Maybe it's a four, five, six minute
meal scene.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.680
How long did it take you guys to get those
shots, and how much do you shoot between your

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.210
two or three cameras
because you operate a camera as well for a

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.210
show
like that.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:05.350
&gt;&gt;Todd: We're probably there two to
three hours before you're even there, because

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.960
we're
shooting the prep with the food which is actually

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.389
a
great way to get involved with the family.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.360
Because
you know, as a lot of you probably know, a

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.729
lot of
stuff happens in the kitchen.

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.229
You know, that's
where the hearth is.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:25.190
So we go in there and have a
relationship often incredibly nonverbal, right?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.450
Because as people on the crew know, my grasp
for

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.020
foreign languages is incredible [ laughter].

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.680
You
know, we go into the kitchen and we are just

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.770
taking
an interest in what they're doing.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.020
And that
immediately, I think, just opens them up to

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.259
us.

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.360
And of course
we're open to them because we're trying to

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.460
just get
in there.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.919
&gt;&gt; Tony: I mean, you're in the kitchen
often in a very tight space with somebody's

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:53.919
grandma.

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.009
She's not used to having other people in the
kitchen

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.050
other than family to start with.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.759
She's certainly
not used to this -- especially when you're

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.240
talking
about the mountains of Laos -- this invading

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.920
army of
hulking white people from America with cameras.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:15.520
That is a weird and
terrifying thing to people particularly hill

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.690
tribe
region of Laos.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.949
I keep using that as example
because that was probably -- I'm trying to

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:25.819
think of
where we appeared as most shocking apparitions,

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:26.819
you
know?

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:30.020
[laughter] So you know you go into a room
with cameras,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.169
everything changes.

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:32.430
Everybody gets weird.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.191
And I
think part of the struggle -- I think one

00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:38.190
of the
things that you guys particularly do really

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.060
really
well that makes all the difference is the

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:49.160
time spent
to A: let people get over that shock.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.910
The fact
that you're in -- it's often you.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.120
You're in the
kitchen with grandma.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.570
She's bumping you out of the
way.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.570
You smiling at each other.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.990
You're expressing
willingness to try things.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.830
You're open to the
experience.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.100
You're clearly appreciative of what's
going on and interested.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.080
You know, people are proud
of their food, wherever they are.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.492
Just about
everywhere in the world, people are proud

00:09:09.492 --> 00:09:10.492
of their
food.

00:09:10.492 --> 00:09:11.492
It means something.

00:09:11.492 --> 00:09:18.391
It reflects their history, their family
history, their ethnic history, often a long

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.690
story of
struggle and deprivation to arrive at these

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.850
dishes.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.850
It means a lot.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:32.750
They tend to like it wherever you
go when a guest is willing to smile and try

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.970
it and
be open to it.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.660
But I think the time you put in with
petting the family dog, playing with the kids.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.780
&gt;&gt; Todd: Milking the yaks.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.100
&gt;&gt; Drinking the local rot gut.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.170
Because let's face it, a lot of these situations,
in almost all of them, somebody is fermenting

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.040
or
distilling something cloudy in a backyard

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.380
somewhere
in a 55 gallon drum.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.990
&gt;&gt;Todd: Which they are very proud of
&gt;&gt;Tony: The willingness to drink that

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.410
makes a big, big difference in how things
are going

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.990
to go.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.040
So there's that.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.050
[laughter] You know, I talk about
time.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:13.510
But then again, this is a hand-crafted
outfit, you know?

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.959
This is -- you know, we're not
Target.

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:21.740
We're Hermès . It takes a long damn time
to make the bag.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.540
[laughter] But at the end of the day, okay,
it's expensive.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.882
It's a damn nice bag.

00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:31.610
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Zach: Yeah, I think -- I mean, yeah,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:37.140
it's like the Japanese craftsmen that believes
they're part of what they make.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.620
I think we go in
like that.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.210
We know our signature is on this thing
we're making.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.420
We're not -- we're making this thing
that represents us and we put -- we standby

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.491
it, you
know.

00:10:48.491 --> 00:10:50.769
&gt;&gt;Tony: You ever watch a show, you ever make
a show, and

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:55.910
later -- I mean, to me it's really really
important.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.910
Whatever I did yesterday.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.680
I know the feeling of
waking up looking in the mirror and going,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.720
"oh,
God --," like, whatever I did yesterday was

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.529
really, really, shameful
and embarrassing.

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:08.300
[laughter] Story of a lot of my life.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.149
I guess I determined
whenever I decided to go on television to

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:18.790
not be, you
know, really I would love to make a joke about

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.290
The
Chew right now.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.760
Should I?

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.720
No. [chuckles] You
know, I just -- I'm constitutionally unable

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.920
to wake
up to in the morning.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.899
To know that I'm going to
wake up tomorrow morning.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:35.611
"Jesus, God, that show we did
was really cynical, and cheap, and stupid.

00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.780
I don't care if people liked it, it sucked."

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.060
Have you ever woken
up in the morning after seeing a show that

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.000
you made
and thought, "oh, man."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.010
&gt;&gt;Tom: I think that's one of the
amazing things about working on this show,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.680
we all
feel so proud like Zach said.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.800
The product we put
out there.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800
I mean, it's just very special.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.640
There's
so many other people who work on shows that

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.290
you just
like you say you don't get to go home and

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.810
feel
really proud of what you do.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.350
It's kind of awesome.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.700
&gt;&gt; Tony: You knew this was coming too?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.089
What about the Romania show, Tom?

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:16.350
[laughter] Here's the
problem for me on the show is that, on the

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.260
one hand,
it's a good thing.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:27.000
Like, if the show goes really
really badly, we tell that story anyway, you

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
know?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.519
And if it goes really badly and it's an utter
misery

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:33.250
for me because I found out painfully one of
Tom's

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.010
early masterpieces, apparently that's pretty
damn

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.010
entertaining.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.680
[laughter] Do you care to tell --. How badly
did that shoot go?

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.200
&gt;&gt; Tom: It went pretty badly.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.060
I can't
just any other episode that's gone -- everything

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.560
--
it was a perfect storm.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.480
Everything was so bad that
it end up being so great in the end.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.519
[laughter] Ultimately, I
think it was a fair accurate representation

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:59.500
of our eight or
ten days there.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.610
Ultimately -- so I can go to bed at
night and sleep with an easy conscience because

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.500
again, that's a fair representation of what
we saw

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.500
during our time there.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.050
It may not be all of
Romania and we certainly did not go out to

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.720
assassinate
a country.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.880
&gt;&gt; Zach: We tried to do right.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.940
We had
the intention of doing right by those people

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.110
&gt;&gt; Tony: At the end of the day, that was
a funny shit though.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.920
&gt;&gt; Zach: We tried.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.270
We tried.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:31.720
I just want to say anecdotally,
this guy, when it starts raining, right?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.540
We're in
the middle of nowhere.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.100
We got no cover.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.200
No trees
no nothing.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.269
It starts raining.

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:41.290
&gt;&gt; Tony: And I'm always, "this scene is
over.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.440
We're screwed.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:49.310
Time to move to plan B."
&gt;&gt; Zach: "shit," and he goes "yes!"

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.030
&gt;&gt; Tom: Bad weather makes for good TV.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.410
&gt;&gt; Zach: And he's just like as soon as
things go off the track naturally "this is

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.410
perfect.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.660
&gt;&gt; Tony: He starts to smell Emmy.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.530
&gt;&gt; Tom: That's one of the things I
learned about this show.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.410
There is no script.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.360
We
don't do multiple takes of things.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.740
If Tony says
something or one of the people we're filming

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.950
says something and we didn't catch it for
some reason we're

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.480
shooting a food insert.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.690
We don't ask them to say it
again.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.529
I think that's very important.

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:19.600
It lends that feeling of immediacy to the
show.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.990
It doesn't feel scripted or forced.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.060
&gt;&gt; Tony: What do I hate most on the
show?

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.740
The walk in and the good-bye.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.470
That way back
when, we would do what's called "the walk

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.470
in".

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.019
It was, "Okay, Tony, stand outside the house
and this is the scene where you walk in and

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:38.470
you meet your hosts."

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.600
Worst case scenario, "We'd like to do that
again."

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.899
Boy -- it's impossible to feel any more of
an asshole

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.490
[laughter] than warmly introduce yourself
to somebody and

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.180
then "I'll be right back to do it again."

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.510
[laughter] Or only
thing worse is, "Thank you so much for the

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:02.060
meal and
letting me in your home, good-bye."

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.890
And then you
got to go back and do that again."

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.240
[laughter] So we just
don't -- we don't do it.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:15.029
The whole organism is
created to never have that kind of artificiality.

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:18.529
So favorite shows --
Favorite show for you to watch

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.010
and then favorite show of yours to make?

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.769
Is there a
difference?

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:26.149
&gt;&gt; Todd: Sure there is.

00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:30.961
Haiti was just
unbelievable, because I think, as I believe

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.740
Lydia was
saying or someone, we were just running on

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.740
all
cylinders there.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.410
&gt;&gt;Tony: You won an Emmy for that one, didn't
you?

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.930
&gt;&gt;Todd: I, I, think so
&gt;&gt;Tony: Might that weigh heavily on your--.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.660
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Todd: You know, I was asked, "is

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.830
there something you want to push forward?"

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.910
And I
said, "yes."

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.050
So that was I think amazing.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.920
Every
step of the way I would watch it.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.120
Pretty
overwhelming.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.320
Very, proud.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.930
&gt;&gt;Tony: So favorite show?

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.639
Proudest of
that one.

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:01.490
&gt;&gt; Tom: Right now.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.199
Most fun show to
do.

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:06.339
Well, the India show we did a making of.

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:08.870
So we
had two crews on.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.139
A lot of friends.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.730
It was a lot
of fun, you know?

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:16.120
You know, all my stuff hit the
editing room floor but what am I gonna do

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.780
It's not about me.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.560
&gt;&gt;Tony: Your favorite show you're
proudest of and then the show that was the

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560
most fun
to shoot.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560
&gt;&gt;Zach: So hard to say.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.400
People ask
that a lot.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:36.490
There's moments we have together making
a show that are just incredible moments.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.550
Like, that
little rail -- the railroad thing -- Cambodia,

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.490
riding scooters in Laos.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.940
&gt;&gt; Tony: Stone on top of this moving
platform built out of wood that they jury

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.649
rigged and put on rails together like with
a little putt putt

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:54.279
lawnmower engine moving farmers from the rice
paddies.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:59.949
We were post dinner and we might
have beamed up a little bit.

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:05.010
&gt;&gt; Zach: And it's his moment, you know.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:10.689
&gt;&gt; Tom: The sun was setting, you're
blowing through these rice fields.

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:12.949
Together after a
rainstorm with the beautiful fresh air.

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.909
So what we're getting paid right now.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.439
&gt;&gt;Tony: Your favorite show.

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.789
You're
proudest of and then most clever to shoot.

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:21.629
&gt;&gt; Tom: I think I would have to agree
with Todd about Haiti as being one of the

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:23.299
ones I'm most proud of.

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:26.389
It was a very difficult shoot.

00:17:26.389 --> 00:17:29.690
There was a lot of heartbreak spending time
with

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.999
these people and then we get on the airplane,
disappear, and come back here and they're

00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:36.159
left there.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:37.429
That was pretty
rough.

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:41.570
But it was also an amazingly magical place.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.570
It was enchanting.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.640
It was something really
enchanting about it.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.830
It was just so intense.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.709
&gt;&gt;Tony: What are the most fun shows.

00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:51.599
&gt;&gt; Zach: You got to say Rome here, come on
&gt;&gt;Tom: I think Rome was a really fun show

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:53.379
&gt;&gt; Tony: Rome is the show I'm the most
proud of.

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:58.210
&gt;&gt;Zach: That's an amazing --
&gt;&gt;Tony: Because we did -- it all started -- this

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:03.739
group we're sitting around in a hotel lobby
somewhere talking about films we like and

00:18:03.739 --> 00:18:07.240
how we
could do -- you know, I think the driving

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.049
mission of
this show is that whatever worked last week

00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:11.940
--
whatever we did last week no matter how well

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.780
it was
received, how successful it was, how much

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.779
the
ratings were, how much people loved it, whatever

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:19.879
we're going to do next week we want to try
really

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:23.409
really hard to undermine completely what we
did last

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:24.409
week.

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:25.409
We want to present a moving target.

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:27.389
We don't
want ever for the network to be able to say,

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:30.979
"I think I figured
out what the hell you guys are doing.

00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:32.009
Let's do more
of that."

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:34.700
Because by the time they figured that out
we will have moved onto something else.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.820
We spend a
lot of time sitting around having a few cocktails

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.029
thinking, "What is the most fucked up thing
we can

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:41.029
do?"

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:42.940
[laughter] And I don't know which one of you
guys said,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.640
"Let's do a food show all in black and white."

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.710
That's how good we are.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.649
We can make food porn in black
and white.

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:56.389
And we started talking about the early
neorealist Italian films that one percent

00:18:56.389 --> 00:18:57.899
of
our audience might have seen.

00:18:57.899 --> 00:19:04.009
[chuckles] We went out and did the just about
the stupidest thing you could do on travel

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.009
and food.

00:19:05.009 --> 00:19:06.940
We
made it all black and white show.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.940
Lit.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.940
We never
light.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.250
&gt;&gt; Zach: And they said no way.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.629
They
said that was.

00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:19.779
&gt;&gt; Tony: It is -- for me it is my
proudest moment because it was just so stupid.

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:21.359
And
it looks so beautiful.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:23.480
And the work you guys did.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.149
And the editing.

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:32.999
It looked -- the music,
everything, everything worked exactly better

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:36.149
than we
could have imagined when it all came together.

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:39.479
That
first Tuscany show that everybody hates, that

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:40.479
was a
fun show to make.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.009
&gt;&gt; Zach: That was a fun show to make.

00:19:42.009 --> 00:19:45.490
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Okay, what about worst?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.869
Just
lowest moment.

00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:48.149
What's the worst thing about making the
show.

00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:50.340
I mean, we have the best jobs in the world.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.549
Everybody says so.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:52.919
And it's true.

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:53.919
What do we do
for a living?

00:19:53.919 --> 00:19:55.309
We travel around the world eating and drinking
to

00:19:55.309 --> 00:20:01.519
excess making incredibly self-indulgent television
any way we damn please [laughter] with

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:06.599
as little creative interference as I think,
most people --

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:09.070
very few people are able to do what we do.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:14.019
&gt;&gt; Todd: Since we're talking about Italy
&gt;&gt; Todd: The Sicily show which I think

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:19.570
was Season 2 or 3, we had a picture that was
very

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.200
self-involved.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.130
And it was.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.080
&gt;&gt; Tony: Helicopter she no come.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.950
Ooh,
we're going to swim with the turtles today.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.630
The
turtle was sick.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.760
Nothing worked.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.960
&gt;&gt; Todd: How about the sea urchin scene?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.209
Oh, that was last week.

00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:38.639
&gt;&gt; Tony: Everything.

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:40.539
It was desperation as
everything.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:45.659
As each day goes by and we don't know what
to do.

00:20:45.659 --> 00:20:47.639
So we just had to make it up.

00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:48.639
&gt;&gt;Todd: Mmm Hmmm.

00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:49.639
So that was tough.

00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:52.530
&gt;&gt; Tony: I jumped off a cliff into water of
indeterminate depth.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.109
&gt;&gt;Todd: That was cool
&gt;&gt; Tony: That was a measure of our

00:20:54.109 --> 00:20:55.139
desperation.

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:58.070
[laughter] Spinal injury, it's always
entertaining.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.580
That will get us five minutes.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.289
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Zach: Bat caves and Bill Murray, those

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:07.739
are my two worst moments just the worst
&gt;&gt;Tony: Bill Murray?

00:21:07.739 --> 00:21:10.029
&gt;&gt; Zach: Remember that?

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:12.549
Went in there
did all the sun path work and everything was

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:13.549
perfect.

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:15.830
I had it silk screened, because it was all
glass.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.919
It was this giant
restaurant's all glass looks out on the Hudson.

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:19.919
Perfect cloudy day.

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.940
&gt;&gt;Tony: Oh that's right and Bill Murray was
--

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.989
First of all, we were supposed
to.

00:21:23.989 --> 00:21:26.840
I'm supposed to shoot with somebody for dinner.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.999
&gt;&gt;Zach: My hero and it was horrible
&gt;&gt;Tony: First, you got to understand this

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:29.999
about Bill Murray.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:31.879
If you want to make like Ghostbusters 3 and
give him

00:21:31.879 --> 00:21:35.849
like 30 million dollars apparently he has
no agent, he has

00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:38.289
no attorney.

00:21:38.289 --> 00:21:42.600
You call an answering machine
somewhere and leave a message and maybe you'll

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.139
hear
back five years later.

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:49.929
[laughter] So this, he just doesn't
behave -- you don't reach out to his people,

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:54.229
right
And I was supposed to have -- and someone

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:56.289
else
shooting with me, a meal scene in the Hudson

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:58.159
valley and they fell through.

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:00.080
The chef of the place said, "How about Bill
Murray?

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.690
Do you want
Bill Murray on the scene?".

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.960
He showed up the next day.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.450
I think he hitchhiked to
the scene.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.419
He just walks in.

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:14.499
The whole time I'm sitting there like I
have no idea what I'm saying.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.580
I know my lips are
moving.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.350
I'm just sitting there talking to him.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.350
The
cameras are rolling.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.210
I'm thinkin', "I can't believe Bill Murray
is

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.210
on my show.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.210
This is so cool.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.759
Why is Bill Murray on my show?"

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:27.950
And then just as Bill launched into a
rare moment of personal reflection.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.899
&gt;&gt;Zack: Oh I know
&gt;&gt;Tony: I don't know

00:22:29.899 --> 00:22:30.899
the most meaningful.

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:34.159
I think it was the most
meaningful, tearful moment of his life, what

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:35.159
happened?

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:39.129
&gt;&gt;Tom: The sun went behind the clouds
&gt;&gt;Todd: No, the sun went into his eyes.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:42.889
&gt;&gt;Zach: Nobody would make me nervous
like that, it was just because it was Bill

00:22:42.889 --> 00:22:44.200
Murray.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.980
But I did sun path to know exactly where the
sun was going to be and I'd hung some silks

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.011
up on the
windows so if it came out I would be able

00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:55.399
to drop it
in time so it would be direct sun right on

00:22:55.399 --> 00:22:56.399
his face.

00:22:56.399 --> 00:23:00.669
Of course, as soon as he started talking
about that, the sun came out wrong place.

00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:02.279
It was
totally in the wrong place.

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.279
&gt;&gt;Tony: Oh I remember.

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:05.149
And because of that
So it was like this.

00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:07.720
Well,
Tony I never told anyone about this before,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.289
after
that childhood tragedy, that was the moment

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:12.541
I
decided to become an --. And suddenly I see

00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:15.099
Zach running through the back of the scene
[laughter]

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:20.390
&gt;&gt; Zach: They came out and it was just
like this piece of sun that had worked its

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.869
way
around everything I had put up and it was

00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:27.029
right
there, right in the worst place possible.

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:28.029
I
remember.

00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:29.840
&gt;&gt; Todd: Your worst moment?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.269
Single worst
moment?

00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:37.840
You weren't the guy who wired up the inside
of the MIG ? The jet.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.629
We spent thousands of
dollars for me to go up in a Russian fighter

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:43.629
plane.

00:23:43.629 --> 00:23:46.529
They rigged up the interior with tiny little
cameras.

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:47.710
It was a new
shooter.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.359
It wasn't anyone on this stage.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:54.369
We go up we do the whole thing
barrel rolls lots of comedic footage of me

00:23:54.369 --> 00:23:56.330
struggling to not blow chunks.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.519
We land . We hadn't
turned the camera on.

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:01.799
[laughter] Sweet.

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.629
&gt;&gt; Todd: Not me.

00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:05.729
I'm responsible for
other breakdowns.

00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:07.480
&gt;&gt; Tony: The worst lowest moment.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.230
&gt;&gt; Todd: Well, I think the one you keep
picking on now three seasons later is just

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.889
my -- I
knocked over a dish and or 2

00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:17.649
&gt;&gt;Tony: or 12.

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:22.679
&gt;&gt;Todd: A gross
&gt;&gt; Tony: It was a classic moment.

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:26.200
You know,
Todd, you have many virtues but Nijinsky-like

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.649
grace is not one of
them.

00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:29.099
What was it called?

00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:30.099
I forget the name.

00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:31.099
Pa dang restaurant?

00:24:31.099 --> 00:24:34.599
&gt;&gt;Todd: Pa Dong
&gt;&gt;Tony: Where they in Indonesia,

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:35.599
right?

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:41.429
Where they stack basically all of the dishes
in a huge triangular formation in the window

00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:44.700
and
underneath it are the mother sauces meaning

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.799
the
buckets of the back up.

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:50.349
You know, basically the
restaurant's entire food supply for the day.

00:24:50.349 --> 00:24:53.369
And
he's filming closeup and the mic hits one

00:24:53.369 --> 00:24:54.369
of the
plates.

00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:55.369
The whole thing comes down.

00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:56.369
Everything
shatters.

00:24:56.369 --> 00:24:57.369
Everything falls in.

00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:59.039
All of the village
elders are sitting there waiting for their

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.039
food.

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:04.649
Of course it's classic television and we've
used that clip at least four times in

00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:05.719
further shows.

00:25:05.719 --> 00:25:12.860
[laughter]What made it great for me was that
years later we're in like rural Szechuan province

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.399
in
China -- it was up in the mountains, Hunan

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:19.019
or Szechuan, we're up in the mountains.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:23.710
Singaporean or
Malaysian tourist and they see Todd and they

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:30.119
start
pointing at him, [laughter] "Mr. Clumsy man."

00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:31.639
Your worst
moment.

00:25:31.639 --> 00:25:34.649
&gt;&gt; Tom: Brazil shoot was really really
rough.

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:38.169
&gt;&gt; Tony: I mean I make you more
miserable than anybody I think.

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:43.869
If anybody bears
the full brunt of my unhappiness, self-doubt,

00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:46.019
self-loathing and misery, it's you.

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:49.100
You pretty
much -- you have a pretty wide menu to select

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.389
from
here.

00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:55.619
&gt;&gt; Tom: Brazil where you hurt your back,
Zach had the 104 degree fever.

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:59.409
We were stranded on the island.

00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:00.409
That was rough.

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:04.690
&gt;&gt; I like the part where we're
waiting on the plane and we're like four hours

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.070
by boat from anywhere.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.080
Waiting on this little island in the Amazon.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.379
You
know, it's late and these couple of other

00:26:13.379 --> 00:26:17.200
like
Europeans or Americans show up on the tarmac

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.149
who we
hadn't seen out in the jungle at all.

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:21.999
We turned to our
guide and say, "Who are they?"

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:24.559
Oh, yes, they too
are waiting for their plane.

00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:26.929
They come every day.

00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:28.710
[laughter] "Oh man."

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:34.639
Let's hear questions from you guys for
any at all.

00:26:34.639 --> 00:26:35.639
Please.

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:39.119
&gt;&gt; Male #1: How are you doing?

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.619
So I have
two questions.

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:41.619
One's for Anthony.

00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:43.820
One's for
everybody else.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.639
The first question is with all the
shooting and the traveling and the book writing

00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:51.539
and
whatever, do you even get a chance to cook

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:54.350
anymore
and if not, do you miss it?

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.099
The second question is,
on location, which one of you has the most

00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:59.099
fortitude.

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:02.919
[audience chuckles]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Okay.

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:04.239
I don't get to cook
much.

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:06.799
Very, very, very, very, rarely do I get to
cook either

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.419
at home or on the road.

00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:12.350
I'm actually really -- some
of my happier moments on the show are when

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:17.019
I get to
cook, either on camera or better yet off camera.

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:19.669
One
of the reasons I like Tuscany.

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:23.179
Because we all
rented a villa -- it was very -- talk about

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:24.179
self-indulgent.

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:26.789
The idea was to make a show about us making
a show.

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:29.529
It was a show about us going staying in a
fabulous

00:27:29.529 --> 00:27:33.859
villa on the a hilltop on Tuscany and then
making a show about the process of living

00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:38.619
in a fabulous villa [laughter] But the fun
part

00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:40.820
for me was I got to cook off cam.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.269
You know, we do
these little pot luck things.

00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:45.399
I got to cook pasta.

00:27:45.399 --> 00:27:47.539
That always makes me happy.

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:49.039
The second question was--.

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:53.389
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Which one of you has the most
fortitude on location?

00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:55.169
&gt;&gt;Todd: Tom.

00:27:55.169 --> 00:27:56.940
&gt;&gt; Tony: It's @TVsuperstar.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.549
It's
his Twitter handle by the way.

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:04.510
Far, far and away this guy is
up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.710
He's a slave
driver.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.859
He pushes his crew really, really hard.

00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:10.499
But he's also up earliest, out there.

00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:15.659
If it's really really stupid and suicidal
and incredibly hot and we don't really need

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:18.729
the footage, he's
going to go out and do it anyway, by himself

00:28:18.729 --> 00:28:19.729
if necessary.

00:28:19.729 --> 00:28:22.769
He's going to go all night
long and in between that, he'll be fretting

00:28:22.769 --> 00:28:26.950
and
worrying and going out and scouting locations.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.570
And he just goes
and goes and goes.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.190
&gt;&gt; Todd: Mobs in Thailand.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.940
Shooting at your
trains in India.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.730
Being attacked by Gila monsters.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.839
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Zach: He always smiles every morning.

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.690
I look forward to that.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.549
Every morning Tom, big smile.

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:43.659
"Good morning, guys.

00:28:43.659 --> 00:28:44.659
Hey guys.

00:28:44.659 --> 00:28:46.539
I love this job."

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:51.440
&gt;&gt;Tom: Just another day at the office
&gt;&gt;Zach: We're crippled.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.259
&gt;&gt; Tony: So without a doubt, it's Tom.

00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:58.529
&gt;&gt; Male#2: Thanks, guys for being here.

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.799
I'm sorry, I'm recording this.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:02.059
My wife, Lisa, is back home in Mountain View.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.450
I'm from the Mountain View office and she's
a former Googler,

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.450
huge fan.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.299
So I'm kind of channeling her right now and
here

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:09.340
enjoying your presence.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.940
&gt;&gt;Tony: Hi [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I'm sure she would say hi

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.659
if she was here.

00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:16.690
I just want to say seems like you
guys are doing exactly what you want to be

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.259
doing.

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:19.899
What you love.

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:21.440
She's somebody who's still trying to
find that.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.999
She's actually a really talented Italian
American cook and chef, somebody I think should

00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:28.960
just go to culinary school and do it.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.510
I think she's maybe afraid or not
sure about what dream to pursue.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.130
So any advice for somebody whose looking to
find what they love.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.509
&gt;&gt; Tony: Short answer on the cooking is
hey, before you spend money on a cooking school

00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:42.580
go
work in a restaurant even for free if necessary.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.389
Work in a busy restaurant.

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:50.830
Give yourself enough
time to understand how hard it is, how little

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.749
money you'll be making, how long it will take
you to pay back that student loan.

00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:58.549
Just how difficult and unglamorous it
is.

00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:03.599
And how insane you have to be to find a home
--

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:04.640
you know, there are two types of people.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.759
People
who love the restaurant business and thrive

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:12.089
on that
sort of insanity and adrenaline and futility

00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:16.379
and
inequity [laughter] and the pressure and the

00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:17.379
heat.

00:30:17.379 --> 00:30:18.399
And then,
there are normal people.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:20.989
And you need to find out
before you go to school.

00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:25.510
So I'm all for pursuing
your dream, but I think it's a good idea to

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.979
go find
out early, you know, before you invest in

00:30:29.979 --> 00:30:32.820
that
dream -- either time or money.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.099
Find out what that
means.

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:38.210
You know, if there's a downside, you know,
I

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.830
don't know how we all got this gig.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:47.029
I think it was,
you know, I mean, were you pursuing your dream&gt;

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:51.819
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Yeah, me too.

00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:55.659
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Thanks, guys.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:57.649
&gt;&gt; Tony: It's selfish though.

00:30:57.649 --> 00:31:00.129
I mean,
let's face it.

00:31:00.129 --> 00:31:05.440
You know, being married to any of us
would be difficult.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.929
We're away a lot.

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:09.109
And I think
it's also -- I mean, what do you talk about

00:31:09.109 --> 00:31:10.109
with
your friends.

00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:11.889
When you come back.

00:31:11.889 --> 00:31:16.019
When you have a
life like us, who do you talk to?

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.509
Your friends from
high school -- my friends from high school

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:20.669
or I used
to work with in the kitchen only 11 years

00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:21.679
ago, 12 years ago.

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.549
So what
did you do last week?

00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:27.200
Saw a Yankee game, went out
for a beer.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.009
Normal stuff that actually sounds pretty good
for me.

00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:30.009
What did you do?

00:31:30.009 --> 00:31:36.149
Me and Zach and Todd and Tom all
sitting on top of a dune in an empty corner

00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:41.140
of the Arabian
Peninsula smoking some hash [laughter] looking

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.239
out over the
vast expanse of desert.

00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:46.950
Then we got together with
these Bedouin dudes playing drums and hanging

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.479
out for hours.

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:53.269
[laughter]
Then we were like in a war.

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:54.269
You know.

00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:56.249
How do
you -- you're not doing anybody a favor by

00:31:56.249 --> 00:31:59.229
telling
them that, you know, what I mean?

00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:01.010
So it is kind of.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.540
We do live in a kind of freakish bubble when
you

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.540
come back.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.369
Or at least I do.

00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:08.950
You know, what do you
say.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.379
&gt;&gt;Tom: So alienating
&gt;&gt;Tony: Alienating

00:32:10.379 --> 00:32:12.679
&gt;&gt; Zach: They always want to know what
you're up to.

00:32:12.679 --> 00:32:14.789
I always want to talk to them about
normal stuff.

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:16.279
Let's talk about fishing.

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:18.899
Give me
something normal to talk about.

00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:20.679
&gt;&gt;Tony: So you never want to rub it in.

00:32:20.679 --> 00:32:23.619
&gt;&gt; Zach: Talk normal stuff.

00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:28.029
&gt;&gt; Tony: But you keep that secret.

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:29.429
You
know what I'm saying?

00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:33.149
You have this amazing amazing
thing happen.

00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:34.149
Let's face it.

00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:36.580
Amazing, amazing
things happen to us all the time.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.719
Do you tell
people.

00:32:39.719 --> 00:32:46.499
&gt;&gt; Todd: You know, I'm always asked,
"Where is your favorite place?"

00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:50.249
Hands down I say
Brooklyn, you know?

00:32:50.249 --> 00:32:55.669
[cheering]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Totally run for office, dude.

00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:59.759
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Todd: City council.

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:01.809
L-I-E-B-L-E-R Yes.

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:07.859
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So my question for you is,
"Would you eat Andrew Zimmern?"

00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:10.719
No, that's not my question.

00:33:10.719 --> 00:33:13.059
[laughter] But
you're actually thinking about it.

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:18.169
&gt;&gt; Tony: Andrew is a good friend, put it
this way, if we're on a lifeboat long enough

00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:20.940
and
he's not keeping up with the rowing, slow

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:27.710
braise . [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #2: My real question is, you get

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.429
your dangerous situations, the bat cave was
scary,

00:33:32.429 --> 00:33:34.940
riots, someone brings out a vat of alcohol
with dead

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.940
birds in it.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.940
What are you gonna do?

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.940
When do you say "no?"

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.789
When do you say
"uh-uh, I'm not doing this."

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:42.019
Like, you're in
danger, or.

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:47.860
&gt;&gt;Zach: Tom never says no
&gt;&gt; Tony: When do we say, "Okay, we're

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.860
not doing it?"

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.580
&gt;&gt;Tom: I can't think of a time.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.950
It's
strange when you're shooting and you're there

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.320
with a
camera we're making a show.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.080
You cease to become yourself.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080
You're not yourself
anymore.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.379
You're not a regular human being.

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:02.669
You
just have to just do it.

00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:06.209
Because any time you close
yourself off to any opportunity.

00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:09.030
When you have --
you're so lucky enough to be there in the

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.819
first
place, you know?

00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:13.159
You'd be a fool to say "no" to
anything.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:17.460
&gt;&gt; Tony: We've been -- looking back
there, I've done some really really stupid

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.569
things on
the show that I probably wouldn't do again,

00:34:22.569 --> 00:34:24.679
but you
know, I'm a dad now.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:29.879
I probably wouldn't -- I
wouldn't make the jump off the cliff for sure.

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:34.569
Other
than that, you're in a situation.

00:34:34.569 --> 00:34:37.210
Violating your
deeply held principles about what to eat for

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.889
instance -- is it a pet or is it food?"

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:45.099
[laughter] I do have
deeply held principles there.

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:49.629
Is it repulsive to me
or is it even rotten?

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:57.550
I'm going to eat it rather than
offend my hosts, I'm going to try it.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.550
Sometimes
that ends badly.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.829
What did you say, man?

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:01.970
You're
another knuckle head.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:08.089
You're hanging out of helicopters; going out
on cliffs, doing stuff Just seeing him in

00:35:08.089 --> 00:35:12.400
Iraq when
we're -- I'm in the rear hatch of a Russian

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.000
helicopter of dubious airworthiness where
the hatch in the back

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.140
opens up.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:23.980
I'm strapped in; I have a tethered cord and
I'm there on the thing and it's wind

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.980
coming.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.730
These guys are hanging out way further.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.880
Just looking at him with a camera, my palms
were

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880
sweating.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.880
So I know you don't say no.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.180
I haven't
seen you.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:41.049
&gt;&gt; Todd: I'm not sure if this is the
right double negative, but like suspend disbelief,

00:35:41.049 --> 00:35:47.430
because you're doing things and you're thinking,
"Well, that rail car in Cambodia, that goes

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.579
off the
rails and we're going at 50 miles an hour,

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:52.410
it's not
going to be a pretty show."

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:57.680
But you just have to
pull back from that and just be there in the

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.279
moment
and not think of the consequences of that

00:36:00.279 --> 00:36:01.279
moment [chuckles].

00:36:01.279 --> 00:36:02.490
&gt;&gt; Tom: Looking into the camera really
helps.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.630
It takes you.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:09.699
&gt;&gt; Tony: So what's my excuse ? I think it
goes back to alcohol.

00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:14.180
&gt;&gt; Male #3: My wife frequently tells me if
I were to be reincarnated, I would want to

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.720
come back as you, Tony.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.470
So probably true.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.660
And I
wanted to ask since you said yourself you've

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.349
got a pretty
good gig, good life, you guys feel blessed,

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:25.640
who would you like
to come back as.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.640
&gt;&gt; Tony: Seriously?

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.200
I would like to
come back as Bootsy Collins, [laughter] or

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.400
somebody who plays bass guitar as well as
Bootsy Collins.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.480
Like Flea or
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I figured it'd be rock and roll

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.510
&gt;&gt;Tony: Flea or Larry Graham.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:42.400
I would play funk bass from like early James
Brown and the Famous Flames or Parliament

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400
Funkadelic.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.390
I would play funk bass, incredibly
well.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.369
I would throw it all away for that honestly.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:51.690
If I could just play bass at all.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.670
No -- really,
really, really well.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.529
That to me seems like something
I would -- I wouldn't mind cheerfully coming

00:36:58.529 --> 00:37:02.699
back but I don't think I'm going to get that
lucky [laughter]

00:37:02.699 --> 00:37:03.890
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Hi.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.690
Thanks so much for being
here today.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:07.750
So I've two questions.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:08.750
One is about
Iceland.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.160
The other is about Peru.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.279
So the first one
is -- so Iceland is somewhere I've always

00:37:13.279 --> 00:37:17.010
wanted to
go, but after seeing your show, I'm not so

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.010
sure.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:19.640
Because it just sounded like everything tastes
so

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.640
terrible.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.539
So my first question is: is there anything
there that any of you

00:37:23.539 --> 00:37:24.539
ate that tastes good.

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:27.609
&gt;&gt; Tony: There is good food there and there
are good restaurants.

00:37:27.609 --> 00:37:28.960
&gt;&gt;Female #2: What is it.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.250
&gt;&gt; Tony: They have, you know, European
and new Scandinavian cuisine.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.819
It's very exciting on the
fine dining end.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.869
The everyday food is pretty decent.

00:37:36.869 --> 00:37:41.660
Their traditional holiday food is
probably the worst in the world.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.369
[laughter] But you're not
going to have to eat that unless you want

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:45.760
to.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.420
My
problem with Iceland is it's tiny.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:52.240
I mean, as far
as, you know, there's one big city.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.240
It's not that
big.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240
Eight bars.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.460
Basically you're going to be
doing a lot of drinking.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.069
Unless you were into
hiking and outdoorsy shit which I'm totally

00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:01.289
not into.

00:38:01.289 --> 00:38:05.630
&gt;&gt;Female #2: You can jog around in 5 days.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:09.160
&gt;&gt;Tony: Cross country skiing, hiking, mountain
biking --

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.060
sounds like hell to me.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:15.049
Rock climbing -- then it's
a wonder land.

00:38:15.049 --> 00:38:19.160
It's incredibly beautiful country
filled with spectacular natural vistas.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.160
Big deal.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.680
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Did you ride the horses there?

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.779
&gt;&gt; Tony: Yeah, I rode the little horses.

00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:28.260
&gt;&gt;Female #2: The glide is really smooth.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.740
&gt;&gt;Tony: Cute
horses.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:35.260
Lot of drinking, lot of marinating in hot
tubs in hot springs.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.260
More drinking.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.809
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Then you guys made a really
funny commercial at the end.

00:38:38.809 --> 00:38:40.489
Yeah, that was
hilarious.

00:38:40.489 --> 00:38:42.000
&gt;&gt; Tony: Not my favorite place.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Peru,
completely awesome.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.609
&gt;&gt; Female #2: So I was in the Amazon earlier
this year.

00:38:45.609 --> 00:38:48.240
I want
to know about that fermented--.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.170
The woman, you showed her I have to say when
you showed her spitting into the cup and making

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.470
-- I was grossed
out.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.910
Which is hard for me --.
&gt;&gt; Tony: Very very traditional all through

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.740
the Andes
mountains.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:08.339
If you're going to be hanging out in
rural mountain regions of Latin America, you

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:10.559
will be
drinking that stuff and likin' it.

00:39:10.559 --> 00:39:12.070
&gt;&gt; Female #2: What did it taste like.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.609
&gt;&gt; Tony: Sort of like --
&gt;&gt; Todd: Saliva.

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:21.290
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Like if you've ever had pulque in

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.290
Mexico.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.540
It's sort of a sour milk.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.660
With beer
with a sour milk component.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.819
[laughter] Not that bad.

00:39:30.819 --> 00:39:31.980
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Sounds good.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980
Okay, thank you.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.020
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Hi again.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.080
I have a bunch of
close friends that are not here that were

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.160
like "you have to ask about Rome" because
that's their favorite.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.140
Cacio e pepe dish
that you ate, where was it at?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.269
&gt;&gt; Tony: The restaurant's name is Roma
Sparita

00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:51.330
&gt;&gt;Tom: I believe so
&gt;&gt;Tony: in Costavel district.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.170
Roma Sparita
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Female #3: I'm going.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.170
Thanks.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.170
&gt;&gt; Tony: Go.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.170
By all means.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.170
Over here.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.579
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Unfortunately, I'm less
traveled than some of my coworkers so I'm

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:00.940
just going straight to the heart.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.079
Anthony, any
bar recommendations in the neighborhood.

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:06.180
&gt;&gt; Tony: Here in New York?

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180
The Village?

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.630
&gt;&gt; Tony: I don't get out to bars much
anymore.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:17.210
One of the -- you know, my favorite dive
bar closed down.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:25.039
I like the distinguished La Camba
lounge on -- it's ninth avenue -- I'm sorry

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:31.000
eighth
avenue and right around 30th.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.400
Right next to where
Papaya King used to be.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.950
38th.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:42.569
That is a
sinister awesome, you know, late afternoon,

00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:45.050
late
night drinking bar.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:50.809
You know, it has sort of a
vaguely Latino tiki kind of a thing going

00:40:50.809 --> 00:40:52.299
on.

00:40:52.299 --> 00:40:55.420
It's really one of the last true dives in
the area

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.380
in an increasingly yuppified world.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.749
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Thank you very much.

00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:03.829
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Thanks again for coming here to
talk to us.

00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:09.810
I think a few years ago you once said
your perfect meal was going to be a bowl of

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.880
pho in Saigon.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.339
A very similar question to what you were saying.

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:14.900
So
when you were in New York, where would you

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.480
go for
such a meal.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.809
&gt;&gt; You know, that's a thing.

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:23.750
When
you've had really good pho in Hanoi or Saigon,

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.380
it really kind of
ruins it for you here.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:35.480
[laughter] There are places that have decent
pho but I need pho in context now.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.240
I'm not happy eating it in New York.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.220
I want to be
on a low plastic stool.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:45.099
I want -- I need the roll
of toilet paper on the table.

00:41:45.099 --> 00:41:47.339
The little toothpick
dispenser.

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:50.049
This sort of grimy bottle of fish sauce.

00:41:50.049 --> 00:41:51.750
I need the condiments there.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.009
I need the chop
sticks.

00:41:54.009 --> 00:41:55.410
The dirty spoons.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.519
The tissues on the ground.

00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:59.550
And I need Vietnam
outside.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.050
I need to smell those smells and see
Vietnam.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.619
It's part of the experience for me.

00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:08.789
So I
just -- I'm not having as much fun.

00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:12.140
I don't -- I
never go out for pho in New York anymore.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:16.609
It's why maybe I'm so
happy when I get it over there and I am ridiculously

00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:17.870
happy getting it there.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.309
That's an interesting questions since we're
all world travelers here.

00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:23.869
Your go to international
dish.

00:42:23.869 --> 00:42:30.779
Of all the things you've eaten, the one that
you had probably be happiest to do again.

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:34.279
&gt;&gt; Tome: My favorite is still Nona Josepina's
ragu

00:42:34.279 --> 00:42:41.530
in Naples with grandma cooking meat and tomato
sauce for ten hours with her

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.809
right there chain smoking the whole time.

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:45.462
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tony: What about you?

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:47.380
&gt;&gt; Zach: I can't answer it.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.380
There's too
many little--.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.380
&gt;&gt; Tony: Oh, pick one -- c'mon.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.020
&gt;&gt; Zach: I can't.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.970
In China we've had
some incredible meals.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.769
In Spain, in Italy we've had
just incredible meals.

00:42:56.769 --> 00:43:00.170
It's too hard to pick.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:06.230
&gt;&gt; Todd: My short-term memory is only
working now so that two bowls of risotto we

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:10.359
just had
in Croatia pretty incredible.

00:43:10.359 --> 00:43:13.829
&gt;&gt;Tony: 12 hours they're
making this ragu of ox tail or something.

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:16.309
Then they
stir in the rice.

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:17.750
Oh man.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.190
That's good.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.640
&gt;&gt; Tony: Yeah.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.079
Over here.

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:26.980
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Thank-you for being here, I just
have two

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.290
very easy questions.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.920
But if I don't ask, I'll
probably regret it in at least a decade.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.299
So in the
spirit of that man's wife whose energy I'm

00:43:34.299 --> 00:43:36.690
also sort
of channeling [laughter].

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:42.700
I don't know where he is.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.309
So to speak.

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:48.819
Have you ever considered having an apprentice
even

00:43:48.819 --> 00:43:49.819
just for one episode.

00:43:49.819 --> 00:43:52.289
A special contest where
someone gets to join you.

00:43:52.289 --> 00:43:53.949
&gt;&gt; Tony: We've done it.

00:43:53.949 --> 00:44:00.650
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So the next question is, can
you do it again and can that be me.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.109
&gt;&gt; Tony: Where would you choose to go if
you were -- if you had to pick a spot to take

00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:05.109
us.

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.640
&gt;&gt; Male #5: That's a good question.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.269
So
you've been to a lot more places than I have.

00:44:08.269 --> 00:44:10.420
I'd
actually like to try South Africa.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.859
There are other
places in Africa that I'd like to go.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:16.580
I'm fairly
well-traveled for my age and I love to eat

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.580
too.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.380
I like the places that are really off the
beaten path as I'm sure do as well.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.299
&gt;&gt; Tony: There's a real risk to this you
know, by the way.

00:44:23.299 --> 00:44:27.670
We did solicit a contest winner to take us
to their choice of place.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:28.670
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I saw that a few years ago.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.670
&gt;&gt;Tony: And
man these people got so much shit from our

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:32.670
home team.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.150
Poor guy from the Philippines who is his life's
dream.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.890
I
think he'd emigrated as a child.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.730
He knew very little
of his country.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.900
Yet he'd been once.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.490
He was desperate,
yearning to reconnect with his family from

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.789
whom he'd
been separated, his culture.

00:44:49.789 --> 00:44:53.809
He single handedly convinced me to
take the show to the Philippines.

00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:58.329
Man, he got
dumped on so bad by his country men.

00:44:58.329 --> 00:44:59.530
You're not
Filipino enough.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.839
I could have done better.

00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:03.750
My
grandma's food was better.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.660
He got a lot of crap for
that.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.289
The buffalo dude.

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:10.700
We did it basically four
times.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.730
The flip side of people taking their food
very personally and being very proud of it,

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.619
is they get very
pissed off when they think somebody else from

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:19.230
their team
hasn't represented well.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:23.200
So there is a dark side to
that job.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.530
You had a second question?

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.530
Or.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.839
&gt;&gt; Male #5: The second question was can it
be me.

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:32.339
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Over here.

00:45:32.339 --> 00:45:35.180
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Thank you so much for coming.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.950
I have a question about music because you
talk about

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.640
how much you love music.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.460
I'm curious who would you
see play live if you could see any touring

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.580
band
that's out today.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.630
&gt;&gt; Tony: Out today.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.260
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Yeah.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.890
&gt;&gt;Tony: Out today.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.400
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Or favorite album of the last

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.460
year or so.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:01.279
&gt;&gt;Tony: Of last year, the Rome album, Daniele
Luppi, Dangermouse and Norah Jones, . Jack

00:46:01.279 --> 00:46:05.869
White, I think is amazing,
amazing album.

00:46:05.869 --> 00:46:06.869
It was like--.

00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:11.210
I just saw the last
episode of Breaking Bad season 4 and it closes

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.720
with
the song from that album and like this show

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.730
wasn't
awesome enough, my head just completely exploded.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:20.119
[laughter] So
that would be the album for me of the past

00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:21.119
year.

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.720
As far as who to see live,
I've never seen Pearl Jam.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.400
I'd like to see Pearl Jame before it's all
over.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400
Yeah.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.660
Who do you?

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.180
Who do you want to see?

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.979
&gt;&gt; Todd: Pavement
&gt;&gt; Tony: Pavement?

00:46:32.979 --> 00:46:34.380
&gt;&gt; Todd: Yeah.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.720
&gt;&gt;Zach: You know, I've never seen Yo Yo Ma.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720
&gt;&gt;Todd: I've seen him!

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:38.720
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tony: You

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.109
&gt;&gt;Tom: Lady Gaga
[laughter]

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:49.049
&gt;&gt;Tony: Over here
&gt;&gt; Male #6: I first wanted to just thank

00:46:49.049 --> 00:46:50.339
you guys for what you do.

00:46:50.339 --> 00:46:52.829
My wife and I had our
first kid this year so we're on travel hiatus.

00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:54.740
So
it's kind of like the methadone for our travel

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.480
addiction for us to be
able to watch your show.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.310
So thank you very much.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.339
I
was just curious -- between going to a place

00:47:01.339 --> 00:47:03.251
that
most people have never been or going to a

00:47:03.251 --> 00:47:05.200
place that
maybe a lot of travelers have been to and

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.630
trying to
show a new angle on it which do you prefer

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.360
or find more exciting to do?

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.650
&gt;&gt; Tony: One demands the other.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.769
Especially as we do this year after year.

00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:18.890
Quite
frankly, if we do a Rome show, an Italy show

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.279
and a Provence show
in short order.

00:47:22.279 --> 00:47:24.460
I'm putting on what, eight, ten pounds.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.269
That's eight to ten pounds we're putting on.

00:47:26.269 --> 00:47:27.810
There's no way.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.130
It'll kill you.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.019
The sheer abundance of
wonderfulness.

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:35.520
[laughter] It's physically just kicks the
shit

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.790
out of you, all that good food.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:44.009
Also, you start to
get -- it's -- it becomes boring for the viewer,

00:47:44.009 --> 00:47:46.380
I think, if
it's just one fantastic experience of the

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.380
other.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.569
So
I think we very deliberately pick especially

00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:53.619
after a show
where there's lots of good stuff, lots of

00:47:53.619 --> 00:47:56.529
beautiful
scenery, it's a comfortable show, we're deliberately

00:47:56.529 --> 00:48:03.380
looking for some place
where both food is a struggle and, as importantly,

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.650
whatever we're going to be talking about is
going to

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.770
be a struggle.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.089
Like, we're not sure how we're going
to feel about this.

00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:13.390
We're not going to be -- there
are no clear cut moral issues.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.690
You know, Haiti,

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.740
Liberia, you know, it's not misery tourism.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.400
We're
going in looking to do a happy show everywhere

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.579
we
go.

00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:28.809
But we're looking for places where we're going
to be, I think, pressed or challenged.

00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:31.460
I think we're
doing that very deliberately over the last

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.300
couple of seasons.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.839
Otherwise the show will become boring.

00:48:34.839 --> 00:48:36.420
We will
become boring.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:43.349
Frankly, you enjoy your fantastic
bowl of fettuccine carbonara a hell of a lot

00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:46.069
more
when you've just gone been to a country where

00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:50.359
people
are really, really struggling for very, very

00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:52.210
little to eat.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:56.980
&gt;&gt; Male #6: That also answers my wife's
question for how you managed to stay so thin.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.980
So
twofer.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.980
Thank-you very much.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.980
&gt;&gt;Tony: Thanks.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.220
Question over here
&gt;&gt; Female #5: In your book Kitchen Confidential,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.410
you talk about how it's tough to
be a woman in the cook kitchen.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.079
You really respect women, you kind of keep
up.

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:11.690
you
Obviously, you guys are a bunch of dudes.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:13.920
Not a lot
of women going on up there.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:19.940
Do you find that
it's -- [laughter]do you think that that's

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.940
changing?

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.690
There are a lot of popular female chefs, is
that changing more and more?

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.140
&gt;&gt; Tony: I feel that any answer I would give
you

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.140
would be patronizing.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:31.190
I think I should probably refer you to
the head of our company, Lydia Tenaglia or

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:36.130
our executive producer, Sandy Zweig Or any
woman who made this

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:41.680
show, who run the show, who oversee the show.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.670
We are
all products both literally and figuratively

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.809
of --
this is a women-run operation.

00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:57.990
[laughter and cheering] So the whole genesis
of

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:06.539
this show in fact started out when I met Lydia
Tenaglia and her new husband Chris Collins

00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:09.590
who just
got married ten seconds earlier and we went

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.290
out to
make a cooks' tour together for Food Network.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.430
I met them they
were people walking backwards in front of

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.670
me with cameras across Southeast Asia.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.710
This whole team, this whole company Zero Point
Zero.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:29.210
And
this whole enterprise came out of that very

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:33.069
tiny
personal relationship.

00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:39.000
So and over the years, you
know, as it has happened over the last few

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.289
years
we're together the most, but we work with

00:50:43.289 --> 00:50:48.849
a lot of
women basically doing your job as shooters,

00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:52.730
assistant
directors.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.670
So.

00:50:54.670 --> 00:51:01.140
Just an ugly accident that we're
all dudes up here now.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:06.410
&gt;&gt; Male #7: So before there's like a
million and one celebrity chefs, who was your

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:11.440
favorite
80's chef like on the old 80's show PBS?

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.480
&gt;&gt; Well, I revered Julia child.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.579
I
think Julia Child the most single important

00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:20.160
person in American gastronomy was Julia Child,
without question.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.710
She changed the world;
not professionally trained.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.940
Made the world a better
place, you know?

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.369
I grew up with a generation where
every refrigerator had a copy of her book

00:51:29.369 --> 00:51:30.369
on top.

00:51:30.369 --> 00:51:32.920
Everyone had seen the shows.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.090
Everybody was a better
person.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:39.460
Not only a better cook, but a better person
and a better eater, which means better person

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.880
in my
view, post, Julia.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.249
Jacques Pepin.

00:51:44.249 --> 00:51:47.450
You know, Jacques Pepin tells
you this is how you make an omelet.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.480
The matter is
settled as far as I'm concerned.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.819
&gt;&gt;Male #7: His daughter would disagree and
she corrected him many times.

00:51:52.819 --> 00:51:53.819
It was great.

00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:54.819
When they do a show together
it's great.

00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:58.869
&gt;&gt; Tony: Jacques could write about everything.

00:51:58.869 --> 00:52:02.230
That's one of the great joys of the show we
had

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:05.839
Jacques Pepin on the show.

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:08.329
I just worshiped his work.

00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:11.930
You know, I would have loved to have Julia
Child on

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.930
the show.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.650
I looked up to her a lot.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.289
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Yeah, she was my favorite too.

00:52:16.289 --> 00:52:20.059
&gt;&gt; Zach: Black and white food show first come
first served, just sayin'--

00:52:20.059 --> 00:52:21.470
&gt;&gt; Female #6: Hi.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.619
Thank you for coming.

00:52:22.619 --> 00:52:25.609
I
actually have a question for the production

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.609
team.

00:52:26.609 --> 00:52:30.759
When you're out shooting, do you always get
to eat what Anthony gets to eat?

00:52:30.759 --> 00:52:33.400
What about places like elBulli?

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.530
&gt;&gt; Zach: Tom.

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:42.329
&gt;&gt; Todd: We actually ate out by the
dumpsters.

00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:51.599
You know, one of the nice things about
working in a kitchen is often you'll find

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:56.590
some very
nice, you know, chefs that will pop something

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:57.590
in
your mouth.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:01.329
So that's always a big perk of the job.

00:53:01.329 --> 00:53:05.859
But we tend to eat what Tony eats.

00:53:05.859 --> 00:53:08.289
Sometimes a
little cold after we're done.

00:53:08.289 --> 00:53:10.340
&gt;&gt;Tony: If it's bad, they're definitely
eating it.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.740
It's like, "you want me to eat that?"

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.740
OK, Dude.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.740
Why don't you guys try some.

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.829
&gt;&gt; Zach: It's very rare that we don't
eat.

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:19.160
&gt;&gt; Tom: People treat us very well.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.329
&gt;&gt; Tony: You've all sat down at Robuchon.

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:25.900
Sometimes the chefs if they
have time and they have the facilities, they

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.250
will make a point of, "okay, what
about you guys?

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.250
You're sitting down.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.619
You're
getting the full treatment."

00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:36.550
First time we shot at elBulli with Lydia and
Chris, okay, they didn't get to

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:38.840
sit down and eat all 40 courses, but they
did get to

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.960
stand up in the kitchen and get like 12 of
them in short order which was

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.630
pretty cool.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:47.400
&gt;&gt;Zach: At Chibaa, we've eaten at some incredible
places.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.769
&gt;&gt; Tony: On the other hand, this is a weird,
you touched on something really unusual that

00:53:51.769 --> 00:53:54.039
I've
noticed.

00:53:54.039 --> 00:53:59.060
Television people and camera people in
general, they all behave as if they're part

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.329
of some
weird international union.

00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:03.329
Meal time is meal time.

00:54:03.329 --> 00:54:06.109
They could be on their way to Robuchon knowing
full

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:08.589
well if they just wait an hour, an hour and
a half

00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:12.410
they could eat the most amazing French meal.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:16.740
They're still eating the bag of snacks and
the hotel-made

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.109
crummy sandwich.

00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:20.099
Every meal it's as if it's
their last.

00:54:20.099 --> 00:54:22.349
You load up for breakfast every day, right?

00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:26.640
You're eating that crummy breakfast at the
hotel , every time.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.890
Whatever nasty
snack or crew meal has been packed by the

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.150
field
producer, you're eating it.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.460
Or they'll stop for lunch
in some horrifying place.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:43.890
"we're about to go off to
this incredible wonder land of food -- why?"

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.700
Why is
that by the way.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.200
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tom: Food is fuel.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.930
And like you
say, we have to spend a lot of time with people.

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.299
There's just not time for eating.

00:54:54.299 --> 00:54:56.559
I mean a few bites here and there.

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:59.640
We don't sit down and have
a full meal when we're working there are other

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.640
things to be done.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.239
&gt;&gt; Zach: Yeah, you never know when your
next meal is going to be.

00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:05.400
[laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Zach: You really don't.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.759
I mean, it
could be eight hours.

00:55:07.759 --> 00:55:09.920
It could be eight hours
later.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.059
And then, we'll sit down and we'll have that
incredible meal at Robuchon.

00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:13.359
But it will be a long stretch.

00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:18.480
&gt;&gt; Tony: Alternately the worst thing for
me is when-- This happened --. We did this

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.019
show in China where this happened
every single day.

00:55:21.019 --> 00:55:24.579
We're on our way to a scene.

00:55:24.579 --> 00:55:25.579
It's brown food.

00:55:25.579 --> 00:55:26.579
We're going to be doing brown food.

00:55:26.579 --> 00:55:28.380
It's not very
visually interesting.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.839
It's good but it's going to
be brown.

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:33.049
And on the way we stop off at our local
fix.

00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:35.490
Oh we'll stop here, you guys need crew meal;
we'll stop here.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:39.509
And you end up at a restaurant and it's like,
"oh my God, this food is like amazing."

00:55:39.509 --> 00:55:41.809
So the crew is
sitting around eating this fantastic food

00:55:41.809 --> 00:55:44.309
and I know
I'm going to sit down eating eight courses

00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:46.079
of brown
food afterwards.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:48.750
It's so hard to resist.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.970
&gt;&gt;Zach: Actually you were asking me what one
of my favorite meals was.

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:51.970
It was that one.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:52.970
[laughter] It was.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:53.970
I'm not kidding.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:54.970
That
was incredible.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:56.710
&gt;&gt; Female #7: That's awesome.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:01.809
Well, so this
lifestyle, it seems totally crazy and not

00:56:01.809 --> 00:56:03.029
sustainable.

00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:04.380
Not that I want the show to go
anywhere.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:09.009
But I was wondering what was the
long-term plan for the show, if any.

00:56:09.009 --> 00:56:16.910
&gt;&gt;Tony: I'm going to keep doing it as
long as it's fun and as long as I'm interested.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:20.369
We
talk about this.

00:56:20.369 --> 00:56:21.930
What can we do next that's
different?

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:30.039
As long as we can figure out a way to
make next episode, next season interesting

00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:31.210
to us.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:34.279
Honestly we
don't really care about the audience that

00:56:34.279 --> 00:56:35.799
much [chuckles].

00:56:35.799 --> 00:56:38.849
Because if it's not
interesting to us, if it's not challenging

00:56:38.849 --> 00:56:43.289
to us, if
it's not fun for us, why would it be fun for

00:56:43.289 --> 00:56:44.809
anybody
else?

00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:49.529
So I mean, I think at this point, you know,
if you guys turn to me in the lobby one day

00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:50.869
and
say, "you know what?

00:56:50.869 --> 00:56:52.989
I think we've gone as far with the photography
as

00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:53.989
we can go.

00:56:53.989 --> 00:57:00.729
I don't know where else we're gonna go.

00:57:00.729 --> 00:57:05.890
" If I turn to you guys and I say, "you
know, this travel and eating thing, I just

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:10.690
want to go home, get a place with a yard
and grow tomatoes."

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:14.660
I think we all would sort
of say, "that's when we'll stop."

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.230
But until then, as long as
it's fun, as long as it's interesting, as

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:21.249
long as we
can figure out something new, and interesting

00:57:21.249 --> 00:57:23.260
frightening to the network to do next week.

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.960
Until then, we'll keep doing it.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.760
&gt;&gt; Todd: No, we're not going to film you
growing tomatoes.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.920
&gt;&gt; Tony: No.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.109
Reality show.

00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:32.109
No.

00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:33.249
Over here?

00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:34.249
Couple more.

00:57:34.249 --> 00:57:35.249
&gt;&gt; Female #8: Hi.

00:57:35.249 --> 00:57:41.720
So a few months ago, you
said something kinda mean about Paula Deen

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.599
and she kind
of fired back at you and I was just wondering

00:57:46.599 --> 00:57:48.709
if you
two ever made amends or --.

00:57:48.709 --> 00:57:55.090
&gt;&gt; Tony: We don't hang out together, you
know?

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:56.090
No.

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.619
I mean, listen.

00:57:58.619 --> 00:58:01.269
I never meant to say
"this is the worst person in the world or

00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:02.940
the worst
person in America."

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.279
As a business person, I actually have a lot
of

00:58:05.279 --> 00:58:07.739
respect for her.

00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:10.759
The story arc of her life is pretty
damn impressive.

00:58:10.759 --> 00:58:16.599
I just don't like the show and I
think that the food she prepares on the show

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:21.140
is
provably bad for the country.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:26.079
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: You know, my show -- I do

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.940
dangerous stuff on the show.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:33.329
You know, you seen
me smoking on the show, drinking to excess,

00:58:33.329 --> 00:58:35.130
eating
unhealthy food.

00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:39.390
The difference between my show and
her show, my show comes with a parental advisory.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:45.190
[laughter]
And I'm only suggesting that maybe hers should,

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:46.220
too.

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:51.210
&gt;&gt; Male #8: So, thanks for joining us
today.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:56.099
I wanted to also first say I play bass so
it's great to hear you say you want to come

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.549
back to
life as a bass player.

00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:59.859
So I have a few questions.

00:58:59.859 --> 00:59:02.980
First one is, if you were on Iron Chef, who
would

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.910
you want to compete against and don't say
the new

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.359
guy because he's easier to beat.

00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:10.009
And then, what
would you secret ingredient be.

00:59:10.009 --> 00:59:12.980
&gt;&gt; Tony: Tough one.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.809
Who are the Iron Chefs
these days?

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:16.410
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Batali.

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:17.410
Flay.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:18.500
&gt;&gt;Tony: I'm not going up against Batali.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.500
He'd kick my ass.

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.239
&gt;&gt;Male #8: The new guy is Mike Symons, I think.

00:59:21.239 --> 00:59:23.849
&gt;&gt;Tony: Symon would kick my ass.

00:59:23.849 --> 00:59:26.599
Flay would kick my ass.

00:59:26.599 --> 00:59:28.762
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Cat Cora, right

00:59:28.762 --> 00:59:29.880
&gt;&gt;Tony: Cat Cora would probably kick my ass,
too.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:34.039
I was never that great a chef. [laughter]
Honestly.

00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:37.019
I'm not going on.

00:59:37.019 --> 00:59:41.759
Like, I've often said on Top Chef, where I'm
a

00:59:41.759 --> 00:59:49.529
frequent judge, I might through age, guile,
experience, hustle, street smarts and pure

00:59:49.529 --> 00:59:55.359
bull shit
be able to weasel my way, four or five episodes

00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:57.789
in
before I got the chop.

00:59:57.789 --> 01:00:03.690
But I would not ever be a
finalist or anywhere close on Top Chef.

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.530
What would
my secret ingredient be?

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:06.760
Pork.
[applause]

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.460
&gt;&gt; Male #8: That's a good one.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.910
And then one last question
since no one asked and here you are at Google.

01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:17.440
Do you guys use
any of our products?

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.599
What are your favorites?[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Tony: Yes.

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:22.599
Yes, I do.

01:00:22.599 --> 01:00:26.049
In fact, I
believe we all use the Google family of products.

01:00:26.049 --> 01:00:29.499
[applause and laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Thank you.
