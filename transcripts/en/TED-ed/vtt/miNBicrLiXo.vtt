00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:10.572
The Devil has come to town.

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:14.652
But don’t worry – all he wants to do 
is stage a magic show.

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:20.317
This absurd premise forms the central plot
of Mikhail Bulgakov’s masterpiece,

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:22.322
"The Master and Margarita."

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.992
Written in Moscow during the 1930s,

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:30.632
this surreal blend of political satire, 
historical fiction, and occult mysticism

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:34.632
has earned a legacy as one of the 20th 
century’s greatest novels–

00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:37.122
and one of its strangest.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:41.532
The story begins when a meeting between
two members of Moscow’s literary elite

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:45.315
is interrupted by a strange gentleman 
named Woland,

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.705
who presents himself as a foreign scholar

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.245
invited to give a presentation 
on black magic.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:55.485
As the stranger engages the two companions
in a philosophical debate

00:00:55.485 --> 00:00:58.278
and makes ominous predictions 
about their fates,

00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:01.949
the reader is suddenly transported 
to first-century Jerusalem.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399
There a tormented Pontius Pilate

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.699
reluctantly sentences Jesus of 
Nazareth to death.

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:11.497
With the narrative shifting between 
the two settings,

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:16.307
Woland and his entourage– Azazello, 
Koroviev, Hella,

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:18.788
and a giant cat named Behemoth–

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:21.428
are seen to have uncanny magical powers,

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:23.648
which they use to stage their performance

00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:28.348
while leaving a trail of havoc 
and confusion in their wake.

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:32.780
Much of the novel’s dark humor comes 
not only from this demonic mischief,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.660
but also the backdrop 
against which it occurs.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.660
Bulgakov’s story takes place in the same 
setting where it was written–

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.310
the USSR at the height of the 
Stalinist period.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.889
There, artists and authors worked 
under strict censorship,

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.299
subject to imprisonment, exile, 
or execution

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.679
if they were seen as undermining 
state ideology.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.879
Even when approved, their work–

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.379
along with housing, travel, 
and everything else–

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.419
was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy.

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:06.509
In the novel, Woland manipulates this 
system along with the fabric of reality,

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.519
to hilarious results.

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.749
As heads are separated from bodies 
and money rains from the sky,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.431
the citizens of Moscow react with 
petty-self interest,

00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:22.111
illustrating how Soviet society bred greed
and cynicism despite its ideals.

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:25.539
And the matter-of-fact narration 
deliberately blends

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.919
the strangeness of the supernatural 
events

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.659
with the everyday absurdity 
of Soviet life.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.869
So how did Bulgakov manage to publish 
such a subversive novel

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.234
under an oppressive regime?

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.284
Well… he didn’t.

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.484
He worked on "The Master and Margarita"
for over ten years.

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.424
But while Stalin’s personal favor

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:48.904
may have kept Bulgakov safe 
from severe persecution,

00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:51.904
many of his plays and writings 
were kept from production,

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:55.424
leaving him safe but effectively silenced.

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:57.844
Upon the author’s death in 1940,

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.034
the manuscript remained unpublished.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.884
A censored version was eventually 
printed in the 1960s,

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.024
while copies of the unabridged manuscript 
continued to circulate

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:09.214
among underground literary circles.

00:03:09.214 --> 00:03:12.674
The full text was only published in 1973,

00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:15.934
over 30 years after its completion.

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:19.754
Bulgakov’s experiences with censorship 
and artistic frustration

00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:23.474
lend an autobiographical air to the 
second part of the novel,

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:26.104
when we are finally introduced 
to its namesake.

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:30.454
‘The Master’ is a nameless author who’s 
worked for years on a novel

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:34.164
but burned the manuscript 
after it was rejected by publishers–

00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:36.964
just as Bulgakov had done 
with his own work.

00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:41.214
Yet the true protagonist is the Master’s 
mistress Margarita.

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:45.467
Her devotion to her lover’s abandoned 
dream bears a strange connection

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:48.207
to the diabolical company’s escapades–

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.627
and carries the story to 
its surreal climax.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:55.156
Despite its dark humor and 
complex structure,

00:03:55.156 --> 00:04:02.406
"The Master and Margarita" is, at its heart,
a meditation on art, love, and redemption

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:05.233
that never loses itself in cynicism.

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:09.593
And the book’s long overdue publication 
and survival against the odds

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:14.060
is a testament to what Woland tells the 
Master:

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.297
“Manuscripts don’t burn.”
