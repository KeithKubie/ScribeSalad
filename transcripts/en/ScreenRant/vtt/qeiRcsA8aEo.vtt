00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.350
Some may not realize how difficult it can
be to get a film made and how even more challenging

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.520
it can be to get a film released.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.820
From the earliest stages of putting together
a script, to pre-production, shooting, and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.310
post-production, there are many steps a filmmaker
must accomplish but no matter how much work

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.810
goes into a film, not every film has the opportunity
to be shown to audiences.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.830
There have been dozens of films with A-list
stars that never saw the light of day, and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.160
even more featuring actors that are not exactly
household names.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.230
Some films may sound appealing while others
should probably be lost forever.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.880
Here are 10 Completed Movies that were Never
Released.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.159
Fantastic Four
Long before Michael B. Jordan and Chris Evans

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.270
stepped into the incendiary role of Johnny
Storm, there was Jay Underwood.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.430
The name may not ring any bells, which is
no surprise since Underwood’s Human Torch

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.970
along with other unknown actors portraying
the familiar foursome in the 1994 unreleased

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.970
film, Fantastic Four.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.080
In the 1980s, German film producer, Bernd
Eichinger optioned Stan Lee’s comic book

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.080
characters.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.110
After little interest from major studios in
providing a large sum of money to make a big

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.720
budget superhero movie, the deadline to make
a Fantastic Four movie was looming as his

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.659
option was about to expire.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.570
With the help of B-movie legend Roger Corman,
he was able to complete a low budget superhero

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.570
film.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.390
Although film trailers for Fantastic Four
were shown in theaters and even at the 1993

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.980
Comic-Con, the film was never released.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.980
The film has only been seen on the internet
or from the hard-to-find bootleg copies.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.930
Producer Eichinger did go on to produce the
big budget 2005 Fantastic Four and many speculate,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.940
including Stan Lee himself, the 1994 original
was never meant to be released and was used

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.740
only to maintain rights to the characters.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.780
However, Eichinger denied this was the case.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.900
Whatever his motive, the Fantastic Four with
the tiny budget has never been released.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.790
Bill Cosby 77
Stand-up comedy films are not for everyone

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.250
but when it stars a fallen legend, it may
not be for anyone.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.810
Such is the case with Bill Cosby 77.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.670
The film was directed by Director and Actor
Robert Townsend, and edited by Cosby’s wife

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.060
Camille during his appearance at the San Francisco
Jazz Center in 2014 on Cosby’s 77th birthday.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.350
The show featured Cosby’s traditional brand
of clean comedy concerning his marriage and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.350
children.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.550
Netflix acquired the rights to the 60-minute
comedy show which was slated to be released

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.610
Thanksgiving weekend 2014.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.330
Just hours after former model and reality
star, Janice Dickinson reported sexual assault

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.380
from Cosby, Netflix postponed the release
of the film.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.280
After additional reports were made from others
victims, Netflix announced the released of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.430
film would be delayed indefinitely.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.000
In 2015, Netflix announced it would not be
appropriate to release Bill Cosby 77 at any

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
time.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.450
Don’s Plum
Never has there been a film that has been

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.610
so tirelessly prevented from release by its
actors as Don’s Plum.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.659
The name may sound familiar simply because
of a lawsuit filed by producer David Stutman

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.499
who claimed the film’s stars including,
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire were obstructing

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.359
the success of the film by interfering with
its release.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.189
Don’s Plum was filmed in 1995 so while the
two actors were not exactly new to the film

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.730
industry, they had not become the household
names they are today.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.730
Two years later, Leonardo DiCaprio’s career
took an entirely different trajectory with

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.730
the release of Titanic.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.060
The low budget Don’t Plum was funded by
DiCaprio and Maguire for their filmmaking

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.209
friend R.D. Robb and was largely improvisational.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.379
The actors claimed the film was intended to
be a short film and only agreed to do the

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.260
film if it was not released in the United
States or Canada.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.629
Once the director began seeking a distributor,
Maguire grew concerned about statements he

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.857
improvised in the film and believed it may
tarnish his image.

00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:06.780
With the help of friend Leonardo DiCaprio,
they worked together to block the film’s

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.780
release.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.780
The film, which also features actor Kevin
Connolly and the music of Rilo Kiley has been

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.790
successfully prevented for two decades and
even after it was released online by the filmmakers,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.790
it was quickly removed due to Leonardo DiCaprio
and friend’s dedication for the film to

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.959
never be seen.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.560
The Day the Clown Cried
Some films become a thing of legend without

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.620
ever being seen by audiences.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.499
The Day the Clown Cried, is the film comedian
Jerry Lewis never wants you to see as it is

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:26.499
far too embarrassing.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.099
The film’s bizarre premise involves a circus
clown who has been imprisoned in a concentration

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.099
camp.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.439
Not exactly the best set-up for a Jerry Lewis
comedy.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.670
However, Lewis’s intention was to make a
drama, which he also wrote and directed, that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.650
would hopefully catch the attention of the
Academy while audiences would accept him as

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.769
a serious actor and filmmaker.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.849
Once the film was completed, Lewis made little
effort to release The Day the Clown Cried

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.629
but did plan showing the film at the Cannes
Film Festival.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.760
It was was never shown.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.623
While Lewis was not particularly proud of
the film, another hold-up was Joan O’ Brien,

00:03:54.623 --> 00:03:59.189
one of the story writers, refusal to sign
over the rights to Lewis.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.189
Actor and writer Harry Shearer is one of the
few people to have seen the completed film.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.640
Not surprisingly, he thought it to be spectacular
in its failure and found it fascinating that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.569
the film was so unfixable.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.659
Since audiences will most likely never get
to see The Day the Clown Cried, Jerry Lewis

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.489
will maintain a reputation for being the lovable
goofball and not a terrible filmmaker.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.840
Temptation
The 2004 musical Temptation may be the most

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.360
mysterious film on our list as there is no
evidence to why the film was never released.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.850
The film stars well-known Broadway actors
Adam Pascal and Alice Ripley and is based

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.730
on the tale of Faust in which a man, who is
bored with his life, makes a deal with the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.730
devil.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.450
Temptation sets the story as a rock opera
and there is little dialogue.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.170
The film also stars Zoe Saldana who was just
hitting her stride as a film star at the time.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.400
Temptation was rumored to have been a well-made
musical and even featured live singing, something

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400
Academy Award winner Les Miserable did years
later.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.040
Finding information on the film is nearly
impossible and there is no speak of legal

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.170
issues or disputes making the film even more
of a head-scratcher.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.870
The only opportunity audiences were given
to view Temptation was the New York Musical

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.540
Festival in 2004.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.881
Even with an undeniable audience for movie
musicals and talented cast, it seems, for

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:14.060
no reason at all, Temptation will never receive
a theatrical or video release.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.500
Prankstar
At the turn of the 21st century, there was

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.310
a comedian who found fame by placing his bum
on everything in his eye line.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.150
That unexplainably popular comedian was Tom
Green.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.180
For a brief time, it seemed the wacky Canadian
was everywhere.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.940
Whether it was his own MTV show or appearances
in films like Road Trip, &nbsp;Stealing Harvard,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.196
or the much ridiculed Freddy Got Fingered
for which he wrote/directed/ and starred,

00:05:33.196 --> 00:05:34.340
he was everywhere.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.220
He was even married to the hugely famous Drew
Barrymore for a short-blink-before-you-miss-the-matrimony-minute.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.220
But like with any over-the-top comedian, public
interest started waning and he became less

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.000
exciting and even less relevant.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.530
In 2006 Tom Green attempted to change that
with his mockumentary, Prankstar.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.620
The independent film is about two student
filmmakers who decide to follow Tom Green

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.780
around to see what his life is like, only
to discover that fame has not been kind to

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.780
the comedian.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.550
After many instances of Green showing sadness
due to the public heckling him, the three

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.720
get into trouble and the adventure begins.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.120
The film was promised a release by Green multiple
times in 2010.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.730
Later he assured fans the film was completed
and would be released in 2011.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.010
However, the film has yet to be shown anywhere
and has no release date set.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.330
Perhaps, Green could not find a distributer
but most likely this is all one big elaborate

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.430
prank of Green’s and the film never existed.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.700
Glitterati
Films adapted from novels are a common practice

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.970
but films based on a section of the book the
film adaptation chose to forgo is a bit unnecessary.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.210
One of the more polarizing modern authors
is Bret Easton Ellis known for his novels

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.010
Less Than Zero, and American Psycho which
were both adapted for the big screen.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.550
The Rules of Attraction was another film based
on his book by the same name.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.450
In the film, we get to see a montage of Victor,
played by Kip Pardue, traipsing through a

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.740
European journey of debauchery.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.260
Apparently, the director Roger Avery filmed
over 70 hours of footage and planned on using

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.090
the footage and the additional story of Victor’s
travels for another film entitled Glitterati.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.890
Avery planned on the film bridging the gap
between the events of The Rules of Attraction

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.290
and another Easton novel set to be a film,
Glamorama.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.480
Since Easton’s characters in all of his
novels live in the same universe and appear

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.480
or are mentioned in multiple books, the concept
was not a bad one.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.540
However, Glitterati never received a release
and Bret Easton Ellis states that for legal

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.480
reasons and for the lack of a cohesive or
interesting plot, he has no intention of releasing

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.520
Glitterati in any form and prefers to screen
the film sporadically to small groups.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520
Spring Break '83
Not every film deserves to be released no

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
matter how many forgotten stars of the 1980s
make a cameo.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.350
Spring Break ‘83 was filmed in 2007 and
along with the less than impressive likes

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:39.480
of Jamie Kennedy and Sophia Monk also includes
Lee Majors, Morgan Fairchild, and Erik Estrada.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.320
For some reason, John Goodman also agreed
to also be in this mess of a comedy.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.000
The premise of the film is simple and revolves
around four friends who were bullied in high

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.120
school who seek revenge on their tormentors
during college spring break a year later.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.600
The film gets an interesting spin by setting
it in the 1980s, harking back to a more frivolous

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.820
time of 80’s comedies like Revenge of the
Nerds and Porky’s.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.620
The film took two years to complete due to
multiple shutdowns caused by the production

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.820
company’s inability to pay the crew.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.390
Big Sky Motion Pictures announced it would
be released in the spring of 2010 but it never

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.390
happened.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.670
Even with its $18 million budget and notable
stars, the company has made no efforts to

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.570
release the film in theaters or video.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.570
For those who are interested, there is a trailer
floating around the internet which may illustrate

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.790
why Big Sky Motion Pictures or any other company
has not made Spring Break ‘83’s release

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.790
a priority.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.930
Hippie Hippie Shake
Back in 1998 Working Title films acquired

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.269
the rights to Hippie Hippie Shake, based on
Hippie Hippie Shake: The Dreams, the Trips,

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:37.490
the Trials, the Love-ins, the Screw Ups: The
Sixties, a memoir written by journalist Richard

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.490
Neville.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.159
The film was expected to begin production
in 1999 until Working Title parted ways with

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.159
Polygram Entertainment.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.690
It was not until 2007 that the film was brought
back to life.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.610
Hippie Hippie Shake was back in action complete
with Playwright and Billy Elliot scribe Lee

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.440
Hall’s screenplay and Cillian Murphy and
Sienna Miller as the two leads.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.330
Hippie Hippie Shake’s initial release date
in the fall of 2008 was delayed amidst controversy

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.520
around Sienna Miller and her personal life
which had become tabloid fodder.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.330
The creative differences of the director and
producers during post-production caused even

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.050
more issues, delaying the film’s release
even further.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.520
The few critics who were given a screening
of Hippie Hippie Shake gave the film fairly

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.480
positive reviews citing the performances of
Murphy and Miller to be the highlight of the

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
film.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.020
Even with the potential for success, Working
Title has still decided not to release Hippie

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.950
Hippie Shake in theaters.
