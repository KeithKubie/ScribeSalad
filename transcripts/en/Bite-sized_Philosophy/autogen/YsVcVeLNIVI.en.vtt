00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580
a bunch of other people at a table how
 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.870
a bunch of other people at a table how
much should you eat and the answer is

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880
much should you eat and the answer is
 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.790
much should you eat and the answer is
you should eat on average what everyone

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800
you should eat on average what everyone
 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.159
you should eat on average what everyone
else eats and that's exactly what you do

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169
else eats and that's exactly what you do
 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.110
else eats and that's exactly what you do
even if you don't notice it you know

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120
even if you don't notice it you know
 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.899
even if you don't notice it you know
people are so wired into we did

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909
people are so wired into we did
 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.430
people are so wired into we did
experiments like this if you if you

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440
experiments like this if you if you
 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.219
experiments like this if you if you
bring on if you bring undergraduates who

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229
bring on if you bring undergraduates who
 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.640
bring on if you bring undergraduates who
don't know each other in to allow

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650
don't know each other in to allow
 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.010
don't know each other in to allow
and you give them a snack while they're

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020
and you give them a snack while they're
 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.360
and you give them a snack while they're
doing something like watching a movie

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370
doing something like watching a movie
 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.540
doing something like watching a movie
they will eat the same number of chips

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550
they will eat the same number of chips
 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.010
they will eat the same number of chips
so you know if one of them eats the

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020
so you know if one of them eats the
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.469
so you know if one of them eats the
whole half the thing the other world eat

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479
whole half the thing the other world eat
 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.600
whole half the thing the other world eat
half if one only has one the other only

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610
half if one only has one the other only
 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.610
half if one only has one the other only
have one the correlation between the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620
have one the correlation between the
 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.920
have one the correlation between the
food intake between the dyads was about

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930
food intake between the dyads was about
 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.770
food intake between the dyads was about
0.8 it was staggering seem to be a

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780
0.8 it was staggering seem to be a
 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.360
0.8 it was staggering seem to be a
little higher for extroverts than for

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370
little higher for extroverts than for
 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.250
little higher for extroverts than for
introverts but it was remarkably

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260
introverts but it was remarkably
 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.409
introverts but it was remarkably
remarkably concordant you can understand

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419
remarkably concordant you can understand
 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.030
remarkably concordant you can understand
why right because human beings share

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.040
why right because human beings share
 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.100
why right because human beings share
food it's like you are not going to be a

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110
food it's like you are not going to be a
 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.700
food it's like you are not going to be a
popular tribes person if you eat you

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710
popular tribes person if you eat you
 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.560
popular tribes person if you eat you
know 30 percent of the food when food is

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570
know 30 percent of the food when food is
 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.520
know 30 percent of the food when food is
in short supply

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530
in short supply
 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.409

you better be bloody awake and make sure

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419
you better be bloody awake and make sure
 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.760
you better be bloody awake and make sure
that you don't take more than your share

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770
that you don't take more than your share
 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.560
that you don't take more than your share
and you know it's a fundamental element

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570
and you know it's a fundamental element
 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.620
and you know it's a fundamental element
of human nature to do that and you know

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630
of human nature to do that and you know
 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.320
of human nature to do that and you know
and we also regulate our sense of

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330
and we also regulate our sense of
 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.200
and we also regulate our sense of

because we're omnivores turns out to be

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:33.289
because we're omnivores turns out to be
 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:35.550
because we're omnivores turns out to be
a tremendously difficult thing and well

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560
a tremendously difficult thing and well
 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.400
a tremendously difficult thing and well
anyways back to this kid so we bring all

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.410
anyways back to this kid so we bring all
 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.900
anyways back to this kid so we bring all
the kids to the table and they're

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:40.910
the kids to the table and they're
 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.580
the kids to the table and they're
sitting around and they're having lunch

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.590
sitting around and they're having lunch
 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.140
sitting around and they're having lunch
and the rule is as I said eat what is in

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150
and the rule is as I said eat what is in
 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.390
and the rule is as I said eat what is in
front of you and be pleased and happy

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400
front of you and be pleased and happy
 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.040
front of you and be pleased and happy
about it so you might say well why would

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.050
about it so you might say well why would
 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.650
about it so you might say well why would
that also be a rule it's like okay put

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660
that also be a rule it's like okay put
 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.810
that also be a rule it's like okay put
yourself in this position now because

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
yourself in this position now because
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.250
yourself in this position now because
you'll be in this position you're gonna

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:57.260
you'll be in this position you're gonna
 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.670
you'll be in this position you're gonna
cook your damn kids some lunch and

00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680
cook your damn kids some lunch and
 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.409
cook your damn kids some lunch and
you're gonna do that well let's let's

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:02.419
you're gonna do that well let's let's
 

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.270
you're gonna do that well let's let's
calculate it out because I like doing

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280
calculate it out because I like doing
 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.879
calculate it out because I like doing
arithmetic so let's say it takes you

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:06.889
arithmetic so let's say it takes you
 

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:09.430
arithmetic so let's say it takes you
half an hour a day and you do it seven

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440
half an hour a day and you do it seven
 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.810
half an hour a day and you do it seven
days a week but we'll multiply that by

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:10.820
days a week but we'll multiply that by
 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.219
days a week but we'll multiply that by
three because there's three meals so

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:12.229
three because there's three meals so
 

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:14.350
three because there's three meals so
it's an hour and a half a day right so

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360
it's an hour and a half a day right so
 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.240
it's an hour and a half a day right so
okay fine seven times an hour and a half

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.250
okay fine seven times an hour and a half
 

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.850
okay fine seven times an hour and a half
is roughly 10 so it's ten hours a week

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:18.860
is roughly 10 so it's ten hours a week
 

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.830
is roughly 10 so it's ten hours a week
it's 40 hours a month right 40 hours a

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840
it's 40 hours a month right 40 hours a
 

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.740
it's 40 hours a month right 40 hours a
month is a full work week so 40 hours a

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:23.750
month is a full work week so 40 hours a
 

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.050
month is a full work week so 40 hours a
month times twelve twelve full work

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.060
month times twelve twelve full work
 

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.860
month times twelve twelve full work
weeks right

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:26.870
weeks right
 

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.710
weeks right
yes that's three full months of 40 hour

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720
yes that's three full months of 40 hour
 

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.529
yes that's three full months of 40 hour
days of cooking something for your damn

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:32.539
days of cooking something for your damn
 

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.260
days of cooking something for your damn
kid now that's a lot of time and then

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.270
kid now that's a lot of time and then
 

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.240
kid now that's a lot of time and then
you're gonna do that for 18 years so

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.250
you're gonna do that for 18 years so
 

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.730
you're gonna do that for 18 years so
then you might ask yourself what sort of

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:39.740
then you might ask yourself what sort of
 

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.779
then you might ask yourself what sort of
response do you need from your child in

miserable about the fact that you have
 

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:50.170
miserable about the fact that you have
to do that for three bloody months this

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.180
to do that for three bloody months this
 

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.690
to do that for three bloody months this
year you just have to think about this

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:52.700
year you just have to think about this
 

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.470
