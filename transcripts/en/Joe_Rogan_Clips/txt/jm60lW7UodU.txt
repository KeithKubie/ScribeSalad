Speaker 1:          00:00          All through his life. But the tragedy of how much effort you put out to, if we want to write about Trump, if you want to go after like Tybee did about the financial institution, the way Thompson did it was to kind of waste your time later for time now. And he talks about that. He says, you mean by that chemical speed? He says, doing dexedrine being an alcoholic, sort of changing his life in his rhythms. He said, I'm wagering time later for time now I'm using up energy are things that I might have by burning the candles so brightly at this instant cause I believe I need to go after these moments and I later, I'm not going to have it, but I'm making that gamble. I'm putting the card down right now. And I think that's terrifying. And I also think that he gave us brilliant writing over one of the most remarkable spans in American history because of it.

Speaker 1:          00:41          That's a weird tradition of journalism to destroy your body while creating your art. And, um, I think there's a, according to my friends who are journalists, there's a big problem with Adderall today and there's a lot of people that are using it to write and um, it's fucking speed and you know, you get addicted. I mean Adderall makes everything in front of you closer. Have you done it? Yeah. So my first book was called hyper. I'm a personal history of Adhd, so it was about being medicated as a child. You were medicated as a child, like having pills forced down my throat, like all sold. We you six. When I took Ritalin for the first time I had, I had a suicidal moment and like six years old. The first time you were six you wanted to commit suicide. I held like a butter knife to my wrist.

Speaker 1:          01:23          I don't remember it. But yeah, I kind of remember it, but yeah. And it was on Ritalin, which I've taken now as an adult and I always feel startled when I'm on it. If I ever take Ritalin now why did he like, well, I take it to write like this world is incredibly painful. So I take Adderall now. Um, and I, I take it to how often you take it everyday. I take like 30 milligrams a day really? And I take it too, I take it to go into a library and this is what David Wallace wells was talking about, I think like two days ago on the show was how do you read really shitty academic articles where you need the information from them. I'm not good at that. I'm not good at even making like a car reservation, you know, like a car rental reservation.

Speaker 1:          02:00          And so this world's going to be painful no matter what. But there's a functionality that, um, Adderall allows and it's always a wager. What Thompson writes about is whenever something is given, something else has lost. You never get anything for free in this world. Thompson understood that better than anybody. So with him, with [inaudible], I'm not going to say Thompson was hyperactive, I'm not going to go into that. But techs a dream, like Geiger was like, Yo, you're breaking down. Like you're 26. You have a wife, you have a very small child you're writing right now. You want to have your career go forward, you're not doing well. He and the guy who was like, I'm a doctor, I had gone through med school, you know, I'd bid it. I, I'd been overwhelmed. Like you guy get ran every morning, you know, he did, he did other things, but he, he took Dex to train.

Speaker 1:          02:42          So I gave it to Thomson. And for that small period of time it helped. I mean for me it's like I, I, I'm not a good researcher and maybe I would be now, but the only way I can write about something like hunter s Thompson where I didn't know him, I had no experience with him, is to read everything that he's ever written or been written about him and then go out and interview people. And so effort is my only path forward. And what Adderall helps for me is to take the pain away of that effort, but it doesn't take it away. It shifts it around to other aspects in other parts of life. And I think Thompson when he wrote, he who makes a piece of himself escapes the pain or gets through the pain of being a man. We don't listen to that. Like, he was like, this effort is hard.

Speaker 1:          03:24          He's like, I'm struggling with this effort. I'm trying to make these beautiful things. I always think of James Salter fiction writer Aspin um, um, resident rope, beautiful novels. He wrote his whole life till he was 90. His last novel was at 87. He wrote a memoir at 76 about being a fighter pilot among other things in the Korean War lyric. Literary he did it his whole life. He didn't, he didn't burn out for a small period of time. He's the Antonym to Thompson I think when it comes to effort and literary work. Right. Um, do, do you just take it for work? Yeah, I mean you don't have like an issue that you need to take it for all my I where we will, um, I think that will, whenever we have something like chemical speed, whenever we have something like alcohol, um, whenever we have something that's not like marijuana where at least marijuana cuts your mania.

Speaker 1:          04:16          You know, like whenever we have something else like alcohol or at our all we need ask the question or is it, is taking the pain away and being productive through those actually hastening your own doom and I think with alcohol is very clear. It is without a roles more complex. I think if you do an amount of time release, you can make it work. How many Americans do that? Out of the percent that are prescribed, you know, I don't know, 10%, 20%, like it's dangerous. How often do you take time off? I'd say maybe one or two weeks, uh, of, uh, every three or four months. And when you do that, do you feel weird? No, I just watch movies. Like I just don't do anything. It doesn't, I don't have any productivity. I don't, I don't produce. So the only way you produces on speed, the only way I produce, the way I want to right now is on speed.

Speaker 1:          05:08          I didn't start taking it till I'm 2010. [inaudible] it's crazy that we're talking about this because there's so many people like you. It's um, it's so calm. I mean how much of the work that we enjoy today, especially literary work is written by people. Journalistic work is written by people that are on speed. But that's not new. I mean that's what Thompson and burrows and southern like this has been. I believe that our American society, the situation I'm in, I have created a situation where I have too much work and it's my fault. I should not be trying to be a professor and also go report it competency and also at George Mason in the creative writing program, you know, and also then be hosting like people coming out and also then like be trying to research something that might be my next thing that's too much in the way Thompson saw dexedrine was that he could make reality match his effort. So there was no longer the limit. It was the American dream idea. If you just put out enough effort, you'll get it. And that's why I think he's so brilliantly understood. The toxicity of the American dream is that the effort is what the story is. You just because you have a path with the effort to be rich, to be successful, that doesn't mean that a good thing. That's what we'll actually dismantle you. Yeah. It's putting it out. And I think we forget that.
