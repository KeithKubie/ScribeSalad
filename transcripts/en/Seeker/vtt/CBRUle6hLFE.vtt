00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.419
You know what will be cool about the future
besides jetpaks and equality?

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.600
Robotic arms.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.300
And surprisingly they’re not too far away.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.400
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.540
Artificial limbs have come a long way since
the days of Pirate Joe’s Peg Leg.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.019
Today’s prosthetics are made of state of
the art materials and cutting edge technology.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.480
They’re made of titanium, carbon fiber,
and/or silicone.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.470
These materials are tough, lighter and can
even be designed to look life-like.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.520
They stay on by a few different mechanisms
like suspension or suction.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.940
Suspension involves some type of straps or
sleeves.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.110
Suction works because the new limb might be
custom made to perfectly fit to the remaining

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.110
natural limb.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.230
Some devices can be controlled by the body,
in a kind of pulley system, not surprisingly

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.830
called body powered.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.350
Others can be controlled by switches or buttons.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.530
While fit and materials get progressively
more advanced, so does the technology.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.530
Most new robotic limbs are myoelectric-controlled,
meaning muscles in the remaining limb naturally

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.350
create electrical signals that are picked
up by electrodes in the prosthetic.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.690
For the past few decades medical technology
allowed patients to control their device through

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.220
electrodes placed on the skin.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.900
But that’s an imperfect design, moving or
sweating might dislodge the electrodes.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.170
So scientists are looking to the future.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
Recently a report published in the journal
Science Translational Medicine talked about

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.830
a robotic arm that uses what’s called a
Brånemark titanium implant which attaches

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.390
the prosthetic directly to the skeleton in
a process called osseointegration.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.550
And just like it sounds, this process fuses
the bone to a titanium piece which sits outside

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.220
of the limb, which the robotic arm attaches
to.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.180
To control the device, the technology goes
a step beyond the current myoelectric types.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.750
It uses Targeted Muscle Reinnervation or TMR
to hook up the prosthetic to nerves INSIDE

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.090
the patient’s body.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.880
The process takes nerves from the amputated
limb and puts them on a spare muscle like

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.479
the pectoral, the target muscle.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.030
Once these nerves start to regrow they can
be activated by thought.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.910
Electrodes surrounding the muscle and nerves
can then control the prosthetic.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.710
Sounds pretty futuristic right?

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.990
Yet something seems to be missing.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.920
The sensation of touch.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.190
Current techniques use sensory substitution
to provide feedback, like a buzz or vibration

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.479
when the limb comes into contact with something.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.170
In research presented in the journal Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgery researchers look

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.430
for a way to restore a patient’s ability
to feel.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.810
The researchers say this would reduce the
“cognitive burden" of relying on vision

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.840
alone to navigate the environment.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.150
A robotic hand with the ability to “feel”
would have to be able to take a sensation

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.590
like hot or cold or pressure like firm or
soft and translate that into electrical signals.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.160
The different sensations could create a different
signal like it could vary in strength, frequency

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
or duration.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.790
The researchers suggested using TMR to restore
some type of sensation for the patient.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.430
Another idea is a sensory regenerative peripheral
nerve interface (sRPNI), which would directly

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.160
hook up a nerve with some sort of biological
interface on the prosthetic.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
Or maybe light could brighten up the future.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.870
Optogenics might enable different light waves
to control nerve signalling.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.989
Anything to make the electrical signalling
devices smaller and more precise.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.880
Robotic legs too are taking great leaps into
the future.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.400
Research published in the journal Science
Translational Medicine explained recent advances

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.630
in powered joints.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.410
Yeah that’s right.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.040
Basically each joint in a robotic leg can
have a little motor in it.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.180
This way it detects pressure and angle and
can send that information to the central nervous

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.180
system.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.989
But more than that, the more advanced models
can have a neural interface that enhances

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.900
integration with the brain.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.230
This way they can sense a person’s intention
like the desire to move from a flat surface

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.550
to climbing stairs.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.709
Either way the future of artificial limbs
is gonna be awesome.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.750
Speaking of insane augmentations, Toyota has
been doing some tinkering of their own with

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.670
the TRD line of Toyota Trucks.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.670
Enhanced to rule the off-road!

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.310
Do you have an artificial limb or know anyone
who does?
