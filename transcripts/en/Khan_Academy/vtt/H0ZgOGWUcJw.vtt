00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.510
In the last video we talked
about the situation where I'm

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.390
taking 9 shots on a goal.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.570
We knew my probability of
making any given shot, and what

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.510
we wanted to do is figure out
the probability distribution of

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.550
me making k shots, in general.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.410
We defined our random
variable, x, as the number

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.690
of shots I make out of 6.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.280
So I realized in that last
example and that example is

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.100
right back here, that the
math gets a little hairy.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.260
You're dealing with 0.7 then
times 0.3 to the fifth

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.000
and all of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.630
So it got a little complicated
and what better thing to do if

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.240
you have numbers like this,
even better than the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.550
calculator than to use Excel.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.330
And you'll see that Excel is
a fairly powerful tool for

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.430
probability and statistics.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.620
And in general, for a lot
of types of simulations.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.130
If you don't want to actually
write serious code you can

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.770
actually do fairly serious
things with something as

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.400
seemingly not so simple, or
not so serious as Excel.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.480
But it's actually
quite serious.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.370
So let's see.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.280
So let's say that I'm going
to take-- let's define n.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.840
I'm going to say that that is,
I'm going to take 6 shots.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.150
The probability of me making
any shot I'll say is 0.3.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.440
That's what we did
in the last video.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.450
The probability of a miss,
let me actually write it a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.310
little bit more explicitly.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.990
Probability of a make is equal
to 0.3 and the probability of a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.640
miss I'm going to write-- and
instead of just writing 0.7

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.110
there because we know it is,
let's just it a little bit

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.070
dependent on the first one.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.080
So write out the formula, we'll
say that's equal to 1 minus--

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.510
and then we'll select
this cell right here.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.880
It's equal to 1 minus the
probability that I make a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.950
shot, And notice it just
calculated it for us, 0.7.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.570
Let me zoom in a little bit.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.060
There you go.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.950
That might be easier
for you to read.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.140
Because I know it gets
really small on YouTube.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.830
And this is neat because now if
we wanted to see what happens

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.490
when this becomes 0.2
that automatically

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.510
calculates to 0.8.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.900
So that's neat.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.870
Let's just put it back to 0.3.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.440
And now let's do a bunch of
rows so that we can calculate

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.500
the probability that our random
variable, x, could be 0

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.870
shots or 1 shot or whatever.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.860
So let's say that k-- let
me make a row called k.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.590
So that's the number of
shots we need to make.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.995
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:20.260
You can't see the sixth one
right now, let me just go

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.650
up here and now you
can see everything.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.430
And then we need to figure out
the binomial coefficient.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.210
Well actually,
let's do it first.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.780
Let's say the probability of
making any one of those,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.170
any one way of getting no
shots, or any one way of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170
getting exactly 3 shots.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.210
So that's going to be the
probability of a make.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.530
So you're going to make it.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.530
You're going to make k shots
times the probability

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.980
of a miss.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.820
So if you make k shots,
how many do you miss?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.100
You miss n minus k.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.990
And I'm not doing anything
fancy in Excel right here.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.210
I'm just kind of writing a
label that hopefully is a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.190
little intuitive for you.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.880
So this is the probability--
this column is going to be-- in

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.070
this cell right here is going
to be the probability that any

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.820
one particular way of making
3 shots and missing 3 shots.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.860
It's going to go in
that cell eventually.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.920
And then you need to know
that you needed the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.940
binomial coefficient.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.960
It's going to look a
little bit messy now.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.370
So you want n choose k.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220
So essentially this row is
going to say, what's the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.560
probability for example, in
this cell right here we'll have

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.780
the probability of making the
first and missing the next 5,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.170
or missing the first 5
and making the last 1.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.270
They're all going to be
the same probability.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.460
You're going to have
1 make and 5 misses.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.250
And then, this cell we're
going to say, well, how

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.840
many different ways can
I make just 1 out of 6?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.850
And that's why I'm going
to choose 1 out of 6.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.840
k is 1 and n is 6.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.530
That's going to go there.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.090
And then we can calculate what
the probability that our random

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.870
variable is equal to k,
is equal to this value.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.910
And it looks all fancy, but
it's exactly what we did in

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.860
the last video with my little
doodle tool that I use.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.850
Which is actually just
Microsoft Paint for those of

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.540
you wondering because I get a
lot of e-mails and I'm tired

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.690
of saying it's just
Microsoft Paint.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.270
All right, so what's the
probability that I make 0

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.310
and I miss 6 because that's
what they're saying here.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.900
So this is going to be the
probability of me making a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.380
shot-- and I'll put
those dollar signs.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.330
That kind of fixes
it on this cell.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.950
The probability that I make
a shot to the kth power.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.220
So I make 0 shots times the
probability that I miss a shot.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.240
Put those dollar signs there so
that it fixes on that cell--

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.100
to the n minus k power.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.820
In this case it would
be the sixth power.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.260
I miss 6 six shots, so
to the-- let me put it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.600
in parentheses-- n.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.200
Let me fix on that cell.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.850
n minus k power.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.650
And there you go there.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.070
That's the probability for
example, of me making the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.280
first and missing the next 5.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.140
Or this could be the
probability of me getting the

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.790
first shot, then missing the
second, and getting

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.820
the last 4 missed.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.540
So any of one of
those situations.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.820
And how many of those
situations are there?

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.950
Well that's n choose k.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.280
So that's equal to-- n
choose k-- that's the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.800
same thing we did before.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.530
That's all this
factorial stuff here.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.210
That's n choose k.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.790
So I'm just going to express
the binomial coefficient

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.300
expression in Excel.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.280
So it's a factorial of how many
we're choosing from, how many

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.640
shots we're taking, and the
Excel function for

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.910
that is fact.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.460
So we'll take the factorial of
6 and we'll divide it by--

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.890
put a parentheses here.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:16.020
The factorial of k times
the factorial of n.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.910
Let me fix that n.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.555
Minus k.

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:22.610
And I know it fell off.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.240
n minus k.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.970
You put some parentheses there,
so the parentheses match up.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.890
Actually, this what fixes
on this cell Let me

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.450
put an F4 there.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.630
And then there you go.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.030
There's only one way to choose
0 things out of 6 things.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.350
That's what that tells us.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.350
And then the probability that
my random variable is equal to

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.780
k, or in this case, that I make
exactly 0 shots is equal to the

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.490
probability of any of the
specific ways of making 0 shots

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.210
times the number of those
ways there are times that.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.600
So that's the probability
of making 0 shots.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.920
And this is a cool thing
about Excel, we can now

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.860
select these cells.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.970
And just go into this right
hand corner, just drag it

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.555
down, and it'll do that
calculation for all of them.

00:07:06.555 --> 00:07:08.540
And this is neat because
it calculated the

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.160
binomial coefficients.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.110
This is 6 choose 3.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.950
n is 6, k is 3.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.440
This is 6 choose 3 is 20.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.990
It's nice and symmetric
like you would expect.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.270
But the probabilities aren't
that symmetric because

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.690
we have 0.3 and 0.7.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.490
So it's not like the flipping
a coin example that was

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.100
0.5 on either side.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.310
Sorry, these aren't symmetric
and then when you multiply

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.880
these, of course, these
don't looks symmetric.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.580
But it's hard to look at these
numbers, so actually, let's

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.160
just use the powers of Excel to
graph this probability

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.505
distribution.

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:39.100
So let's say insert chart.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.040
I'm always, I'm clumsy
at inserting charts,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.640
so let me see.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.390
The data-- I think
this is how I do it.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.670
I select the data.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.240
There you go.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.780
And then I need to select the
label, the category x labels.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.310
OK, that's going to
be that right there.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.500
And then let's see.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.630
Next, that looks good.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.470
I don't want to have anything.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.990
I don't need a legend.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.330
I don't want to show a legend.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.550
There you go.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.400
All right.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.160
Now I think I'm finished.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.250
Data labels-- yeah,
that's fine.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:18.720
OK, finish.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.500
I don't want to get too fancy.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.360
Don't want the
letters [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.750
Let me make this
bigger for you.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.380
So this is neat and I wish
they didn't make the font so

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.890
big, but you get the point.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.850
This is a discreet probability
distribution of me making, in

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.990
this case, k shots out of 6.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.190
And this was based on the fact
that my probability of making

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.520
any given shot was 0.3.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.280
Let me see if it'll actually--
and I'm not making any promises

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.060
here-- let me see if I can
actually make it so

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.800
that it changes.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800
If I make it 0.2
does it change?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.740
Oh, it changed!

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.480
Look at that.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.940
That was neat.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.090
Let me bring this
up a little bit.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.860
So what's neat is if I have a
30% chance of making a free

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.180
throw, that is my probability
distribution, my discrete

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.520
probability distribution
of making k shots.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.170
This is my probability
of making no shots.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.680
I think it was like roughly--
oh, it even gives us it.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.690
Tell us it's 0.12% or it's 12%
chance of making no shots.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.080
My probability of making
4 shots is only 6%.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.610
I know you can't see it but
that little window that

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.260
shows up right under
my pointer says 0.06.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.130
So this is neat.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.700
And since the way we set it up
we can actually change it,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.680
so that if I have a higher
probability of making a shot,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.080
now it looks pretty symmetric.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.050
Now my chances of making 4
shots is the same as my

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.340
chances of making 2 shots.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.250
And if I'm really good at
making baskets, I have

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.370
an 80% probability of
making any given shot.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.550
Now, all of a sudden, the
whole distribution has

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.620
shifted to the right.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.340
But I just wanted to show you
one, this is, I think, a

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.030
pretty neat way to use Excel.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.380
And hopefully, it's
not too daunting.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.570
The other thing is, these are
all examples of binomial

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.110
distributions and I wanted to
give you an example that might

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.280
be a little bit more relevant
to your everyday life.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.390
The probabilities of making
and missing aren't the

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.680
same, they change.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.060
If they are the same
then you end up with a

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.430
situation like that.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.070
Let's say you're a horrible
basketball player and you

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.430
only have a 10% chance of
making any given shot.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.810
So there's a very high
probability that

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.960
you make no shots.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.160
There's a 53% chance you make
no shots and then there's a

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.820
35% chance you make one shot,
and so forth and so on.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.610
But this is pretty neat.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.500
This by itself is kind of a fun
little toy and hopefully you

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.200
have enough information to do
it yourself, or maybe

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.980
experiment with more.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.010
What happens if you
have more than n?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.420
Actually, maybe I'll do
that in the next video.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.332
Anyway, see you soon.
