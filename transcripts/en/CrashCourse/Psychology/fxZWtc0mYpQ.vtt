00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Homunculus!

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.900
If you've heard that word, it probably wasn't
in the context of psychology.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.900
A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song
by They Might Be Giants, the bad guys in Fullmetal

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.740
Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.059
It's Latin for 'little man' and in psychology,
it refers to a kind of sensory map of the

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.760
human body, a depiction of what we'd look
like if each of our parts grew in proportion

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.740
to how much we sense with them.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.740
Witness!

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.740
Look at this dude.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.410
His ham hands could rip off a car door.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.610
I mean, if he could lift them, which he couldn't.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.260
Is this what we're supposed to look like on
the inside?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.250
This freaky thing illustrates the weighted
significance of our sensory receptors.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.780
His disproportional hands are monstrous, for
example, because we primarily touch the world

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.150
with our hands, not our elbows, so our hands
are extremely sensitive.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.010
His mouth, meanwhile, is huge because we also
have a ton of sensory receptors in our tongues

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.010
and lips.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.559
It's what we use for tasting food and for
sucking face.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.510
As we continue our exploration of how we both
sense and perceive the world, the Homunculus,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.410
while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty
attractive model for understanding how our

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.130
bodies interact with the environment.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.950
How we smell it with our outsized nose, taste
it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.250
touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.110
So join me, as we get to know the hideous
little creature within you.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.320
[Intro]

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.150
Last week we talked about the difference between
sensation and perception: how sensation is

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.430
the process by which our senses and brain
receive information from the outer world,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.820
while perception is how we organize and interpret
that information and give it meaning.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.820
Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting
me detect sounds, while my brain is processing

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.600
and interpreting them, allowing me to identify
and perceive the individual sounds and determine

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.610
if they're coming from the radio, or outside
or right behind me.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.040
Sound moves in waves that vibrate through
a medium, like air.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.860
And although they function differently that
waves of electromagnetic radiation, including

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.210
what we think of as light, sound waves also
can vary in shape.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.520
Short waves have a high frequency and a high
pitch, like a plucky violin.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.050
Long waves have a low frequency and pitch,
like a mournful cello.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.000
Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's
loudness, which we typically measure in decibels.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.760
And just as light waves become electrical
impulses that we register with our sight,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560
so too do our ears turn vibrating air into
signals that our brains can decipher.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.000
While the human ear might not be as elegant
as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400
bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.450
Or, organs, since we have two of them, which
helps give us directional stereophonic hearing.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.410
That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't
experience if we had just one big, freaky

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.940
ear in the middle of our foreheads.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.460
Your outer ear, the part that you can see
and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.770
and funnels through the ear canal and into
the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.770
to vibrate.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.570
From there, sound vibrations are amplified
by the so-called 'ossicle bones', which also

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.260
happen to be the most awesomely named bones
in your body: the stirrup, the hammer and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.260
the anvil.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.620
From here, those physical vibrations travel
to the inner ear, where they bump into the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.200
snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding
fluids get jostled around, causing some of

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.900
your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
This motion triggers neighbouring nerve cells
that convert that physical energy into electrical

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.880
impulses zipping up the auditory nerve into
the auditory cortex, where the brain is like

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.150
'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!', or 'Vengeance!',
or whatever.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.849
And you know what goes great with a little
bit of rockabilly, or revenge?

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:25.849
A nice meal.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.519
One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying
flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar,

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.000
we all get our tasting done in the same way,
starting with our taste buds.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.360
Each of our thousands of taste buds contains
a sort of pocket-like pore that contains fifty

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
to a hundred hair-like taste receptor cells
that read food molecules and report back to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360
the brain.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.590
"That chip is salty, that lemon is sour."

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.560
Now, everybody used to think that our tongues
just detected four distinct tastes: sweet,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.240
salty, sour and bitter.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.240
And you've probably seen the version of this
bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.540
certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.260
But we now recognize a fifth flavour: the
savoury, meaty, MSG-y taste, for which there

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.130
is no English word, it's known as 'umami'.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.300
But taste is nothing without smell.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.640
Plug your nose, and a bite of cold bacon is
just a mouthful of salt.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.709
This is a prime example of sensory interaction;
the principle that one sense can influence

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.709
another.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.379
I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but
I want to take a moment to talk about what

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.449
happens when those sensory interactions get
messy.

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.300
Let us take a little questionnaire, shall
we?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.740
Do certain words trigger a strong, specific
taste in your mouth?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.830
Like, does the word 'kitten' taste like candy
canes?

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.099
Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.589
Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain
actually cause the colour purple to flash

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:41.589
before your eyes?

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:44.520
Do you ever feel like you're being touched
when you smell something?

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.800
Like does the smell of lilies give you the
sensation of touching a cold, metal surface?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.249
Most of you said no to all of those questions,
but at least one of you out there answered

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.249
yes.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:05:00.039
And more likely than not, that person has
synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.689
condition where two or more senses get wrapped
together.

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.499
This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary,
and it's experienced without forethought in

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:10.499
a durable and consistent way.

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.639
Like, the number seven is always going to
taste like coffee, and it's never going to

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.910
switch to tomato juice.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.449
And we're still not sure what causes this
phenomenon.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.789
One idea suggests that the rogue development
of new neural connections may override normal

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.149
boundaries that typically separate the senses.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:29.139
Another theory suggests that all babies are
born with synesthesia and experience mixed

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.279
sense until the brain matures and creates
separate sense channels, unless they don't,

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.639
in which case you grow up to be a synesthete.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.289
Yet another theory links the condition to
wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.259
associated with one function turn up way over
in a different part of the brain.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.430
Just another example of how the mind is still
extremely mysterious.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.110
So, back to the comparatively boring topic
of smells that only smell... unlike our wave

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.509
detecting senses of sight and hearing, out
taste and smell are chemical senses.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.169
We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs,
grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.270
molecules travel up the nose and reach the
five to ten million receptor cells at the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.229
top of each nasal cavity; and yes, that means
when you smell poop, there's poop particles

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.229
in your nose.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.779
These receptors send information to the brain's
olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.360
smell cortex and parts of the limbic system
responsible for emotion and memory.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.069
Unlike our five different taste receptors
or two types of retinal receptors, we don't

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:30.940
have specifically differentiated smell receptors,
rather, odour receptors come together in different

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.940
combinations.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.649
So, just like pressing different keys on your
keyboard can allow you to form tons of different

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.599
words, so too can these distinct combinations
of activated smell receptors communicate some

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.619
ten thousand unique smells.

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.189
But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception
of it, is often tangled up in our experiences

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:46.309
with that scent.

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:50.599
If our beloved grandma baked gingerbread every
time we visited, those memories may make you

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.589
partial to the smell of gingerbread.

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:57.270
Even if we can't immediately name the odor,
our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.490
old scents by their associations.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.569
Which is why you may suddenly feel happy when
you walk into a bakery, even before you realize

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.740
you're thinking of your grandma.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.300
The emotional power of smell partly has to
with how our sense circuitry connects to the

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.099
brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional
registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper,

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.099
the hippocampus.

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.559
That's why scents can be so intimately tied
with our feelings and memories.

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.340
And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately
transport to back to eating chips in your

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.559
freshman dorm room.

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.629
Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing: all fantastic,
but if there's one thing that popular music

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.969
taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible
relationship advice, it's that when it comes

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:33.849
to our senses, we're all about touching.

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.689
We've got songs about magic touches and golden
touches, invisible and human touches.

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.650
Songs about touching ourselves, touching me,
touching you, and even what you can't touch.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.749
Touch is extremely important, especially during
early development.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:49.759
Baby monkeys that are allowed to see, hear
and smell, but not touch their mamas become

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:51.389
extremely distraught.

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.709
That's just a mean experiment.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:56.429
Premature human babies gain weight faster
if they're held and massaged, and some studies

00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:59.719
indicated that children that didn't receive
enough physical attention as infants are at

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:03.059
higher risk for emotional, behavioral, and
social problems as they grow.

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:07.389
Your sense of touch is actually a combination
of four distinct skin sensations: pressure,

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.469
warmth, cold, and pain.

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:13.640
If you touch various spots of your skin with
something soft like this anglerfish, you'll

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.550
feel that you sense different amounts of softness
on different parts of your body... just put

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.550
that up there...

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.919
The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube,
or a needle point.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:28.869
You'll sense that some spots are more or less
sensitive to each of the four distinct sensations.

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:33.250
Other skin sensations, like tickles, itches,
and the experience of wetness, are just variations

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.950
on those four different sensations.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:39.560
Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces
with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.139
to provide your personal kinesthesis: the
way that body senses its own movement and

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:45.139
positioning.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:48.730
You use your kinesthetic sense whenever you
walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.810
It's what the cops are testing drunk people
for when they ask them to touch their noses

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.949
with their eyes closed.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.740
This sense allows you to detect changes in
the position of your body without relying

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.130
on other senses, which is why you can still
cha-cha, backstroke, and hula hoop with your

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.959
eyes closed and your ears plugged.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:06.949
The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your
vestibular sense, which monitors your head's

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:08.339
position and your balance.

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:12.541
This sense of equilibrium is ruled by the
pretzel-shaped, semicircular canals and the

00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:16.029
fluid-filled vestibular sacs that connect
those canals to the cochlea in your inner

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:17.029
ear.

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:20.720
So, if you spin around a bunch and suddenly
stop, it'll take a minute for that inner ear

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.019
fluid to return to normal, which is what makes
you feel dizzy.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:28.009
That moving fluid is actually fooling your
brain into thinking your body is still spinning.

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:32.080
It's a good example of how even our normal
functioning senses can fool us.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.019
Understanding exactly how we get fooled helps
us understand how our sensual perception system

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:38.920
works, which is exactly what we're going to
be talking about next time.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.000
For now, hopefully you realized that your
homunculus is actually kinda beautiful, in

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.540
its own way, because you learned how your
sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.540
work.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.180
And thanks for watching, especially to all
our Subbable Subscribers, who make this whole

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.420
channel possible.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.870
