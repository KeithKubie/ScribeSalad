[GOOGLE LOGO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:07.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.690
MATT PARKER: All right.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.660
Thank you very much.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.760
Thank you for the kind
introduction, Ian.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.810
It was very kind of you.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.270
It's always nice to be
introduced by the organizer,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.840
saying I didn't think this talk
was going to be well-attended.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.740
So my name is Matt Parker.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.072
And, oh, as appears
on the screen here.

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.030
It's an absolute pleasure
to be back at Google.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.840
I did a author's
talk at Google--

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.280
trying to make it out-- it
was 2014, late 2014, I think.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.298
So it's been over four
years since I was last here.

00:00:40.298 --> 00:00:41.340
And it's pushing me back.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.550
I do a little work on YouTube,
as was kindly mentioned.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.860
And so I've been to the
building here before.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.837
Last time I was over
near Victoria Station.

00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:50.420
I've been to this
building previously.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.410
But it's the first time
I've been allowed out

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.428
of the basement, which is--

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.220
it's really nice, the
rest of the building.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.250
Anyway.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.190
So the idea is I'm going
to talk to you today

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
a little bit about my
book, "Humble Pi," which

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.060
is kind of the whole
conceit of the talk.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.220
And so the book came
out a couple weeks ago.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.590
And it's all about
mathematics mistakes.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800
And so what I thought I
would do is-- oh, there will

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.180
be Q and A at the end, right?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
So that anything I
don't cover or you've

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.880
worn your favorite
Parker square t-shirt

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.760
and you think I
won't notice, then

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.490
there'll be a time for that
kind of interaction later on.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.100
I'll take questions and I'll
be around to chat afterwards.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.610
What I thought I would do in
the more straightforward part

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.250
of this talk is initially
I'll talk a bit about the book

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.200
and why I wrote it and
what's going on there.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.680
And then secondly,
well, I thought

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.210
would be a bit different.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460
Because it's easy to go along.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.002
And you get asked to do a lot
of talks when you write a book,

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.290
and so I try to make them
all a little bit different,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.720
particularly at Google, who
are very keen on digitizing

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.700
just everything.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.350
And so this talk
will be recorded,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.270
and it will be online.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.880
Hello, everyone.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.470
I don't even know where
they've hidden the cameras.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.845
They may be filming
the audience.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:05.640
That's going to be quite
an immersive experience.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.889
You can watch it back
from my point of view.

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.389
So I thought I'd mix it up and
do something a bit different,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.770
which is what really happened
on some of the greatest

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.360
maths mistakes.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.730
And when I foolishly read
the reviews on Amazon

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.430
for this book-- and
I should have learned

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.710
having been honed in
YouTube comments--

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.470
and I read the reviews.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830
And people say, oh, why
isn't this story in there?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.740
This story should be in
there, or this story.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.490
And I'm, like, OK.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.948
A lot of them I fact checked
and turns out it wasn't right.

00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:37.650
And a lot of them-- what
the general consensus

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.375
of that mistake was is correct
or they're slightly off.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.000
So what I thought I would do is,
once I've introduced the book,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.333
I'm going to go through my
favorite stories that made it

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.770
into the book and
what I actually

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.870
found when I researched
those stories.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.670
Because a lot of
them I kind of knew

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.380
this maths mistake
happened and there

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.690
was an interesting result.
But I was surprised,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.630
when I dug into it, what
the true and slightly more

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.740
accurate, if not more precise,
answer is to what happened.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.220
So we'll start with
the book itself.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.400
So as was covered
very efficiently,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.200
my career is an unusual
mix of different types

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.128
of mathematics communication.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.920
So I used to be a
secondary school teacher.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.300
So I used to teach maths
to teenagers, originally

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.253
in Australia, where I'm from.

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:22.920
I grew up in Perth
in Western Australia.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.860
I studied mathematics and
miscellaneous other bits

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.360
and pieces when I
was at university.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.485
Then got my teaching
qualification, taught in Perth

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:31.470
for a year, moved to the UK.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.260
I taught in a couple
of different schools

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.630
in and around London.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.880
Fairly easy going to
difficult schools,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.240
because I enjoyed challenge.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.638
And I knew each time
I was just teaching

00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:43.680
at the school for a year.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.555
And you can tolerate a
lot for a single year.

00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:48.600
And I'll take my hat off
to some of the teachers who

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.020
do that day in, day out.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.520
Right?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.180
And they're there
every single year,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.160
and they actually learn,
like, the students' names.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.980
Whereas I was kind of in, boom,
maths out, which is great fun.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.630
And I gradually transitioned
from being a classroom teacher

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.850
to what I do now, which
is doing a lot of work

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.770
on YouTube, doing
bits of writing.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.863
I originally started
doing newspaper articles

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:12.030
and doing little live shows.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.947
So actually, if anyone
does want to come along

00:04:13.947 --> 00:04:15.720
to "An Evening of
Unnecessary Detail",

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.790
it's once a month
in East London.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.230
It's exactly what it says.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.570
That is not an ironic title.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.538
We invite comedians
who like science.

00:04:25.538 --> 00:04:27.330
And scientists who
think they're comedians.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.180
And we get them to come
and talk about something

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.950
in an unnecessary
level of detail.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.080
It's fantastic for me.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.950
Reviews in the audience vary.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.648
So it's a weird mix of things.

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:38.940
And I've gone to writing books.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.910
And my first book, which I
came and spoke about here

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.260
previously, was all about
hands on mathematics.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.590
It was recreational maths.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.840
Here's some interesting maths.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.010
Here is how you can actually
try a puzzle, build a thing,

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.177
or somehow interact with it.

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.010
Because so much of mass
is about the doing,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.593
and the experimenting,
and then having

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:56.700
a go, of which I am a big fan.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.130
And when I went back to
Penguin to write a second book,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.760
they're, like,
"Things to Make and Do

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.343
in The Fourth
Dimension"-- great book.

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:06.510
It sold adequately.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.520
I'm paraphrasing.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.300
It sold-- because it sold
good for a maths book.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.330
It sold adequate as a book.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.480
And that's kind of what
Penguin care about.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.910
And they're like why should
we publish another maths book

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.210
from you?

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.250
Again, they didn't say this,
but it was in their eyes.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.440
Why should we publish
another maths book from you

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.410
when we could do another
celebrity cookbook, which

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.000
is the only other option?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.560
And I said, hey, what if I wrote
a book about maths mistakes,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.732
when maths goes wrong?

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.440
And they're like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.770
Because they thought there
would be a much wider appeal

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.870
of a book about
mistakes and things

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.528
going wrong than another
pure mathematics book.

00:05:42.528 --> 00:05:43.820
And I was, like, oh, brilliant!

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.670
So I started collecting stories
of when maths had gone wrong.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.443
And my kind of ulterior
motive, and what

00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:51.110
I talk about quite a
bit in these talks,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.715
is that I wanted to show
how much maths are required

00:05:56.715 --> 00:05:59.180
in our modern society, how
much goes on behind the scenes,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.030
behind all types of technology
and finance and medicine,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.970
and things I don't have to
labor in front of this audience.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.970
And I thought, oh, you
know, when it goes wrong,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.723
that's a good excuse to have
to explain the maths about why

00:06:10.723 --> 00:06:11.390
that went wrong.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.913
And it means I can cover
all these interesting areas

00:06:13.913 --> 00:06:16.080
of technology and modern
life when maths goes wrong.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.810
But then as a teacher,
I was, like, yeah,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.990
but I don't want to
have a whole book which

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.960
is making fun of people who
get maths wrong or discouraging

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.220
people from making mistakes.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.300
I'm a big fan of these things.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.280
And so partly I put
in a bunch of just--

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.300
I'm always curious.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.770
How was that mistake made?

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.710
Is it important?

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.210
What was going on
behind the scenes?

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.668
And so actually,
as a teacher, this

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:40.730
was one of my absolute favorite
posters, which I managed--

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.480
I saw this online.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.440
I got a copy of this.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.400
This is absolutely brilliant.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.450
And try not to skip
ahead to the punch lines.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.970
"Education works best when
all the parts are working."

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.750
Now just-- if you would
tolerate me breaking this down

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.940
into unnecessarily small steps--

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.142
it's students, the cog labeled
students is going clockwise.

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:01.350
Anything that meshes with
it has to go the other way.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.590
So teachers are going to
be going anti-clockwise.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.410
But neither of them can move,
because parents are jamming up

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.160
the whole system, which makes
this one of the more accurate

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.600
educational posters out there.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.078
And I had a good
chuckle at this.

00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:16.120
Someone just hadn't thought
through the geometry.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.078
And it's not important.

00:07:17.078 --> 00:07:18.170
But it's funny, right?

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.795
So I thought this
poster was hilarious,

00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:21.690
which is why I went
and bought a copy.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.718
And now I started
spotting this everywhere.

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:27.260
Is it the frequency illusion,
where you're aware of something

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.780
and suddenly you start
spotting it in loads

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.620
of different places?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.240
And so this was in Manchester,
when they brought out

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.950
a new public transport system--

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.660
"making the city work together."

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.540
Brilliant, pretty accurate
for the trans in Manchester,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.740
in my experience.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.045
And then someone
did point out online

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.670
that-- well, hang
on, hang on-- there's

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.650
a whole third dimension
available here.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.080
All right?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.897
You've only got one
perspective on it.

00:07:49.897 --> 00:07:51.230
You've got to broaden your mind.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.772
Look at that!

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:54.200
If you think outside
the plane, look at that!

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.247
It works a treat.

00:07:55.247 --> 00:07:57.080
That doesn't work,
though, if you've already

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.720
used the third
dimension in the cogs.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.340
So early on in the
Trump administration

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.722
they were going to renegotiate
the North America Free Trade

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:07.430
Agreement, right?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.820
And so "USA Today" illustrated
the incredible progress

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.640
they were making--

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.690
so good.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.320
And they were already 3D.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.050
So you've used up your
third dimension, right?

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.730
So I paid good money.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.390
I paid more money than I should
have, out of my own pocket,

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.050
to license this image so
I could put it in my book.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.350
So if you've got the book,
I believe in the fine Google

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.233
tradition, they
will show up late.

00:08:33.233 --> 00:08:34.400
There will be copies around.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.880
Are they here?

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.510
Or are they still--

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.440
SPEAKER 1: They're here, yeah.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.070
MATT PARKER: They are here.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.640
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.270
MATT PARKER: Wow, you guys
are more organized than ever.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.590
OK.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:39.750
Oh, that's fine.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.580
[INAUDIBLE] you've got them.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:40.940
OK.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.950
If you flip through
the book, you'll

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.460
find I paid money to
put this in the book

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.585
just because I've wanted
to have the caption Making

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:46.460
Cogs Great Again.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.350
I took the rest of day
off after writing that.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.370
And my favorite
example, possibly,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.780
is the two pound coin.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.580
So these came out about 20
years ago, two decades past.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.540
And there's different circles
that different ages of the UK.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.540
And there's one in the
middle with lots of cogs.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.850
And there was a competition
to design the coin.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.050
It was won by a guy called Bruce
Russian, who lives in Norwich.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.150
He's a art teacher and an
artist in his own right.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.840
And he had the winning
design for this.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.550
However, if you count
the number of cogs,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.270
you will see that there
are an odd number of cogs.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.082
And so if they're
alternating clockwise,

00:09:28.082 --> 00:09:30.290
anti-clockwise, they will
not be able to move, right?

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.160
So famously, in
particularly niche circles,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.820
the cogs in the two pound
coin don't go anywhere.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.940
I will let you decide what
era of the UK that represents.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.350
And I thought about
contacting Bruce.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.970
Because online you can find
out who won the competition.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:50.660
That's public knowledge.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.243
I figure I can
probably find this guy.

00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:54.110
And so I thought,
I will look them up

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.580
and I will very politely
inquire if they had deliberately

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.300
done this.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.840
Right?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.572
Or did they not
even think about it?

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:02.780
What was the thought process?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.670
I was always curious to what
went on behind the scenes.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.720
Because obviously,
it's not important

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.130
if the cogs work in a coin.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.400
They can't move anywhere.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.340
They're made of
one piece of metal,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.900
which is a bigger flaw than just
the number of cogs that mesh.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.585
And so I went to their website
and found the original design.

00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.710
This is on Bruce's website.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.070
And I had a close look at it.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.660
And that would have worked.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.410
That is an even number of cogs.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.960
But when it was turned
into the two pound coin,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.060
these three were removed.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.430
And that set it to an
odd number of cogs.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.130
And so the original
design would have worked.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.420
I was, like, wow.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.347
Now I'm extra curious.

00:10:37.347 --> 00:10:38.180
Was that deliberate?

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.430
And it was broken by the mint?

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.180
So I emailed him.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.700
I said, hey, really
sorry, just wondering--

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.110
did you think this through?

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.210
Did you know it
would have worked?

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.890
Did you blah blah blah, all
this, yours sincerely, Matt.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.830
All right, send.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.150
I got a reply back.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.940
And it turns out he
did think about it.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.190
He replied and said,
yeah, I thought about it

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.840
and I realized
that it would only

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.830
work if there was an
even number of cogs.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.190
But I decided that's
not important.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.930
And he said how
he was an artist.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.700
And as an artistic
expression, he

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.430
doesn't think it's
important if it's actually

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.268
mechanically plausible or not.

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:10.810
It's just important that it gets
across the right impression,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.330
which to be fair, I kind of
agree with him on that right.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.260
I'm all for the
artistic impression

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.260
of what's going on here.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.660
So I'm not making fun of
people who get this wrong.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.370
I just think it's interesting
the thought process behind it.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.360
But then he went on to say
that he decided in the end

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.780
to make sure it would
work, because otherwise, he

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.610
would get loads of annoying
emails from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.700
Anyway, that bit was in bold.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.477
But hey.

00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:39.310
And then, yeah-- and
then the mint broke it.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.120
So when they turned it into the
thing, that took the cogs out.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.630
And it no longer worked, right?

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.255
And this one, for
me, this was the kind

00:11:44.255 --> 00:11:45.950
of fun trivial example.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.870
And I kind of use these as a way
of getting people just thinking

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.768
about the geometry
and the logic, right?

00:11:50.768 --> 00:11:53.310
And hopefully I've done it in
a way that is nice and positive

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.860
and engaging and everyone
can get involved.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.050
And so this one hobby
I picked up recently,

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.407
which is trying to spot--

00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:01.740
I'll show you the example first.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.650
See if you can work out why
I'm so upset with almost

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.550
every iteration of "Sesame
Street's" "I Don't Want to Live

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.830
on the Moon", as sung by Ernie.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.790
This gets me really
outraged because you can see

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.935
stars shining through the moon.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.530
The moon is still there.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.990
I also accept that is
not an accurate crescent,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.160
as if you were illuminating a
sphere from one side, right?

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.878
But that's just going too far.

00:12:31.878 --> 00:12:33.420
But I don't like
the fact that you'll

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.030
see these crescent moons, and
you can see right through them.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.180
And there's loads
of great examples.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.162
I've shown this in a
few talks, actually.

00:12:41.162 --> 00:12:42.120
People have emailed me.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.180
And they've realized a wallpaper
or something on their laptop

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.067
is fake.

00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:47.400
It was meant to be a real photo.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.445
But you can see stars
shining through the moon.

00:12:49.445 --> 00:12:50.820
It's obviously
been photoshopped.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.743
People have sent me
screen grabs of TV shows.

00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:54.660
And they're, like, it
just totally took me out

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.000
of the moment when I
realized you could see stars

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.840
through the moon.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.600
And I found the license
plates in Texas,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.070
which were used-- oh,
let's just zoom in, in case

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.610
it being 5% bigger helps.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.910
These are the license
plates from Texas.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.370
And to celebrate NASA's
presence in the Lone Star state,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.820
they have this in the corner.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.350
And I saw these images online.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.650
I was, like, oh, hang on.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.040
That star looks
dangerously close.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.870
The only way I
could find out would

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.460
be to actually buy some license
plates from Texas so that I

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.230
could get a high quality scan.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.780
And you may notice that's
quite a high quality scan.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.310
Because I bought the plates.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.960
These are mine now.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.040
I've got two of these.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.350
I put them on the scanner,
which is the image you're

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.280
looking at here.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.930
I zoomed right in on that moon.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.940
And if you fill in the circle,
sure enough, the plate's

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.500
undone by a lone star.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.610
There you go.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.910
And people have since argued
that-- some people have argued

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.120
it's gravitational lensing.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.890
I'm not buying that.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.810
Number one, mass,
and number two,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.700
lensing doesn't make
things appear in front.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.840
You just see them
around the sides, right?

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.070
Anyway, as if I'd taken that
complaint way too seriously

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.270
already.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.050
Although, someone said it might
be marking the first Apollo

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.280
landing site.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.980
And it's pretty much
in the right spot.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.050
So I'm prepared to give
them a pass on that

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.618
and just assume it's labeling
where NASA landed on the moon.

00:14:30.618 --> 00:14:31.660
The plate will be around.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.220
If you want to come and
check it for yourself

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.595
and convince
yourself either way,

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:37.450
I'll have that
around afterwards.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.370
These were the kind
of ridiculous examples

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.245
I was coming up with.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:41.953
And then I gradually
pieced them together

00:14:41.953 --> 00:14:43.360
with more and more serious ones.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.510
And so by focusing on ones
that weren't so important,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.970
and looking at why it happens,
and a big focus in the book

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.230
is the fact that humans
are not good at maths.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.127
And I go on and on about
this because people

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.710
see people who are
good at mathematics

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.335
and think, well, they
must be a genius.

00:14:58.335 --> 00:14:59.380
It must come naturally.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.090
And I'm, like, no,
for the vast majority

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.340
of people who are into maths,
they don't find it easy.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.500
They're just people who
enjoy how difficult it is.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.010
And the public don't know--

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.840
this is particularly
true for everyone

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.770
here who is a coder, right?

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.490
It's just-- you've got a
thing for self-punishment.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.140
It's insane, all right?

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.630
Just what's the most
frustrating task

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.938
I can try and achieve, right?

00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:23.230
And it's the fact that it's
a challenge, and it's hard.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.950
And you eventually notice
one semicolon, right?

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.610
And it's hard work.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.610
And it's difficult. But
that's why people do it.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.050
Not because it comes
naturally and it's easy,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.500
but because it's a challenge.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.750
And that was the kind of goal.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.250
And there's obviously
a lot in there

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.320
about why we make mistakes,
how we make mistakes,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.237
and systems we can put
in place to avoid them,

00:15:40.237 --> 00:15:42.280
and how mistakes end
up becoming disasters,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.970
and all these things.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.150
But now, now we're going
to play the middle part

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.050
of the show, the game of
guess what stories Matt

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.010
put in the book.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.190
And I've got three, at
least, here that I'm

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.230
prepared to talk about.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.527
But I'm just curious to
know, if those of you

00:15:57.527 --> 00:15:59.110
who have not flipped
through it or you

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.140
haven't already read the book
or listened to the audio one

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.527
available on Audible.com.

00:16:05.902 --> 00:16:06.610
Does anyone know?

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.684
What stories do you
think might be in there?

00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:10.476
What are the classic--
very hesitant person

00:16:10.476 --> 00:16:11.150
in the second row?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.775
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:15.027
The Mars Lander getting
that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:16.110
MATT PARKER: That's great.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.500
You're absolutely correct.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.290
In fact, you are so
correct, you even

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.360
gave the correct
units that were wrong.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.750
So I'm going to break
with my normal tradition

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.550
and say that you should have
a round of applause, well done

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.820
for that.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.320
That's--

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.045
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:31.045 --> 00:16:31.920
Let me bring that up.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.580
That's so good.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.120
So the Mars-- it was the
Mars climate orbiter.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.640
And when it was launched in,
oh, goodness, over a decade ago

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.380
and sent to Mars, there
was a famous understanding

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.570
that there were-- the
general understanding

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.120
that there was a
spacecraft from NASA which

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.630
crashed into a planet because
of a unit's conversion error.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.820
And that's the kind of
headline a lot of people--

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.680
hands up, who's aware
there was a spacecraft

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.978
that crashed because of a unit?

00:16:56.978 --> 00:16:58.020
That's everywhere, right?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.320
Now the most common
version of the story is it

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.770
was a Lander going to
Mars, which is correct--

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.770
which it was an orbiter.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.562
It wasn't a Lander.

00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:09.900
And it was a unit's conversion
between metric and imperial.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.319
And they were using
feet instead of meters.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.220
So it was too close or
something, and it hit.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.869
And often it's a
length measurement.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.036
You were absolutely correct.

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:21.060
It was actually the force on
the aircraft, on the spacecraft,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.319
on its way to Mars.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.849
So as it was flying
to Mars, you got

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.210
this big gyroscopic,
big flywheel thing,

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.460
which is used for controlling
the spacecraft in space.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.960
Because there's
very, very little

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.878
to push against in space.

00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:35.170
And so you got to bring your
own thing to push against.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.753
And so you bring a
big spinning wheel.

00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:38.430
But sometimes the
wheel goes too fast.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.897
And you've got to have these
angular momentum desaturation

00:17:40.897 --> 00:17:42.480
events, right, where
you slow it down.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.090
You adjust it.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.750
But that slightly alters the
trajectory of the spacecraft.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.170
And so over the course
of all these corrections,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.410
you have to keep track of
exactly what twists and force

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.880
was applied to the spacecraft.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.187
And the contractor was
in charge of doing that.

00:17:57.187 --> 00:17:59.520
And then they had to give the
final results over to NASA

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.300
so they knew exactly its
final approach towards Mars.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.770
And this is where it went wrong.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.870
The contractor-- oh,
by the way, it's often

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.640
said that NASA got it wrong.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.760
No, NASA actually
specified very clearly

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.340
in all their documentation
to the contractors

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.990
that it had to be metric.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.520
NASA were totally metric.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.690
They wanted to be metric.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.828
They thought it was metric.

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:21.120
It wasn't the other way around.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.400
The contractor,
however, did it in--

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.980
because normally you do it
in newtons or newton meters

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.960
if you're doing torque.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.668
And they did it, I
don't know-- in pounds

00:18:28.668 --> 00:18:32.760
per bushel or something.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.490
And they just fed the numbers
in and it all went wrong.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.370
And here's a little-- this is
my version of a famous graphic.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.770
This is the sort of AMDs, so the
Angular Momentum Desaturation

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.840
events, where they're
adjusting the flywheel.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.260
And this was the actual
path that it was coming

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.403
in on, much bigger forces.

00:18:51.403 --> 00:18:53.070
Because they were
using, effectively, it

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.323
was a pounds-kilograms,
ironically, kind of mistake.

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.990
This is what they
thought was happening.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.280
And they thought they would
have 150 to 170 kilometers

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.665
clearance from the surface.

00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:06.840
It actually came in about 57
kilometers off the surface.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.100
Mars hasn't got a whole lot
in the way of atmosphere,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.790
but it's a non-zero
amount of atmosphere.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.690
And it slowed it down
quite dramatically,

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.523
and then it crashed.

00:19:14.523 --> 00:19:18.000
So it was, like, half a billion
US dollars' worth of spacecraft

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.890
slammed into Mars because
a units correction,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.250
that the contractor didn't
follow the specification

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.410
document given by NASA.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.730
Does anyone know the other
spacecraft rocket maths

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.600
mistake?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.335
Right over on the wall, in fact.

00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:36.210
AUDIENCE: Ariane 501?

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.740
MATT PARKER: The Ariane 5, yes--

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.990
so the Ariane 5--

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.910
I have got it.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.650
I've got the video of the
launch of the Ariane 5.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.397
This is the first ever
launch in French Guiana.

00:19:47.397 --> 00:19:49.230
Now I've taken the sound
off and everything.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.975
This is just the
launch of the rocket.

00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:52.600
And I've never been
to a rocket launch.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.820
But my wife does
physics research.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.020
She does space physics research.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.960
She looks at magnetic fields
in the atmosphere of the sun

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.210
and all her observations
come from spacecraft.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.270
And her colleagues actually
had some of their spacecraft

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.900
on the Ariane 5 when it
was first being launched.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.650
The Cluster mission-- they
had four spacecraft on there.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.520
But then, very
unfortunately, it did this.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.270
No one's on there.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.645
There's no humans
on that, right?

00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:26.040
It's just spacecraft,
which still--

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.480
now I know a friend of mine--

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.210
I didn't realize
this until later on.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.960
A friend of mine had
just started her PhD.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.600
I know her because she's
a friend of my wife's.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.530
She just got her PhD
when this happened.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.248
And her PhD was going to
be on the Cluster data.

00:20:38.248 --> 00:20:40.290
And she was there watching
it with everyone else.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.440
And this happened.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.350
And the room went
about that happy.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.020
And the room just went
silent when it happened.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:54.000
And she was just thinking,
there goes my PhD, right?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.660
And the bits rained down
on the mangrove swamps

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.220
in French Guiana.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.320
And they actually
posted it back to them.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.920
So more detail than normal,
but it's that kind of crowd.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.140
So my wife works at UCLA in
the Mullard Space Science

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.840
Laboratory.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.070
And so they actually
design the instruments that

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.110
go on the spacecraft there.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.350
And it's in an old,
Victorian era mansion,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.380
out halfway between
Guilford and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.082
in the Surrey countryside.

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.540
And they've converted
a bunch of it

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.270
in to clean rooms and
engineering workshops.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.110
They literally make spacecraft
in the old potting sheds.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.710
And it's phenomenal.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.990
So they make all this.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.277
And it takes so long
to design and make

00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:37.860
these instruments
and these detectors.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.070
And the cluster ones were
going to be orbiting the Earth,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.750
tracking the Earth's
magnetic field

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.160
and how it responds to
changes from the sun.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.918
And they spent ages on
this instrumentation.

00:21:47.918 --> 00:21:48.960
And they got it launched.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.918
And then they weren't
expecting to get it back.

00:21:50.918 --> 00:21:53.860
And it came back in a box,
covered in bits of swamp.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.760
And there was, like, decades
of people's lives were there.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.900
And what went wrong
was an operant error.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.760
So the way this
system worked was they

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.120
had a bunch of
sensors which were

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.450
dotted around the spacecraft.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.158
They were all feeding
into a thing called

00:22:08.158 --> 00:22:12.450
the inertial reference
system, or the SRI for System

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.430
Reference-- eh, it's ESA.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.030
And then that took all the
raw data from the sensors,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.880
turned it into meaningful
navigation or location data,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.320
and then pushed that off
to the main processor.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:23.820
I know.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.160
For some of you, this is an
excruciating amount of data

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.100
that you don't need.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.080
You're, like, Matt, we
know how sensors work.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.052
So the problem was they were
given quite strict budgets

00:22:32.052 --> 00:22:33.510
on how much power
and, effectively,

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.550
computation they were allowed
for all the different bits

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.133
of spacecraft.

00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:38.010
And people working
on the SRI were

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.227
trying to keep their overheads
in terms of energy use down.

00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:43.560
And they looked at all the
sensors which were coming in.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.000
They had to turn them
into 16-bit values

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.553
before they were then sent off.

00:22:49.553 --> 00:22:51.720
And looked at all the
instruments, and seven of them

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.380
could give a 64-bit read out.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.880
OK.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.692
So we need to check everything
from these seven sensors.

00:22:57.692 --> 00:22:58.900
And they went, well, hang on.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.770
What values are we actually
going to get from them?

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.240
And of the seven which
could give a 64-bit number,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.300
three of them would
never actually physically

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.730
be able to record
a value that big.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.230
And so they actually
worked out they

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.140
didn't have to check
those before they put them

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.820
into whatever the memory was.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.547
And so those three
didn't have a check.

00:23:19.547 --> 00:23:20.880
The other four did have a check.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.760
And the whole system worked
great on the Ariane 4.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.790
Then, without
checking it properly,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.300
put the same stuff
on the Ariane 5.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.015
And because it had a
different flight trajectory

00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.390
and slightly
different sensors, I

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.920
believe-- don't
quote me on that.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.300
I spent a long time reading
through ESA official reports.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.970
Because of this, the sensor
wasn't being checked.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.560
It gave a 64-bit value.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.160
It was copied into
a 16-bit space.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.010
It caused an overflow error.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.670
And that crashed the SRI.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.710
Which, in and of itself,
would have been OK.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.910
There are backups.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.080
Except when it crashes, it
sends off an error message,

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.270
like, the final--

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.370
I always describe
error messages--

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.290
it's like the cliched, someone's
oh, tell my spouse I love them.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.970
But it's, like, tell my
debugger the following context

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.810
relevant information.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.812
And so it did that.

00:24:13.812 --> 00:24:15.270
But no one had
noticed it was going

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.750
to send that at the same
channel to the main processor

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.210
or computer as it was
sending its navigation data.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.070
That the system got it,
thought it was navigation data.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.440
Thought the rocket had
veered off to one side

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.337
and tried to correct.

00:24:26.337 --> 00:24:28.420
But it wasn't veering, and
the correct ironically,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.400
was the veer.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.940
And then it rightfully decided
to self-destruct at that point,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.200
and rained down on the swamp.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.450
And so I get a little annoyed.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.520
Because everyone
goes, oh, it was just

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.820
an overflow error or maths
error or programming thing.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.800
Actually, no-- the original
code was very clever.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.327
It just hadn't been
properly checked

00:24:46.327 --> 00:24:47.910
before it was put
into the new system.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.060
And actually, that sensor
didn't have to be on.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.250
It was actually a pre-launch.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.090
I think it was location or
something or tilt sensor.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.110
And originally, the Ariane
4, they got really annoyed

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.390
that, if they went to
launch and they turned off

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.932
the pre-launch stuff, it took
a long time to reset everything

00:25:05.932 --> 00:25:08.557
if they didn't end up launching
and they wanted to do it again.

00:25:08.557 --> 00:25:10.650
So they changed the code
so it would continue

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.273
running for 50 seconds after
the initial launch in case

00:25:14.273 --> 00:25:16.440
it had to be restarted or
it wasn't an actual launch

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.160
that time.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.260
And it caused this error.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.040
It actually exploded 40
seconds into the launch.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.830
And so it didn't even
have to be on, right?

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.550
And so all these extra
layers and details

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.500
are what I find fascinating
about what went wrong.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.800
And sure enough, in the common
room at the Mullard Space

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.990
Science Laboratory, where
my wife and her colleagues

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.350
have coffee, they have the
bits of the spacecraft.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.527
They dusted off most
of the bits of swamp.

00:25:43.527 --> 00:25:45.360
Apparently, you're not
allowed to touch them

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.985
because they've still got rocket
fuel on it, which is something

00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:49.200
something carcinogenic.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.350
And they had them in
a box as a reminder

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.360
to future generations
of space scientists

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.030
that decades, like, their
entire career, can go up.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.440
It could disappear in
the blink of an eye

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.780
because someone didn't
double check some code.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.000
And they weren't insured.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.200
However, ESA decided to
rebuild them and relaunch them.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.420
And there was a bit of
discussion about should we?

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.940
Because by then,
technology has moved on.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.530
They're, like, should
we upgrade them,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.840
or should we just rebuild
them exactly the same?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.762
They decide to rebuild
them exactly the same.

00:26:19.762 --> 00:26:20.720
And they launched them.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.560
They're working fine.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.920
They've been up
there for years now.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.712
So ultimately, it was
a successful mission.

00:26:24.712 --> 00:26:27.300
But all of that, wow, because
there's a couple lines of code.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:27.800
OK.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.700
So Mars Orbitor, good guess--
the other answers maybe

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.300
shorter.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.430
So any other guesses?

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.870
What might have
gone in the book?

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.800
I got one on the
side over there.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.550
We're going to go with
person on the side.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.922
We got reluctant--

00:26:41.922 --> 00:26:43.130
Let's get person on the side.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.340
Yeah?

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.453
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:47.453 --> 00:26:48.120
MATT PARKER: Oh.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.620
OK.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.243
So I wasn't able to find
out any details on this.

00:26:53.243 --> 00:26:55.910
There was a fly-by-wire aircraft
which, correct me if I'm wrong,

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.842
is the kind of aircraft where
the controls are connected

00:26:58.842 --> 00:27:00.050
to what's actually happening.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.400
It's not like electronics.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.800
And they flipped at the equator.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.050
I don't-- that's not in there.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.300
I can't remember if I tried
to fact check that or not.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.600
Has anyone else heard of that?

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.680
We'll talk afterwards.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.800
What I have put in is the US--

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.320
I think it was Air Force--

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.810
had a bunch of F22s.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.330
And this is in the
early, mid-2000s.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.840
The first time they flew
from Hawaii to Japan

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.410
that crossed the International
Date Line and their navigation

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.880
systems turned off.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.640
Genuinely happened,
incredible-- they tried

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.030
to restart them in the air.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.150
It's so good.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.030
But they couldn't.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.523
And so they always have this
fueling aircraft with them--

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:40.940
because they couldn't navigate,
but they could still fly--

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.010
they had to just
limp back, following

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.568
the refueling aircraft all
the way back to Hawaii.

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:46.610
That definitely happened.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.195
I found reports on that.

00:27:49.195 --> 00:27:50.570
I guess what I
couldn't verify in

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.870
that story is there were rumors
that they were in the aircraft,

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:59.950
and they heard the Microsoft
Windows startup noise.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.670
Cannot verify that.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.230
That would be so good--

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.650
no way.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.930
And I managed to verify
there was a US aircraft

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.590
carrier, a massive
warship, which

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.560
was cut adrift without any
power because one of its systems

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.810
divided by zero.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:17.310
Mwah.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.730
Mwah.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.895
Any other guesses
what's in the--

00:28:21.895 --> 00:28:23.085
OK, you, second row.

00:28:23.085 --> 00:28:25.700
AUDIENCE: I think it was the
Patriot missile [INAUDIBLE]??

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.575
MATT PARKER: Oh, yes.

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:28.090
So the Patriot missile--

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.680
this was a missile
defense system

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.900
which was to stop SCUD missiles
in the first of n Iraq wars.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.600
And it had an issue where it
was keeping track of time.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.720
I forget the interval,
something like milliseconds

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.870
in a certain space.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.083
And the longer it was on,
the less precise its time.

00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:50.000
Therefore, location
calculations [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.140
And that's
particularly horrific,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.670
because people
died in that case.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.062
But they'd already told
them it was a problem.

00:28:55.062 --> 00:28:57.020
They just hadn't done
the restart often enough.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.600
And there was already an
updated version of the software.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.670
It arrived days
later at the camp.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.600
So yes, that's a tough one.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.510
Because in so many
of these stories,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.960
they end, and then
everybody died.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.820
Because in engineering
and medicine,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.180
and anything with a military
application, that is so.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.650
And because I've
promised Penguin

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.990
a comedy book about
maths, I couldn't

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.580
have every second story--

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.620
and then everybody died.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.587
This collapsed, everyone died.

00:29:26.587 --> 00:29:27.170
This happened.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.430
Guess what?

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:33.030
So I've tried to be careful
and strategic with what I

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.280
put-- because it is important.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.560
Because if these maths things
go wrong, people do die.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.010
But I've tried to be careful
how and when I put them in

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.680
and how many examples
I use like this.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.780
Actually, all the aviation
stories in my book, nobody

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.010
dies.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.900
And that's partly
because aviation

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.360
is phenomenal in terms of
how they deal with mistakes

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.710
and how they avoid disasters.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.020
Obviously, it does
still go wrong.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.100
I was really annoyed.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.550
The Ethiopian report
into the Boeing 737

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.757
was supposed to come out
on Monday, yesterday.

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.090
And they've delayed its release.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.550
And everyone keeps asking.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.800
Because obviously I've got
a book about maths mistakes

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.460
with a plane on the cover.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.170
And I'm doing media interviews.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.892
And I'm, like, I just
don't know, right?

00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.350
There's a lot of
rumors and reports

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:18.330
and pilot's testimony and
stuff about the autopilot,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.500
I think, in piloting speak,
that's the up and down flapping

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.702
movement of the plane.

00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:24.160
And something is
going wrong there.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.860
But I don't know the details.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.520
I'm waiting for that report
to come out so I can read it.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.540
But I was very careful to only
put in ones where nobody died.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.090
And then likewise,
there was one, again,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.530
kind of roll over errors.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.110
I didn't mean to do
entirely roll over errors,

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.700
but I think they
were fascinating.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.130
And obviously, a
lot of people here

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.397
are well aware of the
limitations of binary

00:30:42.397 --> 00:30:43.730
and coding and roll over errors.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.730
But to the general public,
it's just fascinating

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.830
that you've just not left
enough room to write down

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.020
a big enough number.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.520
Right?

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.210
And obviously, the millennium
bug is a great example.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.420
We only used two digits,
and then the year

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.440
got bigger than that.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:03.530
And obviously, there's a bit
about Unix time and the Y2K 38,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.410
crash harder, the
sequel is coming up.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.670
And I found-- this is great.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.660
I did not know this.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:16.040
In Switzerland, trains are
not allowed to have 256 axles.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.230
How great is that?

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.640
A train must not have an
effective total number

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.090
of axles equal to 256.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.330
Because they use axle
counting detectors.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.410
And they roll over
once they hit 256.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.240
And so if a train has
exactly 256 axles,

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.300
it would count it
as zero, and it

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.750
would move around as a
phantom train on the network.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:44.917
And I mean, I've seen hardware
problems fixed in software.

00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:45.750
There's that before.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.880
I've never seen a hardware
problem fixed in bureaucracy.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.790
That's such-- such a Switzerland
solution to the problem.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.660
And again, I found many
cool machines which

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.730
had the same roll over error.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.672
One machine used
for radiation had

00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:06.130
a bunch of checks to make sure
it wasn't going to overdose.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.860
Because it could do
electrons or x-rays.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.420
And if it had the
wrong setting, it

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.420
could have a horrific
overdose of radiation.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.160
And the check-- they
had a thing called

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.920
check call to check if
the columnar was in place.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.590
And check call, if
it was non-zero,

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.065
it wouldn't run the machine.

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.440
And every time it
does the check,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.065
if it wasn't in the right place,
it would increment check call.

00:32:26.065 --> 00:32:29.320
Except that every
one in 256 times,

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.880
it would over roll to zero.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.810
And if the person hit go right
then, and it wasn't safe,

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.970
and it happened to
be rolling over then,

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.725
it would still turn
on despite the fact

00:32:38.725 --> 00:32:41.100
that checks hadn't been done
and the things were in place

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:41.710
and people died.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:42.210
Right?

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.080
Because of this--
it's just terrifying.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.130
So I tried to balance that with,
hey, funny story about trains,

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.340
people die, and Pac-Man!

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.100
So this-- oh, I've got--

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.080
I shouldn't have converted
this to widescreen

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.510
without looking at it closely.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.367
Fixed, I reckon I
could have done that,

00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:01.950
and if I hadn't been
talking out loud,

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.860
no one would have noticed.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.360
OK.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.730
So this is the final
level of Pac-Man.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.700
People are often vaguely aware
that the 256th level of Pac-Man

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.280
crashes.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.490
This is what it looks like.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.240
This is actually me
playing the level,

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.190
because I know how to
cheat using an emulator.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:22.143
And when you hit this level,
the left is what you expect.

00:33:22.143 --> 00:33:24.060
This is the classic
arcade version of Pac-Man.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.990
The left is what you expect,
and the right is just this mess.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.690
As it's often said that
you hit the 256th level,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.980
and that number is too big to
fit in your 8-bit of memory.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.050
And so it overflows
and everything crashes.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.460
And that's actually
not what happens.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.620
So I dug through this.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.970
People have gone through.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:46.223
And there has been a project
to comment the original--

00:33:46.223 --> 00:33:48.390
whatever it is, machine, I
don't know, whatever code

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.410
this was written in.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.790
People try and comment
it and look at it.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.540
And people, in fact,
have released a patch

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.450
that fixes this problem now--

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.160
oh, nerds!

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.460
And if you dig through what
happened, it's not the level.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:00.960
Right?

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.810
Because 256-- I
mean, programmers

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.200
know how to index from zero.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.210
Please.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:07.710
Right?

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.260
So the first level
1 is indexed as 0.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.030
Level 2 is indexed as 1.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:16.139
So when you get to level
256, it's indexed as 255.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.190
It's fine.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.469
That does not
cause any problems.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.699
The problem is when it tries
to draw the pieces of fruit

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.590
at the bottom of the screen.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.199
And in Pac-Man, they're
generally called fruit.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.320
But there's keys that he eats
and all sorts of other objects.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.750
And the idea is there's a
different one for each level.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.969
And for no reason
other than decoration,

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.340
they decided to
display, at the bottom

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.170
of the screen, the
pieces of fruit

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.840
from the recent levels
the player had played.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.840
Few people play more than one
level, so no one really ever

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.590
notices.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.270
But they show up
to, I think, it's

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.880
seven or eight of
the last levels

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.020
that you've gone through.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.659
And the way that it prints
them is in the memory.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.330
They've stored the table
of fruits and the graphics

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.590
for each one.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.970
And first of all, it checks
if there have been-- actually,

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.470
I'm going to bring
in my pseudocode.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.030
Oh, OK.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.270
So the first step is--
this is a paraphrase this--

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.480
the first step is, is
it level 7 or lower?

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.940
Because it is level 7
or lower, then it only

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.250
needs to print as
many pieces of fruit

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:21.810
as the current level number.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.460
If it's greater
than 7, it'll only

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.850
go up to the most recent, 8.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.370
Let's say 7 or 8.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.730
And so what happened was
it would take the index

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.460
of the level, increment it by
one to get the actual level

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.170
number-- this is
where it went wrong--

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.310
so 255.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:36.270
That becomes zero.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.710
It does a quick check to go, oh,
is that below or above seven?

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.330
Zero is below seven.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.180
But then what it did
was to print anything

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.080
from below seven.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.247
So instead of just doing
the most recent eight, what

00:35:48.247 --> 00:35:51.150
it would do is, first of
all, draw a piece of fruit.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.460
Then let's not check now.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.520
Let's first of all subtract
one from the level number,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.010
then let's check if
it's zero and stop, then

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.870
otherwise keep on fruiting.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:02.820
And so it would
print a bit of fruit.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.570
Subtract one.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.970
Go back down to 255.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.020
That's not 0.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.130
Keep on fruiting.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.050
And so it was this weird--

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.790
it was just hovering
above and below zero

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.800
at just the wrong times.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.470
It tries to print 255,
56, eh, off by one,

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.573
one of the two pieces of
fruit and the rest of it.

00:36:21.573 --> 00:36:22.740
So it starts printing fruit.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.090
And because of the way
the coordinates work,

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.680
it prints across a couple times.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.010
And then it starts top
left and just runs down

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.710
until it thinks it's
done enough fruit.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.960
And this is just the rest of
the stuff in the memory being

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.460
interpreted.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.900
It looks like it
finds with where

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.250
the characters are stored.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.590
It's just whatever else
is in the memory, splashed

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.370
onto the screen.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:46.170
And the levels don't finish when
Pac-Man has eaten all the dots.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.230
The levels know how many
dots there should be,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.165
and they finish when
Pac-Man has eaten

00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:52.537
that many numbers of dots.

00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:54.120
And because it doesn't
print them all,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.710
because they've been
obliterated by the fruit,

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.700
it's impossible to go
on to the next level.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.920
And that's why it crashes.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.257
In the original version,
you would loop back to one.

00:37:01.257 --> 00:37:03.090
And you would just
continue playing forever.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.182
This is actually preferable,
in my humble opinion.

00:37:07.182 --> 00:37:07.890
And so that's it.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.560
So you can check out the
online project to fix it,

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.120
which I think is incredible.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.680
And I did play it myself once.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.780
I've been meaning to
learn to play it properly

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.010
to get there legitimately.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.630
But I just used the
emulator and I got there.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.690
And it was kind of fun.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.960
So again, another fun
example of a roll over error.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.740
So you know what?

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.810
Let's do one more guess.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.200
And then I'll go into
Q&amp;A. So we'll do--

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.730
any other guesses
what I might have

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.610
put in the book, any
other classic stories?

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.680
Very hesitant person
in the middle here--

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.602
AUDIENCE: I think I remember
a story about Royal Navy

00:37:40.602 --> 00:37:43.022
guns being inaccurate in
the Southern Hemisphere

00:37:43.022 --> 00:37:44.993
because they did the
Coriolis effect wrong.

00:37:44.993 --> 00:37:45.660
MATT PARKER: Oh.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.500
That's a good one!

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.920
That rings a tiny bell.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.010
That's not in the book.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.010
And so if you missed it.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.612
It's Royal Navy guns
being inaccurate

00:37:52.612 --> 00:37:54.570
in the Southern Hemisphere
because the Coriolis

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:57.150
effect is going to bump them
off into the other direction.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.733
And too late--
the thing is now--

00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:02.150
because in the
book, I didn't want

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.220
to make the book just
be a bunch of stories

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.870
people could find on Wikipedia.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.420
I liked the fact I got
the common, famous stories

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.423
and properly fact checked
and researched them

00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.340
and put them in there.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.160
So now it's on the public
record what actually happened

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.520
in a bunch of these situations.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.770
And then some of them were
people I knew or had worked

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.380
with or contacts or anonymous.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.280
I wanted to have
extra stuff that's

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.320
in there which were new stories
that weren't out before.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.620
And so people I
know, friends of mine

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.910
who were engineers and
developers and database people

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.103
and occupations I'm
not allowed to reveal,

00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:35.270
would give me these stories.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.460
And I would put them in either
anonymously, or carefully,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.252
as the case may be.

00:38:38.252 --> 00:38:39.960
And so I was quite
happy to add new ones.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.660
But now the book is
out, loads of people

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.090
are contacting me with
more great stories.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.890
And I'm, ah, I
should keep a list

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.120
and just write a lazy sequel.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.620
No.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.055
But I haven't come across that.

00:38:50.055 --> 00:38:52.060
The only thing I
have done is-- you

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.150
know there's the
classic, the water goes

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.680
the different way down the plug
on the toilet thing, right?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.520
And it's not true.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.150
It's not true.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.220
The best you can
do if you actually

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.420
imagine a sink, which is,
like, a meter in radius,

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.190
like, a two meter diameter sink.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.790
And you fill it with water.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.060
And you let the water
totally settle so there's

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.800
no movement whatsoever.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.485
And then you very
carefully release--

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.860
you can't just
pull the plug out,

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:16.940
because that's
too much movement.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.010
If you release some kind
of valve or something

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.280
at the bottom, and let it
drain over the course of hours,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.992
you will get different
rotations in that situation

00:39:25.992 --> 00:39:27.200
in the different hemispheres.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.880
And people have done
that experiment.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.920
Smarter Every Day,
YouTube channel Destin

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.660
did it with
Veritasium with Derek.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.243
And so they filmed the same set
up in different hemispheres,

00:39:37.243 --> 00:39:38.010
brilliant.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.770
And I was, like, wow, hang on.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.570
But what about in a sink?

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.560
Will it work in an actual
working environment?

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.550
And so I got a sink.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.232
I took it to London
so I could film me

00:39:48.232 --> 00:39:49.940
at the front of the
Houses of Parliament.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.710
So I'm definitely in London.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.870
And I fill the sink
with a bowl of water.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:54.620
And I drain it.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.650
And I had a plumbing thing
set up into a bucket.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.970
You know, I put a
lot of effort to make

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:01.360
it look super suspicious.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.600
And no one told me to stop.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.590
There you go.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.480
And so I filled this thing
and emptied it loads of times,

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.070
to where it was a mix
of both directions.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.528
It depends what
the water is doing.

00:40:08.528 --> 00:40:09.180
I even tried--

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.410
I had a thing to try and pacify
the water, like dividers,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.610
to stop it from moving.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.580
But any movement, it
goes different ways.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.232
I then got the same sink,
put it in a suitcase,

00:40:19.232 --> 00:40:20.690
flew it to the
Southern Hemisphere,

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:21.898
did the same thing in Sydney.

00:40:21.898 --> 00:40:23.780
And so I got a
split screen of me

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.000
with the same sink
in both hemispheres.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.640
And it goes in different
directions all the time, right?

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.840
There's no consistency.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.033
But I imagine, yeah, it would
make a difference launching--

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:35.450
firing something
like a trajectory

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.470
of that kind of scale
would make a difference.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.970
OK.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.750
So I am going to take some
questions in a second.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:44.000
They don't have to be
guessing what's in the book.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.490
It's not just me crowd
sourcing the sequel.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:51.170
They can be questions of
anything I do or bits of maths

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.490
or other stories and the rest.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.715
I'm going to put my
slide back up here.

00:40:54.715 --> 00:40:56.090
So that's kind of
what I covered.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:56.960
There's the book.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.460
I think about people
already got it.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.950
I'll be around and
defacing them afterwards.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:06.080
I am fluent in ASCII, so I'm
happy to encode your name.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.990
Most people get very
upset about the URL being

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.130
wwwh.umble-pi.com.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.050
People here are, like, yeah,
you're jerking your subdomains.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.840
There you go.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.362
I thought I was so funny
when I got that working.

00:41:19.362 --> 00:41:21.320
Penguin less so, because
they noticed if you go

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.180
to umble-pi.com,
it doesn't work.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.830
And I was, like, yes,
people have to earn it.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.300
Matt, you have
misunderstood marketing.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.283
So that's that.

00:41:33.283 --> 00:41:34.700
If you've not come
across anything

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.310
I've done, as I've
mentioned before, I

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:38.780
do Numberphile channel,
which is great fun.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.390
I imagine a lot of people
have come across those videos.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.720
In fact, the most recent
video on Numberphile

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.180
was filmed in this building,
the one that I did.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.940
So I always wanted to do--
channels do live coding, which

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.080
I love on YouTube.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.930
And often, in videos, I will
say, I found this number by--

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:54.800
I coded a thing up.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.280
And I found it.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.030
I did this, right?

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.700
And I'm amateur to terrible
level Python coding.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.328
And so live, I wrote a
little bit of Python--

00:42:04.328 --> 00:42:05.120
still in version 2.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.170
That got a lot of comments.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.950
And so never code
live on the internet.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:11.960
It's a terrible idea.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.530
People have opinions,
it turns out.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.070
And so the video went out.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.653
And it shows me doing
the live coding.

00:42:17.653 --> 00:42:20.028
Like, for people who've never
done it, and I keep saying,

00:42:20.028 --> 00:42:22.460
I wrote a program to do this--
what that actually entails.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.543
And so I quite enjoyed it.

00:42:23.543 --> 00:42:24.520
But we filmed that.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.020
Brady and I just happened to
have some time before a YouTube

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.520
event.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.070
And so we're in a dark
corner, literally, it's

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.910
the dark corner in the basement
somewhere that just went out.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.320
So check out Numberphile.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.170
Stand Up Maths is
my other channel.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.370
That's just me.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.730
And I put Patreon on there,
as well, because why not?

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.650
Because they're all
crowdfunded, basically.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.160
So my stand up maths videos--

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.800
what I'm saying is Aunty Adsense
doesn't give me enough pocket

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.400
money.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.340
And so on Patreon,
people contribute.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.170
And I do ridiculous things
filming mass videos with that.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:00.670
So if you want to
check out anything

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.462
more about what I'm
doing, there are links.

00:43:02.462 --> 00:43:06.310
I will wrap up the official part
of today's proceedings there.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.385
And we'll move on to
any other business.

00:43:09.385 --> 00:43:11.260
Let's punctuate this
with around of applause,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.100
and then we'll do questions.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.340
That's the end of my
talk, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.530
Oh!

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.770
How genuine-- so how--

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.770
[INAUDIBLE] got the mic.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.020
How are we going
to do questions?

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.570
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.445
I just wanted to ask
you to go to the middle,

00:43:28.445 --> 00:43:30.040
to the microphone,
so we can hear you

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.650
when you ask the questions.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:32.990
MATT PARKER: Oh, yeah, so we've
got a mic on the stand right

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.230
in the middle.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.730
So if you wish to
ask me a question,

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.750
to there's a certain amount of
public awkwardness involved.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.627
So you have to walk
over to the mic there.

00:43:42.627 --> 00:43:44.960
If I was playing a game of
are they leaving, or are they

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.180
asking a question?

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
thanks for the talk.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.410
There was a story
of some scientists

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.470
that tried to give
cocaine to elephants

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:56.120
as a part of an experiment.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.090
And they messed up the scaling.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.440
They scaled it by the
mass instead of scaling

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.960
by the radius.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.050
And turns out the volume grows
with a cube of the radius.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.760
But what they needed
for the dosage

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.490
was the surface
area of the organs,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:15.800
which grows with the square.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.790
And so they massively--

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.760
I mean, they killed an
elephant with cocaine.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.570
MATT PARKER: I mean, what I
love about your question--

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.592
and there is a lot
to choose from--

00:44:28.592 --> 00:44:30.935
is that you said,
you know, there

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:33.148
were scientists who were
giving an elephant cocaine.

00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:33.940
That's not even it.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.490
That's just the start
to my favorite bit.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:40.450
And they did it based on
the cube of the radius,

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.160
as if we're all, like,
well, we all know

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.310
how to dose an elephant.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.180
Those amateurs!

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.680
No.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.160
Thank you.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.785
It's a great story
everyone can connect

00:44:49.785 --> 00:44:52.550
with in their normal lives.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.050
No.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.290
I hadn't come across that.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:55.570
That's amazing, right?

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:56.300
So I don't know.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.690
Drug dose-- I guess
they don't necessarily

00:44:58.690 --> 00:44:59.952
scale with body mass, do they?

00:44:59.952 --> 00:45:01.160
And so they did it with mass.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.890
And it's actually area.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.270
That's lovely.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.510
Ah.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.470
Can someone write these down?

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:09.580
I hadn't come across that.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.960
That's great.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.000
I have nothing
more to add, other

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.020
than I will be looking that
up afterwards from a browser

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.340
in private settings.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.450
OK.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.810
Any other questions-- one
elephant's worth of cocaine,

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.310
please.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.160
Oh, here we go.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.334
The individual in the
Parker Square t-shirts.

00:45:29.334 --> 00:45:30.167
That's going to be--

00:45:30.167 --> 00:45:31.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.110
MATT PARKER: Is that unrelated?

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.550
It is what you
normally wear to work?

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:33.820
Or is--

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.570
MATT PARKER: Oh, really.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:35.273
Just threw it?

00:45:35.273 --> 00:45:36.190
You didn't even think.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.065
You just threw it
on this morning.

00:45:38.065 --> 00:45:39.440
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.190
My question would be,
have you ever considered

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.890
making another channel with
maybe more advanced features?

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.190
And another question
I have are you aware

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.142
of Three Blue, One Brown?

00:45:50.142 --> 00:45:50.850
MATT PARKER: Yes.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:54.690
So great, great-- two
questions for the price of one.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.770
You may sit down now.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.220
So OK.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.540
First of all, to deal with
the [INAUDIBLE] question,

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.950
the t-shirt, which I've made
a couple references to--

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.320
I did a video ages ago
about how no one has ever

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.020
found a magic square, a
three-by-three magic square,

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.630
so that's nine numbers in a
three-by-three grid, where

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:17.350
every single column and row
and both the main diagonals

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.170
all add to the same
total, such that all

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:23.487
the numbers in the magic square
are themselves square numbers.

00:46:23.487 --> 00:46:24.570
No one's ever found that--

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.530
with certain extra constraints,
like, all the numbers

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:27.960
have to be different,
and a few other things.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.460
Right?

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.390
So I found one which is
close, but not quite.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.050
I gave it a go.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.217
Same story-- I gave it a go.

00:46:33.217 --> 00:46:34.140
I wrote some code.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.140
I did a bit of a search.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.880
I found the best one I could.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.770
And I knew people
have checked them up

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.110
to some crazy threshold.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.000
So I knew I wasn't going to
discover the whole solution.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.980
I wanted to see how
well I could do,

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.933
as a fun thing to talk about.

00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:49.350
As I made the video, and I
showed this square in the video

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:50.152
on Numberphile.

00:46:50.152 --> 00:46:52.360
And then the guy making it,
Brady, behind the camera,

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.833
just went, it's not
very good, is it?

00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:55.750
And I was, like, what?

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.940
This is my best effort.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.610
He's, like, nah.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.210
He's, like, what's it called?

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:01.870
And I said I am not going to
call it the Parker Square.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.720
Because then you'll be ha,
ha, ha, that classic Parker

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.310
Square it'll
become-- and so he's,

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.810
like, OK, fine, fine, fine.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.070
I won't make a big
deal out of it.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:12.520
And then he released
a range of t-shirts

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.870
and named the video
the Parker Square.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:17.140
Now it's become this
mascot for when your best

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.080
is not just good enough, right?

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.660
But I like it, because
I've tried to repurpose

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.090
it to be give it a go, right?

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.157
So much in maths is
you try something,

00:47:27.157 --> 00:47:28.990
and people think maths
are all about getting

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.710
the correct answer.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.418
You try something,
and it's important you

00:47:31.418 --> 00:47:32.390
get the right answer.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.932
But it's not.

00:47:32.932 --> 00:47:34.360
You give it a go
and you're wrong.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.052
You go, oh, OK.

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.760
And you try again,
and you're less wrong.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.180
Yeah?

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.722
And you try again,
you're more wrong.

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:40.840
And then eventually,
hopefully, you converge in

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.220
on getting it right.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.520
And so I like the fact that
it's all about giving it a go.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.112
I'm going to answer your
second question simultaneously.

00:47:48.112 --> 00:47:50.320
So have I considered doing
more advanced mathematics?

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.930
And am I aware of
Three Blue, One Brown?

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.540
Which is-- I do,
yes, great channel.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.100
And so it's difficult how
you pitch a YouTube channel

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.347
about particularly
technical subjects.

00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:04.930
And you're going to get slightly
different audiences depending

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.040
on what you do.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.610
Numberphile we pitched
higher than anyone else

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.620
thought was smart.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.730
And it's because it was the part
of the original-- back in 2011,

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:19.210
it was a part of the early
Google funded channels, when

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.130
Google was, like, TV is dead.

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.910
And so we had a little freedom
when we first set it up.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.340
And partly because
of the people Brady

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.620
chose to work with and
partly deliberately,

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:32.607
we pitched it higher than
most people would expect,

00:48:32.607 --> 00:48:33.190
and it worked.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.910
People liked seeing
mathematicians

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.090
nerding out on their
favorite numbers

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.930
and doing actual working out.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.760
But since then, now it seems
quite tame in comparison.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.860
And now, a lot of people
who were into it when

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.810
they were younger have now gone
on to become mathematicians.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.170
I've met people now are,
like, oh, I finished my PhD.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.030
And I remember
watching your videos

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.350
when I was in high school.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.130
And I'm like, oh.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:55.950
Now I feel old.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:59.470
And so it's kind of
stayed around that level.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.390
Stand Up Maths--

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.770
I like to do two things.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.150
I occasionally like to
have quite heavy content

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.060
in the videos, but
not often, to be fair.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.580
In fact, I'm due one which is a
bit more pure, or interesting,

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.380
or more advanced mathematics.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.120
I tend to go for
one of two things.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.630
I tend to go for accessible
things I think will--

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.520
while being enjoyable
for nerds-- will help

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.450
draw in new people.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.480
I'm much more of an evangelical
channel than a teaching

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.170
channel.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:27.970
And secondly, I
try and do things

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.370
which people of a
nerdy persuasion

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.530
will just find delightful.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.780
And that's because I'm
largely making the videos

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.610
to entertain myself.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.420
And a bit like we do on
Numberphile when we printed out

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.935
over a mile of pi, and
we had the first million

00:49:42.935 --> 00:49:44.560
digits on one continuous
piece of paper

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.940
on a runway at an airport,
it's just ridiculous.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:47.740
But it was great.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.638
And recently,
someone-- I did a video

00:49:50.638 --> 00:49:52.180
which was a little
bit more in depth,

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.550
but we didn't go into any
of the technical details,

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.425
about things called
superpermutations.

00:49:56.425 --> 00:49:57.550
Which I won't go into here.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.008
They're a very long
list of symbols

00:49:59.008 --> 00:50:01.505
that contain all the possible
permutations of the symbols

00:50:01.505 --> 00:50:03.130
in there and every
single permutation's

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.940
in there somewhere.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.845
And how short can you
find the permutation

00:50:05.845 --> 00:50:06.890
is kind of the challenge.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.640
And there's a lot of open
questions in superpermutations.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.090
And I did a video about it.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:13.840
And someone pasted
a new breakthrough,

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.300
like a new, shorter
superpermutation

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.500
for seven symbols.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.120
It's like 5,907 symbols long.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.620
They just pasted it in
as a YouTube comment.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.280
Like, no fanfare,
just here it is, boom.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.100
And I'm, like, wow!

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.910
So new mathematics happened
in the comment section

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:32.290
of my video.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:33.940
But then, based on
those breakthroughs,

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:35.080
because there were
people working on it,

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.470
got in touch with the
person who did it.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:37.240
And they had a bit of a chat.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.970
And some other stuff they were
working on kind of meshed up.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.560
And they found one even shorter.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.550
They had another breakthrough.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.925
And we're, like, well, how
are we going to announce this?

00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:47.420
And then we realized, basically,
this one was one shorter.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.332
So it was 5,706 symbols.

00:50:50.332 --> 00:50:52.040
But there's only seven
different symbols.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.832
And we're, like, well,
an octave on a piano

00:50:53.832 --> 00:50:55.210
has seven notes, right?

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:59.620
Eh, music-- and so we
hired a self-playing piano.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.770
And the first ever announcement
of this mathematical result

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:04.725
was played on a grand piano.

00:51:04.725 --> 00:51:06.100
And I was, like,
that's just fun.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.440
Like why?

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.340
And if you support
me on Patreon,

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.530
that's how I waste your money.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:15.430
And so I'm just trying do fun
things to enrich nerd culture,

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.430
I think, is the
shortest way to put it.

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:21.340
Channels like Three Blue One
Brown I'm super envious of.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:25.030
Because they guy, Grant
runs Three Blue One Brown,

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:33.460
he's a fantastic individual
And maths YouTuber community

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.020
is super friendly
and nice, right?

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.160
And so I know Grant
reasonably well.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.868
He's a great guy.

00:51:36.868 --> 00:51:40.020
And we chat and nerd
out on mathematics.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.450
And one day we'll actually
both do a collaboration

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:44.640
we keep talking about.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.808
But he's incredible at animating
advanced mathematical causes.

00:51:47.808 --> 00:51:50.350
I'm super envious that he can
take these more advanced things

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.290
I would like to do and he can
actually make them happen.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.390
And I struggle.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:57.220
His visualizations
are incredible,

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.730
and my visuals are adequate.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.200
That's my career.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.580
And I do so many
different things

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.290
that I don't have as much time.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:07.613
I can't justify too
much time, because I

00:52:07.613 --> 00:52:09.280
make a loss on my
channel, as it stands.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.600
I can't justify too much time.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.760
I throw a lot of time at
it, don't get me wrong.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.260
Right?

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:17.133
But doing difficult
advanced maths well,

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.550
so it's still
engaging-- and there

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:23.400
are other channels like Red
Pen, Black Pen, and obviously,

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.020
Khan Academy, and
these other channels

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.300
who are doing more
advanced maths in much

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.650
more of a lecturing style.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:32.110
They're great, and they kind
of already feel that niche.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:36.200
So I stay at the low
hanging, entertaining fruit--

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.192
the most concise description
of my job I've ever made.

00:52:39.192 --> 00:52:40.900
We'll do one more
question, and then I'll

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:45.050
loiter around afterwards
to say hi and deface books.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.353
Oh, we're forming a queue.

00:52:47.353 --> 00:52:48.020
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.280
Were you in the queue?

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.238
MATT PARKER: No,
you got there first.

00:52:51.238 --> 00:52:51.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.988
MATT PARKER: We'll hear both
of them, and we'll vote.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.890
AUDIENCE: So in this
company, as you may know,

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.690
we have quite a strong
postmortem culture.

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:04.780
So when stuff goes wrong,
we write postmortems

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.680
with the main goal to learn from
them and not repeat mistakes.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.240
Entertainment value
is kind of secondary.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.140
And given that you've
spent quite a lot of time,

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:18.820
apparently, to look into some
of these things that went wrong,

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.260
did you find a commonality?

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:25.130
What's kind of the big learning
to take from those, other

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:27.328
than don't do this?

00:53:27.328 --> 00:53:29.120
MATT PARKER: That's a
really good question.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:34.240
And do the postmortems done at
Google ever get made public,

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.020
or are they entirely
internal, locks down?

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:39.270
Sometimes?

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.782
OK.

00:53:39.782 --> 00:53:40.490
It's interesting.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:42.040
It's interesting how
much things [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.630
So I've got two
answers, which are

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:46.300
I'll try and do pretty swiftly.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:50.560
One answer is it's interesting
which industries do and don't

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.500
make their postmortems public.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.200
And so there's a sampling
bias that I have of the ones

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.370
I'm able to see.

00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:00.290
And I know of ones that have
happened in other industries.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.050
But I cannot put
them in the book,

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:03.700
because I only know about
them because I know the people

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.200
involved.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.250
And there is no way
they can release them.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.005
And I talk about
a friend of mine--

00:54:08.005 --> 00:54:09.910
let me think about how
vague I have to be.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.490
They worked on a project
which was a thing.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.930
And there was a trivial mistake,
which slightly changed it

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.250
aesthetically.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.770
And I was, like, this
is such a good example.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:23.260
Because the maths
mistake is lovely.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.290
The result is lovely and
funny, but not important.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.630
And nothing is
actually compromised.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.050
And it's a contemporary one, and
no one died, and all the things

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:35.630
I look for in just my life.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:39.190
And I was like, hey, can I put
the story in that you told me

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.390
that time in the pub?

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:41.860
And they were, like, no way.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:46.070
They're still under so many NDAs
that they cannot disclose what

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:46.570
happened.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:50.140
And so it'll often feel like,
when you're reading my book,

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.100
lots of the examples come from
the military or government

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.680
or things that
were quite obvious.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.620
So actually, you have a
lot of engineering ones

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:03.065
where either it was
an organization who

00:55:03.065 --> 00:55:04.690
have some duty to
the public to release

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:07.450
a certain level of report
into what happened,

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.820
or it was so big and so obvious
that a report had to come out.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.400
And so I've kind
of got a problem

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.858
where I only get a lot of the
public ones I can talk about.

00:55:14.858 --> 00:55:18.040
In terms of what I've actually
learned, what I found amazing

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.920
is the different attitude
between different industries

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.230
to blaming the human.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.960
And in aviation, they
don't blame the human.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.120
In medicine, they
blame the human.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.250
And there are loads of others
in both categories, right?

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:32.740
But they're just
my two favorites.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.260
And aviation are
great at looking

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:40.030
at the system as a whole and why
the mistakes became disasters.

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.982
And there's the Swiss cheese
model of accident prevention.

00:55:42.982 --> 00:55:44.440
People have come
across this, which

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.995
is where you imagine your
mistakes as being projectiles,

00:55:46.995 --> 00:55:48.370
and they're going
through a bunch

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.140
of layers of Swiss cheese.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.020
And each layer is like a
different part or component

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.070
of the system.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.210
And each one is meant
to stop mistakes.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:59.020
And so ideally, the mistake
will hit one of these.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.587
But occasionally,
the holes line up,

00:56:00.587 --> 00:56:02.170
and a mistake will
make it all the way

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.720
through the entire system
and become a disaster.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.900
And aviation is big on
and this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.230
I don't think that
came out of aviation.

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.772
It was actually research from
the UK that came out with that.

00:56:10.772 --> 00:56:13.898
But it's a big one for aviation,
the Swiss cheese model.

00:56:13.898 --> 00:56:15.190
And it's the system as a whole.

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:17.230
Whereas in medicine,
if you give someone

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.140
the wrong dose of a certain
drug, if you're, I think,

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.790
as a pharmacist or something,
that's actually illegal.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.760
And so that's not
encouraging people

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.730
to discuss when it's gone
wrong if you make the mistake

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:30.290
and you're arrested, or
fired, or all these things.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:34.630
And so you get this false
sense of the only people left

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:36.850
in medicine are the people
who never made mistakes.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:39.280
And that's not good for
teaching the next generation.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.020
It's not good for developing
systems that deal with it.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.090
And so I think that
is fascinating.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.120
And then there's a
whole other category

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.810
of when the safety features
you put in place cause

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.442
a new type of mistake.

00:56:51.442 --> 00:56:52.900
And there's some
great researchers,

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.550
a group called
ChiMed, who are based

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.290
at Queen Mary University of
London, where I used to work.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.130
It's a great place.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:01.330
And they looked at
the hot cheese model,

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.190
where they imagined horizontal
slices of cheese, which

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:06.580
occasionally, the pieces
of cheese themselves might

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.000
drip and cause extra mistakes.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.950
And in medicine, they
found if they bring

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.900
in a new system of barcodes--

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.850
so you've got to scan
the patient's barcode

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:19.120
and scan the medication
barcode to stop mistakes when

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.920
they get the wrong medication.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.450
They discovered
when it was actually

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.660
implemented staff would
just get duplicate barcodes

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.265
and stick them on their
clipboard to scan patients,

00:57:28.265 --> 00:57:29.140
because it's quicker.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.973
Or they'll have a bunch
up in the storeroom.

00:57:30.973 --> 00:57:35.080
And so there were new ways of
giving the wrong medicine now,

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.580
because of a system
to stop people

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.872
from giving the wrong medicine.

00:57:37.872 --> 00:57:38.800
It's just fascinating.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:44.740
So blaming the individual
versus looking at the system

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.420
and also the intricacies of
the system I find fascinating.

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.940
I don't know how
much that meshes up

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:54.010
with what happens here
at generic tech company,

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:58.120
but that's just how anonymous
I can make your stories if you

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.420
see me afterwards.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.370
So we'll wrap up there.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.510
I will be around.

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.828
I would love to talk
and chat for a bit,

00:58:06.828 --> 00:58:08.620
if people want to come
and tell me stories.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.078
Or I'll sign your
books, et cetera.

00:58:10.078 --> 00:58:13.750
Is there any more official
business to be done?

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:14.280
We're done.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.410
At which point, I thank you so
much for having me along, it's

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:17.520
always a treat, I'm done.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.270
[APPLAUSE]
