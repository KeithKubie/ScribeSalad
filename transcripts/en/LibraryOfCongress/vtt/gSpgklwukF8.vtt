00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.750
I'm Guy Lamolinara and I work
at the Library of Congress

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.410
in a Division appropriately
called the Center for the Book.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.720
All day here at the Library

importance of reading

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280
and authors and books.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.350
The Library of Congress
makes it seem easy

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.680
to do this each and every year.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.590
But the truth is the National
Festival, Book Festival,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.620
is a huge undertaking.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.600
It is a huge financial
undertaking but it is free

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.120
for everyone thanks

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.720

Please welcome David Ezra Stein.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.530
[applause]

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.830
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein:
Hey everybody.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.130
Thank you, Guy.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.860
[applause] It's nice to be back
at the National Book Festival.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.230
I was here when my first
chicken book came out,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.030
Interrupting Chicken.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.660
That was some years ago
and that was a lot of fun.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.570
So I'm looking forward to
celebrating this new book,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.280
Interrupting Chicken and
the Elephant of Surprise.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120
So we're going to read
the story together.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.640
I'm going to get kind of messy
and do some painting up here.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.260
Maybe you've seen people
drawing but I don't know

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.200
if you've seen anybody
using acrylic paint up here.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.320
We're going to get
colorful and messy.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.850
So how's your summer
going, everybody?

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.150
It's the end of the summer.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.050
You guys having a good time?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.650
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein:
Is anybody back

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.950
in school yet, back in school?

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.250
Oh man, ok.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.550
Well that's exciting.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.190
Anybody just started
kindergarten?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.390
Yeah, wow.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.980
My daughter is five and she's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.490
about to start kindergarten
next week.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.160
So I am probably more
nervous than she is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.170
so I'm not really
showing that to her.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.630
I'm trying to keep
that to myself.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.730
But I think she's going
to have a good time.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.240
But when I, you know, when
I was in kindergarten that's

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.820
when I learned to read.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.480
And it was already halfway

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.390
through kindergarten
before I knew how to read

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.950
and I remember trying to read
a book over the winter break

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.900
and it was about a moose who
finds an egg and he tries

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.560
to raise it until it hatches.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.730
And I was reading the whole book

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.750
but there was this one
word I couldn't get.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.050
I just couldn't figure it out.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.350
It was too complicated.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.360
It started with a Ch and I
just couldn't figure it out.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.410
It had all these letters in it.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.470
The last letter was an n. Can
anybody guess what the word was

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.510
that I couldn't read?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.530
Yeah, I could not read
this word chicken,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.440
actually it was chickens
because the chickens come back

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.190
to get their egg from
the moose at the end,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.490
I think that was how it went.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.170
It's been a long time
since I read that book.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.160
So I finally just memorized the
word chickens and when I got

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.390
to the part of the book that
said chickens I said chickens.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.300
And then I knew how to
read and it was fantastic.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.460
And I could go to my school
library, I was very lucky to go

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.170
to my school library and just
walk in and nobody bothered me.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.960
I could just go take a book,
whatever book looked interesting

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.260
to me, and just read it and
nobody asked any questions,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.230
as far as I remember, it
was just me and the book.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.370
And so I wish that for
all of you and I hope

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.730
that you have a great time
in your school library

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.960
and reading with your parents.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.460
So I'd like to read you
Interrupting Chicken

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.950
and the Elephant of Surprise
by David Ezra Stein, me.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.230
[laughter] Ok so the cover
says Interrupting Chicken

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.750
and the Elephant of
Surprise, what a surprise.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.270
Chicken, there are no
elephants in this book.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.300
And then see in the
corner there?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.350
Who's that little guy
going hee, hee, hee, hee?

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.970
An elephant.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.780
Wow this works, ok.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.170
Let's see, so Interrupting
Chicken

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.010
and the Elephant of Surprise.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.720
Interrupting Chicken
and the Elephant

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.700
of Surprise, I said
that already.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.350
Oh man but anyway you can see
that this is the chicken's home,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.970
her porch and then you can
see the school bus coming

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.660
to drop her off, right?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.620
And all the interesting
things that you can look

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.160
at when you look at the book.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.520
It was after school for
the little red chicken.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.820
Well chicken, said poppa,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.370
did you have a good
day at school today?

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.660
Yes, poppa, and today my teacher
told us every story has an

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.450
elephant of surprise.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.960
So let's read a story and
we'll find the elephant.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.540
Chicken, she wasn't
talking about an elephant,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.730
she was talking about
an element of surprise.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.230
What's an element of surprise?

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.200
It's the part of the story that
makes you say woe, I didn't know

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.550
that was going to
happen, said poppa.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.810
An elephant in a story
always makes me say woe.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.160
So please let's read
a story together.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.020
Alright fine but I don't expect
you'll find any elephants

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.660
in this story.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.070
The ugly duckling, oh man this
is going to be tough to read.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.740
[laughter] I think
my eyes are dried up.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.700
Ok, after a long, lonely winter

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.200
in the cave the ugly duckling
was growing desperate.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.500
I don't care if they
tear me to pieces.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.730
I must be near those glorious
creatures for just one moment,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.220
he said, as he flung himself
toward the flock of swans.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.570
To his amazement the
graceful birds did not attack

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.780
or tease him but seemed to
except him as one of their own.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.740
He peered into the water at his
reflection, gasped and said,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.200
surprise, I'm an elephant.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.850
Thank you for finding me.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.300
No problem, we learned
about you in school.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.830
Chicken, there are no
elephants in the Ugly Duckling.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.120
Every good story has one,
that's what my teacher said.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.260
That's ridiculous.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.460
Is the Ugly Duckling
a good story?

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.980
Well yes but, then it must
have an elephant of surprise.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.280
Let's try another book.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.250
Rapunzel, enchanted

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:58.150
by Rapunzel's beautiful singing
the prince drew near the tower.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.540
He had waited for this night.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.400
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, he
called, let down your hair.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.930
Silently a braid of Rapunzel's
hair slid down the tower wall.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.890
Come to me my prince, called
a melodious voice above.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.950
With all haste the
prince began to climb.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.300
When he reached Rapunzel
he gazed at his love

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.980
and she said surprise,
I'm an elephant.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.910
[laughter] You've done it again.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.090
You're welcome.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.640
Chicken, I know there is
no elephant in Rapunzel,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.850
that's just plain ludicrous.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.760
Don't you feel sorry
for the elephant, poppa?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.480
All alone waiting for
someone to find him.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.210
Read another story and we'll
find the poor elephant.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.890
Chicken this is silly.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.190
It's my homework.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.000
Ms. Gizzard said
to read three books

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.990
and find the elephant
in all of them.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:03.890
Ok, poppa said, here comes
another story with no elephant.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.550
The Little Mermaid, already
the mermaid could feel the sea

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.220
which is potent working,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.980
soon with her new legs she
would dance with the prince

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.370
and he would fall
in love with her.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.070
As she crawled out of the waves
a sharp pain passed through her.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.110
She fell to the steps of the
palace and knew only darkness.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.380
When she woke the prince
himself was standing over her.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.360
In the moonlight she saw
that her wish had come true.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.790
She finally did have
legs, elephant legs.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.630
Wow, that was a surprise.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.610
I know. Well chicken,
are you happy?

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.720
You put an elephant in every
story but now I'm going

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.370
to tell you a story and
I'll make sure there are

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.220
no elephants.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.830
Ok poppa and I'll
draw the pictures.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.140
Poppa's story, by poppa, hi,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.010
once there was a poppa whose
daughter loved elephants

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.050
and she thought she
saw them everywhere

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.270
but there were no elephants.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.890
Every day he got her dressed

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.430
but there were no
elephants in the dresser.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.150
Every day he fixed her breakfast

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.480
but there were no elephants
in the refrigerator.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.160
And every day he packed
her off to elephant school,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.510
ta da, hi, hop in chicken.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:35.560
[ Crowd noise ]

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.010
Oh poppa, I knew there'd be
an elephant in the story.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.120
So did I, somehow, said poppa.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.290
And it was right at the
end, said the chicken.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.450
What a great surprise.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.620
Are we done, chicken?

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.920
Yes, poppa.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.530
Now you can help me
with my math homework.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.300
Because that's the end
of Interrupting Chicken

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.350
and the Elephant of Surprise.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.900
[applause] Ta da, thank you.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.000
So how are we for time?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.320
Ok good, we have
some time to do,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.880
I was going to just show you
how I paint an illustration

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.750
but I thought maybe I'd
try something a little more

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.500
interesting and try to tell
you a story while I do it

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.800
at the same time.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.140
So I've never tried this before.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.040
This is, this may fail.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.250
Things might blow up.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.300
I don't know.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.600
We'll find out.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.200
But artists like to take
chances and try new things.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.370
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.880
So I have my acrylic,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.460
I have some acrylic paints
here, nice and colorful.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.790
So I'm going to tell you a
little story about a sea worm,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.530
worm that lived in the sea.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:01.910
There was a sea worm who
went up on top of a cliff

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.700
to take a look at the ocean.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.050
Ok so there's the sea worm.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.940
She went on top of a very
tall and skinny cliff to peek

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.890
over the edge and see
what she could see.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.380
There she is, skinny
cliff there.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:40.630
Now all of a sudden
somebody threw a football

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.430
and it got stuck in the cliff.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:51.180
[noise] There's the football and
it's stuck in the cliff, right?

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.890
I'm waiting to see if
anybody is picking up on this.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:03.110
[laughter] Ok, hm, some
people are chuckling a bit.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:11.020
Now all of a sudden
a big boat came

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.630
and it crashed into the cliff.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:22.790
[noise] Boat came, blue boat,
crashed into the cliff, right?

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.250
And it made, I have to
keep changing colors here.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:36.950
And when that happened
it made a big splash.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.040
[noise] So the big
splash happened.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.670
[laughter] What are you
talking about chickens?

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.290
There's no chicken here.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.910
Didn't you pay attention
to the story?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.070
This story is about
a worm, a sea worm.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.550
[laughter] You want to
hear more of the story?

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.760
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein: Ok then
the, so then the boat decided

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.420
to try and escape from the
cliff so they put up their sail,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:15.170
put up a sail on top of the
boat and that didn't work.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:24.680
So that didn't work so they
had to put out some oars.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.060
Here are the oars,
put out some oars.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.410
A couple of oars came out.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.480
And they had to push
against the rocks.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.370
They pushed against these
two big rocks to get out of,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.390
to get away from the cliff.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.920
[laughter] Wait a minute,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.940
you know I think it looks
a little like a chicken.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.240
That's so weird.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.940
I had no idea that
was going to happen.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:02.220
And then the worm, well the
worm said this spot is too busy

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.640
so it ran away, ran down the
cliff and started to escape

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.020
from this wacky place.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.080
[laughter] Alright
you know what?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.380
I mean you're right.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.810
It does kind of look
like a chicken

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:23.390
so maybe I should
put an eye on it

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.060
and then a little
dot inside the eye.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.530
That's a good idea.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:37.570
Good thing I brought some
of this white paint here

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.930
so I can paint the
chicken's eye.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:50.830
And I wish I had some black
paint but I don't have that.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:59.240
So I have a black marker,
it's a paint marker.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.090
We'll see if it can cover up
the top of the white paint.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.680
Maybe I'll make a
little space for it here.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.200
And we'll put some black
in there and there we go

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:19.510
and we'll do a little
smile, surprise.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:25.510

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:37.750

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.050
Surprise, I'm a chicken.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.520
[applause] Oh so I
have plenty of time.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.070
I didn't plan anything else

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.900
but do you guys have
questions you want to ask?

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.790
Yes, how about you?

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.510
That's a comfy beanbag
you have there.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:09.360
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.040
So she knew like pretty early

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.830
on that it was going
to be a chicken.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.800
That's very good detective work.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.300
Yeah, how about you?

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.600
Nice and loud, ok?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.530
[inaudible audience question]
How long did it take?

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:30.100
How long did it take me to make
that book, Interrupting Chicken

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.400
and the Elephant of Surprise?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.650
Well the first one came out
in 2010 so this one's coming

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.220
out now so it took, in a
way it took like eight years

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.650
or seven years to make.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.060
But really just working on the
artwork took about eight months

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.940
to do all those details and
the background and figure

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.840
out what the elephant
was going to look like.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.960
I could paint you an
elephant if you'd like.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.240
This time I can't pretend
that it's not an elephant.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.260
It's just going to be a boring,
old, straightforward painting.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.950
Now would anybody like
to take, it's very messy

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.310
so parents you have to be ok

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:22.260
with [laughter] Ok it's
wet so just be careful.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.650
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.340
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein: Don't
get it on yourself, ok?

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.490
Maybe give it to mom.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.260
Here you want me to, I'll
just hold it here for you.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.300
&gt;&gt; My nickname is chicken.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.780
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein:
I'll put it over here.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.100
And you can come
collect it at the end.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.060
So for the elephant
in this story I had

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.790
to pick a character that's
very cute and mischievous

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.970
and well he doesn't have any
clothes on because he has

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:58.400
to change into all the different
costumes for each story.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.280
So I decided to make an elephant

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.170
that looks kind of
like a toddler.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.970
Does anybody know a toddler,
have a toddler in their life?

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.220
So they're kind of short
and they have a big head

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.190
and they have a cute
belly button, right?

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.530
And they have short
legs usually.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.690
So that's what I decided
to do for my elephant.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.730
And it took me a long
time to get the ears

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.510
but the ears are this nice like
teardrop upside down shape.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.930
[ Crowd noise ]

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.530
Just the ear, I should
make up a story about this.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.950
There were two raindrops
that decided

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.070
to go up instead of down.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.380
Hey, look at that.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.310
And then they found a puddle.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.240
They fell in a big puddle.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.630
And they said oh
wow, look at that,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.790
there's more water
up here in the sky.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:08.980
But then some of the water
decided to turn into a river.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:19.080
Woo. And then, oh man, then
like a lot of the water started

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:26.720
to leak down, back down to earth
and it grew a belly button.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:36.300
[laughter] It had to have
been in the little metaphor.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.750
[laughter] Wow, looks
really weird on the screen.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:45.150
It's very wet so I guess there's
a lot of light reflecting on it.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.070
It looks kind of cool.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.460
And then the elephant has
these stumpy legs here.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:04.660
Do ta do, a little tail.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:18.590
He has long arms, actually.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.160
My nephew looks exactly
like this elephant.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.850
He's an unusual kid, no
but he has a big head

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.950
and he has short legs
and he's really cute.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.990
So and the elephant
has, I think it's four

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:38.020
or five hairs on
top of its head.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.920
And the elephant is not
complete without eyebrows

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.600
because eyebrows
are very expressive

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.880
so I decided to give
it eyebrows.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.290
Eyebrows are very important.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:03.400
So he has one, two,
three, four, five hairs.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.510
He has eyebrows.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.870
I forget if he has tusks or not.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.940
Oh well. I think little
elephants don't have tusks

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.180
yet so I didn't give him tusks.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.570
And we'll do

00:22:53.570 --> 00:23:05.820

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.510

[ Crowd noise ]

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.430
Now for this character he's
all blue so I use a little bit

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:33.120
of lines to make his
trunk pop out and his arms

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.220
and legs and I use black.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:41.510
And all kinds of,
there's all kinds

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.950
of blues inside the elephant
if you look in the book,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.450
lots of different
colors of blue.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.160
Ok, oh really?

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.230
Ok and then he has
little hairs on the tip

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.110
of his tail, four little hairs.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.950
So that's the elephant.

characters, two main characters.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.430
So we have time for
one question.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.650
We have less time then I thought

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.650
but let's pick somebody
from down here.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.950
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.250
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein:
How about you?

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.650
&gt;&gt; How did you get the
idea to create a father

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.700
and a tiny chicken to
read a bedtime story?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.030
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein: How did
I get the idea of a father

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.450
and a tiny chicken
reading stories together?

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.950
Well there's a knock knock joke.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.830
Knock knock?

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.130
&gt;&gt; [unison] Who's there?

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.430
&gt;&gt; David Ezra Stein:

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.430
Interrupting chicken,
bock, bock, bock.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.690
So I heard this knock knock
joke and I thought well

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.600
who is this little chicken

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.130
and what's the rest
of her life like?

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.330
What does she do when she's
not interrupting knocking

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.630
on somebody's door?

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.940
And so that's where the whole
world of the chicken came about.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.900
And I hope you enjoy the
second book very much.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.200
I'll be signing books

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.800
in a little while,
at 12:30 I believe.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.210
So I hope I see you there.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.760
Thanks, you've been
a wonderful audience.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.110
Thank you very much.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.110
