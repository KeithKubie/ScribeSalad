that spells trouble for libraries in an
interesting and challenging way what's a

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560
interesting and challenging way what's a
 

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.440
interesting and challenging way what's a
library to do in this kind of

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:56.450
library to do in this kind of
 

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.050
library to do in this kind of
environment where the ability to produce

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.060
environment where the ability to produce
 

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.389
environment where the ability to produce
content has been democratized the

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399
content has been democratized the
 

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:04.180
content has been democratized the
ability to access content is assumed

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.190
ability to access content is assumed
 

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.360
ability to access content is assumed
also to be widely distributed and very

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.370
also to be widely distributed and very
 

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:12.490
also to be widely distributed and very
democratized as well so one thing that

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:12.500
democratized as well so one thing that
 

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.750
democratized as well so one thing that
libraries have done is they've become

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760
libraries have done is they've become
 

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.019
libraries have done is they've become

also another really interesting thing
about this shot is that you see people

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279
about this shot is that you see people
 

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.490
about this shot is that you see people
working together in a very collaborative
