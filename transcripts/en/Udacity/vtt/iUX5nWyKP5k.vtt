00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.687
We spent quite a while on the last inequality. So let's move on to a new one, x

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:09.013
squared plus 2x minus 35 is less than or equal to 0. Remember that the way we

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:13.560
started out with the last inequality was to factor the expression over here. So

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.180
please factor the left side and then rewrite the entire inequality in this box.
