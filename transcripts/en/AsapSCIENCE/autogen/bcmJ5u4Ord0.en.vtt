00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.440
 Our planet is amazing. 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.420
 Swirling around the sun at a high speed of 107,218 km / h, the speed of Durana is considered 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.360
 Great for its size - the weight of the Earth's mass 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.369
 According to the calculations of 5,972,190,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (five subtilis, nine hundred and seventy-two stencils 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.460
 And ninety-one quintillion kilos). 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.109
 Although the planet is always losing or gaining a mass 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.949
 We estimate the amount of global dust attracted by gravity by about 40,000 tons 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.320
 Where the earth acts as a giant broom - this dust acts as a remnant of the solar system, and crashes asteroids, and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.410
 Materials that did not turn into planets. 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 But we lose a large amount of mass due to gases (emitted from the ground) 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.580
 Hydrogen is a light gas emitted to the atmosphere at an average rate 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.530
 3 kg per second - equivalent to 95,000 tons per year. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.989
 But what about us? 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.670
 The population reached 5 billion in 1987, now estimated at 7.6 billion people! 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.859
 Do our bodies and everything we put on the surface of the planet affect a mass 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.219
 Our planet? 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.070
 No, because we are made up of matter that already exists on the planet. 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.260
 This article is an atom - 118 different species have been identified (elements) 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.820
 But there are 3 elements that make up 90% of our composition: oxygen (65%), carbon (18.5%), and hydrogen 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 (9.5%) 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.640
 Two of them are important for life: water. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.830
 The oceans account for about 70% of the planet. 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.320
 At the deepest point the marina trench is 10,994 m - if placed 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 Mount Everest base at the bottom of the ditch, the summit will reach 1.6 km 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.510
 Underwater. 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.820
 A large part of the ocean is still unknown - only 5% of it may be detected. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.530
 We may be able, with greater knowledge, to understand how the Dead Sea Octopus (Granilidon Boriopasivalica) 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 Eggs for the longest recorded period (pregnancy). 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.720
 This requires the mother to take more than 160 eggs to plant in Monterey Bay 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.220
 And protect them for 53 months without eating throughout this period, and still do not know how 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.200
 Survived throughout this period. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 Although it is clear that there are animals with distinctive characteristics such as cats and dogs, 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.940
 But many scholars have rejected this idea. 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.700
 There are now approved surveys to measure the distinctive chimpanzees 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 Resulting from natural selection. 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.480
 All this happens on the earth's crust, which amounts to only 1% of 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.460
 The size of the land. 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.520
 There are many forms of life on Earth.
