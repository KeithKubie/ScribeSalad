00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] And the simplest way to do that is just ask if the absolute value of the difference

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
rather than the positive or negative value is equal to 1.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But an alternative way to say it if you wanted to break it down in terms of the other primitive,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you could say that nextto (h1, h2) is defined as immediate right of h1, h2

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or immediate right of h2, h1.
