00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.150
I can't imagine what it would be like to find out

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.900
that your relative isn't actually as closely related as you once thought.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; I thought so too, until I actually participated in 23andMe myself.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Wait, did you find a relative?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.310
&gt;&gt; Amazingly, I discovered that I have a half

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.450
sister living all the way across the country from me.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.910
&gt;&gt; Seriously?

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And she had been searching for her biological faimly for a long time.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.800
And when we both participated in 23andMe, That's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.390
how we discovered that we shared a father.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.600
You're a real-life example of this actually

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.080
working. It's really cool to know that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.040
people can find their relatives even when

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.850
they're not necessarily looking. You weren't, right?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750
&gt;&gt; It's true. And I think it's time that we actually went to check

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.310
in on our friend Sterling and see

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.730
how he's doing on his biological family search.
