00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:06.850
PHILIP TAN: So when
students come into class

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.720
on their first day,
they usually expect

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.590
to walk in and start working
on their dream game right away,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.360
and that's just not
going to happen.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.940
They have a lot to learn.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.442
Simply to learn about working
with their teammates--

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.900
figure out who else
is in the class

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.720
and what skills
they bring to bear.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.150
And chances are
they haven't really

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.940
thought all that much
about the game design

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.070
that they want to make.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.837
And usually their
very first idea,

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:33.170
the idea that you've been
nursing ever since high school

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.970
or something, isn't the best
idea for a single semester

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.565
project.

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:39.940
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
Students often

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.996
want to make the big
expansive epic RPG.

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:45.370
We get a lot of
students who want

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.400
to make the next Legend
of Zelda-- maybe trying

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.152
to remake Skyrim
but in 2D, and they

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:53.110
think they're scoping it
down, but they're not.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.440
So it's one of the
first things we're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.170
doing-- especially the first
couple weeks of the class--

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110
are just getting
them to understand

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.580
what is the scope of the game
development project, but also

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.760
just getting them to
understand how difficult it

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.370
is to work in a team.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.440
How much effort an
individual needs

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
to put forward in order to work
efficiently as part of a team,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.420
especially when it comes to
a creative thing like game

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
development and game design.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.220
A lot of students want to
make their personal project.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.730
And the first thing
they need to do

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.397
is realize that there are
other opinions on the team that

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:31.230
should be respected.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.690
And there are some
opinions that are

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.690
going to be stronger
because there's more design

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.590
experience there.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.000
So figuring out how
to balance those teams

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.102
is a big, big step for them
to take when they start.

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:42.560
SARA VERRILLI: The
biggest thing we

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.190
want them to learn
when they come in

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.470
and take the course
is how to work

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.820
as a group on a
creative project.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.120
Almost everybody's worked
on creative project before.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.100
People have worked
in groups before,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.660
but working on a project where
the group together is setting

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.106
the goal and the goal is fluid.

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:03.480
Because, with a
creative project,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.100
with a game design
project, what you're making

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.990
is always evolving as
you keep working on it.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.210
And so being able to, as a
group, discuss those changes,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.080
acknowledge those
changes, work together

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.550
to get to something that
everybody wants to work on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.550
and everybody is
capable of working on,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.240
and you are all capable of
getting done in the very

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.090
short amount of time you have to
work on these complex projects.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.480
That's actually one
of our biggest goals.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.080
PHILIP TAN: One thing
about creative projects

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.885
is there aren't right answers.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:36.260
There are a lot
of different ways

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.456
that a project can go
when you are basically

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.330
just trying to create
an aesthetic experience

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.150
for the players.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.000
And so multiple people
with different viewpoints

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.140
can all be right
at the same time.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.200
And it's not like you're
designing a machine

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.210
to solve a specific problem,
and if the problem is solved,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.500
you know that you've
done your job.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.990
And this can lead to a lot of
ego and clashes and arguments

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.710
over basically something that is
already difficult to implement.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.160
And every time you get
into those arguments,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.570
you are actually
taking time away

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.930
from the actual
development of the game.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.410
RICHARD EBERHARDT: We try to
give the students the tools

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.130
and methods they can use if
they have an argument to provide

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.900
evidence for the argument.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.320
And often it comes down to
testing out ideas, rather than

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.150
having those
discussions as a team.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.104
Using prototyping methods,
using either paper--

00:03:34.104 --> 00:03:36.520
if they just got the paper
right there before they've even

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.370
written code.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.970
Just throw something on paper,
get another person look at it,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.610
and then to see,
did it work or not?

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.860
Getting away from
having the personalities

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.460
involved, getting
away from having ego

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.720
involved in all this.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.140
For first-time designers, for
the students that we have,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140
if they don't have the
evidence, the first thing

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.286
they're going to go back to it
is personal ego, which is not

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:04.410
the way to do these things.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.780
It will just cause further
problems down the line.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.570
SARA VERRILLI: So
the course is overall

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.700
organized with four projects.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.079
All of our work is group work
because we are emphasizing

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.510
how do you work
together on a team

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.160
to solve a creative problem.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.260
All of our projects
are group projects.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.800
And we grade
primarily as a group.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.280
Our projects start from very
small and scale up to big.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.400
So we have our
opening project, which

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.640
is just doing a paper
prototype-- even

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.850
a fraction of a paper
prototype-- not a full game.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.830
It's just what are the
main actions in the game?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.070
And that's about a
two-week project.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.520
And then we build up to,
OK, you've got a prototype.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.590
Form a new group, a
bigger group this time,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.870
about double our group in
size from three to six,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.740
and turn that into
a digital game.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.180
For the third project, you, once
again, have that two-week time

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.940
period, but during
the second project,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.880
we taught you our basic
project management

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.490
schemes and some
project management

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.580
skills-- using that second
project as an example of how

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.519
to do that.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:09.060
And on the third
project we're asking

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.210
you to come up with your
own game design idea,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.230
prototype it out, and
finish it as a group using

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.410
all those project management
techniques that we taught.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.280
It's sort of our
test run project

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.570
for the fourth project,
which is the final project.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.690
It lasts, I think,
seven and a half weeks,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.529
and we double the group
size again up to eight.

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.570
We are actually intentionally
giving the students

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.629
large groups that are
harder to work with.

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.920
And their first thought is
"we've got all these people,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.630
we can make a huge project."

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.154
And our response is "you've
got all these people.

00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:48.570
You're going to
have to figure out

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.653
how you're all going to
communicate well together,

00:05:50.653 --> 00:05:53.570
so you can actually
get something done."

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.140
And that's sort of
the final capstone

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.014
project where we give
them a fairly tight set

00:05:57.014 --> 00:05:57.810
of constraints.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.920
But other than that, they
are designing the design.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.830
They're planning out
the project management.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.360
They're in charge of planning
their testing sessions

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.000
and their polishing sessions.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.650
And we use that time
to check in with them

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.640
and give them feedback
along the way.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.000
But it really is like,
OK, we've given you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.750
the tools, time to really
practice using them.
