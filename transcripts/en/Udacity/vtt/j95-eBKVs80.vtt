00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.520
So, to set the initial linear velocity, we simply pass it a vector two object.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.912
Now, for our simple projectile, we have a little bit of nuance here, because,

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:11.304
what happens is, once the projectile is created, we pass it in a directional x

00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:14.643
and y, representing the vector of travel for this projectile alongside its

00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:21.010
speed object. So this basically says, move this direction this much per frame.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.850
Now again, we've set this as the initial linear velocity on the physics body.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.474
And of course, once the first update loop happens, we'll actually remove the

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:29.934
velocity from the object, and we need to set it again inside of the update

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.670
function. We set it to the same value, the same speed.
