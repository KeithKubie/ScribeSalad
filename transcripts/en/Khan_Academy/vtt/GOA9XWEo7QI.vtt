00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.307
- So I have some example questions here

00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:03.998
from Khan Academy on arc measure.

00:00:03.998 --> 00:00:05.839
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.167
after you see each of these questions,

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:09.333
and try to solve them before I do.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:11.918
So this first question says
what is the arc measure,

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:15.651
in degrees, of arc AC on circle P below.

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:17.965
So this is point A,

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:19.887
that is point C,

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.921
and when they're talking about arc AC,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.509
since they only have two letters here,

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.543
we can assume that it's
going to be the minor arc.

00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:26.574
When we talk about the minor arc.

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.055
There's two potential arcs that
connect point A and point C.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.591
There's the one here on the left,

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.764
and then there's the one,

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:36.881
there is the one on the right.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.450
And since C isn't exactly
straight down from A,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.843
it's a little bit to the right,

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.682
the shorter arc,

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:46.772
the arc with the smaller length,

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:48.443
or the minor arc is going to be this one

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:51.006
that I'm depicting here
right on the right.

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:54.294
So what is this arc measure going to be?

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.220
Well, the measure of
this arc is going to be

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.425
exactly the same thing as, in degrees,

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:03.767
as the measure of the central
angle that intercepts the arc.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:06.859
So that central angle, let me
do it in a different color,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.753
I'll do it in this blue color,

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:13.294
that central angle is angle C, P, A.

00:01:14.187 --> 00:01:17.084
Angle C, P, A, and the
measure of that central angle

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:20.537
is going to be 70
degrees plus 104 degrees.

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:22.962
It's going to be this whole
thing right over there.

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.273
So it's going to be 174 degrees.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:29.090
One hundred and seventy four degrees,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.098
that's the arc measure,
in degrees, of arc AC.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:33.853
Let's keep doing these.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.160
So let me do another one.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:36.780
So,

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:40.488
this next one asks us,

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:42.378
in the figure below,

00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:45.188
in the figure below, segment AD--

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.052
so this is point A,

00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:48.815
this is point D,

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.711
so segment AD is this one right over here.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.103
Let me see if I can draw that.

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:56.137
That's AD right over there,

00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:59.925
AD and CE are diameters of the circle.

00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:01.486
So let me draw CE,

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:04.022
so CE is,

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:07.170
we're going to connect point C and E.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.898
These are diameters.

00:02:08.898 --> 00:02:10.681
So, let me,

00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.850
so they go straight.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.107
Whoops, I'm using the
wrong tool, let me...

00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:16.280
So those are, somehow I should,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.537
alright.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:21.546
So, those are di--

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.859
whoops, how did that happen?

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.976
So let me, somehow my pen got

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:29.205
really big, alright.

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:31.880
That'll be almost there, ok.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.670
So CE, there you go.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.235
So those are both
diameters of the circle P.

00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:44.307
What is the arc measure of
AB, of arc AB in degrees?

00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:47.288
So arc AB, once again
there's two potential arcs

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.128
that connect point A and B.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:52.107
There's the minor arc,

00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:53.361
and since this only has two letters

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:54.615
we'll assume it's the minor arc.

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.398
It's going to be this one over here.

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:57.792
There's a major arc,

00:02:57.792 --> 00:02:59.324
but to not the major arc
they would've said something

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:02.835
like A, E, B or A, D, B

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:06.150
or arc A, C, B to make us go this kind of,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.352
this long way around.

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:10.274
But this is arc AB, so we,

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.918
in order to find the arc measure,

00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:13.540
we just really have to find the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.021
measure of this central angle.

00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:17.933
This is the central angle
that intercepts that arc,

00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:20.538
or you can even say it
defines that arc in some way.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:22.403
So how can we figure out this angle?

00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:23.839
And this one's a little bit trickier.

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:25.811
Well, the key to,

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.954
the key here is to realize
that this 93 degree angle,

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:33.871
it is vertical to this
whole angle right over here.

00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:37.121
And we know from geometry,

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.649
which we're still learning as
we do this example problem,

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.658
that vertical angles are going
to have the same measure.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.859
So if this one on, this one is 93 degrees,

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.681
then this entire blue one right over here

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:48.794
is also gonna be, let me write it,

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:52.076
this is also gonna be 93 degrees.

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:55.949
So 93 degrees, that's gonna
be made up of this red angle,

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.512
that we care about, and the 38 degrees.

00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:02.553
So this red one, which is the
measure of the central angle,

00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:05.339
it's also the arc measure of arc AB,

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.456
is going to be 93 minus,

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:10.299
93 degrees minus 38 degrees.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.942
So what is that going to be?

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:14.365
Let's see, 93,

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:15.591
I can write degrees there,

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:18.517
minus 38 degrees,

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:20.161
that is going to be equal to,

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.640
let's see if it was 93 minus 40

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.148
it would be, it would be 53,

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:26.179
it's gonna be two more,

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:27.737
it's gonna be 55 degrees.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.829
Fifty five degrees,

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:32.081
and we are done.

00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.561
This angle right here is 55 degrees.

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:36.567
If you were to add this angle meausre,

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.047
plus 38 degrees, you would get 93 degrees,

00:04:39.047 --> 00:04:41.271
and that has the same
measure because it's vertical

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:42.834
with this angle right over here,

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.924
with angle D, P, E.

00:04:44.924 --> 00:04:46.816
Alright, let's do one more of these.

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.327
So, we have

00:04:50.327 --> 00:04:52.027
in the figure below,

00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:53.281
and it doesn't quite fit on the page,

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:55.064
but we'll scroll down in a second,

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:59.073
AB is the diameter of circle P,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.525
is the diameter of circle P.

00:05:01.972 --> 00:05:04.535
Alright, so AB is the diameter,

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:05.871
let me label that.

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:09.158
So AB is the diameter.

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:10.802
It's going straight across,

00:05:10.802 --> 00:05:13.588
straight across the circle.

00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:18.825
What is the arc measure
of A, B, C in degrees?

00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:21.661
So A, B, C.

00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:23.556
So they're making us
go the long way around.

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.534
This is a major arc they're talking about.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.760
Let me draw it.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.853
Arc A, what is the arc measure of

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:31.776
arc A, B, C.

00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:33.475
So we're going the long way around.

00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:35.314
So it's a major arc.

00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:37.070
So what is that going to be.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.048
Well it's going to be in degrees,

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.528
the same measure as the angle,

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:43.896
as the central angle that intercepts it.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.428
So it's going to be the same thing

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.270
as this central angle right over here.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.945
Well, what is that
central angle going to be?

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:52.924
Well, since we know that
this is the diameter,

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.345
since AB is the diameter,

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:57.322
we know that this part of it

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.527
is going to 180 degrees.

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.645
We're going halfway around the circle.

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:04.177
One hundred eighty degrees.

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:07.103
And so if we wanna look
at this whole angle,

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:11.309
the angle that intercepts
the major arc A, B, C,

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:15.851
is going to be 180
degrees plus 69 degrees.

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:19.027
So we're going to have 180 degrees,

00:06:19.027 --> 00:06:21.451
plus 69 degrees

00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:23.680
which is equal to, what is that,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.156
249,

00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:29.996
249 degrees.

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:34.008
That's the arc measure of
this major arc A, B, C.
