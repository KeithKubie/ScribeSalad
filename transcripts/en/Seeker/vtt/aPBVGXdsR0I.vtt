00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.319
Through the history of space exploration so
far, we’ve debated where the earth’s atmosphere

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.950
ends, and space begins. And your surprise
for the day is that according to newly unearthed

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.310
observations, our atmosphere is way bigger
than we ever thought. Like it goes past the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.390
moon.
We’ve mostly defined space as the vast expanse

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.520
of the rest of the universe that exists past
the Kármán Line, which exists roughly

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.289
100 kilometers above mean sea level. Now according
to Federation Aeronautique Internationale—the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.560
organization officially in charge of determining
these kinds of rules—after the Kármán

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.270
line, you are in space.
The reasoning behind this is after 100 kilometers,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.210
the earth’s atmosphere becomes too thin
for a conventional aeronautic vehicle like

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.240
an airplane to stay in flight without reaching
orbital velocity—so you have to switch to

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.070
more specialized astronautic vehicles.
But if you thought this was gonna be simple—it’s

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.420
not. Even though the FAI’s Karman line designation
is commonly recognized, there’s actually

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.620
no official international consensus over where
space technically begins. Some astrophysicists

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.040
say it should actually be 80 kilometers above
the mean sea level because of the way that

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.300
orbital momentum acts on satellite objects.
NASA and the U.S. air force also define space

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.960
as starting about 80 kilometers above the
Earth’s surface, and those who cross that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
line officially become astronauts.
OK, so the definition of space is up in the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.440
air, but what even is the atmosphere? Yes,
it’s the bubble of gases that shield and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.840
insulate the earth from the aggressive radiation
of the sun and the cold dark depths of space,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.510
but like most complex things, it’s got layers:
The troposphere, with all our fun weather

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.720
and necessary gases for breathing and surviving;
The stratosphere, where commercial airlines

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.540
fly when possible because there’s usually
less turbulence; the mesosphere, where most

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.659
meteors burn up and the highest layer at which
clouds can form; Then comes the thermosphere,

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.420
which is where that tricky Kármán line
lives—this is where astronauts begin to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.571
experience weightlessness, and is where the
ISS orbits! That means that technically, our

00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:08.170
most commonly defined line of where space
begins is still in Earth’s atmosphere.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.300
And then finally, there’s the exosphere,
the final layer between us and outer space,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.700
made up of super spaced out hydrogen and helium
atoms slowly dissipating out to nothing up

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.130
to 200,000 kilometers away from earth’s
surface...or so we thought. We actually haven’t

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.330
previously really known where the exosphere
ends and outer space begins, we just know

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.450
that those extremely sparse gases gradually
fade out into a vacuum.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.480
But a team of astronomers has recently dropped
a total bombshell. When the cloud of gases

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.330
in the exosphere reflects the Sun’s UV light,
it creates a luminosity, a glow that we can

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.010
see, called the geocorona. These new observations
of the geocorona indicate that the exosphere

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.550
may extend up to 630,000 kilometers away from
earth—a distance that includes the moon!

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.440
So technically, the moon is in the Earth’s
atmosphere!

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.330
This realization is thanks to an instrument
called the Solar Wind Anisotropies Instrument,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.620
or SWAN. SWAN was able to measure and analyze
the full extent of the geocorona, making us

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.610
think about our atmosphere in a whole new
way.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.100
See, sunlight interacts with the hydrogen
atoms of the exosphere at a wavelength called

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.970
Lyman-alpha radiation, which is something
astrophysicists can measure when looking at

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.270
cosmological structures in deep space. Observing
Lyman alpha radiation can tell us about the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.440
distribution of matter in space, and help
us think about how the universe expanded.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.871
It’s also a wavelength that’s absorbed
by the inner layers of our atmosphere, so

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:48.140
we can’t see it from Earth. But from SWAN’s
position in space, it was able to see and

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.330
measure both--and it extended far beyond what
we were expecting.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.470
So while this discovery is remarkable in many
ways, not the least of which is that technically

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.209
no one has ever left earth’s atmosphere—it
won’t change space travel for us in most

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.400
practical ways. It’s far more important
for informing the future of our observations

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.269
of space.
The new results also show that sunlight compresses

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.449
the hydrogen atoms of the exosphere, producing
pockets of denser geocorona, with the corresponding

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.569
Lyman alpha radiation, depending on the sun’s
position. So space telescopes that make measurements

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.330
from within the confines of the exosphere
will need to take a new Lyman-alpha baseline

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.879
level--and the bunching of the geocorona--into
account when observing the night sky...hopefully

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.699
letting us peer further, and with greater
accuracy.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.930
One last amazing thing about this piece of
information is that this isn’t even new

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.050
research—these observations were made by
SWAN in the late 90’s, and were only JUST

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.689
dug out of the archives for further analysis!!
