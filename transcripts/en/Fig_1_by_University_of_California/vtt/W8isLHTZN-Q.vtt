When the weather gets cold we can go inside, we can put on a sweater, animals can

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.219
migrate

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.730
–&nbsp;they can hibernate, but plants they're
really stuck

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.840
they can't go anywhere so they've
developed all these really amazing

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.790
adaptations

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.520
to deal with things that went to eat
them –&nbsp;to deal with the cold and so

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.060
a vegetable like a carrot that's growing
in the ground – in order to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.789
defend itself against the cold it's
developed all these amazing

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.490
physiological responses including
increasing the sugar content

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.550
and so increasing the sugar content
helps defend against ice crystal

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.570
formation which

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.790
can do all kinds of terrible things
the cells like dehydrate and crush them

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.750
–&nbsp;and rupture them

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.409
along with many other responses. This increase in sugar content helps defend the

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.519
carrot against frost and cold

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.220
and the great benefit that is that when
we harvest those carrots in colder

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.790
weather

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.830
they close much sweeter
