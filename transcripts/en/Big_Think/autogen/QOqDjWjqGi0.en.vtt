very variance in them and then those
 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.000
very variance in them and then those
variants are selected and so you can get

vertebrates called fish in the world's
 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.049
vertebrates called fish in the world's
oceans and then they were able to emerge

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059
oceans and then they were able to emerge
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.640

certain kinds of limbs dying and there

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970
certain kinds of limbs dying and there
 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.420
certain kinds of limbs dying and there
were slow variations accumulating to

turn those fish into tetrapods

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
turn those fish into tetrapods
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.860

be in the mud in the shallow water and
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.270
be in the mud in the shallow water and
eventually crawl up out of the ocean so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280
eventually crawl up out of the ocean so
 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.130

replaced varies depending on what organ

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490
replaced varies depending on what organ
 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.690
replaced varies depending on what organ
we're looking at so for example the the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700
we're looking at so for example the the
 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
we're looking at so for example the the
skin the cells and the skin are turned

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710
skin the cells and the skin are turned
 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.520
skin the cells and the skin are turned
over approximately every month of time

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
over approximately every month of time
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.469
over approximately every month of time
your skin is migrating new cells are

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479
your skin is migrating new cells are
 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.120
your skin is migrating new cells are
migrating outward and the old cells are

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130
migrating outward and the old cells are
 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760
migrating outward and the old cells are
slept off and that makes some sense the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770
slept off and that makes some sense the
 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.620
slept off and that makes some sense the
skin is a subject to a lot of wear and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
skin is a subject to a lot of wear and
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.440
skin is a subject to a lot of wear and
tear and abrasion it sits in contact

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450
tear and abrasion it sits in contact
 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.560
tear and abrasion it sits in contact
with the with a harsh environment and so

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
with the with a harsh environment and so
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.149
with the with a harsh environment and so
for the skin to have some kind of way to

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159
for the skin to have some kind of way to
 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.340
for the skin to have some kind of way to
renew itself is very essential to having

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
renew itself is very essential to having
 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.270
renew itself is very essential to having
a border around our body's organs such

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
a border around our body's organs such
 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.910
a border around our body's organs such

have turnover in some parts of the brain

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
have turnover in some parts of the brain
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.670
have turnover in some parts of the brain
that's being discovered the cells do

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
that's being discovered the cells do
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.000
that's being discovered the cells do
have turnover but clearly the places

the interconnectivity of the cells and
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.900
the interconnectivity of the cells and
the cells working together is really

the cells working together is really
 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.870
the cells working together is really
crucial in those organs that turnover is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880
crucial in those organs that turnover is
 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.060
crucial in those organs that turnover is

the the developing organism it's been

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789
the the developing organism it's been
 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.219
the the developing organism it's been
shown that these organisms can die the

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229
shown that these organisms can die the
 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.200
shown that these organisms can die the
death is absolutely essential in the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210
death is absolutely essential in the
 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.129
death is absolutely essential in the
early developmental process

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139
 
 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.779
 
one thing I write about is the fact that

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789
one thing I write about is the fact that
 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.059
one thing I write about is the fact that
there's not just one death there's

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069
there's not just one death there's
 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.809
there's not just one death there's
there's different forms of death there's

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819
there's different forms of death there's
 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.580
there's different forms of death there's
there's the death of our bodies that has

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590
there's the death of our bodies that has
 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.920
there's the death of our bodies that has
to do with the senescence of us being a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930
to do with the senescence of us being a
 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.990
to do with the senescence of us being a
large multicellular creature a metazoan

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
large multicellular creature a metazoan

having to do with the slowing down of

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319
having to do with the slowing down of
 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.070
having to do with the slowing down of
the repair mechanisms but there's also a

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080
the repair mechanisms but there's also a
 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.959
the repair mechanisms but there's also a
lot of death inside our bodies as we

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969
lot of death inside our bodies as we
 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.709
lot of death inside our bodies as we
live the death of our cells skin cells

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719
live the death of our cells skin cells
 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.680
live the death of our cells skin cells
are always sloughing off in internal

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
are always sloughing off in internal
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.230
are always sloughing off in internal
cells are dying cells that go aberrant

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
cells are dying cells that go aberrant
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.869
cells are dying cells that go aberrant
go through a kind of suicide program so

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879
go through a kind of suicide program so
 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.820
go through a kind of suicide program so
there's a lot of death inside our bodies

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830
there's a lot of death inside our bodies
 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.969
there's a lot of death inside our bodies
all the time going on that is essential

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979
all the time going on that is essential
 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.969
all the time going on that is essential
to our life and this is somewhat of a

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979
to our life and this is somewhat of a
 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.499
to our life and this is somewhat of a
different death from that from the death

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509
different death from that from the death
 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.279
different death from that from the death
of our bodies as as large organisms and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289
of our bodies as as large organisms and
 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.260
of our bodies as as large organisms and
then there's also death on smaller

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270
then there's also death on smaller
 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.379
then there's also death on smaller
scales in bacteria that either have to

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389
scales in bacteria that either have to
 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:25.610
scales in bacteria that either have to
do with they're running out of nutrients

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620
do with they're running out of nutrients
 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.219
do with they're running out of nutrients
that's that that is an inadvertent form

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229
that's that that is an inadvertent form
 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.129
that's that that is an inadvertent form
of death but there's also kinds of

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139
of death but there's also kinds of
 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.339
of death but there's also kinds of
bacteria which are multicellular and

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349
bacteria which are multicellular and
 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.230
bacteria which are multicellular and
they can have programmed cell death in

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240
they can have programmed cell death in
 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.089
they can have programmed cell death in
there as when they go into the

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099
there as when they go into the
 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.939
there as when they go into the
reproductive phases so so one issue

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949
reproductive phases so so one issue
 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.320
reproductive phases so so one issue
about death that I find particularly

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330
about death that I find particularly
 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.279
about death that I find particularly
fascinating is that there is not just

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289
fascinating is that there is not just
 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.719
fascinating is that there is not just
one kind of death but death has been

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729
one kind of death but death has been
 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.510
one kind of death but death has been
really incorporated into life in various

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520
really incorporated into life in various
 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.550
really incorporated into life in various
forms depending on what scale of nature

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560
forms depending on what scale of nature
 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.610
forms depending on what scale of nature
were looking at
