00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.390
(Banjo plays)

00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:29.927
(Banjo and guitar play)

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:37.296
(Sings) Is this what it's like

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.630
to be alive?

00:00:39.382 --> 00:00:41.983
I reached the point of no return

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.646
and I don't know if I've been burned

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.476
from the burned bridges in my life,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.678
thinkin' you were wrong

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:49.867
and I was right.

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.520
Maybe I messed up,

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:54.734
either way it's too late for us.

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:57.569
'Cause baby I'm old with regret,

00:00:57.593 --> 00:01:00.064
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

00:01:00.088 --> 00:01:02.930
Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:06.196
wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.488
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:10.940
wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:15.006
Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.392
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:23.252
Gone, gone, gone.

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:27.972
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:34.029
Gone, gone, gone.

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:38.479
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:43.879
Is this what it's like to fantasize

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:49.659
about a love that never was alive
outside my mind or distance?

00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:51.941
With time I clearly lost my sight,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.291
thinkin' I was wrong
to ever leave your side.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:56.927
But time's the harshest judge,

00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.018
makes us think we were in love.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.198
And now

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:01.742
I'm old with regret,

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.444
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:07.205
Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.273
wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.730
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:15.002
wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:19.260
Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.428
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:27.398
Gone, gone, gone.

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:31.949
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:02:32.707 --> 00:02:38.737
(Banjo and guitar play)

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.039
And baby I'm old with regret,

00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:57.555
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.447
Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:03.590
wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:05.910
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.205
wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.496
Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.592
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:20.869
Gone, gone, gone.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.384
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:31.379
Gone, gone, gone.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.778
I'm a fool for a dead romance.

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:39.449
Is this what it's like?
