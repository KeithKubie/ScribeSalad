00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:03.737
- [Voiceover] Is each piece equal to

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.904
1/4 of the area of the pie?

00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:09.375
So we have a pie,

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.378
and it has one, two, three, four pieces.

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:14.896
So it does have four pieces.

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:19.424
So is one of those pieces
equal to 1/4 of the pie?

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:20.937
Well let's talk about what we mean

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.289
when we have a fraction like 1/4.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.946
The one in the fraction, the numerator,

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:28.538
represents a number of pieces.

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:30.627
So here, one piece.

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.752
One piece of pie.

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:35.344
And then the four, when
we're talking about fractions

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.749
is always talking about
the number of equal size.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:39.582
Equal

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.474
size

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:44.519
pieces.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:48.400
So in this case four equal size pieces.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.816
So the question is,

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:54.945
is each piece one of
four equal size pieces?

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.699
Let's look at the pie.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.539
I think it's pretty clear

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.420
that these pieces on the end

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.452
are not equal, they are smaller

00:01:03.452 --> 00:01:05.333
than the two pieces in the middle.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.302
If you love cherry pie,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.918
you are not happy about
getting this end piece.

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:11.636
Because it is smaller.

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:14.960
It is not an equal size piece.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.359
So yes, each piece is
one out of four pieces.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.807
But it is not one of
four equal size pieces.

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:26.429
Therefore it is not 1/4.

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.922
So our answer is no.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.595
No, no, no.

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:32.665
Each piece is not 1/4

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:35.082
or an equal share of the pie.
