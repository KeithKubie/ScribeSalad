00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.150
The four kinds of transportation: planes,
trains, boats and automobiles.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:15.190
But one preeminent entrepreneur wants to create
a new, fifth transport method.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.009
Hey people Trace here for Dnews with the lowdown
on a new technology announcements, hyper loop.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.260
Elon Musk thought of it.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.089
He is the billionaire creator of Pay Pal,
CEO of Tesla Motors, and SpaceX.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.369
So when he talks,the tech world stop tweeting
for about half a second to listen.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.080
The specifics on how hyper loop would work
are still under wraps, further details are

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.600
coming out next month.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.210
But extrapolating for what Musk said in June,
it will be able to go from San Francisco to

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.350
Los Angeles in 30 minutes, and New York to
LA in 45 minutes.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.960
The plan, we think, is to create a Jetson-like
bank-style vacuum tube transport system.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.280
The transport can't crash and it floats like
an air hockey puck.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.850
It's pretty fantastical.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.990
The project will cost $6 billion dollars,
relatively cheap for an ultra-fast transport

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.940
system and will ideally be solar-powered.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.980
Though, there's not an announced plan yet.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.090
Experts have already weighed in and people
are pretty excited.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.119
As long as we're waiting, I gathered a couple
of other things that we should make some plans

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.119
for.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.119
Firstly, a space elevator.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.369
I mean rocket's are cool and all.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.979
They make a lot of noise and they create some
fantastic pictures.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.700
But there's a better way to get into space,
if we can figure it out.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.150
A space elevator is simply a twenty-two thousand
mile cable with the nine hundred ton elevator

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.939
crawling up and down it.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:26.939
Real simple.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.999
Some plans call for a platform floating in
the Pacific around the equator and the other

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.329
platform is in space.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.380
With a price of about ten thousand dollars
per pound per rocket, a space elevator would

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.439
reduce that to about a hundred to four hundred
dollars per pound, theoretically.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.420
There is one tiny problem.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.600
We just are not smart enough to make it.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.909
The plan was to use carbon nanotubes, but
we can only make them a few inches long at

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.039
a time at the moment and they're looking like
they may not even handle the tensions involved.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.119
So we're stuck on the ground, for now.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.009
By the way water travel could also be revolutionized.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.179
This is a technology call super cavitation.

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.999
Scientific American calls at warp speed for
underwater ships.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.080
Cavitation happens around the edges of propellers.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.330
It has to do with the physical behaviour of
fluids.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.670
Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli discovered
that fluid velocity is directly related to

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.670
pressure and density.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.721
So when you carve through the water in the
right way, like a propeller for example, you

00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.450
force it to change state to conserve energy.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.500
If we did this rapidly and constantly across
the whole surface, we could it cause super

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.920
cavitation, which would theoretically form
a bubble of vaporized water around an entire

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920
vessel.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.290
That bubble could reduce the friction and
increase potential underwater speed by sixty

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.740
to seventy percent.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.570
That is alot.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.070
Unfortunately, like the space elevator and
theoretical hyper loop, we have not quite

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.370
figured out this one either.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.100
But the future of transportation looks bright,
and fast, and bubbly.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.360
Tell us which of these technologies you think
we should be putting all the money into or

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.330
perhaps another one of your favorites.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.040
And make sure you come find us on Facebook,
Twitter, and Google+ so you do not miss the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.470
special behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.470
That's right.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.470
Thanks a lot for watching Dnews everybody.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.320
I'm Trace, see later.
