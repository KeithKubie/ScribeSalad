00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.350
For me, this lesson is about
one of the most fun and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.140
interesting topics in
parallel computing.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.170
Namely, the problem of
graph partitioning.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.180
A common thread in a distributed
memory algorithm is,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.290
how do you distribute the data?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.420
For instance, there's a lesson in this
course on distributed breadth-first

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.280
search or BFS.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.940
Distributive BFS needs
a way to choose an initial

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.170
partitioning of the input graph.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.110
Now that lesson left us
choice of the black box.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.417
This lesson fills in the box.

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.317
Before we start, I want to hint at one
of the techniques which I happen to

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:33.816
think is especially neat.

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:36.330
It's called spectral partitioning.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.620
Spectral partitioning exploits
the connection between graphs and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.570
linear algebra, but
it also has an unusual interpretation,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.630
which it turns out is
really kind of fun.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.420
It's a physics-based interpretation
based on systems of springs.
