00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My feeling was that this was the most promising.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I couldn't figure out how to fill in one digit at a time and make that work,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because if we had something like the word EVEN, and we fill in 1 digit,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we have, say, 8V8N, I didn't figure out how to make sense of that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We have this mixture of some letters that are filled in and some that aren't.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That didn't work for me.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This approach, one big formula--yes,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we could figure out a way to make one big formula,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but the problem is I don't think that would be any faster,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because it would take eval a long time because it would be a very long formula.

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This approach I think is the most promising, so let's talk about it.
