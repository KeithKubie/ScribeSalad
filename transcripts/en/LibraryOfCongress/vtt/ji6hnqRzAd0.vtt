00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.320
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: You know, in my
nearly 40 years here at the Library

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.150
of Congress, my favorite
words have become the last 21,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.170
welcome to the Vardanants
Day Arminian Lecture.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590
This time the 21st lecture.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.730
I see many familiar faces.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.550
Some of whom I will acknowledge
a little later, in the beginning.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440
But I see one who has been here
almost every year, not here.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.190
And I'd like to call the attention
to the fact that my sister,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.310
who has been extremely
supportive, Lynn Young,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.540 position:56%
was caught in the floods of Houston.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.180
Went through two shelters.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.710
And is at least safe and sound
with her daughter now in Denver.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.370
She's one of the lucky ones.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.280
So, I would personally like
to dedicate this event,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.850
the 21st Vardanants Lecture
to all those suffering

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.160
from this horrendous hurricane.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.720
Before I go any further, I
would like to introduce a friend

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.180
and colleague and a great
supporter of the Armenian Programs

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.350
and Collections at the Library
of Congress, Dr. Mary-Jane Deeb,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.510
Chief of the African and
Middle Eastern Division.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.930
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.230
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.530
Thank you, Levon.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.140
And good afternoon everyone.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.470
And welcome to the Library of
Congress and to the African

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.790
and Middle Eastern Division.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.500 position:56%
Thank you, Ambassador Hovhannissian.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.990
And thank you all for being here to
celebrate with us Vardanants Day.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.020
The 21st such celebration in one
of the longest running series

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.800
of programs in the
Library's history.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.210
Many of you, as was mentioned,
have attended these programs

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.700
over the years, organized
by Dr. Levon Avdoyan.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.610
The one and only Armenian
specialist at the Library.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.820
Never before him had there
been an Armenian specialist.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.260
But thanks to a generous grant
from Mrs. Margorie Dadian, in 1991,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.130
the Library established a position
for an Armenian specialist.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.360
And provided funds to build a
collection of Armenian books,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.160
serials, manuscripts, newspapers,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.750
as well as expand the
collections in other formats.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.980
Such as, maps, photographs,
prints, films and much more.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.160
The fund, which exists to
promote Armenian collections,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.350
has been used very wisely by Levon.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.570
In the past two decades, he
has built this collection

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.590
by increasing his items seven-fold.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.160
From an estimated six
or seven items in 1991,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.070
to around 47,000 items today.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.130
He also used the funds to
create the first ever exhibit

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.090
on the Armenian book in 2012,
entitled "To Know Wisdom

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.230
and Instruction, the
Armenian Literary Tradition

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.530
at the Library of Congress."

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.240 position:56%
It was accompanied by an illustrated
catalogue, a book really,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.820
of the same title, on the Armenian
collections at the Library.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.850
The book, which Dr. Avdoyan
wrote, originally in English,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.610
was later translated into Armenian.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.910
And eventually, both versions
were published online.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.450
Dr. Avdoyan has not only focused on
developing the Armenian collection

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.470
and having it preserved and
made accessible to readers.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.960
But has also organized numerous
programs around that collection.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.840
The best known as undoubtedly been
the long running annual Vardanants

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.510
Day Series.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.850
Its goal is to present topics on
all aspects of Armenian history,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.830
culture, politics and society.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.640
In that, he has succeeded
beautifully.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.050
And you can go to our webpage
and find the webcast of each

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.990
of the previous 20 programs.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.240
And today, once again, to
celebrate Vardanants Day,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.130
Levon has invited an
award-winning writer,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.370
whose work has received the
highest level of recognition.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.930
And who is participating in the
National Book Festival tomorrow.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.160
Although Chris Bohjalian is the
New York Times best seller author

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.030
of 19 novels, he is
here today to talk

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.670
about another aspect
of his life and work.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.520
I will not say anymore, as
I know that Levon will want

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.930
to introduce him more fully.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.490
So, now, Levon.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.290
Thank you.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.160
[ Applause ]

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.900
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: If you listen
to Mary-Jane's introduction,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.830
you would think that this is
a one man show, but it isn't.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.010
I'm going to go through
that a little later.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.870
But we've been blessed with
many partners in the endeavor.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800
And I pointed out that
the Armenian collections

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.510
and the Vardanants Lecture,
have grown up the last 25 years,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.900
with the Republic of Armenia.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.800 position:56%
And one of those partners has always
been the Embassy of the Republic

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.170
or Armenia to the United States.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.740
I would like to introduce
to you the present holder

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.690
of the Ambassadorship there.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.140
Who has one won my praise
and friendship for being one

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.450
of the most energetic I have known.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.160
And so, please join me in
welcoming his Excellency Ambassador

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.510
Grigor Hovhannissian.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:22.340
[ Applause ]

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.640
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Grigor Hovhannissian:
Thank you very much Levon.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.620
That was a very generous
introduction.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.120
I'd like to reciprocate.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.280
Knowing you, having you in
Washington is a blessing

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.140
for me personally and for the
Republic for the Armenian culture.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.860
I thank you for the work
you do all these years.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.030
And I can't stress it
enough how appreciative

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.040
and grateful we are
for the work you do.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.020
And we cherish this
institution and cooperation

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.610
with the Library of Congress.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.370
That has become one of
the true cultural bridges

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.560
between Armenia and
the United States.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.630
A landmark event of which the
Vardanants Day invariably makes

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.110
intellectual contributions

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.650
to the Armenian culture,
to the civilization.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.290
Not to mention the massive impact
it makes on disseminating knowledge

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.930
about our country and
Armenian civilization.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.290
I thank you very much Mrs. Deebs
dear compatriots, Ambassador Evans,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.240
great friend of Armenians
for being here today.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.680
Today marks the beginning of --

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.760
actually, in a way it's
a new year, you know.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.690
Because people are
back from vacation.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.120
September marks a beginning
to hard work for many of us.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.540
There's lots of challenges
ahead of us.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.350
You know, there's changes
in Armenia.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.130
There's changes in
the United States.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.750
But institutions like
the Library of Congress,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.620
the Cultural Institutions
activities ongoing,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:06.340
help us maintain the overall, you
know, the level of friendship.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.730
And commitment of both
countries, Armenia

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.330
and the United States
have towards each other.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.740
I thank you all for all you do.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.900
And I'm very pleased that I'll be
witnessing an extraordinary lecture

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.650
by a celebrity.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.420
A person who we already,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.480
in the Armenian world,
called varpet, master.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.020
Only a few of our big
writers, big artists,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.750
you know, deserve that title.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.630
He's -- he won that right already.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.730
And I'm very happy I'll be -- these
lectures happening on my watch.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.600
And I thank you, Levon,
for putting this together.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.550
And as a token of our appreciation,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.350
last year I promised I will
never be coming empty handed.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.510
And today I brought the 47,000
first book to your collection.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.040
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.640
Very much reminiscent
of the topic, you know,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.630
is the DNA Western Armenia
or Eastern Anatolia.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:16.440
An incredibly rich volume that
provides the before and after look

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.780
at the cultural patrimony
of the Armenian civilization

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.370
of what we commonly
call Western Armenia.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.670
Thank you very much.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:37.070
[ Applause ]

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.590
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: You see,
his Excellency doesn't know

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.310
that I invite him because he always
brings books, so [brief laughter].

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:49.590 position:56%
Now, I'd like to get as rapidly as
possible to the meat of the lecture.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.890
But there are people I
do need to acknowledge.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.530
His Excellency pointed out that
John Evans, former Ambassador

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:05.730
for the United States to Armenia,
is yet again with us in support.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.710
Friendly faces and colleagues.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.400
We have Dr. Paul Krigo, [assumed
spelling] who was my partner

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.220
and acquisitions in cataloging
of Armenian materials.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.440
We have Tomoro Ohanian
[assumed spelling]

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.650
and Jasmine Han [assumed
spelling] of Conservation,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.820
who have done so much to
actually preserve our materials.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.500
And it's really, we have
done a marvelous job here.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.950
We have members of the community.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.090
We have members from
Prints and Photographs.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.760
We have a lot of friends
here to listen to you, Chris.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.060
But about Chris.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.130
I have put a biography
of facts in the program.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.110
I don't want to go
through his numerous awards

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.060
and what he has accomplished.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:58.050 position:56%
What I want to say, in a few words,
is that when I started graduate work

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:04.440
at Columbia in 1968, my
colleagues, my fellow Armenians,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.470
were amused when I
said I have one index

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.830
to whether a good --
a book is good or not.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.360
And I look in the index and if
it has Armenia in it, it's good.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.390
And if it doesn't have
Armenia in it, it doesn't.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.780
Many years ago, an Armenian
friend of mine said, well,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.080
what do you think of
Chris Bohjalian's novels?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.390
And I said, well, I don't know.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.860
I haven't read one.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.800
And I got "Secrets of Eden" out.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.110
And I didn't find Armenia in it.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.060
But I loved it.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.780
It was a quintessential
American novel.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.520
Excellent storytelling,
wonderful pros.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.490
A sense to it that
really intrigued me,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.010
that lead me to read a
few others at that time.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.520
And then, five years ago,
something miraculous happened

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.090
to all of us in the community.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.600
And that is Chris authored a book
called "The Sandcastle Girls."

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.070
The very personal account,
the very hard account

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.130
to read for Armenian Americans.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.380
But a wonderful account
of the Armenian genocide.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.330
And I, at that point, met Chris

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.500
for the first time and
I liked what I saw.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.100
I liked what I saw and felt
very friendly toward Chris.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.030
To the point that I, last year,
asked an embarrassing question.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.960
Which was, Chris, tell me, will
you ever write a humorous novel?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.260
To which and I have this e-mailed
response, "Oh, heavens no."

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.840
"All my books are about
dread" [brief laughter].

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.400
They may be about dread, but
they are all exquisitely written.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.630
They are all well thought out.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.950
I've read several since,
"The Guest Room," this year,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.810
which I urge you to read.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.620
Now, I don't know if I can say
that or not, but I am saying that.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.020
And I understand next March,
"The Flight Attendant,"

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.900
his 20th novel will appear.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.850
Those of you who know me, know
that I am extremely interested

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.980
in the question of identity.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.630
And so, when I thought of
identity in literature,

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.760
there was only one name that I
could think of to address you.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.080
So, I asked Chris if he would talk
about the possible impact influence

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.930
of ethnic identity on
literary creativity.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.760
He readily accepted.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.290
And so, ladies and
gentlemen, I ask you to join me

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.900
in welcoming Chris Bohjalian, as he
talks about "Echoes of Anatolia."

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.740
An Armenian American novelist
discovers his literary DNA

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.510
at midlife.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:14:00.480
[ Applause ]

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.510
&gt;&gt; Chris Bohjalian: Thank you,
Levon, for that introduction.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.030
It is a pleasure.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.330
It is an honor.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.490
It is a privilege to join
you on this the 21st lecture.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.700
Ambassador Hovhannissian,
thank you for being here.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.550
Ambassador Evans, thank
you for being here.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:26.170
I thank all of you for joining me
this Friday of Labor Day weekend.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.480
It is a particular pleasure
to be with all of you here

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.060
at the Library of Congress.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.040
Because the last time I was
here, was indeed five years ago,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.990
for Levon's remarkable
curated exhibition,

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.340
"To Know Wisdom and Instruction."

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:52.130
It was profoundly meaningful to
see 500 years of Armenian printing.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.960
Five hundred years
of Armenian culture

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.940
in this magnificent building
in our nations capitol.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.010
I know Levon as a friend.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:11.100
But I know he is also an
enormous gift to the Library

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.610
of Congress, to Armenian Americans.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.100
And to Armenians around the world,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:24.260
for his magisterial work curating
a collection to remind people

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.010
of our long venerated
magnificent history.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.750
Levon, thank you for
all that you do.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.220
It is a particular pleasure
to be with all of you today

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.790
because I'm not on a book tour.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.920
Make no mistake, I like book tours.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.870
It wasn't all that long
ago that my sold briskly.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.040
But only among people
with my last name.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.380
I try never to lose
sight of that fact.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.790
Most people presume, however,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.810
that book tours are
unbelievable glamourous.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.620
You jet around the country and
you hang with Oprah and Katy

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.260
and Terry Gross and sell
whole pallets of books.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.310
But the reality of most book
tours is this, by day 14,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.830
you will have been
on 17 regional jets.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.130
And you will have been reduced

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.440
to wearing a strange man's
underwear [brief laughter].

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.980
I wish I could say
I'm making that up.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.010
I am not. It really
happened to me on the

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.940
"Secrets of Eden's" book tour.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.340
You see, what happens on a book
tour is that the publisher wants

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.640
to get you to as many cities as
possible, as quickly as possible.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.380
So, you spend one night
in every city.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.920
Monday is Boston.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.220
Tuesday is New York.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.520
Wednesday is Washington.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.940
Thursday is L.A. And you
do this for three weeks.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.090
One night, one city, one hotel.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.260
If you're a novelist, there's
nothing in the world you want more

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.240
than two nights in a row in the
same city, in the same hotel

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.620
for one reason and one
reason only, laundry.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.410
You need that second full night
to get your laundry taken care of.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.540
So, on the "Secrets of Eden"
book tour, I get to Minneapolis,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.000
Saint Paul on Friday
afternoon at 4:00.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.670
And I see I'm not checking
out until Sunday morning.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.450
And so, happier than
I've been in two weeks.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.630
I send out a MINI Cooper
sized pile of laundry.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.130
I do my Friday night event.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.070
I have two appearances on Saturday.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.550
I get back to my hotel Saturday
night and there on the bed,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.840 position:56%
under plastic, are all of my
shirts, which have been dry-cleaned.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.030
And a box with my laundry,
which is book tour euphemism

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.360
for my underwear.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.660
Since I'm checking
out Sunday morning,

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.960
I open my suitcase on the floor.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.670
And I open the box on the bed,
planning to move my underwear

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.620
in one neat and tidy
brick, into the suitcase.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.180
So, I open the box and in there
are 14 pairs of underwear,

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.090
not mine [brief laughter].

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.370
Not a man's [brief laughter].

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.070
They belonged to a
very petite woman.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.290
Now, I've done this long enough
to know that rule number one

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.720
of a book tour is that you
never give the hotel all

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.020
of your underwear.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.320
I still have three pairs.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.620
We are not in crisis mode.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.050
So, Sunday morning, the
hotel laundry is closed.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.690
And I am checking out.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:10.790
So, I give these 14 pairs of
women's underwear to the bellman.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.510
And I said, here is the
hotel where I'm going

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.820
to be Tuesday in Orlando, Florida.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.290
And if you could send
my underwear there

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.310 position:56%
by Federal Express, I'd be grateful.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.550
And we both looked at
each other like, yeah,

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.850
that's going to happen
[brief laughter].

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.020
So, then I check out.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.920
And whenever you're on a book tour,
your publisher gives you an escort.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.220
Not that kind.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.450
These are the lovely women and
men who know where the library is,

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.280
the bookstore is, the radio,
TV stations are, in every city.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.570
And they get you to
and from the airport.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.030
And in Minnesota, it's a
wonderful guy named Tim.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.000
So, I get in the car with Tim
and I said, Tim, by any miracle,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.650
is there a store between here and
the airport that's open right now,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.270
where I can get some new underwear?

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.630
And he said two things to me
that were kind of interesting.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.620
The first thing he said
was, wow, you're, like,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.740
the third author I've had this
month who needs new underwear.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.170
And he said there's a Macy's,
but you'll have to be quick.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.820
So, we go to the Macy's.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.230
I go to men's department.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.530
I get my underwear.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.830
It's in a red Macy's bag.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.130
And we go to the airport.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.860
And no one flies through
airport security as quickly

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.200
as a novelist on a book tour.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.850
I throw the shoes, the laptop, the
cellphone and my red Macy's bag

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.150
of underwear in the conveyor belt.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.650
And I fly through the
metal detector.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.740
So, now, I'm boarding regional
jet number 18 from Milwaukee.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.100
And as I am boarding, I realize I
no longer have my red Macy's bag

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.610
of underwear.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.910
How do I know this?

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.230
I hear the following over
the airport loud speakers.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.490
Would the gentlemen
who left his underwear,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.370
please return to security
[brief laughter].

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.290
Bedlam at the gate.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.210
Oh, my gosh, they really
are strip searching us now!

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.510
[brief laughter].

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.250
I couldn't go back for it.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.850
So, I flew into Milwaukee and
had a lovely event in Milwaukee.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.080
I had a terrific even
Monday in Madison.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.040
So, Tuesday, I fly
onto Orlando, Florida.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.050
As I'm checking into my hotel
room on Tuesday afternoon,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.930
the woman behind the
counter says, Mr. Bohjalian,

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.530
we have a Federal Express
box for you.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.540
And I look at it and it is
from the hotel in Minneapolis.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.830
I cradle it against my chest,
as if it is Christmas morning.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.870
I go to my hotel room
and I open it up.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:29.140
And sure enough, in there are
14 pairs of underwear, not mine!

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.440
[brief laughter].

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.260
But they were a man's and they
were boxers and they were clean.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.870
And so, I did the last week of
the "Secrets of Eden" book tour

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.400
in a strange man's underwear.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.380
And I was grateful.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.610 position:56%
You didn't know this was going to be

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.570
such an intellectually
rigorous presentation.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:52.910
Underwear, that brings us to
my work, to our work together,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:56.450
indeed, "Echoes of Anatolia."

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.710
How an Armenian American novelist
rediscovered his literary DNA

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.090
at midlife.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:08.360
For most of my career as a
novelist, I've not been known

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.090
as an Armenian American writer.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:16.650
I've been known as an American
Novelist, most of whose books,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.730
not all, but most were
set in New England.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.200
And most of those books were

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:27.770
about thorny social issues
and moral conundrums.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.790
Books such as 1997's "Midwives."

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.060
About a Vermont midwife
on trial for manslaughter,

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.250
after a cataclysmic home birth.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:44.510
Books such as "Trans-Sister
Radio," in the year 2000.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.300
A novel of a love affair
between a woman

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.200
and a man who's transitioning
to become a woman.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.720 position:56%
And the way their transgender love
story rocks their Vermont community.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.370
And by rocks, I don't mean
in a good Taylor Swift,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.050
Rolling Stones sort of way.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.880
But rocks, as in the
tectonic plates are shifting.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.880
And all that we understand
about gender is shifting.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:15.110
Or "The Double Bind," in 2007.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:19.890 position:56%
The story of a Vermont social worker
who believes that she has found,

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.880
among her clients, the bastard son

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.190
of Jay Gatsby and Daisy
Fay Buchanan.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.310
All of that changed in 2012,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.310
when I published my novel,
"The Sandcastle Girls."

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.920
A love story between
an American woman

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.140
and an Armenian man,
in Aleppo, in 1915.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:54.860 position:56%
Yes, that Aleppo that has broken all
of our hearts the last five years.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.490
In some ways, however,
though I started writing

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.410
"The Sandcastle Girls," was
I was in my late forties.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:09.370
It is a book that had been
gestating inside me my entire life.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:14.700
To understand the origins of "The
Sandcastle Girls," means going back

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.290
in time, all the way to the
last decade of the 19th century.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.160
Come with me to the
oldest family photograph

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.310
and the Bohjalian family archives.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:37.300
The Ottoman City of Kayseri,
it is Southeast of Ankara.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:43.210
This photograph was
taken, we believe, in 1894.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.780
It's my great grandfather
and his family.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:53.690
The patriarch of the family,
that's Nazaret Bedros Bohjalian.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:58.710 position:56%
When I was growing up in the suburbs
of New York City in the 1960's

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.750
and early 1970's, whenever we
would discuss this photograph,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.360
I would always be told
that Nazaret was a tailor.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.770
That's what he did.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.600
He was a tailor.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.740
At the very end of
this presentation,

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.290
we will come back to Nazaret.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:23.160
But I want to spend a moment now
on the little boy on his lap.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.790
That's my grandfather,
Levon Nazareth.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:33.950
Flash forward 35 or so
years to New York City,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.300
another family photograph.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.360
Levon is now grown up.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.660
He's again, seated.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.100
This is a photograph of my
father and my grandparents.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.460
And it is my favorite
photograph I have of my father.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.130
I love this picture of
him as a little boy.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.680
The short pants.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.260
The big wide ears.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.940
The necktie that falls three
inches above his navel.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:06.070
Standing behind him, is
grandmother, Haigouhi Sherinian.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.670
Elegant grey-black dress.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.070
White collar.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.510
The corsage the size of a softball.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:17.270
In my grandmother, I can see
echoes of my beautiful daughter,

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.040
Grace Experience, who
is with us today.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.720
And sitting beside them, Levon.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.800
He's wearing a suit.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:33.310
In my memories, my grandfather
is always wearing a suit.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.700
I once asked his daughter,
my aunt Rose Mary.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.690
I said aunt Rose Mary,
when you were growing up,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.410
was your father always
wearing a suit?

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.960
And she laughed and laughed and
said, no, Chris, of course not.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.160
I remember one day when he
was cleaning the oil burner,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.460
he took off his jacket
[brief laughter].

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.630
Those were my grandparents.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:26:01.130
Levon and Haigouhi, were
survivors of the Armenian genocide.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.370
And like so many survivors of so
many genocides, they brought most

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.210
of their story to their graves.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.180
We know bits and pieces.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.090
We know that my grandmother
Haigouhi Sherinian,

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.060
her father provided cavalry horses

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.820
to the Ottoman army
and had for years.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.150
In 1915, rather than
acquire the horses legally,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.570
they shot him to death,
confiscated the herd.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.870
Confiscated the horse farm.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.760
And for good measure,
confiscated the Sherinian home.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.260
My grandfather, Levon, he
had three older brothers.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.150
And at the start of
the Armenian genocide

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.940
in 1915, they were all alive.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.680
They were in Cairo.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.980
They had made it.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.370
And yet, somehow, between
1915 and 1927,

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.960
when my grandparents
immigrated to the United States,

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:59.650
all three brothers were lost
to the myths of history.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.700
We know nothing about
what happened to them.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.300
We nothing of why they vanished.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.670
This little family you
see in this photograph,

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:16.390
which would soon increase by
two more, my uncle and my aunt.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:23.920
In some ways, represents an almost
classic immigrant American story.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:33.430 position:56%
And the tug of war between American
assimilation and cultural retention.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.970
That home in Tuckahoe,
New York, where Levon

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:43.530
and Haigouhi built their
family, was an Armenian house.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.970
Whenever I would visit
it growing up,

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.680 position:56%
I would see it as an Armenian house.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.580
Beautiful, plush, oriental
carpets everywhere.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.060 position:56%
My grandmothers intricate beautiful,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.470
ornate Armenian lacework,
everywhere.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.210
Floor to ceiling book cases
filled with books in a language

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:07.220
and an alphabet, I
couldn't begin to decipher.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.500
This is actually one of my
rugs, not one of their rugs.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.370
But I share this with those
of you in the community

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.090
who do not read or speak Armenian.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.140
So, you can get a sense of
the beauty of the alphabet.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.270
But in that Armenian household,
it wasn't just the books

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.370
that were Armenian, even
the vinyl was Armenian.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:34.890
A Russian, Armenian pressing
of Komitas, circa 1968.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.070
When the Bohjalian's
would go on vacation,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:44.130
they would be part the
Armenian community in places

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.690
like Tannersville, New
York, in the Catskills.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.640
In this summer photograph
of an Armenian [inaudible],

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.200
the Armenian party, the
Armenian gathering, you can find,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:03.440 position:56%
among the assembled, my
grandmother, my father and my uncle.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.150
Behind the brick walls of that
Armenian house in Tuckahoe,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.970
New York, everyone spoke Armenian.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.250
When my father started
kindergarten at the age of five,

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.420 position:56%
he couldn't speak a word of English.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.940
Couldn't even ask where
the boys room was.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:29.230
And so, like so many sons
and daughters of immigrants,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:36.240
he chose to reinvent himself to be
as American as he possible could.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.040
In the 1950's, he became
that most iconic

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.880
of mid-20th century American
business professionals in admin.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.540
A mad man, think Don Draper.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.480
That is how extensive
his reinvention was.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:30:00.950
And yet, his parents Levon and
Haigouhi, as Armenian as they were,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:08.280
even they were not exempt from the
relentless riptide of assimilation.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.770
The one photograph we
have of my grandfather,

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:17.290
in which he is not wearing a suit,
is this one [brief laughter].

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.320
His first visit to Coney Island.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:26.860
And of course, he's decked
out as an American cowboy.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.680
When I was going through
some of my father's papers,

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.980
after my father passed
away, I found a document.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.640
My grandfather, Levon,
was a jeweler.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.940
He had two stores.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.280
He had one on Maiden
Lane, near Wall Street.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.360
And he had one in Tuckahoe.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.590
When he got his American
certification as a watchmaker,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.080
I noticed that he was
no longer Levon.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.940
He was the more Americanized Leo.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.320
Leo Bohjalian.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.260
And yet, despite my
father's assimilation,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.370
I would always be surprised
when I would come

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:10.160
across photographs,
such as this one.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.820
This was a photograph of my father,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.460
taken in all likelihood
on his honeymoon.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.230
Yes, he's clearly trying
to stay out of the sun.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.800
But there's more to
this picture than that.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.790
Is it simply a very lighthearted,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.700
I am channeling my inner
Lawrence of Arabia?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.590
Or is there something
darker beneath the surface?

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.270
Something all too reminiscent
of what it must have been

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:45.760
like under the searing,
Syrian sun in 1915.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.650 position:56%
He married outside of the community.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.240
He married an odar.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:58.470
He married blonde, blue-eyed
Annalee Carolyn Nelson.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.450
But if he was going to marry
outside of the community,

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.390
he married the perfect odar.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:11.080
He married the perfect
Armenian by choice.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.000
Annalee Carolyn Nelson,
came from a broken home.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.990
A devastatingly shattered home.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.530
A home that began with divorce,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:27.570
so nasty that not only did her own
father not come to her wedding,

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.570
but she and her older
brother, my uncle Warren,

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:35.460
completely separated themselves
from the Swedish half of my family.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.420
And so, Annalee Carolyn
Nelson, was not merely Levon

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:47.170
and Haigouhi's daughter in law, she
became, in essence, their daughter.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.730
Welcoming her into the family.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.540
This is a photograph of
my older brother and me.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.270
I'm the baby, looking
slightly bewildered

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:00.690
by the photographic process.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.900
How Armenian, by choice,
was Annalee Carolyn Nelson?

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.470
Well, she died years and years ago.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.230
But my father died more recently.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.450
As a matter of fact,
he died the summer,

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.780
before "The Sandcastle
Girls," was published.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.570
When I was going through
all of the items that were

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.810
of totemic importance to my father.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:29.140
The things that he cherished, up
until the moment he too passed.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.120
I came across my mother's key ring.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.750
My mother was spectacularly
superstitious.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.300
She wouldn't leave the house,

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.660
much less got on an airplane,
without her keychain.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.520
And among the items always on that
keychain, always on her person,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.600
was a keychain with three items.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.600 position:56%
The Saint Jude medal, a Saint
Christopher medal and a bronze charm

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.670
of the nation state of
Armenia the Republic.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.500
My mother was the one,
when I was growing up,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.450
who made sure that I
read William Saroyan.

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:15.810
This is in fact my childhood
paperback of "My Name is Aram."

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.280
I still own this book.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.100
It is still my dogeared pages.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.380
My underlining.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.520
It was my mother who
insisted, as a teenager,

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.580
that I read "Passage to Ararat."

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.830
And again, this is my copy
that my mother gave me.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:42.100
And it was my mother who
first insisted that I read

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.930
"The Forty Days of Musa Dagh."

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.910
This is not that addition
I read as a teenager.

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:51.740
The edition I read as a
teenager, was an old book

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.520
of the month club addition she had.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.100
Which alas, I no longer have.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.420
But this is an equally
meaningful addition.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.860
It's a first edition in English,

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.580
that my wife found me
one year for Christmas.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:12.560
And it was my mother on Sunday
nights at 8:00, [brief laughter]

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.620
who would remind me
that Cher was Armenian.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:24.430
It was my mother who first told
me that Mike Connors, "Mannix,"

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.720
was actually Krekor Ohanian.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.360
When I was a young
advertising executive

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.010 position:56%
in New York City, the stars aligned.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:40.470
And one of the strange
gifts from the heavens is

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.250
that the account I worked on
as a young man, was Clorets,

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:50.270 position:56%
the breath deodorant whose celebrity
spokesperson in the 1980's,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.400
was none other than
Mike Connors, "Mannix."

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.170
And it was my mother who
first pointed out to me

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:04.570
that the director Ruben
Mamoulian was Armenian.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.750
He had 31 cats at one point.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.560
My friend Vi Babarian
[assumed spelling] tells me.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.510
I've had as many as six.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:18.570
Now, "The Sandcastle Girls," is
not the first time that I tried

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.810
to write a novel of
Armenian history.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:30.000
The first time I explored
1915, was in 1992 and 1993.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.100
I wrote the entire
manuscript, 392 pages.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:45.130
And when I finished reading it,
I realized it was a train wreck.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.530
Utterly unpublishable.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.100
Nothing about this book worked.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.000
Moreover, about this
time, Carol Edgarian,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.660
published her remarkable
novel, "Rise the Euphrates."

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.990
And I remember thinking
to myself, why in the name

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:05.730
of heaven does anyone need
my take on this story?

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.370
When we have the work of
Carol Edgarian, Peter Balakian

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.010
and of course, Franz
Werfel's magisterial epic.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.360 position:56%
So, sent that novel to my alma
mater, where my papers are archived.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:23.060
And you can go there and read it,
if you're a scholar or a masochist.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.360
But I discourage you.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.770
It's a bad book.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.760
So, why did I try again?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.230 position:56%
Well, there are a number of reasons.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:38.380
In 2008, for the first time in my
life, I wrote historical fiction,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.130
"Skeletons at the Feast."

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:47.610
A novel about one German family's
complicity in the Holocaust.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.660
And three young adults who
were trying to work their way

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.220
across the cauldron of Nazi
Germany in its death throws.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.230
Hoping to stay ahead
of the Soviet army

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.670
and reach what they
believe will the safety

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.150
of the British and American lines.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:08.620 position:56%
Friends of mine, Armenian Americans,
sometimes said to me in 2008

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.430
and 2009, it would be lovely

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.100
if you would turn your
talents toward Anatolia.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.720
And give voice to those echoes.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:27.970
On February 2, 2010, this man
added his voice to that chorus.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.210
He's my great friend,
Khatchig Mouradian.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.510
He arrived here from Lebanon in
2007, to edit the Armenian Weekly.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.240
I've known him since.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.490
On February 2, 2010, we were
having a cup of coffee in Boston.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:49.970
And he knew about the
manuscript from 1992 and 1993.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.650
And he said, when are
you going to try again?

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.080
And when Khatchig says
when, he means it.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.280
I had my marching orders.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:05.080
And so, I decided that I would
try again to write that novel

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.190
of the Armenian genocide.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.180
But one of the gifts
of waiting so long is

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.390
that I was older and more mature.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:20.150
And I figured something out, while
writing "Skeletons at the Feast."

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.560
And it was this, when I wrote
"Skeletons at the Feast,"

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.500
I didn't need to educate my
American readers to the Holocaust.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:39.090
All of my American readers knew and
understood what the Holocaust was.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.720
Most of my North American
readers in 2010, however,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.460
could not have found
Aleppo on a map.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.330
Most of them knew nothing
of the Armenian genocide.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.390
The irony, of course, is
that once upon a time,

00:39:55.390 --> 00:40:00.820
all North American eyes were turned
in horror on the fraying edges

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.670
of the Ottoman Empire
and looking on aghast.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.310
There had been bestselling
books in the United States,

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:10.540
"Armenian Massacres,"
"Bleeding Armenia."

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.780
Bestselling memoirs, such
as "Ravished Armenia."

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.310
The story of Aurora
Mardiganian, an Armenian girl

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:23.140
who survived the marches
into the desert,

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:28.310
immigrated to the United
States and published her story.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.790
And wouldn't just be
a bestselling memoir.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:37.200
It was a silent film, eight
reel, Hollywood blockbuster.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.180
Today, but one reel exists, but
you can see that reel right here

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.390
in Washington at the
Holocaust Museum.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.330
You can see it at Yerevan,
at the Genocide Museum.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.550
And you can see it on YouTube.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:58.800
And among the moments from Aurora's
memoir, that Hollywood recreated

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.210
in the American Southwest, was
the passage from her memoir.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:11.950
When she looked on in horror as
women, on the march with her,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:16.580
were stripped naked, nailed to
wooden crosses and crucified

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.830
under the searing, Syrian sun.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:23.740
The New York Times
alone, ran 154 articles

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.570
about the genocide
as it was occurring.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:30.670
Culminating in this front-page
story from July of 1919.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.420
The conviction for what they
called crimes against humanity

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.570
or the architects of the genocide.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:44.970
And this was America's first great
humanitarian outreach effort.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.550 position:56%
At the start of the first World War,

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.640
there were roughly two
million Armenians living

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.610
in the Ottoman Empire.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:57.050
By the end of the first World War,
all but 500,000 would be dead.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:04.010
But Near East relief, an
American originated organization.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:11.790
Nickels, dimes, quarters at a time,
raised the money to save 125,000

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:18.080
of those women, those refugees,
those orphans in the orphanages

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.200
and scattered across the
deserts of the Middle East.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:27.770
For the last eight months, I've
taken such pride in telling people

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:33.040
that I'm a grandson of
Middle Eastern refugees.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.220
I'm a grandson of Middle
Eastern immigrants.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.610
Today, there are roughly
61,000 Armenians in Turkey.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.670
Almost every single one of
them living in Istanbul.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.740
These are Ottoman census figures.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.450
Once upon a time, everyone knew.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.630
But the news cycles moved on.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.930
It's not just 2017, when
the news cycles seem

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:06.350
to have an attention span somewhere
between cottage cheese and yogurt.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.700
As Gore Vidal once said, "We are
the United States of amnesia."

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:14.030
There was the rise
of the Soviet Union.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.420
The fledgling nation state
of Armenia was subsumed.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.770
There's the Great Depression.

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:23.390
There was the rise of Nazi Germany.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.610
And so, a mere 20 years after
that New York Times headline,

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:32.750
I showed you a moment ago, Adolf
Hitler famously said on August 22,

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:37.420
1939, before unleashing
his panzers on Poland,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.660
"be merciless, be merciless.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:45.790
After all, who today remembers the
annihilation of the Armenians?"

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.480
So, when I embarked on
"The Sandcastle Girls,"

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.260
I knew that it needed to have
an educational component that

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.810
"Skeletons at the Feast," did not.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:59.090
And I began by creating
a female version of me.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.040
An Armenian American
novelist at midlife,

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.480
who knows far too little
about her own ancestry.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.010
As she says in the prologue to the
book, Laura Petrosian, she says,

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:16.940
"The world needs one of those black
and yellow books, Microsoft Word

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.890
for Dummies, "Piano for Dummies,"
the "Ukulele for Dummies,"

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.920
the Armenian genocide for dummies.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.620
Something that could
educate Americans."

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.560
But I also knew this, no one
was going to read a novel

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.690
that was 1.5 million
dead in the desert.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.580
And so, I thought of what I loved.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.740
The books that I've loved.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.470
The big, sweeping, epic love
stories set in the midst of war,

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:53.230
such as Michael Ondaatje's,
"The English Patient."

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.630
A love story set in North Africa
and Italy in the second World War.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:00.320
And I'm showing you this movie
poster because I want you

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.290
to notice the biplane that
will be culturally important.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:10.790
Books, such as Ian
McEwan's "Atonement."

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:15.980
A love story, set against
the backdrop of "Atonement."

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.620
And because I wasn't going to
write "The Sandcastle Girls"

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.300
for the Armenian community.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.600
Because we know the story.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.210
I was writing it for my readers
who didn't know the story.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:34.200
I decided that the lovers, one
of them needed to be American.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.250
The lovers, would be
Laura Petrosian,

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.810
the narrator's grandparents.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:48.630
Her grandmother Elizabeth Endicott,
Mount Holyoke, class of 1915,

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:54.790
who ventures with a Boston based
friends of Armenia, to Aleppo.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.770
And there, finds an innermost
ring of Dante's Inferno.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:06.210 position:56%
It's interesting to note that Mount
Holyoke had not one, but two English

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.720
and Armenian speaking
seminaries in Anatolia.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.280
If you visit the Mount Holyoke
library in Hadley, Massachusetts,

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.000
there's a beautiful sculpture
of the Armenian alphabet.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.810 position:56%
A testimony to Western Massachusetts
long connection to Anatolia.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:30.750
Who would Elizabeth
Endicott find in Aleppo?

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:35.620
Armen Petrosian, an
Armenian engineer from Von.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.400
Who is in Aleppo, hoping
against hope

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.380
to find his beloved wife
Kartinai [assumed spelling]

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.870
and his infant daughter
Talin [assumed spelling].

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.430
Though, of course,
he fears the worst.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.510
And so, the novel moves
back and forth in time.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.810
Laura's rediscovery of who she
is as a person in the present

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:59.440
and Elizabeth and Armen's
story in 1915.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.610
The book did well in
the United States.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.240
But I want to share with
you the overseas covers.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.190
Because they say something
interesting

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.610
about culturally how we
approach this material.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.040
This is the United Kingdom cover.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.470
I've christened it, "Downton
Abbey meets the English Patient"

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.770
[brief laughter].

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.220
I love it.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.710
And I love the biplane.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.530
There is no biplane in
"The Sandcastle Girls."

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.890
But because of the place that
the "English Patient" holds

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.790
in our culture, Simon and
Schuster, you made darn sure

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:39.090
that there's a biplane on the
cover of "The Sandcastle Girls."

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.780
The Norwegian edition,
"Sandcastles in Aleppo."

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.110
This edition breaks my heart.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:48.260
Because the Aleppo you
see on the cover there,

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.220
exists now only in
romance and memory.

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.340
It's gone.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:48:01.030
The Farsi edition, a
beautiful split screen image

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:05.090
that immediately conveys the notion

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.920
of our Armenia as a
diasporan nation.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.450
We have the desert on one side.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.740
We have New York City on the other.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.650
The Polish edition, which
I've christened "The Game

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:17.950
of Thrones" [brief laughter].

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:26.110
The Latvian edition, which doesn't
deal directly with the text.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.560
But anyone who has even a dollop of
Armenian blood inside him or her,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:37.500
cannot help but be moved by this
breathtakingly beautiful image.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.770
Most of the foreign
editions, however,

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.850
replicate the American cover.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.940
Elizabeth Endicott, a woman
in white with a parasol,

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.600
looking out at the
Armenian Auschwitz.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.920
The Syrian killing
fields of [inaudible].

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:02.110
The Armenian edition, the Russian
edition, the Brazilian edition,

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.730
aptly titled "Desert of Bones."

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.100
The Italian edition.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:11.160
There's that biplane again.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.400
The French edition.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.790
Elizabeth is wearing
black in this one

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.900
because we know the French
will always sacrifice comfort

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.200
for fashion.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.800 position:56%
So, even though it is Syria in
July, she's no longer wearing white.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:30.420
The Hebrew edition, with
that iconic parasol.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.650
John Gardner, great teacher of
writing, short story writer,

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.370
a novelist, once said, there
are two ways to wake a reader

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.990
from the fictional dream.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:49.780
Clumsiness, bad writing and
inauthenticity, bad research.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.140
I have been guilty
of both in my career.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.640
But for a book such as

00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:01.190
"The Sandcastle Girls,"
research was critical.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:08.230 position:56%
Which is why so many times, over the
last few years, I've been traveling

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.920
to the Middle East to
Armenia, to Turkey.

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.170
And all of the photographs
I'm about to show you, I took,

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.790
except for this first one.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.320
This first one was taken by
my wife, Victoria Blewer,

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.660
who is a fine art photographer.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.900
And it's infinitely better than
anything else you're going to see.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:31.840
But I want to share these
photos of Anatolia with you.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:38.810
Among the echoes that reverberates
with me always, is Kayseri.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:44.150
Because of course, that is
where the Bohjalian's are from.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:49.870
Outside of Istanbul,
there are, I believe,

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:57.390
no more than four structurally
intact Armenian churches.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:03.340
There is the tiny, beautiful little
church on Musa Dagh, for the 200

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.540
or so Armenians in that community.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.800
All decedents of the survivors
of Musa Dagh, who returned.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:14.200 position:56%
But that is the only active
Armenian church congregation outside

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.500
of Istanbul.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.800
That's one.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:23.210
There's Akdamar, restored as
a museum of sorts on Lake Von.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:29.800
There's [inaudible], restored
by the Kurdish municipality.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.610
And there's this one on the screen,

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:40.680
Saint Gregory in Kayseri,
behind barbed wire.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.780
On Akdamar, Saint Gregory
[inaudible],

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.770
there's no Armenian
congregation there every week.

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.090
But the structures remain.

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:55.340
And so, it was important to
go stand inside this church.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.000
The Kurdish caretaker brought us

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.620
through the barbed
wire and let us in.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:06.770
And as I was standing there
and whispering, moved,

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:12.190
my wife said to me,
you realize, don't you,

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.370
that this is where your
grandfather was baptized.

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:18.820
You're now breathing the
air that he breathed.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:24.280
And whenever I see this image,
I hear not merely the echo

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:32.590
of my wife's voice, but I hear the
echo of that baptism in the 1890's.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.730
Most Armenian churches
and monasteries

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.660
in Anatolia are not
structurally intact.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.550
Most of them are relics.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:48.020
They are places such as
[inaudible], also on Lake Von.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:52.490
Once the home to our reverend
fathers, now the home to graffiti

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:57.700
and seagulls, [inaudible],
ransacked regularly for gold

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.840
that probably never was there.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:07.380
This is the cradle, in some
ways, of Armenian civilization.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.680
This is [inaudible].

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.820
This is what it looked
like circa 1910.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.330
This is what remains today.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.560
Saint Bartholomew on
the Iranian border.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.510
I must have 75 images
like this on my phone.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:27.490
I want to show you
just one more, though.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:29.460
Saint Sarkis.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:34.180
Whenever I show this image,
Armenians who have been to Ani,

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.230
which is in Northeastern
Turkey at the Armenian border,

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.470
most people presume it is Ani.

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.810
It's actually not, but
it is very near Ani.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:49.000
Ani, the city of a thousand
churches in the Middle Ages.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.570
But I share with you Saint Sarkis

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:54.890
because I took this
photograph in 2015.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:54:00.820
If I had been standing on the
cliff, looking down at it in 1950,

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:08.350 position:56%
you would have seen five
completely intact church structures,

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.740
all a part of this complex.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.680 position:56%
And today, this is all that remains.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:17.360
Why? Because in the mid 1950's,
the five-church complex was used

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:22.130
for artillery target
practice, medieval churches.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:30.390
Now, the Middle East and Anatolia,
are awash in unmarked masquerades.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.270
Which I will share
with you, but one.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.960
This is the Dudan crevasse.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.090
And here's what the history
books said happened here

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:42.350
over a three-day period in 1915.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:46.060
The 10,000 members of the
Armenian community were marched

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.930
to the edge of the cliff.

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:51.750
And every single one of them
was shot, stabbed or bayonetted.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.220
Their bodies thrown
unceremoniously to the crevasse

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.600
at the bottom of the gorge.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.410
The first time I went
here was in 2013.

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:04.410
And as I am always
when I go to Anatolia,

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:08.080
I was with my great
friend Khatchig Mouradian.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.490
There are five other
Armenian Americans.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:16.570 position:56%
And the seven of us, after listening
to the echoes at the Dudan crevasse,

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:20.110
went to Chunkush to see the
remains of the Armenian church

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.710
and the Armenian monastery there.

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.460
And as we were leaving,
a Kurdish gentleman,

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.320
my age, knocked on or van door.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.610
And begged us not to leave.

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:34.220
He said, please, you must
meet my mother-in-law.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.270
She's 98 years old.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.820
And we all did the
math in our heads.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.310
His mother-in-law was born in 1915.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:45.490
And so, we went to meet her.

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.680
And thank goodness, we did.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.670
Because in this case, the
history books were wrong.

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:57.260
Not every Armenian was killed
that cataclysmic three-day period.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.700
There's one young Armenian woman
in the line who was so beautiful.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.380
That a member of the
Kurdish killing party,

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.790
pulled her from the
line and married her.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:14.680
She had in her arms her
newborn baby, an infant.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:20.730
And that is who we met
that day in 2013, Asiya,

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.870
the last living Armenian
in Chunkush.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:30.370
And as Khatchig was getting
her story, with her hand,

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.190
she looked at us and she
said, you're Armenian.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.690
You're Armenian.

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.460
You're really Armenian.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.080
And that's when I got it.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.370
Her son-in-law was a good
man, a very good man.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:49.100
It wasn't that he wanted us to
meet her, he wanted her to meet us.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.460
To see that while she is
the last living Armenian

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:56.560
in Chunkush, the race continues.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.150
We survive.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.900
Which is why when I return,
I always visit Chunkush.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.960
And why, when I returned
there in 2014,

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.670
I brought my beautiful
daughter and my beautiful wife,

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:13.410
so that Asiya could
meet Grace Experience.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:20.430
And see yet another generation
of Armenians walking the earth.

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:23.950
Now, I said I was going
to end with Nazaret.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:32.740
In 2014, I came across
two-volume encyclopedia.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.270
The notable Armenians of Kayseri.

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:41.890
And as I was thumbing through
this two-volume encyclopedia,

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:47.770
I came across my great
grandfather, Nazaret Bedros.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.510
There were seven pages
about him in Armenian.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:55.610
And I recognized him,
as will you, instantly.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:58:01.210
And for the life of me, I could
not understand why there were seven

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:05.340
pages about a tailor.

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:10.940
So, I asked Khatchig, my
Guggenheim, my Godfather.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.650 position:56%
I said Khatchig, could you translate
this for me and explain to me?

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:19.220
And he called me up,
after reading it and said,

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.160
your grandfather wasn't a tailor.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.820
Maybe he dabbled as a
tailor, but he was a writer.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.240
He was, in fact, a prodigy.

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:36.590
At the age of 12, he was taken
from Kayseri to perform as far

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:38.130
as the Southeast as Jerusalem.

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:40.660
As far as the West
as Constantinople.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:47.650
And he didn't just write
his poems, he sang them.

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.830
He was a troubadour.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:55.770
He was performing across Anatolia
in the 1860's and the 1870's.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.730
A Bruce Springsteen, of the
Anatolian plains [brief laughter].

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:03.940
And his poetry, it was upbeat.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.990
It was ebullient.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:12.920
It was an unceasing beautiful
celebration of the Armenians,

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.400
the Turks, the Kurds of Kayseri.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.230
The landscape.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:19.830
The topography.

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:26.240
Think Walt Whitman, with its
exuberance and enthusiasm

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.760
for the beauty and the
community of Anatolia.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:39.950
All that changed at the end of
his life on November 18, 1895.

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:43.270
Almost a century to the
date, when his great,

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:46.170
great granddaughter Grace
Experience would be born.

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:51.160 position:56%
In a runup to the Armenian genocide,
we call the Hamidian Massacres,

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:57.270
250,000 Armenians died, the
slaughter came to Kayseri.

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:03.100
And the Bohjalian family
was witness and victim.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.270
And now, at the very
end of his life,

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:11.260
despite the fact among his children
was a little boy named Levon.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:16.050
He wrote the longest
poem of his life.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:22.870
A 70-quatrain epic, chronicling
what he witnessed on November 18.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:27.680
I will share with you, but
two of the 70-quatrains.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.950 position:56%
"They killed infidels with axes,
daggers and didn't ask who you were,

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:33.050
whether merchant or coolie."

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.630
"They took the babies out of the
wombs of their mothers and those

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:38.990
who witnessed lost their minds."

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:40.570
Think [inaudible].

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:48.230
I have always been so proud
to be my father's son.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:54.130
I was always so proud to be
my grandfather's grandson.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:01:00.490
But that's the thing about
identity and about genocide.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.420
Whenever we talk about genocide,
we always go right to the numbers.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.920
The six million, the 1.5 million.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:10.420
But it's not just the
souls that are lost.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.880
It's the stories.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.980
It's why the work of Levon Avdoyan
and everyone who works with him

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:23.750
in this wing of the Library
of Congress, are so important.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.550
Because you collect the stories.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.600
You preserve the maps.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.370
You preserve the photographs,
the poetry, the Abovyan.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:37.560
You preserve our cultural identity

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.500
against the relentless
tide of assimilation.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.190
I find it so interesting that
as proud as I've always been

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:53.820
to be Aaron Bohjalian's son, Levon
Nazareth's grandson, that's in only

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:58.380
in midlife that I've
discovered how proud I can be

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.500
to be Nazaret Bedrose's
great-grandson.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.160
Because it is only at
midlife that I've discovered,

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.770
I am not the first
Bohjalian to be a writer

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:12.170 position:56%
and to plum this part of my history.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:15.990
I am humbled to be but the second.

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:19.510
Thank you so much [speaking
in foreign language]

01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:25.050
[ Applause ]

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.690
