00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:04.896
To each of these yellow bars is ten
blocks. You see that: 1,2,3,4

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.322
5,6,7,8,9,10

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.386
so you could view it as a 10 and we have
1,2,3,4

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.786
5,6,7,8

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.850
So this is 8 tens

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:24.094
tens and we have three 1's right over
here.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.000
So it is three 3

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.032
We could write it as 83 we
have

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:34.035
8 tens in the tenth place

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:37.062
and then we have a three in the ones
place

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:41.110
What I wanna do is subtract from this

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.026
25

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:49.044
from the 83

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:54.025
I wanna subtract 25

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:57.078
from the 83

00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:00.166
so the first thing you might want to do
is look at the ones place

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.071
I have three ones I want to subtract

00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:09.160
5 ones and you immediately say well how
do I do that how do I subtract five

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:10.860
things from three

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:14.525
we don't know how to do
that yet

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.180
what if there was a way to take a 10
from here

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:22.019
and break it up and turn it into 10 ones

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.106
and so we could put those 10 ones here
and adding three ones we could have 13

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.078
well we're going to do exactly that and
then we will be able to subtract

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:34.104
so let's do that let's take one of these
tens here

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.373
and take one away from the tens place

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.530
so let's take this one right

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:42.134
over here

00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:47.093
actually underline it first and let's
break it up

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.450
let's break it up into ten ones so

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.090
1,2,3

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.020
4,5,6

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:02.028
7,8,9

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:03.132
and 10

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:07.128
so took this one 10 and I broke it
up into ten ones

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:12.039
so I no longer have a-ten

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.048
I now have 7 tens

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.067
seven tens and how many ones do I now
have

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:24.075
and no longer have 3 ones. I have added 10
ones to that. So it is ten plus three

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:27.140
is now 13

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.020
Now it's going to be a little bit
easier to subtract

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:35.133
if I have 13 ones that I want to take
away five

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.122
if I take away 1,2,3,4,5

00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:43.113
how many ones on my left with.. it is
13 -5

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:47.044
which is equal to you 8

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:51.403
13-5 = 8

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.920
that the is 8 right over here and then
we go to the tens place

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.186
we have seven tens. we're going to take
away two tens

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:04.104
how many are we left with now?

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:10.017
we are going to be left with

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:13.031
1,2,3,4,5

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:17.039
we are going to be left with 5 tens

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.084
seven tens -2 tens

00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:23.135
is five 10's so there you have it

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:29.040
83 -25 is 58 and what we've just done
is we've regrouped

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:33.653
we took a group of 10 and we broke it up
and we turn it into 10 ones and the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.400
reason we did that so that we could
subtract in the ones place here

00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:41.004
so that three became the sort of having 13. we have 13 ones

00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.007
and we took those 10 from the tenth place

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.054
in order to do that

00:03:48.017 --> 00:03:51.054
and to make this really clear we could
write this a different way

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:52.103
We started with

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:57.015
83 which is eighty plus three

00:03:57.015 --> 00:04:01.053
and we subtracted

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:05.137
20 and we subtracted 5 that's what's
subtracting 25 would do

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:10.104
In order to subtract 5 ones

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:11.603
from three, five is

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.780
larger than three

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:15.567
so instead

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.399
we took a 10 from here so the eighty
became

00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:22.088
a seventy and we gave that ten to the
three 10 plus three

00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:26.693
is 13 and now we were ready to subtract

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.941
now we're ready to subtract 13

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.900
-5 his 8 and seventy

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.028
-20 is fifty so we were left with 50
Plus 8

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.062
or 58
