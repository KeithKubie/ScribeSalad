Let's see if we can use our concept of working together to solve this problem.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.039
Vanessa and Tim want to repaint a room. Tim's painted the room alone before,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.020
and done it in 4 hours. While Vanessa's painted the room alone, and done it in

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.334
3 hours. If they're working together, how long would it take them to paint the

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:19.992
room? Try setting up an equation, and then solve and write your final answer

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:20.920
here.
