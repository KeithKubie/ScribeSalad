00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.420
- Hey, guys,
my name's Rick Rabjohn.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.080
Welcome to
the Booyah Forge.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.880
This is the power hammer
that I made

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.920
about three years ago;
it works great.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.710
A little bit
of the wall of fame.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.710
Just different knives
I've made.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.960
This is my tabar battle axe.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.710
A Viking axe.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.330
This is my King Kong
forge press.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.830
It's a 20-ton forge press,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.250
and I use that a lot.
That works really great.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.750
This is a beautiful Hill anvil
back from the 1850s.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.120
I've got my coal forge
I built.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120
[chuckles] It's an upside-down
trash can.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.330
And this is the propane forge
I built.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.290
It works really well.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.580
All right, that's it
for the forge area.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.210
Let's go over to the shop
and see--

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.330
see that portion of it.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.710
- Hello. This is my forge.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.710
Come on in.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.830
Got my quench tank here...

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.540
which I built out
of an oxygen bottle.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.880
I cut the bottom off
and flipped it upside down

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.330
so I can drain the oil out.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.920
This is my forge.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.580
I incorporated my forge
into my work bench

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.000
because some pieces I do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.960
I need to go straight
from the fire to a jig

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.120
that I have laid
out on a table.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.710
If you look at the setup,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.120
you have 6 feet from
the center of the fire pot

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.330
to the striking surface.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210
So there's very
little heat loss.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.710
That's paramount
when you're working.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.710
Like little work triangles--

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.380
they just--it speeds up
your efficiency.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.880
- All right, guys,
welcome to the shop.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.750
Here's my 2x72-inch
belt grinder.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.080
I made that--
the milling machine,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170
cutting and welding.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.250
You know, my drill press.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790
All the different grinders.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.620
And then of course my band saw.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.580
I don't specialize
in any one thing.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.170
<i>There's a couple of examples.</i>

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.880
<i>I've got a beautiful kinetic
wind sculpture</i>

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.460
<i>in the back. And then
of course I've got</i>

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.790
<i>some decorative iron work
here.</i>

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.330
It's time for me
to go back to work.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.710
All right, take care, guys.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.540
- This was gonna be
a coffee table.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.460
The wife and I--Patti and I got
back from a trip to Scotland,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.250
but I wound up going
to a lot of castles

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.960
while I was over there,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.250
down on my hands and knees on
the floor looking at hinges

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.000
and stuff the ancient smiths
did.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
And this kind of inspired me
a little bit.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080
This was gonna go through...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.500
But Patti said, "No. I'll be
catching my pantyhose on it

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.420
left and right,"
and that was the end of that.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.830
I hung onto them.
I'm not gonna get rid of them.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.460
They're nice. I like them.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.620
So I'll use them for something
eventually, I guess.
