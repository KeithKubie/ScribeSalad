00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.640
- [Voiceover] You bought a huge canister,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.210
aluminum can, of super hot red peppers,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.770
three kilograms' worth, and
you hung them from two strings

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.910
from the ceiling 'cause
you don't want anyone

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.010
to get your super hot red peppers,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.500
and you wanted to know,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.350
what's the tension in
both of these strings?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.830
If this is the angle

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.960
that the strings make with the ceiling,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.280
what are these two tensions?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.590
This problem's hard.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.910
This problem's spicy, this
is a spicy tension problem.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.950
Let's start with something
a little more mild

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.370
and we'll work our way up to this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.770
to see how this works.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.760
We're gonna do that because
even though this one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.320
seems very difficult, and easier problems

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.680
seem much different from it,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.510
the process that you use
to figure out the answer

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940
is always the same.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.610
So I'm gonna try to show you

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.740
that you shouldn't get distracted.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.510
Even though the details
are different, the process,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.190
the overall strategy is the same.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.050
Let's start with
something a little easier.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.970
Let's start with this, a nice, red apple.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.160
Let's say this apple is three kilograms

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220
so we can keep the same number.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.610
Three kilogram apple,
hanging from a string.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.200
We wanna know what's
the tension in the rope.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.600
Well, this one's easy.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.320
The way you solve it is the way you solve

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
all of these problems.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170
So even though it's easy,
we're gonna go through

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.890
the entire process so
you can see how it works,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.230
and it won't take long.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.270
We draw the forces.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.760
The force of gravity is
exerted on this apple

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.950
because it's always exerted
on everything near the Earth,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.180
and it's mg.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.520
Now, we've got a tension force.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.280
And the tension does not push.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.520
You can't push with a rope.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.000
You can pull with a rope,
so this tension force

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.800
points upward, I'll call it T.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.910
That's always the first step.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.390
You draw your force diagram,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.690
and now you use Newton's Second Law

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.660
for either the horizontal direction

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.460
or the vertical direction,
of both if you have to.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.280
So we're gonna use Newton's Second Law,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.600
which looks like this.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.100
And the acceleration
in a certain direction

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.100
equals the net force in that direction

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.250
divided by the mass.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.490
Which direction do we pick?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.560
It's pretty obvious here.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.720
We'll pick the vertical direction

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.040
because there are no forces
in the horizontal direction.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.340
And I'll plug in the acceleration.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.040
If this apple's just
hanging here and not moving,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.060
then it's not accelerating,
it's just sitting here.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.720
Unless this was like an
elevator or a rocket ship

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.300
that had acceleration upward.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.580
You could do that, you'd
plug in that acceleration.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.070
But if it's just hanging
from the ceiling at rest,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.140
this acceleration's gonna be zero.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.220
That's gonna equal the net force.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.310
We've got tension upward.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.310
To figure out what goes here,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.250
like we draw this force
diagram for a reason.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.820
This isn't just like

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.060
happy fun painting time over here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.320
This is a strategy.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.250
We draw these forces
'cause this lets us know

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.350
what we plug into Newton's
Second Law for the net force.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.100
If it's not on here, I
don't put it up here.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.950
And if it is on here, I
have to put it in here

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.050
if it's in that direction.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
So tension is vertical, and
this is the vertical direction

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.130
for the net force.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.320
So I put tension in here.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.850
I'm gonna call upward positive.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.890
That means I make this tension positive.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.650
And how about mg over here?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.067
mg points down so I minus mg.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.970
Then I divide by the mass.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.490
Well, now I just solve for the tension.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.680
So this is the process.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.210
You draw your force diagram,
you use Newton's Second Law,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.110
and then you try to solve
for the force that you want.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.690
In this case, it's the tension.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.760
So I multiply both sides by m.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.660
It's still zero on the left-hand side,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.460
so zero equals t minus mg.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.340
And if I solve this for t,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.920
I get something that might
not be all that surprising.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.820
I just get that the
tension is equal to mg.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.800
And you might be like, "Well, duh.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.980
"That was like way more
trouble than it had to be."

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.340
I mean, you just knew it, it was mg.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.220
This tension just has to balance gravity,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.340
so it's just mg, why did we
go through all this trouble?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.460
And the reason is, I
mean, it is equal to mg,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.320
but it won't always be equal to mg.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.670
So if you wanna know what to
do when it's not equal to mg,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.060
you have to know how to
use this process well.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.200
Why would it not be equal to mg?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
Well, imagine this.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.400
Imagine I had, say, two tensions up here.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.120
Or let's start with this,
let's say I just pull down

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.310
on the rope.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.630
I just come over here and
someone pulls down on the apple.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.140
Let's say someone just
pulls down the apple

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.890
with an extra five Newtons.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.470
Right, pulling this apple,
which pulls this string,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.590
which makes it tighter.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.950
What would I do in that case?

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.330
Well, I've got one more force
here in my force diagram.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.890
I just add that.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.050
So that's five Newtons.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.220
It's pointing downward, so
when I come over to here

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.720
to my net force, I've got
to subtract five Newtons

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.730
'cause that's pointing downward.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.760
And now I do my algebra just as before.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.710
I multiply both sides by m.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.530
I'll have another minus five Newtons here.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.090
And then when I solve for t
I'll add mg to both sides,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.880
and I'll add five Newtons to both sides.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.410
And so this would be my force.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.170
So with numbers, what are we gonna get?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.460
The mass was three, so
we'll have three kilograms

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.390
times the acceleration due to gravity

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.050
is 9.8, but to make the numbers nice,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.850
let's just round to 10 for now,

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.650
10 meters per second squared.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.900
That way we don't get lost
in details and decimals.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.030
So plus five Newtons.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.510
It's mg when it's just hanging there,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.800
but if there's extra
forces, it won't be mg.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.040
In this case, with a five
Newton force downward,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.980
it's gonna be 30 plus five,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.320
so it's gonna be 35 Newtons.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.820
So it's equal to mg in
the easiest possible case,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.270
but if there's extra forces,
it won't be equal to that.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.100
Also, if there was another rope pulling up

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.590
in the same spot as the first rope,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.800
now I'd have two tensions pulling up.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.590
Now I've got another tension
force pulling up this way.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.630
So what would I do now?

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.860
I'd have to add another T.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.490
I'd have plus T.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.470
Well T plus T is just 2T.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.850
So I'd have a 2T here, I'd have a 2T here.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.820
To solve for T, I'd just
have to do 35 Newtons

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.820
divided by two.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.810
You could start making these
harder, and harder, and harder,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.960
and you could do that
by adding extra ropes,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.610
or adding forces down.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.860
And you might convince
yourself erroneously

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.820
you have to do something
new, but you don't.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.000
You still just draw your force diagram,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.730
then you go to Newton's Second Law,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.410
you put those forces in carefully,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.350
you solve for what you wanna know.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.950
And if this is confusing,
why is it 35 over two?

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.950
It kind of makes sense.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.300
The total downward force is 35 Newtons

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.990
'cause this is 30 Newtons of weight here.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.920
We've got 35 Newtons in downward.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.320
The total upward force has to be 35.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.470
And if these strings are
attached at the same point,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.270
they're both gonna bear
the same amount of weight.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.450
They have to total up to 35,

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.950
so you just get 35 over
two amongst each of them

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.310
'cause they each bear half the weight.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.000
So that was one of the easiest problems.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.090
We turned it into a little
bit of a harder problem.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.450
It gets even harder if we add an angle.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.020
Remember, those jalapenos
were at an angle.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.220
We gotta do this.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.630
We gotta do one at an angle.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.200
Say you got a chalkboard
hanging from two strings.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
One string's horizontal, one
string is up here at an angle.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.610
What do you do now?

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.450
It's easy to convince yourself
you gotta try something new,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.560
or go for a new strategy, but you don't.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.950
You solve this the same way.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.510
We're gonna draw our forces.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.540
We've still got a force of gravity down.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.850
So this force of gravity is just mg.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.450
And for consistency's
sake, let's say the mass

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.610
of this chalkboard is
also three kilograms.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.860
All right, what else do I have?

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.960
I'm gonna have a tension that
points up and to the right.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.710
It doesn't point this way.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.830
Tension doesn't push, tension pulls.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.890
So this tension's gotta pull this way.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.990
We'll call this T one.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.950
This is T one.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.290
And over on my force diagram,
it would look like this.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.310
I'd have a T one that
points something like that.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.020
So here's my T one.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.280
I'll put it here, T one.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.900
And I've got one more force now.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.830
I've got this horizontal force here.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.450
Again, it does not push.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.360
This is a rope, it can only pull.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.040
So it pulls to the left.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.630
I'll call this T two.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.180
So on my force diagram, I would have

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.700
T two, and that's it.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.860
Those are all my forces.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.040
I don't have a normal force.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.740
Sometimes people wanna draw,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.070
people are so used to there
always being normal force.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.470
They're like, "Normal force, right?"

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.640
And it's like, "No."

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.400
There's no surface
touching this chalkboard.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.940
It's just hanging by strings.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.260
The only force keeping it up
would be the vertical component

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.940
of this T one, so this is it.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.780
These are the only forces we've got.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.830
What do you do after that?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.970
Same as the apple problem.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.620
We go to Newton's Second Law,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.250
and we say that the acceleration
will be the net force

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.820
divided by the mass.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.240
Which direction do we pick?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.780
It's not quite as obvious here.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.590
We've got forces vertically
and horizontally.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.030
So here's my advice.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.520
Look for something that you know.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.150
in this case, I know the
mass is three kilograms,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.890
and I know the acceleration
due to gravity,

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.960
or the magnitude of it, 9.8,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.090
but in this case, 10.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.400
Since I know this force, remember,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.680
this force is just 30 Newtons

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.250
'cause three times 9.8,

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.550
or three times 10 meters
per second squared

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.650
is just 30 Newtons.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.220
Since I know this force,
it's a vertical force,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.840
I know something about that direction.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.580
I'm just gonna start with that direction

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.820
'cause I already know something about it.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.640
So I'm gonna do a in the y direction,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.660
F in the y direction.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.140
We'll start with the vertical direction.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.430
If you make a mistake and
you pick the wrong direction,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.870
it's not the end of the world.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.970
Just pick the other direction.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.650
There's only two to worry about,

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.810
so if you screw one up,
just go on to the next one.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.170
It's not that big of a deal.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.960
All right, acceleration vertically again.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.780
Let's say this is at rest,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.980
just hanging from these strings.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.890
So we don't have to worry
about any acceleration.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.200
Although, if there was, you would just

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.600
plug that acceleration in here.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.400
It's not that much harder of a problem.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.060
Zero equals, all right, what do we got?

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.770
We need to put our vertical forces up top.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:13.780
I know this one.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.490
30 Newtons downward.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.480
So I'm gonna have negative 30 Newtons

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.060
'cause those 30 Newtons point down,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.720
and I'm gonna consider
downward as a negative,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.400
upward as positive.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.740
This is really just mg.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.120
I could've wrote it as negative mg.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.150
What else do I have?

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.820
I've got T one; T one points up,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.100
but I can't add all of T one here

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.060
'cause it doesn't all point up.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.500
I can only add all of T one

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.040
if T one pointed straight upward.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040
But it doesn't.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.370
Part of it points up.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.320
So this part of T one points to the right,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.330
pulls to the right.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.800
This part of T one pulls up.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.530
It's this component right
here that's gonna be

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.970
the component that actually
causes this chalkboard

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.160
to stay up, that keeps
it from falling down

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.170
because that's the part
that's fighting gravity.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.750
We'll call this T one in the y direction.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.120
We'll call this T one in the x direction.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.500
So we need to add plus T
one in the y direction.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.640
And that's it, those
are the only two forces

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.780
that are vertical.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.410
T one x is not vertical.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.790
That's horizontal, and
this T two is horizontal.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.600
So I've included T one y and mg.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.440
Those are the only two
forces that are vertical.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.190
So now I divide by them my mass.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.190
I can multiply both sides by mass.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.000
m times zero is still zero.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.270
I get zero equals negative 30 Newtons

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.070
plus T one y.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.720
And now we have to figure out, okay,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.090
T one y,

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.940
T one y has to equal what?

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.020
I can solve this for T one y.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.310
I add 30 to both sides.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.900
I'm gonna get T one y

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.040
equals positive 30 Newtons.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.490
And that makes sense.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.410
I mean, this T one y is the only component

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.760
that's balancing out gravity.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760
We know it has to balance

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.460
because there's no
acceleration vertically.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.780
So this T one y has to
be the exact same size

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.080
as the force of gravity.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.740
I drew it, it's not proportional here.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.770
Sorry about that, I should've drawn it

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.850
with this component
exactly the same length

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.720
as this component 'cause
they to be the same,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.310
they have to cancel.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.790
But that just tells me T one y.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.810
I wanna know what T one is.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.240
How do I solve for what T one is,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.640
and what T two is?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.830
These are what I wanna figure out.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.840
What are the tensions?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.440
I don't just want the
component, I want the tension.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.500
And so now I say that
this component, T one y,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.840
is gonna be related to the total T one,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.500
and it's related through this angle here.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.170
So I can say that T one y,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.820
whatever this angle is right here.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.710
Remember, we can use trigonometry

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.360
and we can say that sine theta

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.330
is gonna be the opposite
side over the hypotenuse.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.830
And in this case the
opposite side to this angle,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.700
opposite is T one y.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.880
It's gonna be T one y divided by,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.140
the hypotenuse side is the total tension.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.270
So that's always the total
magnitude of the force.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.460
In this case, we're calling that T one.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.130
So I wanna solve for T one.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.710
So if I multiply both sides by T one,

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.550
I'll get T one times sine theta,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.890
and then I divide both
sides by sine theta.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.900
I'll end up with T one equals

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.330
T one in the y direction
divided by sine theta.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.960
I know T one in the y direction.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.490
That was 30 degree, or
sorry, not 30 degrees.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.160
That was 30 Newtons.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.900
So I've got 30 Newtons,
that's my force, upward.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.320
This vertical component right
here had to be 30 Newtons

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.830
'cause it had to balance gravity,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.640
divided by sine of the angle.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.230
But what is this angle?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.260
We know this angle's 30.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.570
And you could probably convince yourself,

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.400
if I draw a triangle this way,

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.110
let's try to figure out,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.960
we wanna figure out what
this angle is right here

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.460
'cause that's what this angle is here.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.490
So if this is 30 and that's 90,

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.520
then this has to be 60.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.840
And if that's 60, and this is 90,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.220
then this has to be 30.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.220
So this angle is 30 degrees right here.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.930
So that's 30 degrees.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.400
So this angle right here,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.100
which is this angle
right here, has to be 30.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.210
So when I'm taking my sine,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.500
I'm taking my sine of 30 degrees.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.880
And I get 30 Newtons
divided by sine of 30,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.980
and sine of 30 is 1/2.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.080
So .5, so I get that this is 60 Newtons.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.610
And that might seem crazy.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.640
You might be like, "Wait a minute.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.180
"T one is 60 Newtons?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.340
"60 Newtons?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.270
"The weight of this
chalkboard is only 30 Newtons.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.340
"How in the world can
the tension in this rope

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.020
"be 60 Newtons?"

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.110
I mean, if we just hung
it by a single string,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.540
if we just hung this
chalkboard by a single string

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.740
over the center of mass,

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.600
you'd just get a tension of 30 Newtons.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.960
How can this be 60 Newtons?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.170
And the reason is, this
part's gotta be 30 Newtons.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.450
We know that 'cause it
has to balance gravity.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.120
But that's only part of the total tension.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.700
So if the total tension, if
part of the total tension is 30,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.870
all of the tension's
gotta be more than 30.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.290
And in this case, it's 60 Newtons.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.130
So that's why it's larger in this case,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.310
'cause it's at an angle.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.080
So this component has to equal gravity,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.930
and this total amount has
to be bigger than that

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.750
so that its component is equal to gravity.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.640
Right, how do we figure out T two?

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.070
Well, you don't invent a new strategy.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.470
We keep going, we're just
gonna say that the acceleration

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.290
in the horizontal direction

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.470
is the net force in the
horizontal direction

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.170
divided by the mass, so we still

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.820
stick with Newton's Second Law

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.160
even when we wanna find this other force.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.040
This force is horizontal,
so it makes sense

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.830
that we're gonna use Newton's Second Law

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.240
for the horizontal direction.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.580
Again, if this chalkboard
is not accelerating,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.620
the acceleration is zero,
so I'll draw a line here

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.300
to keep my calculations separate.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.270
Equals net force in the x direction.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.470
Okay, now I'm gonna have
T one in the x direction.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.880
So this is gonna be T one in the x.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.810
So I'll have T one in the x direction.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.490
That's positive 'cause it points right,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.550
and I'm gonna consider rightward positive.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.120
Minus T two, all of T two.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.470
I don't have to break T two up.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.760
T two points completely in
the horizontal direction.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.710
And I divide that by the mass.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.930
And well, I can multiply
both sides by mass.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.450
I'd get zero equals

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.540
T one in the x direction

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.130
puh, minus, excuse me, minus T two.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.180
So if I solve this for T two,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.070
I'm gonna get that T two, if
I add T two to both sides,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.470
I get that T two just equals

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.550
T one in the x direction.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.760
But how big is T one in the x direction?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.430
We know T one is 60 Newtons.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.560
We know T one in the y direction

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.670
of this piece here was 30 Newtons.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.550
How big is this piece?

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.250
Well we can use, instead of sine now,

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.320
we can use cosine.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.040
So if I use cosine, I can
get that cosine theta,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.220
which is 30 degrees here,
'cause this angle here's 30.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.190
Cosine of 30 would be the adjacent.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.100
That's this T one x, so it's adjacent

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.500
over the hypotenuse.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.290
The hypotenuse is T
one, and we know T one.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.190
T one was 60.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.640
So I can solve for T one x,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.210
and I get that T one in the x direction,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.940
if I multiply both sides by 60 Newtons,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.420
this is 60 Newtons, I get
that T one in the x direction

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.540
would be 60 Newtons

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.210
times cosine of 30.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.080
And the cosine of 30 is,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.130
cosine of 30 is root three over two.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.030
So I get 60 Newtons

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.970
times root three over two,

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.130
which means that T one
in the x direction is,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.830
60 over two would be 30,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.350
so this is 30 root three Newtons.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.870
And that's what I can bring up here.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.460
This is T one x.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.110
So since that's T one x, I can
say that T one x right here

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.780
is 30 root three Newtons.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.770
And by Newton's Second Law
in the horizontal direction,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.430
that's what T two had to equal.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.720
So T two equals 30 root three Newtons.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.720
So we figured it out.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.640
T two equals 30 root three Newtons,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.280
and that should be surprising.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.080
This force here, in order to make it

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.450
so that there's no
acceleration horizontally,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.030
just has to equal this force here.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.220
Those are the only two horizontal forces.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.210
We knew T one x was 30 root three.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.350
That's what we found.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.620
So that means T two also
has to be 30 root three

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.520
to make it so that these
forces are balanced

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.180
in the horizontal direction.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.180
All right, so we did it.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.050
We figured out T one, 60 Newtons.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.260
We figured out T two,
30 root three Newtons.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.450
Now we're ready, now we could figure out

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.580
the super hot jalapeno problem.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.300
We'll do that in the next video.
