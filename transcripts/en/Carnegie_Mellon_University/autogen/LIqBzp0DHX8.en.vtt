right<00:08:44.540><c> so</c><00:08:45.470><c> I</c><00:08:45.860><c> think</c><00:08:45.980><c> with</c><00:08:46.310><c> Kris</c><00:08:46.460><c> and</c><00:08:46.550><c> I</c><00:08:46.700><c> will</c>

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
right so I think with Kris and I will
 

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.570 align:start position:0%
right so I think with Kris and I will
probably<00:08:47.090><c> something</c><00:08:47.480><c> to</c><00:08:47.540><c> say</c><00:08:47.720><c> about</c><00:08:47.750><c> this</c><00:08:48.140><c> but</c>

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:48.580 align:start position:0%
probably something to say about this but
 

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.890 align:start position:0%
probably something to say about this but
the<00:08:49.580><c> rate</c><00:08:49.790><c> of</c><00:08:49.820><c> it</c><00:08:50.030><c> you</c><00:08:50.180><c> move</c><00:08:50.390><c> your</c><00:08:50.540><c> eyes</c><00:08:50.570><c> is</c>

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:50.900 align:start position:0%
the rate of it you move your eyes is
 

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.570 align:start position:0%
the rate of it you move your eyes is
such<00:08:51.110><c> that</c><00:08:51.290><c> you</c><00:08:51.440><c> probably</c><00:08:51.800><c> get</c><00:08:52.220><c> to</c><00:08:52.310><c> look</c><00:08:52.490><c> at</c>

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:52.580 align:start position:0%
such that you probably get to look at
 

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.190 align:start position:0%
such that you probably get to look at
the<00:08:52.730><c> ball</c><00:08:52.910><c> somewhere</c><00:08:53.330><c> around</c><00:08:53.540><c> the</c><00:08:53.750><c> midpoint</c>

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.540 align:start position:0%
we're getting movement of the ball in
 

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
we're getting movement of the ball in

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:34.770 align:start position:0%
three dimensions so in addition to just
 

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.380 align:start position:0%
three dimensions so in addition to just
the<00:12:34.920><c> speed</c><00:12:35.250><c> there's</c><00:12:35.610><c> the</c><00:12:35.850><c> movement</c><00:12:36.240><c> of</c><00:12:36.330><c> the</c>

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:36.390 align:start position:0%
the speed there's the movement of the
 

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.420 align:start position:0%
the speed there's the movement of the

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.430 align:start position:0%
ball and there's also the deception of
 

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.900 align:start position:0%
ball and there's also the deception of
the<00:12:38.580><c> picture</c><00:12:38.880><c> has</c><00:12:39.030><c> before</c><00:12:39.480><c> he</c><00:12:39.570><c> throws</c><00:12:39.870><c> so</c><00:12:40.910><c> and</c>

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
the picture has before he throws so and
 

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
the picture has before he throws so and
then<00:12:42.089><c> you</c><00:12:42.210><c> added</c><00:12:42.390><c> stress</c><00:12:42.930><c> because</c><00:12:43.710><c> these</c><00:12:43.860><c> are</c>

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
then you added stress because these are

about Robin Roberts when guys were on
 

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.580 align:start position:0%
about Robin Roberts when guys were on
base<00:17:48.510><c> all</c><00:17:48.840><c> of</c><00:17:48.990><c> a</c><00:17:49.080><c> sudden</c><00:17:49.500><c> it</c><00:17:50.280><c> was</c><00:17:50.460><c> really</c><00:17:50.970><c> fast</c>

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:51.590 align:start position:0%
base all of a sudden it was really fast

base all of a sudden it was really fast
now<00:17:52.590><c> guys</c><00:17:52.890><c> are</c><00:17:53.190><c> just</c><00:17:53.420><c> you</c><00:17:54.420><c> know</c><00:17:54.540><c> can</c><00:17:54.750><c> throw</c><00:17:54.990><c> it</c>

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
now guys are just you know can throw it
 

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
now guys are just you know can throw it
because<00:17:55.380><c> they're</c><00:17:55.680><c> not</c><00:17:55.800><c> expected</c><00:17:56.430><c> to</c><00:17:56.550><c> stay</c><00:17:56.760><c> in</c>

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:56.970 align:start position:0%
because they're not expected to stay in
 

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.090 align:start position:0%
because they're not expected to stay in
so<00:17:57.720><c> I</c><00:17:57.750><c> think</c><00:17:57.810><c> it's</c><00:17:58.050><c> a</c><00:17:58.170><c> combination</c><00:17:58.500><c> of</c><00:17:58.920><c> all</c>

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a combination of all
 

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.670 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a combination of all
those<00:17:59.280><c> factors</c><00:18:00.150><c> and</c><00:18:00.570><c> either</c><00:18:00.870><c> the</c><00:18:01.230><c> game</c><00:18:01.440><c> is</c>

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
those factors and either the game is
 

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
those factors and either the game is
