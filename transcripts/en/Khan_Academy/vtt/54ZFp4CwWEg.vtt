00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:01.669
- [Voiceover] We're told
the following equation

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.931
is true for all real values of y

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:07.727
for which the expression
on the left is defined

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:10.740
and D is a polynomial expression.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.425
And they have this equation here.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:15.014
What is D?

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.873
All right. So essentially,
what they're saying

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:19.416
is they don't want us to
somehow solve this equation.

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:20.654
They're saying D is going to be

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.853
some type of a polynomial expression.

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:24.615
They tell us that right over there:

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.160
D is a polynomial expression.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.397
And if we figure out what D is,

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.579
this left-hand side of the expression

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.416
is going to evaluate to one
for all real values of y

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.795
for which the expression is defined.

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.857
So let's think about how
we would tackle that.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.339
Well the first thing
that pops into my mind,

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.146
if I'm dividing by a fraction
or a rational expression,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.672
that's the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:52.375
So let's just rewrite this
on the left-hand side.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:56.010
So this is 20 y squared

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.743
minus 80 over D

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:03.515
times four,

00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:06.076
oh, let me do the reciprocal,
let me be careful,

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.104
times the reciprocal of this.

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:09.120
If I divide by something,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.033
the same thing as multiplying
by the reciprocal,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.354
so let me just swap the
numerator and the denominator,

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.646
(chuckle) numerators and denominators,

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.444
numerator and denominator.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:22.444
All right, y to the third
plus nine y squared,

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:27.445
all of that over four y
squared minus eight y.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.506
That's going to be equal to one.

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:32.095
Now let's say if we can simplify

00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:35.719
all of these business on the
left-hand side a little bit.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.824
So let's see.

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:41.224
Over here, I can divide both terms by 20.

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:42.676
So let me factor out 20 because I think

00:01:42.676 --> 00:01:45.178
it's gonna end up being
a difference of squares.

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:47.774
So if I factor out of 20,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.029
so this is about the same thing

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.928
as 20

00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:54.768
times y squared minus four

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:57.310
and y squared minus four,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.763
we can rewrite as y plus
two times y minus two.

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:02.662
It is a difference of squares.

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:04.871
So let me write y plus two

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:07.975
times y minus two.

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:12.121
All right. This down here,
four y squared minus eight y,

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.875
well it looks like we
can factor out of four y.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.360
And so this is going to be same thing

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.156
as four y

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:22.996
times y minus two.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:27.353
All right. So let me cross that out.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:29.115
So it's the same thing as
four y times y and minus two

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.447
and I already see that
this y minus two here

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:33.039
and this y minus two here
are gonna cancel out.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.022
And let's see. Up here, both terms

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.355
are divisible by y squared,
so I can rewrite this as,

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:41.768
I don't know if this is
actually going to be helpful

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:42.812
because it's gonna,

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:45.064
well let me just do it, just in case.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:49.836
So that's the same thing
as y squared times,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:54.784
y squared times y plus nine.

00:02:54.784 --> 00:02:57.424
All right. And so we can
rewrite all of these things.

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.546
If we were to multiply
everything together,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.647
we would end up getting,

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:05.078
the numerator would
get 20 times y plus two

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.580
times y minus two

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.523
times y squared

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.973
times y plus nine, I'm just
multiplying all the numerators,

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.762
and that's going to be over,

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.254
in the denominator, I would have

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.415
whatever the expression D is,

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:22.765
times four y

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.525
times y minus two,

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.608
and that's all going to be equal to one.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.449
Now let's think about it.

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.810
We can divide,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.230
we have y minus two
divided by y minus two,

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.981
so those cancel out.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.070
Now let's see. We have a...

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.779
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by y,

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.824
so that would just become one.

00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:46.212
And then that would just
become a y to the first power.

00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:48.161
And so, what we'd be left with,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.953
what we'd be left with in the numerator

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:54.531
is 20 times this y

00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:59.455
times y plus two times y plus nine

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.598
over,

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:06.120
over four D

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.951
is equal to one.

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:10.243
Now if we wanna solve four D,

00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:12.205
well we could just
multiply both sides by D

00:04:12.205 --> 00:04:13.964
and one times D is just gonna be D,

00:04:13.964 --> 00:04:15.826
so we're gonna have D
equals something over here

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:16.927
and we'd be done.

00:04:16.927 --> 00:04:17.788
So let's do that.

00:04:17.788 --> 00:04:19.199
D times that

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.981
and let's multiply that times D.

00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.753
Let me be clear what I'm doing here.

00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:25.115
Let me draw a little divider here

00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:29.085
to make it clear that that's happening

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:30.814
in the other side of the page.

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:34.147
All right. So D times
this, those cancel out,

00:04:34.147 --> 00:04:38.034
and we're gonna be left with 20 y times,

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:40.493
actually, let me, I could
simplify it even more.

00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:44.524
20 divided by four is five.

00:04:44.524 --> 00:04:46.686
So, our numerator is now just one.

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:50.653
So we have five times y

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:53.483
times y plus two

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:56.159
times y plus nine

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.285
is equal to D, and we're done.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:01.707
This is D. This is the polynomial,

00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:03.903
whoops, that is...

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.063
That is the polynomial expression

00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:08.434
that we are looking for.

00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:09.636
If you were to substitute this back in

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:11.541
and then try to simplify it,

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:13.860
well, you would end up
with all of these over here

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.265
and D would be this,

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:17.227
and so, it would all just cancel out

00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.685
and you would be left with one.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.168
For all real values y
for which the expression

00:05:22.168 --> 00:05:25.287
on the left is actually defined.

00:05:25.287 --> 00:05:27.003
There are some values of y

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:29.913
for which the expression
on the left is not defined.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.195
If y is equal to zero,
this denominator is zero

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.834
and you're dividing by zero,
well that's not defined.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.003
And then when you multiply
by the reciprocal,

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:40.654
if this were to become zero,

00:05:40.654 --> 00:05:42.508
then that wouldn't be cool either.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:45.250
And there's multiple ways
to make this equal to zero.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.622
y could be equal to negative nine,

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.324
that would also make this bottom zero.

00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:51.196
So we could think about
that if we wanted to,

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:52.732
but they're not asking us to do that.

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:54.211
They're saying, for all
of the real values for y

00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:55.766
for which the expression defined,

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.062
find the D that makes all of
this business equal to one

00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:01.070
and we just did that.
