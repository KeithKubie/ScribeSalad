00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, I'd like to give you a number of situations where you might be able

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to use hypothesis tests.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In which of these situations would it be helpful to use a hypothesis test?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Comparing crash rates of two different airlines with 100 flights each.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In case you don't know but I assume most of you do, planes don't crash very often.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Comparing five-year auto repair rates on 100 vehicle samples.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Comparing the heights of the tallest buildings in two different cities.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And determining if a course improved test scores in some sample of students.
