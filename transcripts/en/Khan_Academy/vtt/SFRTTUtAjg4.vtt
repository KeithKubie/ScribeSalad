00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:02.668
- What I'm going to introduce
you to in this video

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:07.171
is a way to classify numbers
as either being even,

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:09.831
or being odd.

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:12.466
So what does it mean to be even?

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.494
Well an even number is one

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:17.420
where if you had that many doughnuts,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.159
you could split it evenly
between two people.

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:25.208
So even numbers are numbers
that are multiples of two.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.583
So if you have two doughnuts,
you could split them.

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:29.516
If you had two people,

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:31.860
you could give one
doughnut to each person.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.997
Four doughnuts,

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:35.366
you could split that
evenly with two people.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.061
They could each get two doughnuts.

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:38.220
And then we could keep going.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.916
All of the multiples of two,

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.751
these are even numbers.

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.140
8, 10, 12, and of course
we could keep going

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.033
on, and on, and on, and on.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.738
An easy way to spot an even number

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:52.930
is that it's ones place
is going to be even.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.930
So, for example, the
number 32 is an even number

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.287
because in the ones place you have a two.

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:01.573
The number

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:05.503
5,977,354,

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:09.341
5,977,354,

00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:13.506
well that's an even number,
because the ones place is even.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.488
Now there's one number
that's an interesting one,

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.595
why some people sometimes say,

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.091
"Well is this one really even?"

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.747
And that's the number zero.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.486
And the number zero is even

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:25.750
because it is a multiple of two.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.131
How is it a multiple of two?

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:31.044
Well, zero times two is equal to zero.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.971
So zero is a multiple of two,

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:36.744
and so zero, for sure, is an even number.

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:37.742
And then that actually makes

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:41.283
our looking at the ones
place idea hold up.

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.349
Because a number like...

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.981
a number like 150 is an even number,

00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:49.925
and we can look at the
ones place of it and see,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:51.069
we have a zero there.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.950
And a zero is an even number.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.225
So if, in the ones place,
you have an even number,

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.172
you are looking, the
whole thing is going to be

00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:00.008
an even number.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.110
So what are odd numbers?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.143
Well one way to think about them

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.399
is they're the numbers that aren't even.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.565
So not multiples of two.

00:02:07.565 --> 00:02:10.669
Not multiples...

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.945
not multiples of two.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:15.637
So what are some examples of odd numbers?

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:19.455
Well one, three, five,

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:21.461
seven, nine,

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.730
and of course you can
go on, and on, and on.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.819
And just like we could
look at the ones place

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.909
to spot an even number, you
can also look at the ones place

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.569
to spot an odd number.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.531
The number 59,

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:33.830
well I have a nine over
here in the ones place.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.172
Nine is odd, so this is
going to be an odd number.

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:42.259
The number 1,441

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.209
has a one in the ones place.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.776
That is an odd number.

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:47.912
So this whole thing is going to be odd.

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:49.073
And so what's another way of...

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:50.820
why is it called odd?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.806
Well, it'd be hard to
split 1,441 doughnuts.

00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:58.449
You can't split it
evenly between two people

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.788
without breaking up a doughnut.

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:01.610
If you wanted to leave
the doughnuts whole,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.064
one person would have to get

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:05.766
one extra doughnut than the other person.

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.148
You can't split it evenly.

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:08.634
The easiest way I think about odd,

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:11.606
it's not a multiple of two, it's not even.

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.742
So another way, it is not...

00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.992
it is not even.

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:20.626
So now that we know what an
odd or an even number is,

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:23.145
let's think about what
happens when we operate

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.165
on odd or even numbers.

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:27.712
So let's think, in particular,

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:31.074
actually let me move over
to the side right over here.

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:34.255
Let me move over....

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.567
right over here.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.030
Let's think, whoops.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.713
Fell off the screen.

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:43.066
Let's think about what happens
if I take an even number,

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:47.269
an even number, plus another even number.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.595
Is this number, the sum, is
it going to be even or odd?

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:53.050
Well you could take some examples.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.457
If I say two plus six,

00:03:56.457 --> 00:03:58.633
that is going to be equal to eight.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:00.349
Well eight is an even number.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.349
If I say 14 plus four,

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:07.533
well that equals 18.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.628
Once again, eight in the ones place.

00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:11.345
This is an even number.

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:14.627
If I say 150...

00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:17.692
156 plus...

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:20.827
plus 100...

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.395
100 and...

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.826
why don't we do a simpler number,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:27.092
plus four,

00:04:27.092 --> 00:04:30.450
that is equal to 160.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.624
Zero in the ones place,
this also is an even number.

00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:35.748
So it looks like all the
examples that I've done so far,

00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:39.242
when I add an even to an
even, I get an even number.

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:40.903
And I encourage you to
keep trying this out.

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:42.526
I encourage you to keep trying,

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:45.384
pick some even number,
then another even number,

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.346
add them together and you'll
see that you keep getting

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:50.098
even numbers.

00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:51.091
And it makes sense.

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.497
Because if you had one number
that's a multiple of two,

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:56.447
and you add it to another
number that's a multiple of two,

00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:57.944
it makes sense that the sum

00:04:57.944 --> 00:05:01.311
is going to be a multiple of two.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:05.224
Now what happens if you
add an odd and an odd?

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:06.925
What happens if you add an odd number

00:05:06.925 --> 00:05:09.043
plus another odd number?

00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:10.064
Well let's try.

00:05:10.064 --> 00:05:12.432
What is one plus three?

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:13.988
Well that's equal to four.

00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:17.111
You actually get an even number.

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.185
You add two odd numbers,
you get an even number.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.046
Well maybe that was
just that special case.

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:24.065
What if I add 15 plus seven?

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:25.632
These are both odd numbers,

00:05:25.632 --> 00:05:27.921
when I add them together I get 22.

00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:30.068
I get another even number.

00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:31.309
This is interesting.

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:36.309
If I take, let me say 19 plus 3.

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:39.707
Actually that gets us 22 again.

00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:41.966
We have an even number.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.741
This is interesting.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:46.424
What about, what about, let's see...

00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:51.424
23 plus 5, well that gets us to 28.

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.564
Once again, get an even number.

00:05:53.564 --> 00:05:56.443
So the pattern that
seems to be forming here

00:05:56.443 --> 00:05:59.682
is that if I have an even
plus an even I get an even,

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:01.644
but also if I have an odd plus an odd,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:04.163
then I also get an even number.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.881
And once again, I encourage you to try out

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:09.004
as many numbers as you can
to see if this pattern holds.

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:10.629
And you will see that it is true.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.260
An odd plus an odd number is an even.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.385
Now let's think about
one last combination.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.939
What about an even,

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.225
what about an even plus an odd?

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:24.978
An even plus an odd.

00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:28.762
So let's say I have two plus one.

00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:31.920
Two plus one, well what
is that going to be?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.859
Well that's going to be equal to three.

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:35.519
That's going to be an odd number.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.745
Well what about, what
about four plus three?

00:06:39.745 --> 00:06:43.076
Four plus three, well
that's equal to seven.

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:45.757
That's equal to an odd number.

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:48.266
And so it looks like if I
have an even plus an odd,

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:49.995
and I've only tried out two cases here,

00:06:49.995 --> 00:06:52.097
but I encourage you to try
out many, many, many more

00:06:52.097 --> 00:06:54.139
to make sure that you
feel good about this,

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.702
but an even and an odd is
always going to give you an odd.

00:06:58.702 --> 00:07:02.034
So this is always going
to give you an odd.

00:07:02.034 --> 00:07:03.299
So let's just remind ourselves,

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:07.061
even numbers, they're multiples
of two, including zero.

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:09.324
Odd numbers are just numbers
that aren't multiples of two,

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:10.473
that aren't even.

00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:14.653
And an even plus an even is
going to be equal to an even.

00:07:14.653 --> 00:07:19.123
An odd plus an odd is also
going to be equal to an even.

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:23.036
We saw that, we saw that multiple times.

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:24.881
But an even plus an odd?

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.815
That is odd.
