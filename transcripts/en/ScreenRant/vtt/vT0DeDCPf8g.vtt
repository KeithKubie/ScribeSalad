As nice as it is to think that movies made

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.540

favourites in a completely different light

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.540

or dark themes, movie fans can see their childhood
favourites in a completely different light

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.540

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.540
Whether it's intended or not, these theories
are too good to leave unexamined.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.540
Wait until you hear the last one, you won’t
even believe it!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.540
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movie Theories That
Completely Change Children's Films.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.540
Peter Pan

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.540
When people think Disney mermaids, the ones
in the animated version of Neverland aren't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.540
the first ones that come to mind.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
But they were the first, showing their talent
for trouble making, a distrust of mortals,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.540
and a fear of pirates.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180
And one of them looks an awful lot like Ariel,
the Star of The Little Mermaid.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.340
So much, that fans have theorized that it's
actually Ariel's mother, Athena.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.740
The mother isn't introduced until the straight
to video sequel, where she is eventually killed

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.430
by - you guessed it - pirates.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.120
If the theory is true, then she really should
have stayed in Neverland.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.660
Finding Nemo

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.740
It's a happy story, but Finding Nemo begins
with a heartbreaking scene, as Nemo's mother

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
is killed along with the rest of her eggs,
leaving Nemo to be raised by his father, Marlon.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.720
At least, that's what you're meant to think.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460
But after watching Marlon's whole adventure,
some have pointed out that it's a close parallel

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.360
to the stages of grief - as in, the way he
would have to come to terms with losing Nemo,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
too.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.510
Was Marlon searching for an imaginary son
the entire time, unable to accept that he'd

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.320
lost his entire family?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.930
There isn't much actual evidence to support
it in the story, but it's too dark to not

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.370
mention.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.780
Back to the Future

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.690
Nobody ever asked how a teenage boy and an
elderly scientist and failed inventor became

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.229
best friends, but there wasn't much time before
Doc Brown sent Marty McFly back in time to

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.229
wonder.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.940
But take a closer look at the DeLorean's first
trip through time: Doc makes Marty stand beside

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.810
him staring down the speeding car, with it
disappearing just in time.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.840
Since every other one of his inventions failed,
fans claim, he would've had to think the same

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.010
might happen here.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.020
Apparently, Doc had reached his breaking point,
making sure that if this invention was also

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.700
a bust, he wouldn't live to make another.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.970
And he'd be taking Marty with him.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.549
Talk about heavy.

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.549
Willy Wonka&nbsp;

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.200
Even fans would agree: there is something
very off about Willy Wonka.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.659
But some people claim that Wonka isn't just
weird, but a cold blooded killer.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.819
He never seems too surprised when the children
on his factory tour wind up hurt or possibly

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:25.819
killed, or even upset.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.909
Once fans realized that his Oompa Loompas
would have needed time to rehearse their songs,

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.719
describing which children were harmed, and
how, the theory was complete: long before

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.340
the Saw movies (Use Still), there was Willy
Wonka, and his chocolate factory death trap

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.559
- only kids allowed.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:41.559
Star Wars

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.670
You don't have to be a kid to love Star Wars,
but George Lucas clearly hoped that one character

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.489
in his prequel trilogy, Jar Jar Binks would
be a hit with young fans.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.849
Instead, he became a punching bag for the
prequels as a whole.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.290
But what if fans were right to hate the Gungan
klutz?

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.379
It may sound like a long shot, but the theory
that Jar Jar was faking his stupidity, and

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.329
working for the Dark Side all along has gained
a lot of steam.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.940
The “Darth Jar Jar” theory even made it
to Lucas himself.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.870
But if it's true that Jar Jar and the Emperor
were working together all along, he's not

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.540
letting the secret out any time soon.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.540
Toy Story

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.909
The toys take the spotlight in Pixar's series,
but there are humans, too: Andy, the boy who

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.209
owns the toys, and his mother and sister.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.670
But most fans have wondered about Andy's father.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.049
It's nothing new for a Disney movie to have
a parent or two out of the picture, but it's

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.450
never explained, or even mentioned.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.569
Some fans have taken that fact as a sign that
Andy's father either left the family, or passed

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.681
away long before the first movie - explaining
his connection to strong, honourable, father

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:39.569
figure dolls like Buzz and Woody.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.439
One Pixar writer has supported that idea,
so this theory isn't as far fetched as some

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.370
might think.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.370
Spider-Man

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.299
It may not be a kids movie but Spider-Man
remains extremely popular with today’s youth.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.079
Peter Parker's journey from geek to superhero
is a dream come true for every comic book

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.330
nerd, but when he hit the big screen, some
fans think it was a more universal story being

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.330
told.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.449
Peter doesn't start getting powers until he
hits high school, when he starts getting serious

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.299
feelings for a childhood crush, grows into
a man's body overnight, and starts spending

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.269
more and more time alone in his room.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.779
It seems a pretty clear metaphor for boys
hitting puberty, at least that's what some

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.779
claim.

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:19.370
Even without the sticky webbing, it's a hard
case to argue.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.680
Harry Potter

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.370
Most of the magical spells in the Harry Potter
series were created from scratch, but the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.850
most evil curse actually sounds familiar.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.870
But why would The Killing Curse sound just
like "Abra cadabra," one of the most well

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.780
known magic spells in the world?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.090
Fans have connected the dots, deducing that
wizards and witches weren't always kind to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.622
Muggles (those are non magic people for non
harry potter fans!), some imagining they even

00:04:42.622 --> 00:04:44.850
killed everyday people for sport.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.680
More optimistic fans claim the curse was used
to kill infections before Muggles got wise

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.470
to magic, so fans can take their pick.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.040
But it isn't just Harry Potter who makes out
like the hero of the series, thanks to one

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.540
fan theory based directly on the books.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.410
Most fans will remember Neville Longbottom
as a bumbling, but lovable sidekick who eventually

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.640
let his good heart make up for his lack of
magic.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.630
But remember: a wizard's wand matters too
- that's why it's supposed to choose its user.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.310
But Neville chose to use his father's wand
instead, which was probably the reason for

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.500
his disastrous magic.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.180
It was only after he purchased a wand of his
own that he joined Dumbledore's Army, battled

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.100
Death Eaters and became an all around top
tier wizard.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.150
It turns out Neville was a master spellcaster
the entire time.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.150
Home Alone

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.320
We've saved the most incredible theory for
last.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.390
Everyone knows how Kevin McCallister survived
a Christmas home alone, using paint cans,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.770
nails, tar and blowtorches to turn his house
into a torture chamber for two attempted burglars.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.180
But it wasn't his last.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.420
That's right, some fans believe Kevin grew
up to become Jigsaw, the murderous mastermind

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.640
of the Saw movie series.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.470
Once you factor in Kevin's serious rage issues,
it's the best kind of theory.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.280
One that makes both movies seem even more
amazing - whether it's true or not.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.680
Those are some of the most entertaining and
convincing theories based on kids' movies

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.990
that we've found, but which ones have we missed?
