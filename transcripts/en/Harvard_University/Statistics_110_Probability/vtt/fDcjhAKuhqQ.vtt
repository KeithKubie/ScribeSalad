00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.327
So we're talking about
conditional probability, right?

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:06.540
We're continuing to do
conditional probability.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.157
And so today we're gonna talk
about a couple of the most

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:14.731
interesting famous problems related
to conditional probability.

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.920
First one, a lot of you have
seen in some form or other.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
And that's called the Monty Hall problem,
the three door problem.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.370
Very, very famous problem,
it's been in movies, on TV, and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.990
New York Times articles about this.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.840
There are entire books written
just about this problem,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.110
popular books on just this problem,
entire problem.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.890
So a lot of you have seen it before,
but I'm not assuming you've seen it.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.660
Even if you have seen it though then I'm
hoping I can give you some additional

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.280
ways to think about it.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.900
And we'll approach it from
more than one perspective

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.880
because it's a very subtle problem.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.670
This is the sorta problem that almost
everyone gets wrong the first time they

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.590
see it.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.740
And then if they think about it for
a while they think they understand it.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.090
And then you ask the same question
just in a slight disguise.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.870
And then everyone gets it wrong again.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.140
So, I'm gonna try to talk a lot about
how do you really think about this so

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.120
that you won't get fooled
if I ask the same thing.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.320
And then just change a few things around.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.370
What's really going on here.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.420
But anyway I'm not assuming
you've seen the problem before,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.820
so let's start from the beginning.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.687
So Monty Hall is a game show host.

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.860
He's retired now, but for

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.880
many years he hosted a game show
on TV called Let's Make a Deal.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.794
And so the problem is named after him
because it's not exactly what he did on

00:01:44.794 --> 00:01:49.380
his game show but he did kinda
similar kinds of games on his show.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.005
So the game is like this,
there are three doors.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.756
Let's just call them door 1, 2 and 3.

00:02:01.756 --> 00:02:03.130
[COUGH].

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.390
And suppose that you're
the contestant on the game show.

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:10.680
Monty Hall asks you to choose.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.955
And right now you don't know
what's behind each door.

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:16.050
Monty Hall asks you to choose a door.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970
So say you pick that one.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.190
So, there are all
assumptions in this problem.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.610
We are supposed to assume that
one door has a car behind it.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.730
The other two doors have goats.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.180
So you don't know which one.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.580
One of these has a car behind it.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.250
The other two have goats.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.740
And we're assuming that you,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.330
the contestant,
have no idea which one has the car.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.487
They're all equally likely, but we assume
that Monty Hall knows which is which.

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:59.719
So Monty knows which one has the car.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.260
Okay, that's a key
assumption of this problem.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.890
Sometimes it's kinda left implicit, and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.040
I think it's important to
state that explicitly.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.400
It's a different problem
if Monty Hall doesn't know.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.040
So one door has a car,
two doors have goats.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.430
You pick one.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.180
Another assumption is that you want
the car, you do not want the goats.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.590
So you pick a door.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.980
Suppose you pick this one.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.788
So let's say you pick this one.

00:03:32.788 --> 00:03:34.935
Pick this one.

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:39.640
Just by symmetry, we can simplify things,
if we assume that we,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.670
being the contestants, we choose door one.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.640
If you want door 3 instead, that's fine
with me, we could just renumber the doors.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.770
So let's assume that we pick
this one initially, door 1,

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.840
just to simplify the notation.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.550
Then what happens is that Monty opens up
either door 2 or door 3 revealing a goat.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.700
So for example, he could possibly
opens door 2 and there's a goat there.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.135
So then you know the car's either
the one you initially chose or door 3.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.345
Question is should you switch?

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:17.455
Monty Hall gives you the option of do you
wanna switch to the other door that's

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:20.265
unopened or keep your original choice?

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.435
The question is,
is it beneficial to switch?

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.935
So that's the problem and
there's one more assumption.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.130
Which is that Monty always opens,

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.960
he's always gonna offer you that choice,
so he's always gonna open a goat door.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.280
I'm just saying goat door
is a door with a goat.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.640
That's an assumption.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.220
But if Monty opened the door that had
the car then it's a stupid game, right?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.218
Like, it's okay.

00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:50.740
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.690
he's always gonna open
the door with the goat.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.240
That's why he needs to know otherwise
by chance he might spoil the game.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.180
There's one more assumption that
usually doesn't usually get stated but

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.730
it's actually pretty important.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.810
If he has a choice of which door to open.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.710
He picks with equal probabilities.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.180
And the case where that happens is
if initially you guessed right, so

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.290
the car is here.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.030
These ones both have goats.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.050
So Monty could open either door 2 or
door 3, assume those are equally likely.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.366
On the strategic problems,
I posted the new homework and

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.048
the new strategic practice.

00:05:29.048 --> 00:05:32.929
On the strategic practice you'll find
a problem there which is kind of

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:36.768
an extension to the case where,
what you might call Lazy Monty Hall.

00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:41.246
Where he's standing here and
he prefers opening door 2 to door 3,

00:05:41.246 --> 00:05:45.260
cuz he doesn't wanna walk all
the way from here to here.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.000
So suppose he opens this one, probability
P this one probability one minus P.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.040
Where maybe P is greater than one half,
or less than one half, or whatever.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.060
If he has a choice,
sometimes he has no choice right?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.930
Because he's not going to spoil the game,
but sometimes he has a choice.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.860
But for the basic problem we assumed
he picks with equal probabilities.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.870
Okay, and the question is,
should you switch?

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.249
And most people when they first
hear this problem they say,

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.470
okay, well suppose you open door 2.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.800
And you're picking between door 1 and
door 3.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.190
There's two doors.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.310
You don't seemingly have any
information about whether door 1 or

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.490
door 3 is more likely.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.240
It looks kind of symmetrical,
so it's 50/50.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:36.470
And controversy has raged about this
problem for years and years and years.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.023
Part of the controversy is because
people don't understand probability and

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:40.168
they haven't taken Stat 110.

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:41.621
Part of the reason for

00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:47.690
the controversy is that sometimes some of
these key assumptions are left implicit.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.271
And so then you know different people
might interpret it differently.

00:06:51.271 --> 00:06:54.210
So it's important to have
these assumptions clear.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.970
Under these assumptions,
the answer is that you should switch.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.930
And if you switch, your probability
of success is two-thirds, and

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.400
if you stick with your original choice,
your probability of success is one-third.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.163
So, it's better to switch.

00:07:08.163 --> 00:07:09.184
It's not 50/50.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.860
We can't, it's sorta like an abuse
of the naive definition of probably.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.250
If you just immediately say well
it's 50/50 cuz there's two doors and

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.210
we don't know which is which.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.540
Well, it's the naive definition, right?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.350
Assuming they're equal to likely but
why they're equal likely?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.040
We don't know that they're equal
likely given the evidence.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.230
We are assuming that initially I
didn't write this but I said it.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.590
Initially it's one-third, one-third,
one-third as the probabilities.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.700
But that doesn't mean that conditionally
after we observe what happens.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.570
It doesn't mean that it's
still equally likely.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.140
Cuz we have the information.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.840
One key intuitive point.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.440
Suppose that Monty opens door 2.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.820
Just for concreteness.

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:07.211
Well, obviously,
we know that Door 2 has a goat.

00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:13.018
So the kind of naive approach would be,

00:08:13.018 --> 00:08:17.180
well, let's just condition on
the fact that Door 2 has a goat.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.308
And originally, it was one-third,
one-third, one-third.

00:08:19.308 --> 00:08:23.510
And we're getting rid of this, so then
it's still one-half, one-half for these.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.780
There's a subtle flaw in that reasoning.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.431
So we know Door 2 has a goat,
but a key thing with conditioning

00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:38.970
is we wanna condition on all the evidence,
okay?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.610
The evidence is not just
that Door 2 has a goat.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.810
We need to condition on all the evidence.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.060
There's one more key piece
of information there.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.711
That's the fact that
Monty Hall opened Door 2.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.451
So now we're gonna start thinking about,

00:08:56.451 --> 00:08:58.678
why does that matter
that he opened that door?

00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:02.200
So we're not just conditioning
on there being a goat there.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.015
We're conditioning on the fact
that Monty Hall opened Door 2.

00:09:05.015 --> 00:09:09.703
So we have to kind of see,
why is that relevant,

00:09:09.703 --> 00:09:13.006
why does it become two-thirds?

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:17.742
Okay, Door 2, all right, so

00:09:17.742 --> 00:09:22.365
I wanna approach this problem
in a couple different ways.

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:26.369
Maybe three different ways,
one intuitive, one with a tree, and

00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:29.340
one with a probability calculation, okay?

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.620
Actually, two intuitive ways.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.440
There are a lot of ways to think about
this problem, but some of them are wrong.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.670
So I'm gonna show you some
correct ways to think about this.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.960
So first of all, a tree diagram, I think,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.830
is a very good way to
picture this problem.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.123
So let's draw a tree.

00:09:48.731 --> 00:09:53.604
So you choose the door, and just to
simplify not having to draw as many

00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:59.270
branches, I'm gonna assume that
the contestant chooses Door 1.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.701
So choose Door 1, Door 1, okay?

00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:09.660
Now it branches depending on which
door Monty Hall opens, right?

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.340
Monty Hall, well, there's two things.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.680
One is, what's the door that has the car?

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.211
And the other branching is,
what door does Monty Hall open, okay?

00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:25.850
So let's actually do the door
that has the car first.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.490
So it branches three ways, and
these branches each have probability of

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.580
one-third, one-third, one-third,
Door 1, Door 2, Door 3.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.390
So this is just the car door.

00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:42.203
By car door,
I don't mean that the door of the car, but

00:10:42.203 --> 00:10:44.430
the door that has a car behind it.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.352
That's either Door 1, 2, or 3, right?

00:10:46.352 --> 00:10:50.820
And they're equally likely by assumption,
that's the first branch.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.410
Secondly, we have Monty door, that's
whatever door that Monty Hall opens.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.390
And let's just consider the cases.

00:11:02.777 --> 00:11:06.354
We choose Door 1,
the car is behind Door 1.

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:09.950
Then Monty Hall can open either Door 2 or
Door 3.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.620
So that's where he has two choices,
so it branches two ways.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.848
Then he opens Door 2 or Door 3.

00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:20.888
And we're assuming those are equally
likely, so I'm putting one-half,

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.800
one-half on those branches.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.574
Now if we picked Door 1,
and the car is behind 2,

00:11:27.574 --> 00:11:33.059
then Monty Hall has no choice but
to open Door 3, right?

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:37.310
And then he'll offer you,
do you wanna switch to Door 2 or not?

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.064
So in this case, he has no choice,
so this has a probability of 1.

00:11:41.064 --> 00:11:45.730
And then lastly, we picked Door 1,
car is behind Door 3.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.131
Monty Hall has no choice but
to open Door 2 to reveal a goat, right?

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.770
So that is probability 1, Door 2.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:12:01.135
Okay, so now how do we actually use
this tree diagram to get the answer?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.330
Well, we just have to consider cases.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.215
So suppose that Monty Hall opens,

00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:15.380
just for example,
suppose he opens Door 2, okay?

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.380
That means I'm just, basically,
I'm gonna show you how do you do

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.080
conditional probability
in terms of a tree, okay?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.250
So what does it mean?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.441
Suppose we condition on the fact
that Monty opened Door 2.

00:12:25.441 --> 00:12:30.740
That means that it must be that we took
this path here, I'll circled that one.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:36.290
Or we took this path here, right?

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.910
These two are now irrelevant, just like
when I was drawing the pebble diagram.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.150
And when you condition on something,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.420
you delete from your space everything
that you can now rule out, right?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.470
You rule out everything that's
inconsistent with what you observe.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.950
And whatever's left would
be these two cases.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.960
And now let's just see what happens.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.130
The probability of this
path from here to here,

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.210
I'm just multiplying cuz
I'm assuming independent.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.363
Well, I'm assuming that one-half is the
probability of going from here to here if

00:13:05.363 --> 00:13:06.047
you're at here.

00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:08.527
So one-third times one-half is one-sixth.

00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:13.210
And for this branch,
one-third times 1 is one-third.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.300
And remember what I said when we were
doing conditional probabilities using

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.500
the pebble world perspective.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.080
We deleted all the pebbles that
are irrelevant, and then we renormalized,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.350
right, to make the total mass equal to 1.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.063
So if we wanna renormalize one-sixth and

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:35.263
one-third, what we should
do is just multiply by 2.

00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:37.850
Because then I'm making it two-thirds,
one-third.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.835
Now I've renormalized so
that they add up to 1.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:46.293
So what that says is that,
conditional on Monty Hall opening Door 2,

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:51.126
there is a two-thirds chance now
that the car is behind Door 3.

00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:55.020
And there's a one-third chance
that it's behind Door 1.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.680
So therefore, if we switch,
we have a two-thirds chance of success.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.050
So what this thing, the circling,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.399
just showed was that the probability
of success, if switching,

00:14:08.798 --> 00:14:16.330
Given that Monty opens Door 2,
cuz I was assuming he opened Door 2.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:23.930
And we just showed just by this tree
diagram that this is = two-thirds.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.847
Of course, you could do the same
thing if he opens Door 3.

00:14:26.847 --> 00:14:29.970
Just circle the other two, same thing
again, and it's still two-thirds, okay?

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.050
So that's one way to think of it,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.510
just looking at what
are the different possibilities.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.120
And let me just say, and
what does this say intuitively?

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.810
What this says intuitively is one-third of
the time, your initial guess is correct.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.050
And then you would fail if you switched,
right?

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.920
No matter what happened,
you would fail cuz you got it right.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.254
But that's only one-third of the time.

00:14:58.254 --> 00:15:02.530
The other two-thirds of the time
your initial guess is wrong.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.881
Monty opens up a goat door,
and then he should switch.

00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:08.571
So two-thirds of the time you should
switch, I mean, you should always switch.

00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:10.120
Cuz two-thirds of the time
you'll get it right.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.780
And the one-third where you're getting
right is where you were initially correct,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.436
but that's only one-third of the time,
okay?

00:15:17.436 --> 00:15:20.300
So that's a tree diagram,
which I think is useful.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.230
But it's also useful to
just see how can we do this

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.620
as a conditional probability argument.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.220
You can do this problem using Bayes' rule.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.912
But actually, I would prefer to just
use the law of total probability here.

00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:39.477
So let's do this by using the law
of total probability, LOTP.

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:46.179
When we're using the law
of total probability,

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:49.473
the key step is deciding
what to condition on, okay?

00:15:49.473 --> 00:15:53.453
And one of the really nice
things about statistics and

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:57.878
probability that's basically
unique to this subject is,

00:15:57.878 --> 00:16:04.420
with most mathematical subjects, if you
have a problem And you're stuck, right?

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.610
You can't just say well I wish that I
knew this and I wish that I knew that.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.010
Well, you can say that, but
it doesn't help you, right?

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.210
In probability you think I wish
I knew this, I wish I knew that.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.530
That's giving you a hint as to
what you should condition on, and

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.590
then you just condition on it.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.860
And you act as if you did know that.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.480
Okay?
So

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.690
I didn't name the law of
total probability, but

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.660
if I had I would have just called
it wishful thinking, all right?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.530
It's like what do we wish that we knew?

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:37.910
Well, I don't know about you, but for
me the first thing I think of if someone

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.880
asks me, what do I wish that I knew I
wish I knew where the car was, right?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.740
So it's a pretty obvious
thing to think about.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.776
That's what we wish we knew,
so we wish we know car door.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.830
So that's all we wish.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:01.280
We wish we knew where the car is,
so we're gonna condition on that.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.060
That's all, okay?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.870
So So we need to define some events.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.131
I'll just say, let S be

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:17.620
the event that we succeed.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.290
Succeed, assuming that we're
using the switching strategy.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.550
So I'm gonna assume that
we're gonna switch.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.380
And I'm gonna see what the probability
that we succeed by that strategy.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.950
So assuming our strategy is always switch.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.880
You know Monty Hall's gonna give us
the chance to switch, and we'll say yes.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.750
That's our strategy, and

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.770
we wanna see what's the probability
of success of that strategy.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:43.270
Okay, and then let's just let, Dj be

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:49.090
the event that Door j has the car.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.804
So I'm using D for Door, Door j has car.

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:55.590
Where j is just 1, 2, or 3.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.900
Okay so that's just some simple notation.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.950
Now let's do a calculation of
the probability of success.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.434
Law of total probabilities just says
well condition on which door has

00:18:11.434 --> 00:18:14.640
the car that's the only wish we knew.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:21.869
So to do that that's just P(S)=P(S|D1)

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:27.471
which is 1/3 + P(S|D2) which

00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:33.630
is 1/3 + P(S|D3) times 1/3.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.590
So it's P(S|D1), right?

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.750
But P of D1 is the prior probability.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.080
That door one has the car and we're
assuming that there are equally likely to

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.060
start with so it's just 1/3,
1/3, 1/3 for these waits.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.210
Okay now what's this?

00:18:51.605 --> 00:18:55.680
D1, I'm just assuming, remember we're
assuming well we pick door one so

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.470
that means we got it right initially.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.030
But we switch, so that's bad.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.740
This is a bad case.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.830
So this is gonna be 0.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.880
It's never gonna work in that case.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.600
Now in this case, we picked door 1.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.755
The car is behind door 2.

00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:12.430
Monty Hall will open door 3,
and we should switch, right?

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.830
So, we have probability of success 1 here,
1 times 1/3.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.000
Similarly in this case, it's gonna work.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.805
So, that's also 1 = 2/3.

00:19:21.805 --> 00:19:25.690
So, it's actually a very easy calculation,
right?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.420
Because these problems are very, very easy
to compute once we know where the car is.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.644
So, it's 2/3.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.150
There's one slightly subtle
point here which is that

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:41.480
this is the unconditional probability
that our strategy will be successful.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.870
And you could say well what if we
wanted the conditional probability,

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.400
given that Monty Hall opened door 2,
is that gonna be different?

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.860
But in this case, I defined it
symmetrically so by symmetry we also have.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.590
We can make up a notation for
which which door Monty Hall opens.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.720
P(S| Monte opens

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.210
2)= 2/3.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.520
You could write out another law of total
probability calculation if you want,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.188
but all it's a condition on whether
Monty Hall opens door 2 or door 3.

00:20:24.188 --> 00:20:29.846
But by symmetry it couldn't
be because from door 2 and

00:20:29.846 --> 00:20:36.745
door 3 are completely symmetrical
until Monty opens one of them.

00:20:36.745 --> 00:20:38.845
So that means both the conditional and

00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:42.545
the unconditional probabilities
of success are 2/3.

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:45.735
Now in the extension on the strategic
practice that I mentioned,

00:20:45.735 --> 00:20:49.860
the unconditional
probability is still 2/3.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.750
But the conditional probability changes
because in that problem I said that

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.690
Monty Hall is too lazy to walk over and
open door 3 unless he has to or

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.710
that kind of thing.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.155
Then there's an asymmetry but
in this version It's symmetrical,

00:21:02.155 --> 00:21:05.525
so conditional and
unconditional works the same way.

00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:07.485
So okay so we got 2/3.

00:21:07.485 --> 00:21:10.215
And they're nice,
you can easily find applets online,

00:21:10.215 --> 00:21:13.345
I put a link on the webpage for
a nice one that the New York Times had,

00:21:13.345 --> 00:21:15.045
if you wanted to try it out.

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:17.145
There's one thing that, so

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.610
just to tell you a little bit about
the controversy over this problem.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.260
That controversy started raging
when Marilyn vos Savant,

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.670
who writes a column in Parade Magazine.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.080
Someone wrote in and asked this question.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.400
It was not 100% explicitly specified,
all of the assumptions.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.160
But it was fairly clear that
this was what was intended.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.880
And she basically gave the correct answer.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.000
And then thousands of people started
writing in telling her that she was wrong.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.570
Telling her that she was stupid,
including people with PhD's in math and

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.410
just writing all these scathing,
nasty letters to her and

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.390
that controversy was raging for
a long time.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.660
And one thing that I find
ridiculous about that is

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.580
well okay so most people's intuition
about this problem are wrong.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.840
But if you think about it carefully you'll
get the right answer if you have some

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.960
familiarity with conditional probability.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.490
But even for

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.380
people who had no understanding of
any of the stuff I was doing here.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.820
This is a problem that and

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.960
this is true in statistics in general,
you could just simulate it, right?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.960
It's very, very easy to try it
out with a friend, 3 doors.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.310
You can just do it with cups and
props and whatever.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:40.840
You can also do it on a computer, very
very easily, write a little simulation.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.440
Try it out 1,000 times,
just via computer simulation, and

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.720
you'll see that if you switch,
you'll win 2/3 of the.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.820
So I don't understand how people still
continue to argue with that, when you just

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:57.580
try it out, simulate it, you'll see 2/3
of the time you succeed by switching.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.000
I mean it's just It's just
kind of mind boggling but

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.590
maybe some of the math PhD's
didn't want to actually try

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:09.340
it out cuz they thought they
proved that it 1/2 or something.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.340
Anyway, so that's the Monty Hall problem.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.240
I wanted to mention one other intuition
for this, that's kind of unusual.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.930
Usually when we have a complicated
problem, the suggestion would be,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.280
look at a simpler case.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:28.540
But I did emphasize the fact that
it's useful to consider simple and

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.620
extreme cases.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:36.610
So an extreme case here would
be what if instead of 3 doors,

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.620
what if we considered the Monty Hall
problem with a million doors?

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.495
So you pick one of those one million doors
and then Monty Hall proceeds to open

00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:51.810
999,998 doors leaving just
one door should you switch.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.665
In that case, I've never met anyone
who would not switch, right.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.950
I've never met anyone like that.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.210
That because with a million
doors you're extremely confident

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.060
that your initial guess is wrong and

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.840
you're extremely confident that that
one remaining door has the car.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.610
Conceptually though, there's no
difference between that and this.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:21.062
It's like three doors or
a million doors, it's the argument for

00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:25.110
one-half, one-half here would apply
in the same way with a million doors.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.170
It's just in that case everyone sees
intuitively that it's ridiculous and

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.720
here people don't have that intuition.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.665
So anyways,
that's another intuition from the problem.

00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:38.395
All right, so
that's the Monty Hall problem.

00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:45.115
You should look at the strategic practice
problem, and on the homework three,

00:24:45.115 --> 00:24:51.185
there's an extension with more than
three doors that you can think about.

00:24:51.185 --> 00:24:56.140
I'm talking on that problem about the case
where Monty Hall Possibly leaves more than

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.720
one door still unopened.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.250
But anyway, you can work on that later.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.510
But this is just an introduction
to the Monty Hall.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.590
So, that's a very famous fun problem,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:09.490
but I think it also illustrate a lot
about how to think conditionally, right?

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.410
Like the tree is useful this perspective,

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.920
it's just the problem is really easy when
you set it up this way, but if you just

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.620
try to just apply naive intuition then
most people get this completely wrong.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.730
Okay.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.810
So let's do another example.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.020
So this example.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.611
Is called Simpson's paradox.

00:25:33.611 --> 00:25:41.015
It's another kind of notorious,
Problem or paradox that comes up.

00:25:43.261 --> 00:25:46.020
It comes up a lot in everyday life.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.950
And it's another problem where
most people see it the first time,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.080
it seems impossible and
then they think they understand it,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.368
then change a few things around and
then they fall for it again.

00:25:57.368 --> 00:26:00.980
So, I love paradoxes in general so

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.650
we'll be seeing a lot of
paradoxes in this course.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.380
So the best way,

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.110
I mean I could start making up some
abstract notation and stuff, but

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:16.970
the best way to start understanding
Simpson's paradox is to see an examples.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.316
So I'll write down an example,
and then we can discuss that and

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:26.333
then we can try to write out with
the more general thing that's going on.

00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:30.733
By the way, there is no such thing
as a true paradox, a real paradox.

00:26:30.733 --> 00:26:33.544
If there were a real paradox,
we'd have a contradiction,

00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:36.540
and the universe would explode,
and we would not be here.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.041
So there are no paradoxes
in the literal sense.

00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:44.482
What it is though, is something that's
deeply counter-intuitive to most people.

00:26:44.482 --> 00:26:47.210
Which means it forces you to think harder.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.280
And if you think hard enough,

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.780
then eventually, you understand
that actually, it does make sense.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.200
But you have to think hard, okay?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.392
So here's the problem, one example.

00:26:58.392 --> 00:27:04.239
Is it possible to have two
doctors where the first

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:09.944
doctor has a higher success
rate at every single

00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:16.946
possible type of surgery
imaginable than the second one?

00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:20.772
Name any surgery, first doctor is more
successful than the second doctor,

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:24.470
measured in terms of percentage
of successful outcome.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:30.240
Yet the second doctor, overall,
has a higher success rate.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.420
That's the basic question.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.390
Okay, well Simpson's paradox
says that that's possible.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.870
And at first that sounds
wrong to most people.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.390
Because it sounds like if

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.570
person a is better than person b in
every single category then when you

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.140
aggregate those categories together
it's not gonna somehow flip, right?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.160
Except that's wrong since this
paradox says it can flip.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.960
The signs of inequalities can flip
when you aggregate data together.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.220
So one thing seems better than
another in every individual case.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.866
You add up all those cases to get the
total, and then it flips which way it is?

00:28:06.866 --> 00:28:10.325
So that sounds really weird at first, but

00:28:10.325 --> 00:28:12.735
I'm just gonna illustrate
through a very simple example.

00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:14.975
And if you think carefully
about this simple example,

00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:18.245
then you can see what's really going
on there, why is that possible.

00:28:19.835 --> 00:28:22.746
Okay, so
I like to illustrate Simpson's paradox

00:28:22.746 --> 00:28:26.570
through examples that I make
up based on the Simpsons.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:32.610
As I've been watching the Simpsons
since I was a kid and I like the show.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.010
And it helps me remember the example
that the Simpsons paradox.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.890
So I don't know how many of you watch the
Simpsons, but it doesn't matter if you do.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:46.940
On the Simpsons there are two doctors Dr.
Hibbert and Dr. Nick, okay?

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.800
The data that I'm gonna
give you are made up.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.600
They don't actually tell you the
percentage of success on the show, okay?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.380
But anyway, Dr. Hibbert is kind
of the reasonably well respected

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.610
town doctor that everyone who can afford
to goes to, but he's gonna charge a lot.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.480
Doctor Nick is like the guy
with the infomercials on TV

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.720
who advertises that he'll perform
any surgery for 129.99, okay?

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.030
So probably most

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.460
people would consider Dr.
Hibbert to be the better doctor and Dr.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.470
Nick is kind of like a a cheap,
quack doctor, okay?

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.390
Now, I made up some numbers.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.200
So, suppose for simplicity,
to understand the paradox,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.040
we only need to consider
two types of surgeries.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.410
Once you understand what happens with two
surgeries you can easily see what would

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.650
happen if you had like 50
different types of surgery.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.520
But to understand that the crucial
phenomenon, remains what is assumed

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.330
that there's two doctors,
two different types of surgeries, okay?

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.542
So I made up some numbers, and

00:29:55.542 --> 00:30:00.331
we can summarize everything in
terms of two, two by two tables.

00:30:02.763 --> 00:30:03.970
Okay?

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.994
One table for Dr. Hibbert.

00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:11.058
And one table for Dr. Nick.

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:16.280
And I'm gonna fill in some numbers.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.660
So these tables represent two types
of surgeries and success or failure.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.400
So let's just write success here.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.600
First row is for success.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.020
Second row is for failure.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.520
So each doctor performs
a certain number of surgeries.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.210
And to simplify things,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.883
I think I assumed that each doctor
performs 100 surgeries total.

00:30:37.883 --> 00:30:41.861
So there's nothing going on where you'd
say one doctor is doing a lot more

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:42.900
surgeries total.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.402
This is success failure for Dr. Nick.

00:30:46.402 --> 00:30:51.928
And let's assume that there
are only two types of surgeries,

00:30:51.928 --> 00:30:55.646
one is heart surgery and the other one is,

00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:59.912
I just made up and example,
a bandage removal.

00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.870
I just tried to make up
something that seems hard.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:11.498
I'm not a doctor obviously, well doctor
of philosophy but that doesn't count.

00:31:11.498 --> 00:31:15.300
One's an easy surgery and
one's a difficult surgery, okay?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.915
Like bandage removal I can do.

00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:19.260
Now I can't do heart surgery.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.740
So, all right, I made up some numbers.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:27.630
So suppose that Dr.
Hibbert performed 90 heart surgeries and

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.580
succeeded 70 times, failed 20 times.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:35.318
And suppose that he performed 10 bandage
removals and succeeded all 10 times.

00:31:35.318 --> 00:31:43.801
Now, Dr.
Nick performed 10 heart surgeries.

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:49.439
Succeeded 2, failed 8 times,

00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:52.618
that's kind of sad.

00:31:52.618 --> 00:31:56.112
He performed 90 bandage removals,

00:31:56.112 --> 00:32:00.376
he succeeded 81 times, he failed 9 times.

00:32:00.376 --> 00:32:03.530
Some how,
he failed 9 times at bandage removal.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:11.830
Now, how many of you would rather
go to Dr. Hibbert than Dr. Nick?

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.237
Would anyone here prefer to go to Dr.
Nick, based on this data?

00:32:16.237 --> 00:32:17.667
No?

00:32:17.667 --> 00:32:23.533
[COUGH] Okay, well, I would definitely
prefer to go to Dr. Hibbert.

00:32:23.533 --> 00:32:27.693
But on the other hand,
you could argue from this that Dr.

00:32:27.693 --> 00:32:30.821
Hibbert is successful 80% of the time.

00:32:35.571 --> 00:32:39.518
And Dr. Nick had 83 successes.

00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:44.451
So on his infomercial,
he can say he succeeded 83%

00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:49.171
of the time and
that 3% better than Dr. Hibbert.

00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:53.695
And yet you're paying so much less for
a 3% higher success rate.

00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:55.955
So what did we do to get 80 and 83?

00:32:55.955 --> 00:32:57.845
We were just aggregating, right?

00:32:57.845 --> 00:33:01.470
Here I listed out separately by surgery.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.370
Here we aggregated.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.230
Notice that the direction flipped, okay?

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.580
So for each individual surgery, Dr.
Hibbert is better.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.950
So that's conditional, right?

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.340
So it's the difference between
conditional and unconditional.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.660
Conditional on which type of surgery.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.600
If you condition on performing heart
surgery, you'd rather have Dr. Hibbert.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.948
If you condition on having band-aid
removal, you'd rather have Dr.

00:33:26.948 --> 00:33:28.117
Hibbert, right?

00:33:28.117 --> 00:33:33.110
But unconditionally, Dr.
Nick has a higher percentage rate.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.970
And the reason, you can see it here.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.960
I just made this up as kind of an extreme
example so that you get some intuition.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.156
You see what's going on is that 90% of Dr.
Nick's surgeries are band-aid removals.

00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:48.300
Well, band-aid removal is so much easier
than heart surgery that it would be very

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.980
easy for him to get a higher success rate
because he's doing easier surgeries.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.979
And you can see, of course,
this is just made up.

00:33:54.979 --> 00:33:59.615
But in real examples you can imagine
that maybe the most famous and

00:33:59.615 --> 00:34:04.670
most renowned best neurosurgeons in
the world, could be the that their

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:10.420
success rate isn't as great because
they're getting the hardest cases right?

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.639
They're getting the cases that no
one else knows how to deal with.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.358
So you refer to the world's
leading expert, and

00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:19.200
that's gonna hurt their success rate,
right?

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.880
So that's what's going on.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.600
That's an example of Simpson's paradox.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.240
I think when you see this example
it's clear how that can happen.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.252
And yet, in problems that are completely
the same, just in a different language

00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:34.270
different setting,
then it sounds like it's impossible.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.595
How can it flip like that?

00:34:36.595 --> 00:34:37.540
Okay?

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.422
So let me explain it a couple other ways
and mention a couple other examples.

00:34:45.675 --> 00:34:50.358
Another way to think of Simpson's paradox,
well here's another example.

00:34:51.371 --> 00:34:56.799
[COUGH] In baseball,
it's possible to have two players

00:34:56.799 --> 00:35:02.250
where the first player has
a higher batting average.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.300
A batting average is just what
percentage of times they were at

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.560
bat that they got a hit.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.828
One player has a higher batting average
for the first half of the season and for

00:35:11.828 --> 00:35:13.890
the second half of the season.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.459
Yet, if you look at the whole season,

00:35:15.459 --> 00:35:17.505
the second player has
a higher batting average.

00:35:17.505 --> 00:35:19.900
And again,
that sounds impossible at first.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.370
If you are better for the first
half of the season and better for

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.215
the second half of the season how could
you be worst for the whole season?

00:35:25.215 --> 00:35:28.010
But you can see that it's basically the
same problem is that you can easily make

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.400
up some numbers to illustrate that.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.950
So it can flip.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.540
What's really going on here,

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:38.270
another way to look at it, is just
in terms of adding fractions, okay?

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:44.149
So if you had one-third plus two-fifths.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.997
Well, let's see,
I haven't added any fractions in a while.

00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:53.741
But I think you're not supposed
to just add the numerators and

00:35:53.741 --> 00:35:55.580
add the denominators, right?

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.390
This is not equal to three-eighths, right?

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.310
That's our inequality for the day.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.640
If you haven't studied adding fractions
before, when you're learning for

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.180
the first time,
that's kinda the obvious thing to do.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:10.960
Add the numerators.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.781
Add the denominator.

00:36:11.781 --> 00:36:14.600
Well, that doesn't actually work, right?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.520
However, if you add fractions this way,

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.400
that is closer to how you aggregate,
right?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.540
Because we're just adding up successes and
adding up trials, right?

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.460
So that is sort of how we do
the aggregation here, right?

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.770
Add up the successes.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.074
Add up the total number of trials,
that kind of thing.

00:36:34.074 --> 00:36:40.230
So if fractions were added this way,
then Simpson's paradox would not occur.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.470
But since that's not how we add fractions,
it doesn't happen.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.310
Okay, they're a lot of other examples
of Simpson's paradox if you just

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.050
look at the Wikipedia entry, and
you can find as many as you want.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.407
Examples that happen in real life and

00:36:55.407 --> 00:36:59.752
actually have policy implications and
legal.

00:36:59.752 --> 00:37:02.569
There are some interesting legal
cases involving Simpson's paradox.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.475
Let me talk about how do we express
Simpson's Paradox in terms of

00:37:09.475 --> 00:37:11.505
conditional probability?

00:37:11.505 --> 00:37:18.570
So, just to kind of map this
example into some events.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:24.850
Let's let A be the event that surgery,
suppose someone's going to have surgery,

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.901
and let A be the event that
the surgery is successful.

00:37:33.135 --> 00:37:37.595
And then we'll try to write out in
probability notation what is this example

00:37:37.595 --> 00:37:38.440
saying?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.030
Okay?

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.544
So let A be the event that
the surgery is successful.

00:37:42.544 --> 00:37:47.237
Let B be the event that
we're treated by Dr. Nick.

00:37:53.925 --> 00:37:56.257
So, B complement would correspond to Dr.
Hibbert.

00:37:56.257 --> 00:37:58.245
So we don't need separate notation for
that.

00:37:58.245 --> 00:38:03.291
And then we need one more event,
which is what type of surgery?

00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:04.890
So let's call that C.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.020
C be the event that we have heart surgery.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.770
So C complement is band-aid removal, okay?

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.710
So those are the events that we need.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:16.520
And let's just write out,

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.330
in probability notation,
what are these tables telling us?

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:21.830
Okay?

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:22.932
Well, what's it saying?

00:38:22.932 --> 00:38:30.806
It's says the probability of success
given that we're treated by Dr.

00:38:30.806 --> 00:38:35.500
Nick, and we're having heart surgery,
is less than the probability

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:44.090
that the surgery is successful given that
we have Dr. Herbert for heart surgery.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.020
Right, that's just comparing
the two heart surgeries.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.320
Now, what about for band-aid removal?

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.344
The probability of success for
band-aid removal, again,

00:38:55.344 --> 00:39:01.164
it's less likely to have success with Dr.
Nick, than Dr. Hibbert.

00:39:01.164 --> 00:39:06.459
So this is just gonna be A given
B complement, C complement.

00:39:06.459 --> 00:39:07.115
Okay?

00:39:07.115 --> 00:39:08.820
So those are the two statements we have.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:15.150
But overall, when you aggregate,
and aggregating means

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.130
don't condition on the type of surgery,
then we're just looking at the overall.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.195
So overall, the probability of A given B,
that is success,

00:39:23.195 --> 00:39:27.423
given that you're being treated by Dr.
Nick, is greater than

00:39:27.423 --> 00:39:32.472
the probability of success,
given that you're treated by Dr. Hibbert.

00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:37.760
So notice, it looks like these
expressions look similar.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.800
And it looks like if you
combine these two cases,

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.190
all these are A given B on the left,
and we have the two cases.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.930
Given C, given C complement.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.800
Looks like you combine
those cases you get this.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.910
But if you add up or
combine these inequalities somehow,

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.790
then you would guess that it would remain
less than but then the inequality flipped.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.450
So, Simpson's Paradox says
that this is possible.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.450
This is an explicit example
showing that that's possible.

00:40:08.562 --> 00:40:10.272
C is called a confounder.

00:40:17.221 --> 00:40:21.586
I chose the letter C cuz it can stand for
confounder or control.

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.680
It's something you wanna control for.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.913
In this problem,

00:40:24.913 --> 00:40:30.602
it seems a lot more relevant to condition
on what type of surgery you have, right?

00:40:30.602 --> 00:40:35.337
So the more relevant comparison would be
the more conditional one in this case.

00:40:35.337 --> 00:40:37.477
And everyone here agrees that Dr.

00:40:37.477 --> 00:40:42.090
Hibbert is better, that means we
should condition on more things.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.766
If we fail to condition on C, though,

00:40:44.766 --> 00:40:48.291
we can get a very misleading answer here,
right?

00:40:48.291 --> 00:40:54.029
Because of the fact that if we don't
condition on the type of heart surgery,

00:40:54.029 --> 00:40:57.796
what happens is knowing
that we got treated by Dr.

00:40:57.796 --> 00:41:02.383
Nick gives us information about
what type of surgery we had.

00:41:02.383 --> 00:41:06.100
Which then in turn affects
the probability of success.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.440
So that's Simpson's Paradox,

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.250
and this is just kinda like the general
setting of Simpson's Paradox.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:17.991
So basically any example of Simpson's
Paradox can be written in this form.

00:41:17.991 --> 00:41:21.936
So I would take the definition of
Simpson's Paradox is whenever you have

00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:25.440
these inequalities but
it flips when you aggregate in this way.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.702
That's a concrete example.

00:41:26.702 --> 00:41:29.070
That's just the generic setting.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.478
Okay, so you should try to think
intuitively about why is this possible,

00:41:33.478 --> 00:41:35.266
by thinking about examples.

00:41:35.266 --> 00:41:39.711
Think about why this is possible.

00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:42.939
And think about you know should
you be conditioning on C.

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:48.027
And then there's one other thing
that I wanted to mention about this,

00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:52.597
just to go into a little bit more
of the math of those equations,

00:41:52.597 --> 00:41:54.944
why is that actually possible?

00:41:54.944 --> 00:41:58.433
In the sense that the first
time that I saw this,

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:03.858
I thought that from here and here,
I thought I could probably prove this.

00:42:03.858 --> 00:42:06.720
Because it looks like it's gonna
be the law of total probabilities.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.991
So I'm gonna show you what goes wrong.

00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:13.281
Obviously it's not gonna work
to prove less than here,

00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.578
because we just saw an example
that it could go this way.

00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:19.064
But what if you were trying
to prove that this and

00:42:19.064 --> 00:42:21.875
this implies this with a less than,
will it go wrong?

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:24.978
I just wanted to show you quickly what
would be wrong with that argument.

00:42:24.978 --> 00:42:29.891
So the obvious argument to
make is I wanna A\B to A\B,C

00:42:29.891 --> 00:42:34.710
that means we need to use
the law of total probability.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:41.320
So by the law of total probability,
I would be conditioning on C.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.271
This is just the conditional form
of the law of total probability.

00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:48.547
Conditional probabilities are
probabilities, so I can do Bayes' rule,

00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:51.875
law of total probability, anything I want,
it's gonna work the same way,

00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:53.183
just everything's given B.

00:42:53.183 --> 00:42:57.231
So I'm conditioning on C,
whether C happened or not.

00:42:57.231 --> 00:43:03.262
But everything is still given
B is the conditional form,

00:43:03.262 --> 00:43:10.060
+ A given B, C complement,
P(C) complement given B, okay?

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.468
So if you deleted the given Bs everywhere,

00:43:14.468 --> 00:43:19.850
this would just be exactly the law
of total probability, right?

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.632
And so therefore this is true,
cuz conditional probabilities

00:43:22.632 --> 00:43:25.105
are probabilities, so
it's still true with given Bs.

00:43:25.105 --> 00:43:30.253
Now if we compare this with what we had,

00:43:30.253 --> 00:43:35.713
we know that A given BC,
this thing is less

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:40.559
than P(A given B complement in C).

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:48.770
And this thing is less than P(A
given B complement and C complement.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.530
So you would then you
would wanna plug those in.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.230
But at that point in the calculation,

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.040
you're not gonna be able
to reduce it down to this.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.320
It's because of this term and
this term, we might call those weights.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.624
Those are conditional on B, right?

00:44:07.624 --> 00:44:10.414
And if we tried to write the same
thing for P(A given B complement),

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.979
then we would have B complement here,
and B complement there.

00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:17.773
But we don't have any way to relate
those weights for one case or

00:44:17.773 --> 00:44:20.770
the other, so it's not gonna follow.

00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:26.693
[COUGH] So
it's important to contrast this with

00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:31.342
the law of total probability, basically.

00:44:31.342 --> 00:44:34.422
Intuitively, what this term is in that Dr.
Nick case,

00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:38.619
this is the probability of performing
heart surgery for Dr. Nick, which is

00:44:38.619 --> 00:44:42.506
very different from the probability
of heart surgery for Dr Hibbert.

00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:48.921
So the weights change, and that's what
enables Simpson's Paradox to happen.

00:44:48.921 --> 00:44:52.913
Okay, so let me mention one or

00:44:52.913 --> 00:44:58.673
two more examples of Simpson's Paradox.

00:45:01.722 --> 00:45:07.257
So here's another one that's a pretty
famous one that involved it.

00:45:07.257 --> 00:45:12.273
A court case, so
what happened was that [COUGH] there

00:45:12.273 --> 00:45:16.940
was a lawsuit against
UC Berkeley claiming a sex

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:22.902
discrimination in admissions
to their graduate programs.

00:45:22.902 --> 00:45:28.458
That is claiming that UC Berkeley
was discriminating against women for

00:45:28.458 --> 00:45:31.246
admissions to graduate programs.

00:45:31.246 --> 00:45:36.461
And something interesting happened,
in the sense that when

00:45:36.461 --> 00:45:41.573
you kind of looked at kind of
the overall admissions rates,

00:45:41.573 --> 00:45:45.868
it looked like UC Berkeley
was making it easier for

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:49.360
men to get in than women for grad school.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.115
So then it seems to be a clear-cut
case of discrimination.

00:45:52.115 --> 00:45:57.220
When you look at the data more closely
than that, then something different

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:02.579
turned up, which was the fact that if
you look at each individual department.

00:46:02.579 --> 00:46:06.229
Cuz when you were apply to grad school,
you apply to a specific department, right?

00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:11.045
For each individual department,
there was not clear evidence, right?

00:46:11.045 --> 00:46:15.689
So each individual departmency,
I'm not saying they were all exactly fair.

00:46:15.689 --> 00:46:20.600
But each individual department generally
did not seem to be discriminating.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.591
But when you aggregated all
of the departments together,

00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:27.854
then it seemed like it
was very unfair to women.

00:46:27.854 --> 00:46:32.656
And the reason is that certain
departments are more popular for

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:35.289
women to apply to relative to men.

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:38.443
And certain departments are harder
to get into than others and

00:46:38.443 --> 00:46:41.970
somehow those things are what led
to Simpson's Paradox occurring.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.170
All right,
one more example of Simpson's Paradox.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.980
This is actually the first one.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.620
I love paradoxes for a long time.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:57.130
And this was the first one I ever saw, and
I still find it helpful to think about it.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.180
Let's see how does it work?

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:06.640
We have two jars like
that with jelly beans.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.160
So though, if I were phrasing it now,
I would use gummy bears.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.125
But I first learned this
problem with jelly beans.

00:47:11.125 --> 00:47:13.489
There's two types of jelly beans.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:18.500
Let's say open circles and closed circles,

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.460
and two flavors of jelly beans, okay?

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:29.680
In these two jars, and
there's two more jars here, okay?

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.810
And there's more jelly beans.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:31.950
I'm not gonna make up numbers.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:36.280
All I'm saying is that there are two types
of jelly beans in each of these four jars.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:43.025
Okay, now suppose that this, suppose that
you like one flavor better than another.

00:47:43.025 --> 00:47:47.894
So you get to choose a random jelly
bean from this jar or this jar, right?

00:47:47.894 --> 00:47:49.058
But you just have to reach in, and

00:47:49.058 --> 00:47:51.025
you can't actually pick
which color you're getting.

00:47:51.025 --> 00:47:54.060
So you just pick a random jelly
bean from this jar or this jar.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.913
And suppose this jar is
better than this jar.

00:47:57.913 --> 00:47:58.904
By greater than,

00:47:58.904 --> 00:48:02.874
I mean that this jar has a higher
percentage of the one you like, right?

00:48:02.874 --> 00:48:05.152
And suppose this jar you can
make up your own numbers.

00:48:05.152 --> 00:48:09.370
It's actually good practice to make up
your own specific numbers for this.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.496
Suppose that this jar is
better than this jar, okay?

00:48:13.496 --> 00:48:16.121
That is, a higher percentage
of the jelly mean you like.

00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:23.497
Now suppose that someone then created
a bigger jar and then created a bigger.

00:48:23.497 --> 00:48:25.270
I should've used a board where
I could write this below.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:29.110
These two jars,
just dumped everything into one big jar.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.860
So this one and
this one all got dumped into here.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:35.340
And this one and
this one all got dumped into here, okay?

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:39.198
So I combined the two better jars and
I combined the two worse jars.

00:48:39.198 --> 00:48:41.870
Well, naively you'd think, well,
I combine the better ones,

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:43.520
that's gonna be better, okay?

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.925
But then it could flip, and
after you aggregate the jars,

00:48:46.925 --> 00:48:51.179
suddenly this one has a higher
percentage of your favorite jelly beans.

00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:55.050
You should make up your own example, your
own numbers showing all that I can have.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.940
And I'll give you a lot of intuition for
Simpson's Paradox.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.320
Okay, so that's all for
today, have a good weekend
