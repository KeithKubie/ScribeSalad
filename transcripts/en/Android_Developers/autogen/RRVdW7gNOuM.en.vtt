Android development like Android

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839
Android development like Android
 

00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:21.309
Android development like Android
developers Paris android usergroup etc

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:21.319
developers Paris android usergroup etc
 

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:24.280
developers Paris android usergroup etc
is there any circle form from a pact

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.290
is there any circle form from a pact
 

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.340
is there any circle form from a pact
area anyway place I can find out this

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.350
area anyway place I can find out this
 

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.360
area anyway place I can find out this
information um I guess the answer to

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.370
information um I guess the answer to
 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.840
information um I guess the answer to
this question is really arm because all

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:34.850
this question is really arm because all
 

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.840
this question is really arm because all
the circles are created by these

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:37.850
the circles are created by these
 

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.869
the circles are created by these
particular groups and it's really open

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:40.879
particular groups and it's really open
 

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.769
particular groups and it's really open
to all this community of I think the

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:44.779
to all this community of I think the
 

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.420
to all this community of I think the
best way to find out whether there's a

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:46.430
best way to find out whether there's a
 

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.509
best way to find out whether there's a
there's an existing group for the area

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519
there's an existing group for the area
 

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.569
there's an existing group for the area
is to reach out to these music groups

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:52.579
is to reach out to these music groups
 

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:55.329
is to reach out to these music groups
and see what they have created one and

00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:55.339
and see what they have created one and
 

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.369
and see what they have created one and
if not you may want to encourage them to

00:09:57.369 --> 00:09:57.379
if not you may want to encourage them to
 

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.340
if not you may want to encourage them to
play one arm probably that's the best

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.350
play one arm probably that's the best
 

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.379
play one arm probably that's the best
way to do to find out the information

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:04.389
way to do to find out the information
 

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:06.819
way to do to find out the information
yeah I might just add that a lot of

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:06.829
yeah I might just add that a lot of
 

00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:09.790
yeah I might just add that a lot of
these google developer communities so

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800
these google developer communities so
 

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.929
these google developer communities so
typically we have to track types of two

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:13.939
typically we have to track types of two
 

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:15.009
typically we have to track types of two
names that are given to these

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:15.019
names that are given to these
 

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:17.019
names that are given to these
communities one is a google developer

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:17.029
communities one is a google developer
 

00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:19.720
communities one is a google developer
group which is GD g and often they they

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:19.730
group which is GD g and often they they
 

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.879
group which is GD g and often they they
cover more than just android so we have

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:21.889
cover more than just android so we have
 

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:23.199
cover more than just android so we have
a you know google has a number of

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:23.209
a you know google has a number of
 

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:25.300
a you know google has a number of
technologies and those communities are

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:25.310
technologies and those communities are
 

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.100
technologies and those communities are
interested in all of them yeah by the

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.110
interested in all of them yeah by the
 

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.559
interested in all of them yeah by the
way it was it was originally called G

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:29.569
way it was it was originally called G
 

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:33.610
way it was it was originally called G
Tugg tub so a lot of developers may may

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:33.620
Tugg tub so a lot of developers may may
 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.980
Tugg tub so a lot of developers may may
may not get used to the new branding so

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:35.990
may not get used to the new branding so
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.470
may not get used to the new branding so
right yeah google so that was Google

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480
right yeah google so that was Google
 

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.030
right yeah google so that was Google
technology user group that was the old

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040
technology user group that was the old
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.160
technology user group that was the old
brand it used to be called G toggle

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.170
brand it used to be called G toggle
 

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.019
brand it used to be called G toggle
google technology as a group recently

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:44.029
google technology as a group recently
 

00:10:44.029 --> 00:10:45.879
google technology as a group recently
been changed to Google developer groups

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:45.889
been changed to Google developer groups
 

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:48.370
been changed to Google developer groups
GD geez so have a look to see if there

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:48.380
GD geez so have a look to see if there
 

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.160
GD geez so have a look to see if there
are any in your area you according to

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.170
are any in your area you according to
 

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.290
are any in your area you according to
you post you from Taiwan so there could

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300
you post you from Taiwan so there could
 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.480
you post you from Taiwan so there could
be some communities there the other type

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.490
be some communities there the other type
 

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.850
be some communities there the other type
of community that you find they tend to

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:57.860
of community that you find they tend to
 

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.590
of community that you find they tend to
call themselves Android user groups or

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600
call themselves Android user groups or
 

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.439
call themselves Android user groups or
Android developer groups and they also

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:02.449
Android developer groups and they also
 

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:05.470
Android developer groups and they also
exist enough they typically are kind of

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480
exist enough they typically are kind of
 

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.100
exist enough they typically are kind of
like a subset of the

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.110
like a subset of the
 

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.800
like a subset of the
tons of the GD G's in that they they

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:09.810
tons of the GD G's in that they they
 

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.480
tons of the GD G's in that they they
specialize purely on Android so these

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:11.490
specialize purely on Android so these
 

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.819
specialize purely on Android so these
are like-minded people that are really

00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:13.829
are like-minded people that are really
 

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:17.090
are like-minded people that are really
interested in Android development and so

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100
interested in Android development and so
 

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.769
interested in Android development and so
what I would suggest is how to do a

00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779
what I would suggest is how to do a
 

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:20.600
what I would suggest is how to do a
search on Google Plus because i often

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:20.610
search on Google Plus because i often
 

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.880
search on Google Plus because i often
many of these communities have google+

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:22.890
many of these communities have google+
 

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.670
many of these communities have google+
pages and you know failing that do it do

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680
pages and you know failing that do it do
 

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.920
pages and you know failing that do it do
a search on google itself i know that

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:27.930
a search on google itself i know that
 

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.790
a search on google itself i know that
the communities in in sydney and in

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800
the communities in in sydney and in
 

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.269
the communities in in sydney and in
melbourne used meetup com to organize

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279
melbourne used meetup com to organize
 

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.430
melbourne used meetup com to organize
their events so again your local

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440
their events so again your local
 

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.579
their events so again your local
community may use a site like meet up or

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:40.589
community may use a site like meet up or
 

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:44.630
community may use a site like meet up or
something else to do so i'll just to add

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640
something else to do so i'll just to add
 

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.240
something else to do so i'll just to add
to that not sure where which region are

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.250
to that not sure where which region are
 

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.190
to that not sure where which region are
you from in part from Taiwan but

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200
you from in part from Taiwan but
 

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.769
you from in part from Taiwan but
definitely there are two very active or

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779
definitely there are two very active or
 

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:55.040
definitely there are two very active or
GDG ones in Taipei and other one is in

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.050
GDG ones in Taipei and other one is in
 

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:01.000
GDG ones in Taipei and other one is in
culture yeah great alright thanks Tony

culture yeah great alright thanks Tony
 

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:06.650
culture yeah great alright thanks Tony
all right we have a another question

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660
all right we have a another question
 

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.040
all right we have a another question
from Owen Cassidy in Sydney is there a

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.050
from Owen Cassidy in Sydney is there a
 

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.710
from Owen Cassidy in Sydney is there a
way to harness the two finger gesture to

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720
way to harness the two finger gesture to
 

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.800
way to harness the two finger gesture to
expand notifications in other areas for

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:15.810
expand notifications in other areas for
 

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.680
expand notifications in other areas for
example to expand a relative layout to

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:18.690
example to expand a relative layout to
 

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.829
example to expand a relative layout to
reveal more information so the two

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839
reveal more information so the two
 

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.319
reveal more information so the two
finger gesture notification is is

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:24.329
finger gesture notification is is
 

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:27.769
finger gesture notification is is
something that we added as part of the

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:27.779
something that we added as part of the
 

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.670
something that we added as part of the
rich notification feature in jellybean

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680
rich notification feature in jellybean
 

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.380
rich notification feature in jellybean
and basically what it does is that

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.390
and basically what it does is that
 

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.150
and basically what it does is that
you're kind of on your device that

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160
you're kind of on your device that
 

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.400
you're kind of on your device that
allows you to get a notification use two

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:37.410
allows you to get a notification use two
 

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.759
allows you to get a notification use two
fingers you sort of swipe down and it

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:40.769
fingers you sort of swipe down and it
 

00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:42.590
fingers you sort of swipe down and it
expands that notification or you can use

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
expands that notification or you can use
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.300
expands that notification or you can use
two fingers to swipe off to shrink that

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.310
two fingers to swipe off to shrink that
 

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.150
two fingers to swipe off to shrink that
notification and that's something that

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160
notification and that's something that
 

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.460
notification and that's something that
we've added especially for notifications

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.470
we've added especially for notifications
 

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.340
we've added especially for notifications
in relative layouts that behavior is not

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:52.350
in relative layouts that behavior is not
 

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.639
in relative layouts that behavior is not
the default behavior you can of course

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:54.649
the default behavior you can of course
 

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:58.220
the default behavior you can of course
capture those touch events and react to

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:58.230
capture those touch events and react to
 

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.860
capture those touch events and react to
them but it is code that you will have

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:00.870
them but it is code that you will have
 

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.259
them but it is code that you will have
to build yourself it is certainly not

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:03.269
to build yourself it is certainly not
 

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:05.980
to build yourself it is certainly not
something that's provided out of the box

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:05.990
something that's provided out of the box
 

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.500
something that's provided out of the box
so yeah I mean it sounds like that that

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:09.510
so yeah I mean it sounds like that that
 

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.470
so yeah I mean it sounds like that that
could be a usage pattern that might

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480
could be a usage pattern that might
 

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.800
could be a usage pattern that might
become more popular but you'll need to

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:15.810
become more popular but you'll need to
 

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.120
become more popular but you'll need to
build it yourself all right we

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.130
build it yourself all right we
 

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.910
build it yourself all right we
have a another question from what we

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920
have a another question from what we
 

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.850
have a another question from what we
from someone called nail I apologize if

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860
from someone called nail I apologize if
 

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.310
from someone called nail I apologize if
I've mispronounced your name from San

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320
I've mispronounced your name from San
