00:00:00.212 --> 00:00:01.829
- [Instructor] What we're going
to do in this video is try

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.597
to get a graphical appreciation
for inflection points,

00:00:05.597 --> 00:00:08.752
which we also cover in some
detail in other videos.

00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:10.638
So, the first thing to appreciate

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:14.177
is an inflection point
is a point on our graph

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:17.414
where our slope goes from
decreasing to increasing

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:20.234
or from increasing to decreasing.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:23.602
So, right over here I have
the graph of some function,

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:24.837
and let me draw the slope

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:26.954
of a tangent line at different points.

00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:29.341
So, when x is equal to negative two,

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.524
that is what the tangent line looks like.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:32.970
And you can see its slope.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.938
And then as we increase x,

00:00:34.938 --> 00:00:39.510
we can see that the slope is
positive, but it is decreasing.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.038
Then it goes to zero, and
then it goes negative,

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:44.612
and the slope keeps decreasing,

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:47.813
all the way until we
get, it looks like we get

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:50.044
to about x equals negative one,

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:54.028
and then our slope
begins to increase again.

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:55.745
So, something interesting happened

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.292
right at x equals negative one,

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.807
and so that's a pretty good indication.

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:01.179
We're just doing it graphically here.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:02.556
We're not proving it.

00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.382
But that at this point right over here,

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.710
we have an inflection point,
so let me write that down.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.466
So, let me show you that again

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.336
now that the point is labeled.

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:15.114
For x at negative two,
we have a positive slope.

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:17.553
It decreases, decreases, decreases.

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:22.330
It's negative, it still
decreases, x equals negative one,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.143
and then our slope
begins increasing again.

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:27.139
So, that's how you could tell it

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.142
just from the function itself.

00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:31.927
But you could also tell inflection points

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:34.261
by looking at your first derivative.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.523
Remember, an inflection
point is when our slope goes

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:38.231
from increasing to decreasing

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.322
or from decreasing to increasing.

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:43.224
The derivative is just the
slope of the tangent line.

00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:45.736
So, this right over here,
this is the derivative

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:48.236
of our original blue function.

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:51.875
So, here we can see the interesting parts.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.322
And so notice what's happening.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:56.644
On the derivative, the
derivative is decreasing,

00:01:56.644 --> 00:01:58.873
which means the slope of our tangent line

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.491
of our original function is
decreasing, and we saw that.

00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:06.158
Notice, while the derivative
is decreasing right over here,

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.499
our slope will be decreasing.

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.490
Our slope is positive.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.651
Our slope is positive, but decreasing.

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.322
Then it becomes negative, but decreasing,

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:17.938
all the way until this point,

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:20.554
which is at x equals negative one.

00:02:20.554 --> 00:02:22.191
So, let's do that again.

00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:25.489
So, our slope is positive and decreasing,

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.110
and then right over about
there, right over here,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.571
our slope keeps decreasing,

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.654
but then it actually turns negative.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.422
And it keeps decreasing all the way

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.036
until x equals negative one,

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.959
and then our slope
begins increasing again.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.578
So, the derivative begins increasing,

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:43.977
which means the slope of our tangent line

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:46.485
of our original function
begins increasing.

00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:48.825
So, that point is interesting.

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:52.640
An inflection point, one way
to identify an inflection point

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.504
from the first derivative is
to look at a minimum point

00:02:56.504 --> 00:03:01.430
or to look at a maximum point,
because that shows a place

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.485
where your derivative
is changing direction.

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:06.193
It's going from increasing to decreasing,

00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:08.892
or in this case from
decreasing to increasing,

00:03:08.892 --> 00:03:12.780
which tells you that this is
likely an inflection point.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.739
Now, let's think about
the second derivative.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.850
So, right over here,

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.921
this is the derivative of the derivative.

00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:21.773
And I could zoom out to
look at the whole thing.

00:03:21.773 --> 00:03:23.861
You actually can't see the
whole thing right over here.

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:25.286
Actually, I can zoom out a little bit more

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.982
so that you can really
see what's going on.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.984
And so what's interesting here?

00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:34.840
Well, it looks like right
at x equals negative one,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.092
we cross, our second
derivative crosses the x axis,

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:40.633
so let me label that.

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:43.103
So, right over there, we cross the x axis,

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:45.487
which is exactly where we
have the inflection point.

00:03:45.487 --> 00:03:46.904
And that makes sense,

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:49.091
because if our second derivative goes

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.119
from being negative to positive,

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:52.604
that means our first derivative goes

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:54.965
from being decreasing to increasing,

00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:57.463
which means the slope of our tangent line

00:03:57.463 --> 00:04:01.696
of our function goes from
decreasing to increasing.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:03.290
We've seen that over and over,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.696
decreasing to increasing right over here.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:07.529
Now, it's important to realize

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.100
the second derivative doesn't
need to just touch the x axis.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.641
It needs to cross it.

00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:12.474
So, you might say,

00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:16.313
"Well, what about this point
right over here, two, zero?"

00:04:16.313 --> 00:04:20.484
The second derivative
touches the x axis there,

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:22.137
but it doesn't cross it,

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.313
so we never go from our
derivative increasing

00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:28.593
to our derivative decreasing.

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.289
So, big takeaways,

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.729
you could figure out the inflection point

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.385
from either the graph of the function,

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:34.817
from the graph of the derivative,

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:36.752
or the graph of the second derivative.

00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:38.085
On the function itself,

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.499
you just wanna inspect the
slopes of the tangent line

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:41.696
and think about where does it go

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:44.901
from decreasing to increasing?

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:47.919
Or the other way around, from
increasing to decreasing.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.051
If you're looking at the first derivative,

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:55.174
you really just wanna look
at minimum or maximum points.

00:04:55.174 --> 00:04:56.827
And if you're looking at
the second derivative,

00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:58.617
which have we in orange, you wanna look at

00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:02.093
at what x value are we
crossing the x axis?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.710
Not just touching it,
but crossing the x axis.
