00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.240
 The greatest potential possessed by humans may be invention and innovation 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.000
 Overcoming obstacles and changing the world around us 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.940
 Such as the formation of language for example, which remains one of the greatest mysteries of scientists 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 Without a consensus on its beginnings, but without a doubt changed a world 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.340
 The sex of quasi-humans who existed nearly 2.5 million years ago. Or ability to control 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.380
 With evidence of cooked food dating back to about 1.5 million years. 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.380
 About 200,000 years ago, modern humans evolved, but after 190,000 years 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 We turned from fishing communities and started farming 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.650
 Collecting grains, planting them and paying attention to them is not the form of our modern civilization. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.160
 Soon after, the plow was invented, changing the agriculture 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.140
 By 5000 BC we began to feel more curious towards the planet and invented sailboats 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.679
 Thus opening the world of exploration. In 3500 BC the first glasses were invented, and after 100 years 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.280
 The nails that are found in ancient Egypt come to help us make a better building, 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.180
 Which have helped expand human life. A few centuries later cement was invented 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 It is the basis for our urbanization, literally. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.180
 Considering the improvement of transportation, the wheel was invented in 3000 BC followed by 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.670
 With soap and then the primitive computer, or abacus 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.130
 Which has helped to increase people's capabilities and shape our economy. Although the paper 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.070
 It was not made until 200 BC and the printing press until 1430 AD, but the first libraries 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.860
 Appeared in 2600 BC with recorded recordings on stone slabs to make knowledge 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.040
 By 1500 BC, the alphabet became popular in some societies 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.980
 As a synonym for glyphs, is causing further cognitive transmission 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 700 years later, the modern 9-9 system emerged, paving the way for mathematics. 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.340
 The first democracy began in Greece in 508 BC, where everyone had an equal share 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840
 In power, it is possible that our favorite innovation is scientific method. 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.500
 Which arose at the time of Aristotle in 384 BC - a process requiring information and verification in new phenomena - 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.020
 We may be slightly biased, of course it has been refined over time. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.620
 The Chinese invented the first compass in 300 BC, allowing sailors to sail 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.890
 For vast distances, and at the same time designed the Archimedes spiral which helps in the transfer 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.110
 Water from low to high areas, making irrigation and agriculture. And all this even before 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.210
 The present era. 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.800
 Speaking of time, the first mechanical clock came in 725 AD but was not even 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.220
 In 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was established, it was the time of the people around the world 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.760
 The glasses came in the thirteenth century and may look slim but overly elevated 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.720
 Human intelligence, and it has also been a sign of binocular and microscopy 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.880
 Before the telescope, in 1542, it was the idea that Earth was not the center of the universe 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.150
 Pioneer, but the Copernicus system put the sun into the axis of the solar system 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.120
 And all, this has not been accepted for hundreds of years. 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.160
 At the end of 1600 AD steam engines came and were not only used for trains, ships, even factories 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.070
 The problem of the industrial revolution, which was later replaced by internal combustion engines. 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.520
 At about the same time, binary figures and Bolian logic developed 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.340
 Which is the basis of digital computing, Newton's laws 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.400
 The movement and general intrigue helped shape the ideas of physics despite Einstein's theory 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 Special relativity and general quantum theory as well 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.780
 These ideas were then built. 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.020
 Vaccines came in 1796, which over the past twenty years only saved 21 million people from hospital for treatment 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.360
 And prevented 732,000 people from dying, water purification and food preservation as well 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.990
 I saved millions of lives, and the camera allowed us to document 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.920
 Our past and connect with the events of the present. Hundreds of years to come will also witness tremendous development 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.250
 In communication with telegraph and telephone, radio waves, 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.680
 Radio, and television, all converted 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.280
 Our world makes it seem smaller. 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.880
 The world of medicine changed radically in 1846 with the appearance of anesthesia, 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.300
 And antiseptic, which allowed major surgeries that were previously very painful 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.370
 Thus saving innumerable lives. Sewage system also has a good range of spread 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.450
 Many diseases. Refrigeration also changed the way people eat around the world 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.139
 The invention of the lighting lamp occurred shortly after that note 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.871
 Static electricity was in 600 BC, and the invention of electric condenser 

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:29.751
 In 1745 it was like many other discoveries that paved the way for the use of electricity 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.680
 The move was a giant step by step in 1885 by modern car, and later 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.449
 Aircraft, semiconductors that will help regulate the flow of electricity 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.920
 And finally transport resistance, without which the modern electronic devices will not work 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.860
 Many scientific discoveries will be followed initially by the electron 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.279
 Which helped Niels Bohr model his work for the atom, although the atom 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.370
 Her theory was actually developed 2,300 years ago. Nitrogen fixation, 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.180
 Plant breeding has helped us to maintain our society and its credit for conservation 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.930
 The same billion along with antibiotics such as penicillin, accidental discovery 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.139
 Fighting bacterial infection, birth control also reduced the number of children 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.550
 In women allowing higher quality life, polyethylene and other plastics 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.860
 All of us surround us in many of our influences. 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.900
 The discovery of DNA in the 1950's unleashed many of what we now know about humanity 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.180
 Through inherited traits and genetics, resulting in genetic engineering 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.650
 And the sequence of succession in the seventies, and in the past eighty years, communication jumped 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.970
 Steps forward from satellite communications in the 1940s 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.939
 TV, weather, defense and to the beginning of the Internet 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.979
 1960s, PC and GPS in the 1970s, without mentioning the device 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.999
 Which could be in your hands or in your pocket now a smartphone that is invented 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.819
 For the first time by IBM in 1994. 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.900
 As technology continues to progress here on Earth, space exploration continues to astonish us 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.980
 The first successful orbital launch in 1957, the first landing on the moon 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.080
 In 1969 and the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s, both a spacecraft 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.780
 An observatory scouring the earth every 97 minutes. 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.440
 But, the more we look at the universe and the future 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.979
 What will come next? As sometimes the world may seem dark, these innovations 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.119
 Show that people live longer, healthier, and happier. 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.389
 One of the best ways 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.749
 To ensure the continuity of innovation is to support leaders who recognize the importance of programs 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.260
 General research of global health, agriculture, information technology or energy. 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.400
 You can find out more about the innovations in the amazing Bill Gates blog that funded this episode 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.200
 Learn more about what we can do to make sure that the world continues to improve for all 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.080
