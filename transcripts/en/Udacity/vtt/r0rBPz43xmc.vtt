00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In our model, the number of susceptible persons always decreases.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It cannot have any component here with a + sign and leave this blank.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And similarly, the number of recovered persons always increases.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It cannot have something with a - sign here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A certain fraction of the infectious persons is taken per day to the recovered compartment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What worked best is 1/5 days, b times well the number of infectious persons f.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We need the same here with a - sign.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Everybody who leaves the infectious compartment joins the recovered compartment.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The similar process is in place with e and i. Exposed persons become infectious afterwards.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The rate should be a, 1/1 day seems to be plausible latency of 1 day

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
times the number of exposed persons.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Certain fraction of the exposed persons per day gives the exposed compartment

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and joins the infectious compartment.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That same number that leaves here has to joint here, a,e and here we have the infectious process.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The number of exposed, infected that is, persons increases per day by 5*10⁻⁹/day

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
times the product of the number of infectious persons times the number of susceptible persons.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, it's c, h and what we gained here, we have to use here, c, h.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There's one thing to keep in mind though. This latency period of one day is an average.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's not a strict number similar to this recovery period of 5 days. These are average numbers.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The small percentage of exposed infected disease persons will be taken pretty quickly

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to the infectious state and the small percentage will take quite a while to get to the infectious state.

00:01:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This times of 1 day and 5 days are not rigid. They are averages.
