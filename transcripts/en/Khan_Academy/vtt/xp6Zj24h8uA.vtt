00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.670
A couple of videos ago, we
saw that in classic C-3

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.240
photosynthesis-- and once again
it's called C-3 because

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.770
the first time that carbon
dioxide is fixed, it's fixed

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.470
into a 3-carbon molecule.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.590
But we saw the problem with C-3
photosynthesis is that the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.580
enzyme that does the carbon
fixation, it can also react

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.430
with oxygen.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.470
And when oxygen essentially
reacts with ribulose

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.110
biphosphate instead of your
carbon, you get an

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.330
unproductive reaction.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.390
Not only is it unproductive,
it'll actually suck up your

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.900
ATP and your NADPH and
you'll go nowhere.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.540
So every now and then, when
oxygen bonds here instead of a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.240
carbon dioxide, you get
nothing produced, net.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.910
Everything becomes
less efficient.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.740
And so in the last video, we
saw that some plants have

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.660
evolved a way to get
around this.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.390
And what they do is, they fix
their carbon on the outside,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.930
on cells that are actually
exposed to the air.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.090
And then once they fix the
carbon they actually fix it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.850
into a 4-carbon molecule, into
oxaloacetate And then that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.740
gets turned into malate Then
they pump the malate deeper

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.930
within the leaf, where you
aren't exposed to oxygen.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.720
And then they take the carbon
dioxide off the malate, and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.940
this is where they actually
perform the Calvin cycle.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.540
And even though you do have
your rubiscos still there,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.830
your rubisco isn't going to
have-- the photorespiration is

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.980
not going to occur.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
Because it only has access
to carbon dioxide.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.710
It does not have access to
this oxygen out here.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.950
Now that's a very efficient
way of producing sugars.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.630
And that's why some of the
plants that we associate with

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.100
being very strong sugar, or even
ethanol producers, all

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.610
perform C-4 photosynthesis.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:49.360
Corn, sugarcane,
and crab grass.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.850
And these are all very, very
efficient sugar producers.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.260
Because they don't have to
worry too much about

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.890
photorespiration.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.400
Now some plants have a slightly
different problem.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.970
They're not so worried about the
efficiency of the process.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.750
They're more worried
about losing water.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.040
And you can imagine what
plants these are.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.150
These are plants that
are in the desert.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.900
Because these stomata, these
pores that are on the leaves,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.720
they let in air, but they
can also let out water.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.970
I mean, if I'm in the
rainforest, I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.080
don't care about that.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.220
But if I'm in the middle of the
desert, I don't want to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.230
let out water vapor through
my stomata.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.460
So the ideal situation is, I
would want my stomata closed

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.140
during the daytime.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.730
This is what I want.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.120
So I want-- if I'm in
the desert, let

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.510
me make this clear.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:46.310
If I'm in the desert I want
stomata closed during the day.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.230
For obvious reasons.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.580
I don't want all my water
to vaporize out of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.090
these holes in my leaves.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.900
But at the same time, the
problem is that photosynthesis

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.580
can only occur during
the daytime.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.880
And that includes the
dark reactions.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.040
Remember, I've said multiple
times, the dark reactions are

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.680
badly named.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.800
They're more the light
independent reactions.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.220
But they both occur
simultaneously-- the light

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.600
independent and light
dependent-- and only during

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.850
the daytime.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.360
And if your stomata is closed,
you need to perform

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.190
photosynthesis, especially the
Calvin cycle, you need CO2.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.650
So how can you get
around this?

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.870
If I want to close my stomata
during the day, but I need CO2

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.660
during the day, how can
I solve this problem?

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.700
And what desert plants, or
many desert plants, have

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.240
evolved to do, essentially
does photosynthesis, but

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.250
instead of fixing the carbon
in outer cells and then

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.070
pushing it in to inner cells and
then performing the Calvin

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.370
cycle, instead of outer and
inner cells, they do it at the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.100
nighttime and in the daytime.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.940
So in CAM plants-- and these are
called CAM plants because,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.235
I could tell you what
it stands for.

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:06.180
It stands for crassulacean
acid metabolism.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.380
And that's because it was first
observed in that species

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.200
of plants, the crassulacean
plant.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.260
But these are just called,
you could call it CAM

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.720
photosynthesis or CAM plants.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.480
They're essentially a subset
of C-4 plants.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.029
But instead of performing C-4
photosynthesis, kind of an

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.670
outside cells and inside cells,
they do it at the

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.920
nighttime and the day.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.545
And what they do is, at night
they keep their stomata open.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.190
And they perform, and they're
able to fix-- and everything

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.960
occurs in the mesophyll
cells and the CAM

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.290
cells, in the CAM plants.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.350
So at nighttime, when they're
not afraid of losing water--

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.790
let's say this is a mesophyll
cell right here--

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.160
my stomata is open.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.280
Let's say that this is my
stomata right there.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.090
And so it lets in
carbon dioxide.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.870
I'm not worried about
losing water vapor.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.190
It's night time right now.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.150
So carbon dioxide
comes in here.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.870
And then it fixes the
carbon dioxide.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.650
It fixes it the exact same way
that the C-4 plants do.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.080
So you have your CO2 come in.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.680
You have your PEP .

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.910
It's all facilitated by PEP
carboxylase That's the enzyme.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.570
That can only fix CO2, that can
only react with CO2, not

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.470
with oxygen.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.430
And then that is used to
produce-- and we saw it here

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.460
in our CAM-4 diagram in the last
video, that is to used to

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.490
produce malate.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.025
A 4-carbon molecule.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.380
And then the malate-- and then
this is what's key-- the

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.640
malate get stored in other
organelles in the cell.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.775
In the vacuoles , which are, you
can kind of view them as

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:02.920
large storage containers
in the cell.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.620
So I drew this as
the whole cell.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.990
I mean, this is actually all
occurring in your chloroplast.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.430
But you can imagine your cell
having a big storage center

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.180
where the malate gets
stored at night.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.480
And you can view malate as
almost a carbon dioxide store.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.750
Because later on we can
access the malate and

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.180
get the carbon dioxide.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.670
And that's exactly what these
CAM plants are going to do.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.380
So this is nighttime.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.520
Then the sun comes up.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.050
So now we're in the daytime.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.255
This desert plant, well maybe
it's a cactus, it doesn't want

00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:35.620
to lose its water vapor.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.870
So it closes its stomata.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.110
This particular stoma
now is closed.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.090
It's now closed.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.380
And you say, oh boy, how
is it going to perform

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.680
photosynthesis?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.800
Well, it can perform
photosynthesis in

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.085
that very same cell.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.660
Because it stored up all of
this malate at night.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.870
And so now the malate can be
pumped out of the vacuoles

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.950
into the stroma of our
chloroplast. And then you can

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.460
have pyruvate break off.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.990
But the more important thing
is you have CO2 break off.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.160
So you have a ready
supply of CO2.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.290
And now we can perform our
standard Calvin cycle.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.040
And in an environment only
with CO2, our stomata is

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.300
closed, so we're ready to go.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:24.330
Our CO2 reacts with ribulose
bisphosphate It is catalyzed

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.420
by rubisco It's the whole
Calvin cycle and we

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.660
produced our sugar.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.340
So this is kind of a
neat adaptation.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.500
In these high, very efficient
sugar-producing plants that

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.430
aren't worried about water, they
perform carbon fixation

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.690
on things that are exposed to
the air and then they pump

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.160
kind of a stored version of
the carbon deeper into the

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.280
leaf to actually perform the
Calvin cycle so that it's not

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.080
lossy, so that

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.380
photorespiration doesn't occur.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.750
Because down here you
have no oxygen.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.700
The desert plants benefit from
that property as well, but

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.820
their whole concern is, I don't
want to keep my stomata

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.370
open in the daytime.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.650
So what I do is, I fix
my carbon at night.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.160
But I use the exact
same process.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.830
I use PEP carboxylase
And I store my

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.540
carbon dioxide at night.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.940
And in the daytime, I can
actually-- when my

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.310
light-dependant reactions are
occurring, they're producing

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.780
my ATP and my NADH I can also
perform my dark reactions in

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.410
the daytime.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.550
As I said, the dark reactions
always occur in the daytime.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.430
Or my light-independent
reactions.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.790
Because even though my stomata
is closed, I have a store of

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.224
carbon dioxide in the
form of malate.
