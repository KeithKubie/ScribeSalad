in the middle of the Turkmenistan desert
is it 230 foot wide hole and the hole

petroleum geologists set out across the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
petroleum geologists set out across the
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.189
petroleum geologists set out across the
desert of Turkmenistan and they were on

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
desert of Turkmenistan and they were on
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380
desert of Turkmenistan and they were on
the hunt for petroleum and when they

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
the hunt for petroleum and when they
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810
the hunt for petroleum and when they
found a place that they thought would be

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
found a place that they thought would be
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870
found a place that they thought would be
full of oil they decided to set up a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
full of oil they decided to set up a
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.560
full of oil they decided to set up a
drilling rig unfortunately for them they

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
drilling rig unfortunately for them they
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690
drilling rig unfortunately for them they
set this drilling rig up over what

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
set this drilling rig up over what
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.049
set this drilling rig up over what
turned out to be an enormous cavern of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
turned out to be an enormous cavern of
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.690
turned out to be an enormous cavern of
natural gas and when they punched in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
natural gas and when they punched in
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790
natural gas and when they punched in
through the top of the desert the entire

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
through the top of the desert the entire
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010
through the top of the desert the entire
thing collapsed taking the drilling rig

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
thing collapsed taking the drilling rig
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.709
thing collapsed taking the drilling rig
with it and even more problematic than

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
with it and even more problematic than

hole was methane gas which is a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
hole was methane gas which is a
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779

explosive gas so the Soviet geologists

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
explosive gas so the Soviet geologists
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.430
explosive gas so the Soviet geologists
did what was for them the sensible thing

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440
did what was for them the sensible thing
 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.810

they lit the hole on fire the scientists

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
they lit the hole on fire the scientists
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520
they lit the hole on fire the scientists
thought when they lit this crater on

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
thought when they lit this crater on
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320
thought when they lit this crater on
fire that it would burn for a few weeks

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
fire that it would burn for a few weeks
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780
fire that it would burn for a few weeks
maybe a few months and then it would

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
maybe a few months and then it would
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030
maybe a few months and then it would
just extinguish itself it has been

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
just extinguish itself it has been
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.969
just extinguish itself it has been
burning for over 40 years

light and the heat which come to the
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.850
light and the heat which come to the
edge of the crater and then

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860
edge of the crater and then
 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.760
edge of the crater and then
throw themselves into it presumably they

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770
throw themselves into it presumably they
 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100
throw themselves into it presumably they
are trying to reunite themselves with

so the crater has been burning for 40

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870
so the crater has been burning for 40
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.250
so the crater has been burning for 40
years and there's no telling when it

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
years and there's no telling when it
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.820
years and there's no telling when it
will stop but with continued tourist

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
will stop but with continued tourist
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920
will stop but with continued tourist
interest it's likely that it may be

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
interest it's likely that it may be
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.950
interest it's likely that it may be
burning for some time to come

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960
burning for some time to come
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.970
