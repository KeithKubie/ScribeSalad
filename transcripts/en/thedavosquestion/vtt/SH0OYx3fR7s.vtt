00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:09.991
Yeah, economy may come back in 2009, maybe
in 10, maybe in 11. That's not for me the

00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:16.250
most important issue because it will come
back some day, today, tomorrow, or the day

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.320
after. But the issue is come back where. That's
my issue. Do we go back to the same normal

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.000
situation, quote unquote normal situation
that we were in before the crisis? When the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.190
crisis is over we go back to that? Or we never
try to go back to that, we create a new normal

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.490
situation which is quite different then what
we have been going through. So that's the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.989
one that I'm concerned with. The worst of
the crisis is the best of the opportunity

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.789
to change things. So to me this is the most
exciting pillar. To design the whole structure,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.629
to design the things so that we can achieve
goals that we have set for our self. Creating

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.530
a new kind of world where people won't prevent
poor people who would be dejected from the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.039
banking system that with the diseases, so
that we can move in that direction. The one

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.759
that the normal situation is coming from,
it didn't assure us. So it's good that they

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.940
created disguises. It gives us option now
to move out. Like for example the financial

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.990
system, so that all people are included in
the financial system. It's an inclusive financial

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.310
system. Not just exclusive club or privileged
people. We create new kinds of businesses.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.190
Not only just money making businesses which
we have now, which makes us look like we are

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.110
some kind of money making machines. All we
do, all our life, make money. We're not money

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.311
making machines. We are human beings. We are
much bigger than money making machines. We

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:58.450
should be doing businesses to change the world.
So I talk about social business, how to include

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.410
social business in god frame world. We can
eliminate all of the problem that we created

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.470
in the past and create a new world. A world
without poverty, a world that exists without

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.940
hunger. Then we can make it. That's the normal
thing we should be working for an this is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.590
the time to work for it. Thank you.
