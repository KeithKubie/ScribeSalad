&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.426
&gt;&gt; Nora Krug: We hope you're having
a wondering day, in the heat,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.713
celebrating the joy of reading
here in the National Mall.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.193
Just before we start, I have a
couple of housekeeping measures.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.980
I want to tell you that the pavilion
-- this presentation is being filmed

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.556
for the Library of Congress'
website for their archives,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.823
so please be mindful of that
as you enjoy this presentation.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.146
Also please don't sit on the camera
risers in the back of the pavilion.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.220
With that said, I'm Nora Krug.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.396
I write a column for
the Washington Post,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.610
which is another sponsor
of this wonderful event.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.456
And I'm very honored to be here
to introduce James Ransome,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.886
who has illustrated more
than 20 children's books,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.146
including The Creation,
How Many Stars in the Sky,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.963
Sweet Clara, and The Freedom Quilt.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.300
He is a two-time recipient of
the Coretta Scott King award

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.580
for illustration for The Creation,
and for Uncle Jed's Barber Shop.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.496
He's also completed
several commissioned murals

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.363
for the Children's
Museum in Indianapolis,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.470
and the National Underground
Railroad Freedom Center

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.750
in Cincinnati.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.283
Ransome lives in Upstate New
York with his wife, Lisa?

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.070
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.003
&gt;&gt; Lisa Cline-Ransome, who is
also a children's book writer.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.136
And the two have collaborated
on several books,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.193
including Satchel Paige, Quilt
Alphabet, Quilt Counting, and Pele.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.603
And amid all of this work they also
have managed to raise four children,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.123
three of whom are now teenagers.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.290
Ransome's latest book is
Gunner, which is a first for him,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.233
as he has both written
and illustrated the book.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.713
We're looking forward to
seeing more of that from him.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.220
And I have the wonderful honor

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.520
of saying it's also
his birthday today, so.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.720
[ applause ]

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.170
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Thank you so much.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.330
Well, it's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.753
And I feel the same way you
guys feel, I'm hot and tired.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.653
So I'm gonna try to
make this exciting.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.863
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna do a
storytelling of Gunner, my --

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.550
my first book that I
wrote and illustrated.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.830
And it's gonna be -- and since
I'm not used to doing this,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.620
as an illustrator I'm used to
doing PowerPoint presentations,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.553
but now I have to sort of tell
the story and flip the pages.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.403
Way too much to do at once,
but I'm gonna give it a shot.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.593
And then after that I'm going to --
I guess I'll answer a few questions,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.130
based on how much time we have left,
I'm watching my time keeper here.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.963
And -- but I really
want to draw with some

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.830
of the young people
that are here today.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.496
So I'm going to be inviting kids
to come up to write a number,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.096
and I'm gonna show you how I can
draw with a -- from a number.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.990
I will make sure I turn the pad so
the people on this side can see.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.756
But it's gonna be hard
to accommodate everyone,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.463
cause it's so -- such
a wide area here.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.556
So let's get started
with -- with Gunner.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.370
And first I'd like to
tell you a little bit

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.903
about Gunner and how it came about.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.570
I'm a big football fan, and I
-- I grew up in North Carolina.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.980
In 1972 I started watching football.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.310
So I'm a Miami Dolphin fan.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
[ applause ]

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.093
And I always talk to kids --
somehow I go to the schools,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.820
I end up talking to the
kids about my football team.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.103
There's always usually a
question that comes up.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.803
And I -- it was just
always interesting

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.176
to me how some kids just had
this -- this sense of winning.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.600
I mean they -- they would do
anything to win and to want to win.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.486
And I just found that interesting.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.773
So I wanted to -- when it came to
writing this book I wanted to write

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.253
about that -- that need and desire
to win, to help kids understand

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.306
that we don't always win, and
there's actually two sides

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.130
who are -- who are trying to win.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.693
And your story may be compelling,
but maybe a story on the other side

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.793
of the field which is just as
compelling as yours to win.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.473
So that's how Gunner came about.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.223
So it starts off with Gunner
is a great name for a boy

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.993
who -- who loved football.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.306
He didn't look like
a football player.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.796
He looked -- he was too
short and too round.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.930
[ silence ]

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.523
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Gunner was the
only child of Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070
who didn't like sports at all.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.650
But they knew their
son liked sports,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.896
and made sure he was the first child
in line when it came to signing

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.593
up for the Peewee League
football team.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.060
[ silence ]

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.470
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Told
you this would be hard.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.250
Gunner said that he wanted to be
a quarterback, but everyone looked

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.000
at him and laughed because he
didn't look like a quarterback.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.913
But when they saw him
throw a -- a foot --

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.646
throw a football, they
said oh my God.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.453
The laughing stopped
because he had a great arm.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.286
So they said you can
be a quarterback,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.073
but you can be a third
string quarterback,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.300
but mainly because
of the way he looked,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.543
because he had a much better
arm than all the other players.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.443
So once the season start -- started,
Gunner sat the bench all year long.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.926
He never got a chance to play,
but he was always the first one

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.973
at practice, the last one to leave.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
On Saturdays he would
watch the college games,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.956
on Sunday he would watch the pros.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.736
He always studied his
book and his plays.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.940
But he sat the bench all year.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.013
But in the last game of the season,
in the Peewee County's championship,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.216
the Mighty Bowl, during the --
in the third quarter when --

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.636
in the fourth quarter, I'm
sorry, when his team --

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.863
the Malden Tigers -- were down, the
first quarterback was hit and was --

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.143
actually someone stepped on
his fingers and he went home.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.866
And then the second string
quarterback came in, and he was hit

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.450
so hard he saw stars, and his
mommy took him to the hospital.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.510
[ silence ]

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.156
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: But no one --

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.356
no one was excited when
Gunner went into the game.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.513
Actually everyone was pretty quiet.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000


00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.590
[ silence ]

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.403
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: And no
one was especially excited

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.516
when he ran the wrong way on the
first play and he was sacked.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.023
But his parents cheered, go Gunner!

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.690


00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.203
But everyone cheered after he threw
his first touchdown, a spiral,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.353
to a -- a tight -- a wide
receiver in the end zone.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.770
So they were two scores down, and
he had to score one more time.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.420
The defense got the ball
back, and Gunner went back in,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.206
and again his parents
cheered, go Gunner!

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.540
[ silence ]

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.903
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Well everyone
cheered once again once he scored.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.990
He threw a long bomb
for a touchdown,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.903
and now the game was tied.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.770
And everyone was excited when Gunner
went back into -- onto the field.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.763
His father -- his coach
said you can win this game.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.433
We can win the championship,
we just need one more score.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.453
They only had minutes
left in the game.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.956
The team -- the offense slowly
moved down the field, the --

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.573
the running backs ran, the receivers
caught, and they slowly moved

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.633
down towards the end zone.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.163
But everyone was surprised when
Gunner tried to throw a pass

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.146
to his wide receiver,
and the defensive back

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.106
from the other team
intercepted the ball,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.693
and ran it in for a
touchdown, and won the game.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.326
So Gunner's team didn't win,

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:46.916
but they still carried
him off the field,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.266
'cause they felt he tried his
hardest, and he was a hero to them.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.236
And after the game they
went out for ice cream,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.950
and his coach gave him
rookie of the year trophy.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.770
And -- and everyone
gave him a high five

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.086
in the -- in the ice cream parlor.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.320
[ silence ]

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.090
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: The next
morning while having breakfast,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:10.563
Gunner's father was
reading the newspaper.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.550
He read that a little
girl from across town

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.293
on the Woodland [phonetic] team
intercepted the ball and ran it

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.643
in for a touchdown, and
it was her first time

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.770
in the game playing for her team.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.636
And that's the story of
Gunner, our football hero.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.510
[ applause ]

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:34.916
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: So
Gunner is a hero,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:36.650
although he did not win the game.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.116
And we can all be heroes
without always coming in first.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:42.736
There's lots of things
we can accomplish,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.043
lots of challenges we can
overcome, and still be successful.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.923
Sometimes it's -- I
know it sounds cliche,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.766
but sometimes it's something
more important than being the one

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.700
with the highest score,
or actually the one

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.540
who walks away with
the championship.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.006
There are other small challenges
that we can be winners at.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.660
So that's what I wanted
to do about Gunner.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.656
And the idea about this little
girl who it was her first time in,

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.530
no one knows anything
about her until she gets in

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.126
and she scores the touch --
winning touchdown for her team.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.516
I just felt that that was a very
interesting, compelling story

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.456
that I wanted to tell, built around
Gunner, this football player.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.190


00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.426
Are there any other -- are
there any questions about Gunner

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.533
that I could answer, quickly?

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.883
I could tell you guys some
things about how I got started

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.723
as an illustrator, if not.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.030
But on Gunner?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.526
We could talk about --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000


00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.530
[ silence ]

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.706
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Yes,
microphone please.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040


00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.546
&gt;&gt; I wonder if you would
have any advice to give sort

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.866
of a beginning children's
book writer?

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.800
You know, we're told different
things, you know, about how --

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.833
how the text and the --

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.366
and the illustrations
are supposed to interact.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.700
Can you -- can you --

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.033
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: As
-- as -- as a writer?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500
Or as illustrator?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:11.833
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what would
you -- what you say

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.900
as an illustrator to
a beginning writer?

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.566
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: What would I say

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.900
to an illustrator as
a beginning writer?

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.300
That's -- that's a good way to
phrase it, 'cause I don't feel

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.233
like I'm really a writer yet.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.750
I would say write your story, and
try to sell your story, and don't --

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.650
don't -- although you should leave
something to the illustrator.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.303
And that's probably the
hardest part for early writer,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.693
is those parts you lead to -- you
live -- you give to an illustrator.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.096
You want to sort of set the
illustrator up, and give him clues

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.090
to what's in your imagination
if -- if that --

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.793
if that helps, rather
than being direct

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.433
and telling him the person has
on let's say boots, for example.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.896
If you want the character to have on
boots, maybe you can say something

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.283
about putting the boots on, how
you put the boots on, rather than,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.893
you know, the person
just has on boots.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.426
It's things like that.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.426
It's sort of -- I love
when -- when --

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.736
when writers just give me
great clues for visual images.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.066
And I think that's -- that's
what I look for in stories.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.133
And also sometimes how they leave
certain things for me to add.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.560
I always think of it as it's
ice cream, and it's my job

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.013
to put the sprinkles on the top.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.613
The text is the ice cream,
and I put the sprinkles on top

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.613
of the ice cream, that's
what I try to do.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.213
So I don't want you to give
me all the information,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.670
I want you to just -- just
sort of create a pathway for me

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.156
to walk down, as the artist, okay?

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.993
Some people wonder -- and this is
actually a good question writing

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.120
and illustrating -- how did I --
how did I get to be here today,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.533
talking about my books, and I've
illustrated almost 50 books to date.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.466
I was a young boy, I'm growing up
in a small town in North Carolina.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.156
In this small town I came from there
were not a lot of opportunities

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:00.936
for me, someone who wanted to be
an artist since the third grade.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.280
Art wasn't even taught in
the schools I attended,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.540
and there were no artists to be
around to take me to their studios,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.040
or even go to museums
to see artwork.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.473
So my first things that inspired
me were comic books, and --

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.330
and cartoons on television,
like so many kids.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.203
I started drawing at a very early
age, as well as writing stories.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.146
I wrote stories to give me
a reason to draw pictures.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.286
Then I became influence by Mad
magazine, and I would copy stories

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.883
in Mad magazine, and I would draw
images from there and make up books

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.120
about my friends and I
doing different things.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.686
I basically would pass
those out in the classroom.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.553
From -- once I got into high school,
I started drawing less and less.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.980
But at that same time I moved
from North Carolina to New Jersey,

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:58.950
and I was really fortunate
to move into a school system

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.673
that had a great art department.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.623
It was just the opposite of where
I had grew up in North Carolina.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.056
It was Bergenfield, New Jersey.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.900
And there they had -- we had
eight art teachers at one point.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.416
And anything you could
imagine was offered at this --

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.986
in this school setting --
this public school setting.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.500
I spent a lot of my time

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.263
with my other passion,
which was film making.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.430
I wanted to be a film maker, so I --

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.230
I made films, and this
was back in the days

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.730
when you actually used film, it
wasn't video, it wasn't digital.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.720
We used to actually develop our own
black and white film, so it was --

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.826
it was very difficult because
you would do -- make --

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.386
do all this work to film the
film, then you went to develop it

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.933
and you would ruin
it in developing it.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.490
And then if you didn't ruin it then,
you would probably ruin it trying

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.643
to put the sound strip on.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.776
Because you had to use glue,
and the film would move around

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.843
and you glued this piece
of tape to the film,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.293
and it would easily
go across the film.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.253
So a lot of great films
were ruined there.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.586
So I -- I just recently went back to
my old high school and was talking

00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.746
to my high school film
making teacher.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.620
And these kids today
have it so easy.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.206
I mean they -- they actually
made a film the day before his

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.603
retirement party.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.870
And some of the older people
like myself were there,

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.110
and we just shook our heads
going we could have never done

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.830
that back when we were in school.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.090
So I was very fortunate
when it was time to go

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.950
to college I started animating my
films, because I did like working

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.643
by myself, I didn't like
working for a large group.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.353
As a film maker you do have
to work with a lot of people.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:28.346
So I started animating my film,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.480
and that brought me back
to drawing and painting.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:32.910
Then I went to college and decided
to major in illustration, and --

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:40.050
and in illustration I fell in
love with drawing and painting.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.463
And that's when I sort of focused my
-- all my energies on illustrating,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.136
and it's that drawing and painting

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.603
which has gotten me
into children's books.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.070
While at private institute I met
Jerry Pinkley's [phonetic] son,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.416
who was attending school there.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.376
His name was Scott [phonetic] -- not
Brian [phonetic], the illustrator.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.036
And Scott brought his
father in to speak to us,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.870
and after I graduated I reconnected
with Jerry, and we create --

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.200
and basically over a long period
of time a friendship developed,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.173
with me going up to see him
and talking about my artwork.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.733
So that's my long journey
to -- to getting here.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.603
I was very fortunate to be in some
right places at the right time,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.266
but it also is a path of a lot
of -- of a lot of hard work.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.793
I worked extremely hard
when I was in art school

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.723
to develop a good portfolio
that got me my first book job

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:36.986
within two years after graduating,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.190
and I've been doing
books ever since.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.260
And they've gotten better and
better, and now I'm doing books

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.293
with my wife who's a
writer, Lisa Cline-Ransome.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.816
And we've collaborated on
maybe five or six books.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.103
It's hard to keep count because
some books are in production

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.830
when some books are just coming out.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.913
And now I've written my first book
that I've written and illustrated.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.510
So it's been a wonderful journey,
and I've enjoyed every minute of it,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.783
and really appreciate my wife
who tolerates my long hours

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.266
in the studio, along with my four
children who also are very patient

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:19.693
and understanding with me being in
the studio for lots of long hours.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.600
So now -- I haven't seen
the sign yet, I'm not --

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.326
so I'm not at that 10
minute point, okay?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:25.813
So good. So if you guys wouldn't
mind, I would like to draw,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.906
which is one of my
favorite things to do.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.413
And I'd like to get some
of you to help me draw.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.000
I like to show people
how easy drawing can be,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.626
and how you don't have
to go to school to draw.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.076
Anyone can draw, as long
as you can see shapes.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.100
So I'm gonna ask some kids to come
up here and create some nice shapes

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.133
that we all know, and those
are numbers between 1 and 10.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.150
So if I can get some --
a volunteer to come up

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.803
and write a nice big number on
this paper, any number they want

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.263
between 1 and 10, I'm gonna
show you how I can make

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.063
that number into an image.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.433
And I think this young lady over
here is gonna be my first volunteer.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.626
We're gonna have to --

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.160


00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.510
[ silence ]

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.106
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: The number 9,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.840
which happens to be my favorite
number to draw with, okay?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.510
[ silence ]

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.500
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: This
is my favorite part.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.700

[ applause ]

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.060
[ silence ]

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.433
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Between 1 and 10.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.150
Oh and -- oh.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.886
I'm getting all my favorite
numbers first, that's great.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.100


00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.073
I didn't staff the audience either.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.240
[ silence ]

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.293

&gt;&gt; James Ransome: A pirate.

[ silence ]

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.530
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: This is
our last number, number 2.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.130


00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:00.870
Okay, good job.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.510

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.933
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Okay.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.013
Are there any questions
about anything?

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.506
We have two minutes left.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.486
Yes, to the mic?

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.260
Could you come to the mic please?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.060
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.460
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Oh.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.060
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.060
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.526
I drew a lot as a kid.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.126
I've always liked doodling, I've
always liked making pictures.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.393
I -- actually when I think
back and I talk to my --

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.823
some of my childhood friends, I
was always the one who was sort

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.140
of coming up with new games
and things to play with.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.273
So yeah, I was that way growing up.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.300
And you are -- you can really
get your voice across the room.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720
[ laughter ]

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.440
Yes.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000


00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.020
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.383
What do you think is like more fun?

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.703
Or what do you --

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.236
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Well --

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.570
&gt;&gt; -- enjoy --

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.236
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Well --

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.570
&gt;&gt; -- more?

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.036
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: It's always
fun playing with words.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.036
That's -- that's --
that's a challenge

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.570
and interesting about writing.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.770
But I still like drawing
and making the pictures.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.236
That's still the thing I enjoy
most, working with colors

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:03.970
and compositions, and
placing figures

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.636
in a space is always fun to me.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.570
&gt;&gt; Okay. Can I do another one?

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:09.703
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Sure, why not?

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.570
Yeah.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.103
&gt;&gt; Are you gonna be
writing more books?

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.436
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Yes, I am.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.836
There are gonna be more
books coming from me, yes.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.103
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Yeah.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:24.570
Thank you.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.036
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Yes.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.103
&gt;&gt; I assume you like
what you're doing,

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.036
so you're living your
dream basically.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.770
I was wondering if there's something
that you can't do right now

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.770
but you -- that's a challenge for
you that you would really love

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.570
to do, that you're working
towards, that's kind of your dream

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.303
that you're not able to do right now
but you'd like to do in the future?

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.036
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: That's a
very interesting question.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:43.970
There is. I'm interested
in painting,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.503
doing more gallery paintings.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:48.370
That would be my ultimate
dream to do that.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.636
So that's something I'm
-- I'm working towards.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.303
But I do feel very fortunate
that my dream did come true,

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.703
to be able to -- to make a living
off of the art that I create.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.036
I feel very fortunate.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.370
That would be the other
dream I would have.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.103
&gt;&gt; What do you like drawing
better, animals or people?

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.370
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: Animals --
people are what I enjoy most.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:04.103
I consider myself a
figurative painter.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.436
Painting people is much more
challenging, especially facial

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.103
and facial expressions
are so much fun.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.000
Animals are good, but, you know,
you can sort of get away with more

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.740
with animals 'cause most
of us don't know animals

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.873
that well, so it's a little easier.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.540


00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.930
Over time, oh.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.930
I'm over time.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.063
So my time is up.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.660
I'd like to thank you
for coming out today.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000


00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.463
[ background applause ]

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:30.596
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: I
really appreciate it.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.860
Bye-bye.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000


00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:34.930
[ applause ]

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:36.930
[ silence ]

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.786
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
