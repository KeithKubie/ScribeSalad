00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.040
Okay so by way of wrapping up on this
let me just point out three quick facts

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.450
about correlated equilibrium.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.022
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's the first one,

00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:11.258
correlated equilibria or C.E.

00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:15.070
as a cool kids call them can
be found in poly of the time.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.460
So this is a good thing
even though I didn't

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.210
tell you how I found the one third,
one third,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.400
one third, zero correlated
equilibrium in the previous example.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.850
You can find that in
a reasonable amount of time.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.580
I found it in even more
reasonable amount of time,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.825
which is I looked at the example and
I wrote down the numbers.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:32.610
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Which is also polynomial.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.790
Okay, in fact it's linear.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.340
Okay, so.
&gt;&gt; And that's not so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.230
true of Nash equilibria,
that Nash equilibria are hard to find.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.391
&gt;&gt; Yes, they are which is unfortunate.

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:44.218
&gt;&gt; No but it, okay, it gets a nice
advantage of correlated equilibrium.

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:46.650
&gt;&gt; That's true but Nash sounds so cool.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.410
Well in any case.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.890
Okay, the second fact is all mixed Nash
equilibria are in fact correlated.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.923
So this means that correlated
equilibiria exist.

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:55.850
That comes from what we discussed or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.480
that there's always at least
a possibly mixed Nash equilibria.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.030
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.890
&gt;&gt; And of course pure Nash equilibria
are themselves mixed Nash equilibria.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.860
Therefore correlated equilibria exist.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.500
Finally.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.230
&gt;&gt; Wait, pure in the sense of
the original definition of.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.810
&gt;&gt; Right exactly.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.500
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.540
then the third one is, and
this kind of follows from probability,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.431
all convex combinations of mixed Nash
equilibria are in fact correlated.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.600
&gt;&gt; Whoa, okay.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880
&gt;&gt; There's a lot there and
we could talk about it forever but

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.350
the basic idea is that correlated
equilibria is kind of cool traffic

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.910
lights are not a bad idea and coming
up with them isn't impossibly hard.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.510
Unlike all that other stuff you
talked about before with POMDPs

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.430
where there are undecidable and
life is terrible

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.970
at least here we can actually find
pretty good correlated equilibrium.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.080
Or at least we can find
correlated equilibrium.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.950
&gt;&gt; That's a relief.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.940
&gt;&gt; It is a relief.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think I'm ready
to go on to the next thing.
