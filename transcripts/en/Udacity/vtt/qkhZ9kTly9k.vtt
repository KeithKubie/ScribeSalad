00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.367
I'm here with Nija,
a dev ops engineer here at Udacity.

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.660
So tell me,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.620
how do you consume documentation
as part of an engineering team?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; We consume documentation every day
because we use third party libraries and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.720
tools.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.220
So, one of the easiest things to
do is when we want to get up and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.100
running, we look for an example for
how to do that in the documentation.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.290
&gt;&gt; And what would you do if you did
not have this documentation available?

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.580
&gt;&gt; We would be very sad.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.000
Realistically, we may
not use that library, or

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.340
we may switch to a library
that is better documented.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.680
Or we might write our own
internal documentation if that's

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.070
really the library that we need to use.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.860
&gt;&gt; How would you figure out the code
if the documentation wasn't there?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.560
&gt;&gt; You'd have to dig through
the source code a lot of the times,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.430
or examine it using a debugger.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.220
Or, a number of other more
advanced trouble-shooting tools.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.370
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a big headache.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.460
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like reverse engineering
somebody else's thought process.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.700
Sometimes it doesn't work so
well in practice.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.200
&gt;&gt; Thanks Nija.
