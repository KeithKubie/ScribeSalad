FRANK: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.720
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.910
I'm really excited to
introduce Dr. James Shapiro.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.890
Dr. Shapiro's been working
on diabetes research

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.320
for a long time, and
in particular he's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.240
credited with
developing the Edmonton

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.504
Protocol for human islet
cell transplantation, which

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.670
was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.250
in the year 2000.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.210
He's currently
continuing this research

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.460
at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.900
And he also holds the
Canadian Research Chair

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.900
in transplantation and
regenerative medicine.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.980
Dr. Shapiro's received
quite a lot of awards,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.930
including a Hunterian
medal from the Royal

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.330
College of Surgeons of England.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.980
And he's also
recently been inducted

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.940
as a fellow of the
Royal Society of Canada.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.200
And with that, please help
me welcome Dr. Shapiro.

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:53.550
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: Frank,
thank you very much indeed.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.630
It's very kind of you
to invite me to Google.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.992
I'm very impressed
with my tour so far.

00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.700
And I'm very excited
about the discussion

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.741
that we're going to have
later on this afternoon.

00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.319
So it's a great privilege
to be here and be with you

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.000
and share our hopes and trials
and tribulations and progress

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.725
in some of the treatments for
the condition of diabetes.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:16.100
So we're trying
to get to a point

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.700
where we have
diabetes cured once

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.770
and for all for the future.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.840
But it's not easy to do
that in one fell swoop.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.040
So we've got several
strategies, and it's really

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.280
a team and global effort
in diabetes research,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.760
to try and take a point
where we have insulin today

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.300
and hopefully no injections,
no monitoring for the future.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.235
And I'll try and take
you along that journey

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.910
of cutting edge islet and stem
cell transplant treatments

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.970
in the clinic for diabetes
as we move forward today.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.796
So diabetes.

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:46.420
Most of you will know
what diabetes is,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.990
but just the start
of the basics.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.310
Diabetes is a condition
where patients

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.835
lose the ability to
adjust their blood sugar.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.585
And there are two main
types of diabetes--

00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:57.430
there are several subtypes--
but two main types.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.060
Type one, where the
pancreas basically

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.914
has lost its ability
to make insulin.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.705
The cells in the pancreas
that make insulin

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:06.700
are called islets of Langerhans.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.521
And inside those collections
of cells there are beta cells,

00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:12.020
and those are the beta cells
are the ones that make insulin.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.340
So in someone who has
type I diabetes then

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.500
the body has basically destroyed
those cells-- destroyed

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.770
the beta cells inside the
pancreas inside the islets

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.890
that make insulin.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.515
So the patients have an
absolute deficiency of insulin.

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.130
And the other type
of diabetes-- which

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.250
is of course much more common
and increasing in number as

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.180
well-- is type 2
diabetes, where patients

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.290
become resistant to insulin.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080
And therefore when
they receive insulin,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.180
or the pancreas
is making insulin,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.670
the body's needs for
insulin are basically

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.620
what the pancreas can
release is insufficient.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010
So diabetes is a very
common condition.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.020
There are about
381 million people

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.600
with diabetes in
the world today,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.310
based on the world estimates
from the Diabetes Federation

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.770
2013.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.890
Type I diabetes represents about
10% of the world population.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.620
By 2030, this population with
type I and type 2 diabetes

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.630
will double.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.960
So it's going to be a huge, huge
health burden for the future.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.440
The national cost of diabetes
in this country and the US

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.210
alone is greater than $245
billion estimated last year.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.350
And that increased from
$174 billion in 2007.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.290
And clearly, with
the massive increase

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.140
in numbers of patients
with diabetes,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.840
this is going to become
uncontrollable and super

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.250
saturate the ability
of health care systems

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.174
to deliver appropriate care.

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:37.590
So insulin has been around for
a long time, as some of you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.370
may know.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.450
Banting/Best-- and this
is Frederick Banting

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.840
in the physiology laboratories
in London, Canada in 1920,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.290
1921, 1922 when the
team was working

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.820
on the discovery of insulin
Banting, Best, Collip,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.300
and Macleod.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.320
And insulin injection
therapy clearly

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.405
has been life-saving for many,
many patients with type 1

00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:03.620
and some patients
with type 2 diabetes.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.110
So injections of
insulin from the outside

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.634
can substitute for the pancreas'
ability to make insulin.

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:13.550
And we measure insulin
in the number of units.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.250
So most patients will take 20,
30, 40 units on insulin a day.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.769
And they measure the number
of units of insulin--

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.830
it was a crude amount-- it was
the amount of insulin needed,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.040
one unit of instant to cause
hypoglycemia in a rabbit.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.830
That's how they
originally discovered it

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.790
when Banting and Best
were working on this.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.760
Diabetes is a dangerous
condition to have overall.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.070
Kidney failure is a
problem-- 25 times more

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.520
risk than the
general population.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.600
Heart attacks-- two to
five times more risk

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.310
than the general population.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.940
Strokes-- two to
three times more risk.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.520
And life expectancy for
patients with diabetes

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.110
is at least 10 years shorter
than the rest of the world

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.150
without diabetes.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.680
Diabetes is the leading
cause of vision loss

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.230
in working age adults.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.520
It's the commonest cause of
end stage kidney failure,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.812
and of non-traumatic
lower limb amputations,

00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:05.270
because the blood
vessels basically

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.970
become destroyed when the
body's glucose becomes awry.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.790
There's been lots
of improvements

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.190
in the treatment of diabetes
over the course of time.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.148
As I mentioned, before
the discovery of insulin

00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:20.850
in 1921, 1922, diabetes
was a fatal condition.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.080
When insulin was first
tried in patients,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.847
it led to complications--
infection, sepsis.

00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:29.430
Then there's been
various improvements

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.270
in different types of insulin--
short acting, long acting

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.420
insulin-- in different
ways of delivering insulin

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.050
over the course of time,
including insulin pumps,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.230
including continuous blood
glucose monitoring systems.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.830
And the whole idea here is to
try to tighten up the sugar

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.100
control so that patients
are at less risk of getting

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.720
the end stage complications
of diabetes-- the micro

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.850
and the macro
complications of diabetes.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.690
And the reverse side
of that equation

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.610
is we try to tighten
up the control

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.420
as the patients get much
more of this condition, which

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.880
is a iatrogenic condition--
in other words, caused

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.800
by doctors-- which is
called hypoglycemia.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.130
So when the blood sugar falls
below a certain threshold,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.560
then patients
become susceptible,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.410
because the brain absolutely
requires glucose to function.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.590
As soon as the blood glucose
drops below a certain level,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.050
then the brain can
no longer function.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.130
So islet cell transplantation
has been around since the 1970s

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.410
experimentally.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.620
And first trials in patients
happened in the 1980s.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.652
And it really took
off in 2000, and there

00:06:30.652 --> 00:06:31.610
have been several done.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.151
I'm now going to
explain and tell you

00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:35.540
the story about
transportation shortly.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.210
But really our indications
for islet transplantation

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.150
have been to try to reduce
this risk of hypoglycemia,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.750
reducing the risk
of lows in patients

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.370
that are needing insulin.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.280
So why do we try to run
the blood sugar low?

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.010
This is really based on
some very large trials

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.100
in patients with diabetes.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.120
We know from these
curves for example,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.120
as we try to tighten up
the blood sugar control,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.280
we can definitely reduce
the risk of complications

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.613
such as this one on the right,
called retinopathy, which

00:07:00.613 --> 00:07:03.430
is where the blood vessels in
the back of the eye accelerate,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.200
and grow, and cause
the blindness.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.730
But, as we tighten
up the control,

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.800
then patients are more and
more at risk of getting lows.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.660
And we measure this by
the glycated hemoglobin,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.912
which is a marker in the
bloodstream that really tells

00:07:15.912 --> 00:07:17.370
you how good or
bad the blood sugar

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.410
control is over several months.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.320
So here's a patient that's
wearing a state-of-the-art

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.840
continuous glucose monitor.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.810
And you can see across
day one and day two,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.050
this patient has quite
wide fluctuations

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.360
in blood sugar control.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.960
And at 8:00 in the
morning on the second day,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.860
you can see the
blood glucose drops,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.375
the patient is on their
own, not monitored.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.750
And unfortunately,
that patient's

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.710
found dead in bed
at 9:00 an hour

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.550
later, from a fatal
hypoglycemic event.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.570
And fortunately, this
is relatively rare,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.580
but it does happen.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.550
And it happens in young
adults with type 1 diabetes

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.910
that have poor control.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.260
Now this is what we can achieve
today with an islet cell

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.820
transplant in the
lower panel here.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.550
You can see very
wide fluctuations

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.510
in blood sugar over
the course of time,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.910
up until that red arrow
when the patient receives

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.320
an islet transplant.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.570
This is a transplant that
actually is done in Miami.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.650
Dr. Camillo Ricordi shared
this slide and data with me.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.350
But it's very typical of
what we can achieve routinely

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.600
with an islet cell transplant.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.100
And here you can see, after
the islet transplant, when

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.490
the patient discontinues
insulin, the blood sugar

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.950
control becomes very tight,
is in the normal range

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.194
or near normal range.

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:29.110
The price of this however,
is that the patient

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.630
needs a procedure-- a small
procedure to receive cells--

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.600
and has to have
immunosuppressive drugs

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.229
in order for the body not
to reject these cells.

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.290
They're transplanted
cells from organ donors,

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.909
and they are
therefore potentially

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.340
foreign to the body.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.960
And also the process
that caused diabetes

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.190
in the first place, which
is an autoimmune process,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.610
meaning the body attacks itself.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.530
This will happen
again after an islet

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.810
transparent to the new cells,
unless the anti-rejection drugs

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.310
are given.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.119
So there's been real progress
in islet cell transplantation.

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:00.160
I'll explain that to you.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.100
But I think we're somewhere
along this hype cycle

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.516
right now, perhaps
somewhere along

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:05.150
the slope of enlightenment.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.010
We haven't got to
Nirvana yet, but we're

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.600
trying to get there along
the plateau of productivity.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.060
And still I think
if you can read

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.062
and you can Google lots
of negative reviews

00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:17.520
on islet transplantation,
because I

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.290
think the knowledge
in this area probably

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.404
hasn't reached all
of the community.

00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:24.570
But I'm sharing with you
today some of the progress.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.619
But there's been progress
throughout diabetes.

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:28.160
And here for example,
is a trial that

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.930
was just completed in
September last year, looking

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.120
at a special instant pump that
switches off when the blood

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.910
sugar reaches a certain low
threshold, low glucose suspend.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.500
And when this is
applied to patients,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.120
then the risk of patients
getting hypoglycemia

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.805
is certainly a lot less
than it would be otherwise.

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:47.180
So there's been
lots of progress.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.970
And I'm also very
excited this afternoon

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.030
to meet with your Google
contact lens team.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.510
Because I think the areas of
monitoring for blood sugar

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.096
control, and our
ability to monitor

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.970
the function of our cell
transplant therapies

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.060
over time with this
kind of technology

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.690
will be enormously informative
and allow us to tighten up

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.350
our control, minimize
the stress on the cells,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.510
and allow us all to learn a
lot about controlling diabetes.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.830
So who do we offer an
islet transplant to today?

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.970
We have two real
major categories--

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.980
those with patients who have
an islet transplant alone.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.271
In other words, they haven't
had a previous transplant.

00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:23.000
They have to have
type 1 diabetes

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.204
for more than five years.

00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:26.620
They have to fail on all the
standard therapies, including

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.805
insulin pumps if available.

00:10:28.805 --> 00:10:30.305
And we have various
scoring systems,

00:10:30.305 --> 00:10:32.500
which I won't dwell on,
but they're basically

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.390
to demonstrate that the
patient has severe lows,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.130
despite their ability to control
the glucose as best they can.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.000
And about 5% to 10% of
the population with type 1

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.700
diabetes-- at least
in Canada-- would

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.800
fulfill these very
strict criteria

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.260
to justify adding
immunosuppression and receiving

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.414
a cell infusion.

00:10:52.414 --> 00:10:53.830
The other side of
the equation are

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.820
patients who have already
had a successful transplant,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.520
like a heart, a lung, or in
this case, a kidney transplant.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.640
So they're already on
the anti-rejection drugs,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.556
so they don't have to
face any additional risk

00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:05.360
except from the minor risk
of the procedure required

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.780
to put the cells in.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.430
And islet after kidney
transplant, or second category,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.030
is becoming a very
successful category too.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.614
So we began with the Edmonton
protocol in the year 2000.

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:17.030
It didn't just
begin from nowhere.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.800
It began from 30
years of research

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.610
in small and large
animal models.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.740
And a terrific collaboration
with several international

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.390
centers across the world.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.200
And I think that's one of the
privileges involved in science

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.780
and in diabetes
research, is that we

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.150
have a very, very close knit
community of scientists working

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.130
together, willing to share
information and ideas

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.960
to allow us all to
get to the next step.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.940
And it probably is
modeled very nicely

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.440
in the Google organization.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.257
So we published this in 2000.

00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:50.090
This is the New England
Journal of Medicine,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.160
where our first seven
patients receiving islets

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.640
under the Edmonton protocol--
that we called subsequently

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.400
the Edmonton protocol--
where all the patients that

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.407
had the transplants were able to
come off insulin and remain off

00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:01.740
insulin for a period of a years.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.836
And in fact, now 15 years
later, two of the original 12

00:12:04.836 --> 00:12:06.210
are still completely
insulin-free

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.720
with full function.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.120
And we've just
refined this treatment

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.622
over the course of time to
try and further improve it.

00:12:13.622 --> 00:12:15.580
So this was what we call
the Edmonton protocol.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.400
We gave two sets
of islet infusions.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.980
Initially around 5,000
islets per kilogram

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.500
based on the recipient's weight.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.874
And then we have
another infusion

00:12:23.874 --> 00:12:25.417
to provide enough
cell mass to make

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:27.000
it sufficient insulin
for the patient.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.160
Then we gave these two
anti-rejection drugs--

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.490
sirolimus and tacrolimus-- and
an antibody at the beginning.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.355
And we subsequently
changed these drugs now

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:36.300
to more standard drugs,
because we encountered

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.710
quite a lot of side effects
from the sirolimus drug.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.210
But it was certainly
very successful

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.030
in allowing us to
begin our first trials.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.060
We then replicated these
trials in Miami, Minnesota,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.570
and in our own site in
Edmonton in 118 patients,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.976
and were able to replicate
this quite successfully in 82%

00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:54.600
percent of patients
coming off insulin.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.680
And then we moved forward with
the immune tolerance network

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.470
and carried out a large
international trial

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.380
in the US and Europe, testing
the Edmonton protocol.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.120
And we published that too
in the New England Journal.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.590
So where are we today?

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.590
So we've treated in
Edmonton over 200 patients--

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.869
218 patients-- who've
received 460 transplants.

00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:18.660
So you can see that
most patients require--

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.080
in our center at least--
two islet infusions

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.672
to provide sufficient
mass for them

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:24.380
to come off insulin
for a period of time.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.100
We've received in
Canada patients

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.862
from all across the country.

00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:30.070
Last year we did a record
number of islet transplants

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.569
in Edmonton.

00:13:30.569 --> 00:13:33.550
We did 66 islet
transplants at Edmonton.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.800
And we're quite proud of that.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.420
We've kept our teams very busy.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.350
Across the world,
currently there've

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.750
been over 1,000 islet
transplants done at least

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.910
30 different
international sites.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.715
And so I'm going
to explain to you

00:13:47.715 --> 00:13:49.222
know how we get the islets out.

00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:50.930
That was a picture,
by the way, of islets

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.630
under a microscope stained
with a dithizone dye that

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.552
stains the zinc.

00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:56.260
Because zinc and
insulin are very closely

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.119
linked Studying the
zinc inside the islet,

00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:00.410
so you can see then quite
clearly under the microscope.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.652
Those are very pure
islets ready for infusion.

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:04.610
But we don't just get
the islets from anywhere.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.720
They come from a human pancreas.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.030
So I'm just going to walk
you through this process,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.630
because it is quite a complex
process that our team has

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.380
to do in Edmonton.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.850
So here they take
a pancreas, they

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.540
canulate the pancreas duct.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.150
And as we're going through
the video here on the right,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.890
I'll show you the
graph on the left there

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.820
is all those little dots, sort
of like the stars in the night,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.150
every one of those represents
over 1,500 islet isolations

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.637
done by our team over
the last 15 years.

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:31.220
There's a human
pancreas on the right,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.290
you can see it being distended
with collagenase enzymes

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.180
before we chop it up and put it
in Camillo Ricordi's chamber.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.050
So there's Doug shaking
the chamber there.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.306
This team's a very
well-knit team.

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:45.180
They work day and night
to prepare the cells.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.260
Once the cells are
digested, then we

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.670
purify them on a continuous
ficoll gradient on a cool code

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.710
machine.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.657
And there's Doug and Tatsuya
and the team at Edmonton

00:14:57.657 --> 00:14:58.990
that prepare these cells for us.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.580
They've done a
terrific job for us.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.360
You can't see that
graph on the right,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.460
it's a little too small for
you, but basically the number

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.043
of islets they get
out of the pancreas

00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:07.620
today is double
the number that we

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.570
were able to get in
2000, when we first

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.080
began the Edmonton protocol.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.850
And their success rate in
being able to take a pancreas

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.500
and provide enough
cells to transplant

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.042
has also increased to
around 60% to 70% percent.

00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:21.665
The actual transplant
part is very, very simple.

00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:23.290
It doesn't require
a transplant surgeon

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.150
to do this, fortunately.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.370
So the transplant is done
in the x-ray department

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.130
under local anesthetic.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.360
Here's a patient who
is awake, chatting away

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.620
during the procedure.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.140
We use fluoroscopy x-ray so we
can see where the needle goes.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.070
We thread a catheter into
the main portal vein there,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.360
and then we simply drip
the cells in under gravity.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.150
And we measure the
portal pressure

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.270
while we do this, we give
heparin to prevent blood

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.810
clotting at the end, before
we pull that catheter out.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.451
Because we learned this perhaps
in our first early cases,

00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:56.325
when we pulled the
catheter out of the liver,

00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:57.408
we initially got bleeding.

00:15:57.408 --> 00:15:59.960
So we found that when we put
this paste in along the track

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.955
as we pull it out, we
mix it up with contrast

00:16:01.955 --> 00:16:05.710
so that we can see it being
injected on the x-ray screen.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.090
You'll see that in a second
here as we load the syringe,

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.115
this is Aventine paste.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:11.740
So as we pull the catheter out,
we plug the track in the liver.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.030
And that has eliminated
the risk of complications

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.470
such as bleeding after
the islet transplant

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.680
So this is a very
safe procedure.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.870
And if we look at the
number of patients

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.871
we've treated over the course
of time now, 97% of patients

00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:25.370
survive.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.350
And these are
patients, of course,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.975
who have had longstanding
diabetes, who

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.130
are at risk of many
different things.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.270
And of the few deaths that
we've encountered over 15

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.320
years have been mainly
cardiovascular deaths

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.294
in patients with
longstanding diabetes.

00:16:37.294 --> 00:16:38.460
So heart attacks, basically.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.850
So we've had four patients
die of heart attacks.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.920
One patient had a possible
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.300
And one patient had
fatal hypoglycemia

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.520
after an early transplant
where the cells failed.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.490
So none of these deaths have
been related to the transplant

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.370
or to the anti-rejection
drug treatment today.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.560
So this has been a
very safe transplant,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.799
certainly the safest transplant
that I've been involved in.

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:03.090
There have been adverse events.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.610
We can go through
these, but I won't

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:05.859
go to them in too much detail.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.940
A couple of patients
over 15 years-- 1.4%--

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.930
needed to go on to get
a kidney transplant,

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.260
because the drug we give to
prevent rejection to crolimus

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.940
does have kidney side effects.

00:17:18.925 --> 00:17:20.050
Now what about performance?

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.480
Are we doing better over time?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.920
So if we look at the
function of cells over time,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.300
in the red line here.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.910
So every molecule
of insulin that's

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.700
made by the cells,
another molecule

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.110
is made called C-peptide.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.580
And we can measure the
C-peptide in the bloodstream

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.150
with a simple blood test.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.900
So you can see that over
the course of 15 years,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.060
73% of patients continue
to make C-peptide

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.940
to a sufficient degree that
controls the hemoglobin A1c,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.750
therefore reduces
their risk of getting

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.380
the complications of
diabetes, and prevents

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.100
the patients from getting
hypoglycemic events.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.390
So this is a real advance,
particularly for patients

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.000
that have really recalcitrant
risk of hypoglycemia.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.165
So these patients are
very well protected.

00:18:00.165 --> 00:18:02.540
But what we did see in the
early Edmonton protocol series

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.880
is that a large
number of patients

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.046
did need to go back on to
small amounts of insulin--

00:18:06.046 --> 00:18:09.434
around 15% of patients--
by the 15-year mark.

00:18:09.434 --> 00:18:10.850
And so we've spent
a lot of effort

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.790
now in the last
several years seeing

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.532
if we can improve these results
over the course of time.

00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:17.490
And if you can think of
the number of the cells

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.590
that we transplant in to
liver here as a bucket,

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.820
and the cells are being
lost through little holes

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.380
in the bucket, we've
been working in science

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.310
to see if we can plug
the holes in the bucket

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.842
to try to allow more cells
to survive over time.

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:30.550
So we've been looking
at various pathways

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.640
to reduce early
damage to the cells,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.120
trying to prevent them from
being rejected and preventing

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.275
leg graft loss, and
then really trying

00:18:37.275 --> 00:18:39.150
to improve the number
of cells that we put in

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.358
at the beginning, so that
we can have many, many more

00:18:41.358 --> 00:18:43.000
patients with fuller
function and more

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.680
durable function over time.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.765
Now because type 1 diabetes
is an autoimmune condition,

00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:50.140
as we mentioned
at the beginning,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.300
there is a risk of the
autoimmunity coming back again.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.092
And here's a patient's
biopsy-- and I

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.550
won't go through
too much details--

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.220
but you can see on
the right hand side,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.260
there are islets
surviving quite well,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.780
but no beta cells in
that biopsy, which

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.980
is from Dr. Razinia's group in
University of Massachusetts.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.110
So we need processes that
can control rejection, reduce

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.230
inflammation, and allow the
patients to become tolerant.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.770
In other words, for
the future, we'd

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.520
like to have a cell
treatment that we just

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.020
put into the patients that
the patients won't reject

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.260
on their own, and won't need
lifelong anti-rejection drugs.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.050
And we're all trying
to get to that point

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.210
where we can achieve that.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.920
And controlling this triangle
is a bit of a challenge,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.060
but we're working on
it very intensively

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.850
as a global community of
diabetes research scientists.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.235
And we're trying various
different maneuvers--

00:19:37.235 --> 00:19:39.860
I mentioned a few of them that
I won't go through the details--

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.360
but I've mentioned a few of
them that we're trying presently

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.900
in Edmonton.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.380
Now I showed you that
falloff an insulin

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.600
independence rates
at five years.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.460
And now there are 6 centers
across the world that

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.420
have insulin-free
rates with islet cell

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.170
transplant of five
years, more than 50%.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.870
And this is an
important milestone,

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.670
because it's exactly the
same rate that we would

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.890
see with a whole pancreas
transplant alone,

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.130
so a big operation
in comparison.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.770
Putting a whole
pancreas transplant in,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.580
connecting the blood vessels
up, and the risks from that.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.670
We can achieve today-- at
least in these 6 centers-- very

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.050
similar results to the whole
pancreas transfer alone,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.220
with a simple
injection in the site.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.132
So in trying to control
the immune response.

00:20:20.132 --> 00:20:21.715
We've tried this
treatment in Edmonton

00:20:21.715 --> 00:20:23.840
now in over 100
patients-- I need

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.820
to update those
numbers-- on over 100

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.300
patients in various
different protocols

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300
over the course of time.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.920
And what we found in our
earlier analysis is basically

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.740
if we look at the
C-peptide rates,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.910
they're very similar,
perhaps a little bit better

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.326
with the the
Alemtuzumab than they

00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:40.840
were with the Edmonton
protocol, 84% at seven

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.510
years with C-peptide function.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.630
And if we look at the
independence rates--

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.360
these are patients who are
fully free of insulin-- again,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.600
ongoing data still in analysis
phase, but 58% of our patients,

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.440
when we last analyzed
this at seven years,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.970
were still free of insulin.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.510
Significantly improved from
our original Edmonton protocol

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:04.130
data, where currently at 15
years, just 11% of patients

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.170
remain insulin-free.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.150
I mentioned the hemoglobin
A1c-- the glycated hemoglobin--

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.680
this marker in the
bloodstream that tells you

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.210
how good the blood
sugar control is.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.790
And you can see at the
beginning where it says pre

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.650
there, on the left hand
side of your screen,

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.610
that the levels are
around 8% or 9%.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.720
And the red line
is the threshold

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.040
of what a normal
person would have,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.220
who doesn't have diabetes.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.510
Now as we bring the line closer
and closer to the red line,

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.700
then the risk of getting
secondary complications

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.667
is obviously reduced markedly.

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:36.750
But normally, if we did
that with injected insulin

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.291
from the outside, the closer we
got to the red line, the more

00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:41.740
and more dangerous hypoglycemias
the patient would have.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.590
Well after the islet
cell transplant,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.240
we can achieve the
below the red line

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.390
or under the red
line very reliably

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.699
without the risk
of hypoglycemia.

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:52.240
And these graphs show you the
different measures that we use.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.781
Beforehand, you see
the patients have

00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:57.780
a sky-high risk of hypoglycemia,
and this score is about five

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.420
on that score.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.540
On the hypo score,
it's around 1,200.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.360
And afterward, you
can see it's almost

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.350
undetectable over
the course of time.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.751
So patients are
completely protected,

00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:10.500
as long as the cells
continue to function,

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.690
from hypoglycemia and
swings in blood sugar.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.470
So this is a very
effective treatment

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.700
for controlling blood sugar.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.366
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:17.366 --> 00:22:20.850
-I feel my control
now is the best

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.126
it's ever been in 20 years.

00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:24.077
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:25.660
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
What about the risk

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.230
of the secondary complications?

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.980
There are several
centers looking at this.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.400
Garth Warnock Vancouver has
looked at this quite closely.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.420
What he finds in a control
group with islet transplant

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.560
versus conventional, or best
medical care insulin therapy,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.170
is the islet transplant group
has much lower hemoglobin

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:43.680
A1c in the green.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.142
They have less risk
of eye disease.

00:22:46.142 --> 00:22:47.850
And their kidneys are
actually protected,

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.760
despite the fact that they
are receiving tacrolimus.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.730
So this is very
encouraging data to suggest

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.600
that an islet or
other cell transplant,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.997
or stem cell transplant in
the future for diabetes,

00:22:57.997 --> 00:22:59.580
will have these
similar effects, being

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.704
able to protect against
the secondary complications

00:23:01.704 --> 00:23:03.700
of diabetes.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.650
We're working with the
US FDA quite closely

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.710
in two major trials were part
of the clinical islet transplant

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.330
consortium.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.600
One is called CIT-06 and
one is called CIT-07.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.250
And basically to
make it very simple,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.130
one is islet after
kidney transplants,

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.270
in the 07 one are islets alone.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.720
These trials are now
completed or undergoing

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.320
a very detailed analysis with
the FDA, and very likely,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.910
these two trials will
lead to the FD awarding

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.680
a biological license for
islet transplantation,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.550
allowing Medicare, Medicaid,
and third party payers

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.740
to potentially reimburse islet
transplant in the US, which

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.080
has been a major limiting factor
in terms of the numbers of cell

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.840
transplants done in the US.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.039
We've been very fortunate
in Canada however

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:47.580
to have the Canadian government
pay-- the Alberta government,

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.317
I should say-- pay for
the Canadian transplants

00:23:50.317 --> 00:23:50.900
to this point.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.976
And a similar thing
has happened in the UK

00:23:52.976 --> 00:23:55.350
with the National Institute
of Clinical Excellence paying

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.490
for islet transplant
through the UK government.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.010
Same thing in Australia, same
thing in Europe, and Geneva,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.360
and in several other countries.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.740
So hopefully this will
happen very soon in the US.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.040
Several groups have
reported the ability

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.080
to achieve what I showed you
with two islet transplants

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.870
with a single donor
islet infusion.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:13.960
And this would be
important because it

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.626
would allow twice the
number of patients

00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:19.210
to receive transplants from
a limited donor source,

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.779
from organ donors.

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:22.570
And so several centers
have been able to do

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.950
that with different strategies.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.940
But still this is a challenge,
I would say, for us.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.940
Only about 10% of our
patients in Edmonton

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.640
are able to achieve insulin
independence routinely.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.520
If we don't select the donor,
we don't select the recipient

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.950
entirely.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.640
What we do find if we look
at Melena Bellin's analysis?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.640
Looking at all the
patients treated

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.940
that are participating in these
centers, that at five years,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.900
if we give an anti-inflammatory
treatment at the beginning

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:54.100
called Tanacet-- which prevents
an inflammatory agent called

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.650
TNF-- if we switch that
off at the beginning,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.850
we can have many, many
more patients of insulin

00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.510
at five years.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.650
Seems to be very important
to suppress inflammation

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.440
at the beginning.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.720
So we've done studies in mice.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.845
We always take things back
to mice and test things.

00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:09.190
And we tested another compound
called Anakinra, which

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.370
is another antibody--
which is also

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.505
an anti-inflammatory one used
in inflammatory bowel disease

00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:16.830
and another condition
called psoriasis--

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.200
and we found that this is
a very effective treatment

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.820
to allow human islets
to engraft in mice.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.890
And we've been able to take that
treatment across to the clinic

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.775
and treat many
patients that way.

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.900
We've also been trying to
switch off the cell death

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.210
pathways in this pathway
called apoptosis.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.290
So cells die by
different processes,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.780
but we've tried several agents
to switch off cell death.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.910
These are called pan
caspase inhibitors,

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.030
because they switch off
all the major cell death

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.375
pathways that lead
to this apoptosis.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:47.530
And when we've tested these in
our mouse models and our pig

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.160
models, we find that
these caspase inhibitors

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.440
can reduce the tiny
number of islets needed

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.670
to reverse diabetes
by about 80%.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.722
So they make a big,
big difference.

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.180
And we've tested
this several times

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.650
in various different
combinations

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.200
and various different ways.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.160
And we've moved on and carried
out the early clinical trial

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.374
with these that looks--
well at this point,

00:26:06.374 --> 00:26:08.540
it's difficult to say whether
it's had a big impact.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.530
But we're still working on it.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.059
So we recognize today that
islet transplantation,

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:14.600
the way it is today,
because patients

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.560
need immunosuppression, because
there is a shortage of organ

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.110
donors, could only
really address

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.782
a very narrow band in
the spectrum of patients

00:26:21.782 --> 00:26:22.365
with diabetes.

00:26:22.365 --> 00:26:23.990
And we'd like to get
to this point here

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.590
where we can treat all
the patients that are just

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.880
diagnosed with diabetes, that
have difficult to control

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.110
diabetes, that have
chronic type I diabetes,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.870
and also those that
have type 2 diabetes--

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.410
the entire spectrum of diabetes.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.260
And we recognize
that if we keep going

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.140
the way we are going
on that one track,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.960
we won't be able to address
that entire spectrum.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.760
So what next?

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.810
So we're looking at
alternative retrievable sites

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.580
to put in islets today, or stem
cells potentially tomorrow.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.330
And here's a trial
that we're actively

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.930
involved in now with a
company called Sernova.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.730
And this is a device
that goes under the skin.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.359
It's the the size and
shape of a tea bag.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:04.150
And it basically threads
in under the skin.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.720
We leave it there for
about a month or two.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.900
And while it's
under the skin here,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.800
the body makes new blood
vessels that grow in.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.220
And this is a sort of in
response to a foreign body.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.717
Then we take those rods
out when we come back.

00:27:17.717 --> 00:27:19.550
And we can do this under
a local anesthetic,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.350
we can do this under
a general anesthetic.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.160
And then we can infuse
ourselves along that track,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.730
and basically put the cells
in under the skin instead

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.950
of in in liver.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.860
Now that may be an advantage,
but as we think to the future,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.760
as we think about
use of stem cells,

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.940
it might be safer to put
them in a retrievable place

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.800
where we can take them
out if we need to.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.049
So if we put them under the
skin instead of the liver,

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:43.540
it's a much simpler maneuver
to take the cells out.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.880
So we've done this so
far in a few patients,

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.640
and it's looked
somewhat promising

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.880
in terms of being able
to show cell survival.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.440
But this is still ongoing,
and we're looking at the data

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.060
closely.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.510
We've also been looking at what
we call the deviceless method.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.700
So we put a tube under the skin.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.970
We leave the tube under the
skin-- a simple catheter

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.097
that we use routinely
in the x-ray department.

00:28:06.097 --> 00:28:08.180
We leave that catheter
under the skin for a month.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.490
We take the calculator out,
and then we put our cells,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.224
or stem cells, or
islets, or whatever kind

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.765
of cell population
we want to put in,

00:28:14.765 --> 00:28:18.450
in this track, which has now got
lots of nice new blood vessels.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.040
And here you can
see islets surviving

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.590
in that round area
that used to have

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.940
the little catheter
on the top left there.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.590
And the cells work very well.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.819
And you can see with the
catheter placed under the skin,

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:31.610
and then we put the
cells in the blue line,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.320
blood glucose comes
down quite nicely,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.620
It takes a few weeks to do so.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.120
And you can see on
the right, we get

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.120
lots of nice new blood
vessels growing in

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.070
to supply these cells.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.130
So I mentioned islet transplants
today, and stem cells tomorrow.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.990
So I think we are
getting very close now

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.860
to being able to move
forward with stem cell

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.180
treatments instead of islet
cell transplant treatments

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.850
for the next round of
trials for the future.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.730
There are several
groups across the world

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.040
working on stem cells.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.740
And I'll show first
just one that we're

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.190
collaborating with,
Maria Nostro and Gordon

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:03.970
Keller at the
University of Toronto

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.190
have made a stem
cell line that makes

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.480
human insulin-- the human beta
cells, basically-- from stem

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.316
cells.

00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:12.690
And we've been able to reverse
diabetes quite effectively

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.210
in mice and our deviceless
model with that cell system.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.640
We've also been testing out
to see if the cells turn out

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.040
to have what's
called a teratoma,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.310
or risk of awry cells, then
they can be transplanted still

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.810
in this deviceless space
and not breach the space,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.115
so we can still
potentially remove them.

00:29:31.115 --> 00:29:32.990
We've also been working
for the last 10 years

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.355
with a company called
Viacyte down in San Diego.

00:29:36.355 --> 00:29:39.090
And we've been very
excited by that progress

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.460
in developing a human embryonic
stem cell line that they have

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.730
shown can reliably
make human insulin,

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.330
and can be potentially
transplanted,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.160
and can cure diabetes in
mice when transplanted.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.820
And this group has
been very innovative

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.660
and shown these
cells to be safe,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.650
to have no risk of the
teratoma that I mentioned.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.670
And they are now carrying
out a clinical trial

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.860
that we're looking
forward to participate in,

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.180
where we're going to put
these cells inside what's

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.280
called an immunoisolating
device, so

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.190
that the immune
system can't directly

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:16.434
get cell-to-cell contact
with the transplanted cells.

00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:18.100
And the idea of that
is that we wouldn't

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.160
have to give the
anti-rejection drug treatments

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.050
if it's effective.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.280
So we're looking forward
to starting these trials

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.210
with Viacyte within
the next few months.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.176
Now in parallel, there's
lots of other treatments

00:30:30.176 --> 00:30:31.550
that could
potentially switch off

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.960
the autoimmune pathways
in type 1 diabetes.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.180
And Jeff Bluestone,
from San Francisco here,

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.880
has summarized all
the different pathways

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.230
that can be switched off in type
1 diabetes, all the studies,

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.700
all the antibodies, all
the drug treatments that

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.990
can be given to try
and control diabetes.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.090
And it's obviously
a very complex one.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.450
We've amassed a team in
Alberta to try and address

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.210
one or two of these
together with industry

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.420
and a large collaboration
of scientists

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.056
in Edmonton and Calgary.

00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:00.680
We're going to do
two different trials.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.720
One is trying to get
patients' own stem

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.740
cells to regenerate
their own pancreas as

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.575
soon as the patient is
diagnosed with diabetes.

00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:11.360
In other words, resetting
the immune system

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.810
and getting the
patient's own cells

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.944
to turn back and
repair the beta cells.

00:31:16.944 --> 00:31:18.610
And then the second
strategy we're using

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.610
is the Viacyte cell transplants
to try to treat patients

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.610
just like we would at the
Edmonton protocol type

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.690
treatments that I
showed you about.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.460
So the immune reset
is moving forward.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.830
We've got our plans in place.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.413
We're just putting
them through ethics

00:31:33.413 --> 00:31:34.913
and through Health
Canada right now.

00:31:34.913 --> 00:31:37.246
We're going to give antibody
treatments at the beginning

00:31:37.246 --> 00:31:38.460
to reset the immune system.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.010
We're going to take the
patient's own bone marrow cells

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.030
and re-transplant those
up into the pancreas

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.880
to allow those cells to
repair the injured pancreas.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.470
Then we're going to give a
treatment for the first year,

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.690
called a GLP-1 analog,
that will help to further

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.330
regenerate and
accelerate the growth

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.716
and repair of injured islets.

00:31:56.716 --> 00:31:58.090
So we have a lot
of things to do,

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.673
and we're very, very
excited about it.

00:31:59.673 --> 00:32:02.320
We're also working
with another technology

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.190
called normothermic perfusion.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.760
And this is going
to I think really

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.020
revolutionize all areas
of transplantation.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.020
So most the time you can see
those boxes on the right,

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.930
that's how we carry
organs around, in ice.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.226
So hearts, lungs,
livers, kidneys,

00:32:16.226 --> 00:32:17.600
and the pancreas
for our islets--

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.350
we carry them in these boxes.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.980
So we're just about
to start a trial

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.432
with a group at the
University of Oxford,

00:32:24.432 --> 00:32:25.890
and a company called
OrganOx, where

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.640
they have one device that
we could put a liver on,

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.860
which is in this
bottom left panel.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.980
There's other companies that
have a device for hearts,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.739
for lungs.

00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:37.280
And here's one that
we're testing out

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.620
for pancreas transplantation.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.104
So in other words, instead
of putting the organ in ice

00:32:42.104 --> 00:32:43.520
and having it
injured, we can keep

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.395
it perfectly alive--
like the heart's beating

00:32:45.395 --> 00:32:47.420
there-- outside the body.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.562
And so as soon as
we transplant it,

00:32:49.562 --> 00:32:51.020
it can be in perfect
condition when

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.144
we transplant these organs.

00:32:52.144 --> 00:32:55.289
It'll make a big, big difference
to the safety of transplants,

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:57.330
and also to make sure that
the transplants really

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.805
work before we put them in.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.030
And the idea here is that we
can deliver oxygen, deliver

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.590
nutrients, provide a
physiological temperature,

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.870
and provide an ideal
environment for the organ

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.000
while it's outside of the body.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.060
So we're very excited about this
technology as well as we move

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.560
forward.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.590
And this is the liver machine
that we're about to test.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.700
And the company who
came to San Diego

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.730
to the World Transplant
Congress mentioned to me

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.200
that they'd love
to have Google's

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.850
logo on the outside of the box.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.766
So, if you're interested
in working with them,

00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:30.350
just let them know.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.519
So let me sum up.

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:33.560
So I showed you that we've
made a lot of progress

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.100
in the treatments of diabetes
over the course of time.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.270
That insulin dependence
rates have improved a lot.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.050
That several centers now have
over half of their patients

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:44.240
still free of
insulin at five years

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.600
after an islet transplant.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.360
That we're looking now to
other alternative sites

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.035
for infusing islets
under the skin.

00:33:50.035 --> 00:33:51.660
I didn't mention
other sites that we're

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.490
about to test with
the Pittsburgh group,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.420
including the lining
of the stomach.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.910
We're about to start trials with
Viacyte on their embryonic stem

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.060
cell treatments.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.030
And we're also looking
at regeneration trials

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.790
to regenerate and repair
the pancreas and the islets

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.800
that at the moment a child or
adult is diagnosed with type 1

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.300
diabetes.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.000
So there's a lot of
things happening.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.250
I think we'll make
a lot of progress.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.040
So finally today, I'm very much
looking forward to discussing

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.830
with the contact lens team
our opportunities of working

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.270
together in cell
transplant monitoring,

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.889
and also with the
Google Glass team,

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.370
looking at the role
of the Google Glasses

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.680
and state-of-the-art monitoring
and complex surgeries.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.320
A guy was telling
me about the use

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.409
of these in lung
transplantation.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.920
I think we could apply this
very easily also in liver

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.610
transplantation, maybe join
the pancreas islet isolation.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.719
I think also this could
allow us to communicate

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.350
far better as scientists from
one institution to another.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.459
So instead of me being in
Edmonton, another group

00:34:48.459 --> 00:34:50.250
being in San Francisco,
another group being

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.600
in Australia, another
group being in China,

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.360
we could make a
scientific community that

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.830
is basically global
and one, and allow

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.690
us to work much closer together.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.950
And that's what I'm
very excited about.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.350
So on behalf of our
pre-clinical team scientists

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.310
that have done all the
hard work-- our PhDs,

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.879
our master students,
our post-docs,

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:10.420
and technicians that
have done really

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.990
all the hard work and
pre-clinical testing--

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.510
on behalf of our
large clinical team

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.650
that has basically helped up
prepare the islet transplants.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.820
So thank you very much
indeed for the opportunity

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.195
to present to you
this afternoon.

00:35:21.195 --> 00:35:24.684
I look forward to
answering your questions.

00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:31.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:31.075 --> 00:35:32.200
AUDIENCE: My name is Zerga.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.890
I actually work on
the iris and basically

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.130
the contact lens project here.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.130
So I've heard some questions
about the cells you infuse.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.170
So can you tell us some very
basic biology of those cells?

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:48.250
So when you inject it into the
blood vessels of the kidney,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.040
where do they end up?

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.700
So do they actually stay
there and live in the kidney?

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.600
Or do they end up
in the pancreas?

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.016
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
So the question

00:35:58.016 --> 00:36:02.482
is-- so we transplant our
cells inside the liver.

00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:04.780
So it's a local injection
literally inside like this,

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.694
under x-ray.

00:36:05.694 --> 00:36:08.180
And we get the radiologist
to put a catheter

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.030
into the main vein that
goes up into the liver.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.700
It's called the portal vein.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.763
And it's like a tree.

00:36:13.763 --> 00:36:16.590
It has main trunks, and
it has little branches.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.100
And the islet cells, the
vary in size, from about 50

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.380
microns to 150
micrometers in size.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.082
Some are larger-- 400 or
500 micrometers in size.

00:36:26.082 --> 00:36:27.540
And basically they
go up this tree,

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.168
and they go far along
the tree until they

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:32.940
get into a blood vessel
that's smaller than they are.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.320
There they get trapped.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.885
And basically a little bit of
blood clot forms around them,

00:36:37.885 --> 00:36:41.130
and a local inflammatory
reaction-- then new blood

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.902
vessels grow in
inside the liver.

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:47.060
These cells are not going
back into the pancreas.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.060
We could potentially put
them in the pancreas,

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.620
but it would be very, very
technically difficult to do so.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.740
It would be risky.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.266
It could case pancreatitis.

00:36:54.266 --> 00:36:56.015
It could be a difficult
place to put them.

00:36:56.015 --> 00:36:59.330
It just so happens that the
liver is a very effective place

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.205
to put these cells.

00:37:00.205 --> 00:37:01.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.470
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: Potentially
they can grow anywhere.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:12.880
The question will be will
the cells work as effectively

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.545
in another site as they
do currently in the liver.

00:37:15.545 --> 00:37:16.670
And we don't know that yet.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.670
AUDIENCE: How do they
communicate with the body?

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.037
When do they know
when to generate--

00:37:21.037 --> 00:37:23.370
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: How do
they communicate with the body

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:24.670
was the question.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.240
So the islets have
sensors on them.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.270
So they have glucose
receptors and they

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:31.750
can sense the blood
sugar, much the same way

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.160
you do with a skin test when
you take a drop of blood.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.910
They're listening to the
blood stream, monitoring it

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.930
constantly, all the time.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.890
And as soon as the blood glucose
goes high, then in concert,

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.620
they all release just the
right amount of insulin

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.530
that's needed in a
very dynamic way.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.900
And as the blood sugar drops
below a certain threshold,

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.540
they all shut off, so
they stop making insulin.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:01.845
So it's a much more precise
way of regulating blood sugar

00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:05.230
than if you inject
insulin from the outside.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.360
So it's able to do
that because they're

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.010
a collection of cells
there that adjust insulin.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.550
And i didn't mention, the islets
have several cell populations

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.100
int them.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.040
The have the beta cells
that make insulin.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.705
They also have another
cell population

00:38:17.705 --> 00:38:19.748
called alpha cells
that make glucagon.

00:38:19.748 --> 00:38:22.490
And glucagon makes
the blood sugar go up.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.250
So you have what's called
counter regulatory control.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.090
So with counter
regulatory control,

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.266
you can keep your blood sugar
in a very precise balance.

00:38:31.266 --> 00:38:32.390
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dr. Shapiro.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.090
My name's Joel.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:37.230
My wife has lived with type 1
diabetes for nearly 40 years.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.320
And she had a couple questions.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.280
The short one is-- do you
transplant the entirety

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.180
of the islet, or
just the beta cells?

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.130
And the more interesting,
or more complex

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.710
question is-- are you
modifying the islet cells prior

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:54.160
to transplant to reduce the
chance they'll be attacked

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.290
by the same antibodies
that originally

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.380
killed of the islet cells?

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.210
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: So the
islets that we transplant

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:02.824
are the collection
of all the cells.

00:39:02.824 --> 00:39:04.990
So there's five-- I mentioned
two cell types-- there

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.450
are actually five or six
different cell types.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.741
Maybe there's even more that
we haven't discovered yet.

00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:11.000
But the islet is sort of
an organelle collection

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.360
of several types.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.300
We think that the islet
needs all of those cell types

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.220
in order to survive
in the longer term.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.845
If you just took out
all the beta cells

00:39:18.845 --> 00:39:21.110
and transplanted them, they
might work for a while.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.693
But maybe the beta
cells on their own,

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:24.390
without the rest of
the supported matrix

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:26.848
and the ability to communicate
with each other in this sort

00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.869
of local mode, maybe they
wouldn't work as well.

00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:29.660
We don't know that.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.380
But we transplant
all of the cells.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.548
And so the second question was--

00:39:34.548 --> 00:39:38.028
AUDIENCE: Do you do anything
to modify the islet cells prior

00:39:38.028 --> 00:39:38.730
to transplant?

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.271
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
Do we do anything.

00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:42.724
And so, the islets are
taken out of the pancreas

00:39:42.724 --> 00:39:43.390
in that process.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.290
We keep them in culture.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.660
Now in the old days, in the very
first experiments we've done,

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.537
there was a lot of different
innovations that we had done.

00:39:52.537 --> 00:39:54.370
You could treat them
with ultraviolet light.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.110
You could treat
them with x-rays.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.720
You could treat them
with high oxygen.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.053
And these would alter what
is called the immunogenicity,

00:39:59.053 --> 00:40:02.610
or the ability of the body
to recognize them as foreign.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.070
We haven't done so
much of that now.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.610
But potentially you
can do a lot of things

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.489
to manipulate the
cells in the Petri dish

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:12.155
that could alter the
ability of the body

00:40:12.155 --> 00:40:13.363
to recognize them as foreign.

00:40:13.363 --> 00:40:15.535
we could wrap them in
a seaweed membrane,

00:40:15.535 --> 00:40:18.650
an algenate microcapsule.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.604
We could add other
products locally

00:40:20.604 --> 00:40:22.020
around the islets
to protect them.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.520
So an islet in some way
has a lot more potential

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.100
than the other
transplants that we do,

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.190
where we don't have that ability
to alter them in the dish.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.016
But we haven't explored that
perhaps to its full potential.

00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:35.140
Yeah, you're quite correct.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.050
AUDIENCE: I noticed
in one of the slides

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:42.020
that the A1c's
that were reported,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.160
or that were monitored in your
patients, seemed to improve

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.630
over time after the
transplant, not just initially.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.310
And given the propensity
of these cells to degrade,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.189
I was surprised that it
got better as time went on.

00:40:55.189 --> 00:40:57.605
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: I think
that's partly a function-- well

00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:00.570
I should say hemoglobin
doesn't drop immediately.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.240
The reason for that is it
takes two or three months

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.600
to have an effect.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.880
So if you have bad
control, then you suddenly

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.899
go to perfect control,
the next A1c test

00:41:09.899 --> 00:41:11.940
is reflecting what happened
three months earlier.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.110
So there's a lag in
its ability to measure.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.630
It's designed that
way, because it

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.769
is meant to tell
you what's happened

00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:19.810
over the last few months.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.620
So that's why you're
seeing a delay.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.240
It's not so much that control
is improving over time,

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.980
but I think it's more that.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.160
AUDIENCE: And just sort of
a more general follow up.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.660
I've been diabetic for 25 years.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.900
And ever since I
was diagnosed I've

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.820
been following the news media
and basically, the light

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.790
at the end of the tunnel has
been there the whole time.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.160
Does seem to getting
brighter, but what

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.150
is your take on kind
of a realistic timeline

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.849
for-- I realize it's
all speculation.

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:54.515
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
So if I send you back

00:41:54.515 --> 00:41:57.090
to your office this
afternoon in Google and say,

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.470
I want you to tell me
in a week how long it's

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.327
going to take to
finish a project.

00:42:02.327 --> 00:42:04.535
Maybe you've got all the
algorithms straightened out,

00:42:04.535 --> 00:42:06.610
and you can tell me it's
going to take exactly a week.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.734
I think for this, because
it's a biological system,

00:42:08.734 --> 00:42:12.039
it's working humans, it's
not just all of that.

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:14.080
We also have to deal with
the regulatory agencies

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.440
as soon as we want to
do something different.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.030
We've got to justify
what we're doing.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.280
They often tell us to go
back and do more experiments.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.022
So you'll notice I never
mentioned the five year cure.

00:42:22.022 --> 00:42:23.980
I never said, well, we'll
do this in five years

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.140
or we'll do it in 10 years.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.430
What I will say to you
is that in 2014 we're

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.654
doing far more in
this year than I ever

00:42:31.654 --> 00:42:33.070
dreamed we would
be at this point.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:37.780
So my impression is that we're--
all of us as a community--

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.820
are moving faster.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.862
We haven't got there yet.

00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:42.361
I don't know how long it's going
to take to get to the light

00:42:42.361 --> 00:42:43.410
at the end of the tunnel.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.750
But I know that's
where we want to be.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.367
But it's going to
take what it takes,

00:42:48.367 --> 00:42:49.950
provided we're all
working intensively

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.954
in the right direction.

00:42:50.954 --> 00:42:52.120
AUDIENCE: My name is Steven.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.786
I also work on the
contact lens project.

00:42:53.786 --> 00:42:55.410
And so I have a
question a little bit

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.460
related to Zach's question.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.350
The islet function is
said to be modulated

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.675
by the autonomic nervous
system, parasympathetic, and

00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:04.800
sympathetic nervous system.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.700
Alpha and beta insulin
and glucagon production.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:14.800
And so if you place these cells
underneath the skin, what's

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.740
the effect of breaking
the autonomic link so

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:22.060
you have some autonomous
function in response

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.090
to glucose.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.524
You cut off this nervous
system link, so--

00:43:25.524 --> 00:43:27.190
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
You're quite correct.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.270
So the islets that
are transplanted

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:30.340
are completely detonated.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.995
They don't have any
nerves going into them.

00:43:32.995 --> 00:43:34.870
Potentially the nerves
can grow in over time,

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.160
along with the new-- blood
vessels happen first.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.310
Potentially they can
become integrated.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.780
But the nerve end
growth isn't essential.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.460
So perhaps it helps with the
a cued release of insulin

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.430
in the normal individual
who's stressed.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.780
But most of the time these cells
can respond very effectively

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.860
to the local environment.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.880
So you don't need innovation.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.520
And they clearly
can work just fine,

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.769
as I showed you,
without innovation.

00:43:59.769 --> 00:44:01.560
You can divide the
vagus nerves in patients

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.430
that don't get diabetes.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.060
Often we do that for
other conditions.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.280
So it clearly plays
a role somehow,

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.850
but it's probably
a very minor role,

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.630
because it's just
completely redundant.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.730
You don't need it.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.130
AUDIENCE: So there
was a research article

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.090
that I came across recently
about activating islet cell

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:22.340
production in the
gastrointestinal tract.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.980
And I was wondering if
you could talk about that.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.192
I don't recall seeing
it on the slides.

00:44:27.192 --> 00:44:29.600
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO:
So there's a group

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.850
led by Dr. Tim Kieffer
in Vancouver, who's

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.940
worked on trying to
convert the cells

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.140
in the gastrointestinal
tract into becoming

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.320
insulin-making beta cells.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.930
That's really his
area of expertise.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.096
He's made a lot of progress
over the course of time.

00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:46.591
But I don't think I can
beyond that comment directly

00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:49.090
on his work, because I haven't
been directly involved in it.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.410
But it's exciting.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:52.530
AUDIENCE: How does the
life look for the patient

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.590
after the transplant, in terms
of taking the immunosuppression

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.330
drugs, and what's
the cost of it,

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.340
and how often it has
to be administered.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.010
And what are the
side effects of it?

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:03.051
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: Right.

00:45:03.051 --> 00:45:05.030
So the standard
anti-rejection drugs

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.390
are usually taken twice a day.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.770
And most patients tolerate
these extremely well.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.350
And we do a lot of
testing beforehand

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.832
to weed out the odd patient
that won't tolerate it well.

00:45:16.832 --> 00:45:19.040
So we look for patients who
have bad kidney function,

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.248
and we won't give them a
transplant, because we don't

00:45:21.248 --> 00:45:23.860
want to push them
into kidney failure.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.710
But it's usually a twice
daily drug regimen.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.140
Most patients tolerate
it quite well.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.590
Some people get a
tremor in the hands.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.962
Some people got
some leg swelling.

00:45:33.962 --> 00:45:35.170
Some people get mouth ulcers.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.836
There's various
different side effects--

00:45:36.836 --> 00:45:38.600
the whole panoply
of side effects

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.444
can happen-- bit generally most
patients tolerate them well.

00:45:41.444 --> 00:45:43.735
One thing we don't hear though
in the islet transplants

00:45:43.735 --> 00:45:46.040
is to avoid the steroids.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.062
So steroids used to have
a lot of side effects

00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:48.770
after transplant.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.030
They would give you
puffiness in the face,

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.260
actually cause diabetes
in some patients,

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.680
cause overweight, cause various
issues, mood disturbance.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.460
So we're not giving
any steroids at all

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.340
in the islet cell transplants.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.822
So the side effects are probably
minimized because of that.

00:46:05.822 --> 00:46:06.530
They're not zero.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.400
And the side effects that you
don't see but you worry about

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.160
are the risk of cancers
and the risk of infections.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.374
So we tell every
patient coming in

00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:18.540
that they have an increased
risk of certain cancers,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.720
skin cancers, blood cancers,
and certain infections that

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.212
could potentially kill them.

00:46:24.212 --> 00:46:25.920
And the way I look
upon it and discuss it

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.870
with the patient is if they have
bad control of their diabetes

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.750
anyway, then the risks
attendant to the drugs

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.220
are actually a
drop in the ocean,

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.830
very small compared
to the big risks

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.010
they face every day
from their diabetes.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.232
If they have perfect
control of their diabetes,

00:46:40.232 --> 00:46:41.440
then it's a different matter.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.722
Is they are well-controlled
with insulin,

00:46:43.722 --> 00:46:45.680
then on the other hand,
I would say, "Well, you

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.388
don't want to face
the risk of infection.

00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:49.900
You don't want to face the
increased risk of cancer

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.460
if your diabetes is being
managed perfectly the way

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.160
it is already."

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.910
And that's really
the rationale for us

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.830
picking the worst of the worst
patients in terms of the blood

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.260
sugar control.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.870
Insulin is of course very cheap.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.880
The immunosuppressive
drugs can be expensive.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.380
The costs are changing
over the course of time

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.900
now because all of the
patents on these earlier drugs

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.000
have ended.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.120
So there are generics coming in,
and the costs are coming down.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.860
They're still not zero.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.720
And it depends on the patient's
drug plan and their ability

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.080
to get reimbursed for it.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.330
So in Canada, most the time
it has not been a problem.

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:27.220
Occasional patients have not had
full coverage for their drugs.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.330
But generally it can be managed.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.240
FEAUDIENCE: Could you comment
on the transition from islets

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.084
to stem cells?

00:47:35.084 --> 00:47:36.500
How do you make
them differentiate

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.750
into the right thing?

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.990
And does it happen inside
or outside of the body?

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.500
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: Stem cells
are, of course, exciting

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.080
in many ways, because it
means that instead of relying

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.010
on going through that complex
process of making the cells,

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:48.680
you have a limitless
supply that could

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.510
treat the whole population
in the world with Type 1

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:52.810
and Type 2 diabetes.

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.555
That would be really,
really exciting.

00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:57.240
But as you move
forward, you've got

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.690
a whole new gamut
of testing to do.

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:01.566
You have to be sure
they're going to be safe.

00:48:01.566 --> 00:48:03.565
You've got to be sure
that when you put them in,

00:48:03.565 --> 00:48:05.845
they're not going to cause
uncontrolled drop in blood

00:48:05.845 --> 00:48:06.160
sugar.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.743
We don't think that's
going to happen.

00:48:07.743 --> 00:48:08.340
But it could.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.881
We've got to be sure
that they're not

00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:11.870
going to turn into
cancers, or precancers,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.910
or some other worrisome
transformation

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.970
once we transplant the cells.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.120
We know that islet cells,
when we transplant them,

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.570
stay very stable.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.260
But these other
cells-- these stem

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:25.220
cells-- they can turn
into any cell potentially.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.129
So there's a lot of
caution as we move forward,

00:48:28.129 --> 00:48:29.420
as well as a lot of excitement.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.099
So it has to be done very
carefully, step by step.

00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:35.140
Can we make the cells
differentiate and make them

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.150
into perfect islets
and stable islets

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.180
before we transform them?

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.880
That's what we'd like to do.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.250
But the stem cell scientists
that make these cells

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.640
have not yet been able
to completely overcome

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.630
that hurdle.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:50.900
So they're giving us the cells
that they make-- manufacture--

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.180
are still these pre-islet cells.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.280
And they turn into islets
once they're transplanted.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.622
So they're working
very hard trying

00:48:58.622 --> 00:49:00.080
to understand the
messaging systems

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.280
in the body as an
embryo grows, what

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.140
controls the differentiation,
what controls

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.430
the stabilization from
one step to the next.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.460
And I think until they've done
that fully, we'll probably

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:16.260
still be transplanting these
precursor cells for a while,

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.070
until we have the--
yeah, ideally we'd

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.404
like to have perfect human
islets, look like human islets,

00:49:21.404 --> 00:49:23.820
they taste like human islets,
they work like human islets,

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.600
and they stay that way forever.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.434
But I don't think
we're there yet.

00:49:27.434 --> 00:49:28.850
And perhaps we're
never get there.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:29.960
But hopefully we will.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.095
FEAUDIENCE: I
understand that you

00:49:31.095 --> 00:49:32.490
know, when you were
first doing trials,

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.020
you were using the worst case
scenario patients-- terribly

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.800
brittle diabetics-- in
whom you were hoping

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.140
to provide some relief
without causing long term

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.020
complications from all of the
immunosuppressants and robbing

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.370
Peter to pay Paul.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:49.577
So I'm wondering now
in the current trials,

00:49:49.577 --> 00:49:51.410
if we're starting to
broaden those inclusion

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:52.440
criteria a little bit?

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.070
Or where are we now with that?

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.570
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: We haven't
really broadened the criteria.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.305
So very fair question.

00:49:58.305 --> 00:49:59.180
We haven't done that.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.402
We're still concentrated
on the brittle patients.

00:50:02.402 --> 00:50:04.610
Occasionally, we'll see a
patient come to us and say,

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:06.810
"I'm just tired of
having diabetes.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.721
I'm tired of testing.

00:50:08.721 --> 00:50:09.970
I've worked pretty hard at it.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.050
I'm tired of it.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.020
But my control right
now is pretty good."

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.030
That's a hard one for
us, because we say, "OK.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.820
We understand where you're at.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.550
But we don't want to
do any harm to you."

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:21.740
It's so much easier to take
somebody who you've worked on,

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.830
you've tried.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.360
If despite your best
efforts as a diabetes

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.457
and an endocrinologist
to control them.

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.290
If you fail, then there's
nothing else left.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.180
And then it's easy for us.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.680
So have we reached
the point where

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.960
we could transition and
open it up to more patients?

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.302
I think we probably have.

00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:38.760
I mean, I think at
the beginning we

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.650
didn't know what
the real risks were.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.580
We didn't know what the
risk of plotting off

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:44.330
the vein and the liver,
the portal vein thrombosis

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:44.730
would be.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:46.229
We didn't know the
risk of bleeding.

00:50:46.229 --> 00:50:47.040
The procedure risk.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.270
We knew there's be a risk of
cancers and life-threatening

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.989
infections, but we didn't really
have a quantification of it.

00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:54.530
I think now, and
I've shown you data,

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:56.460
I think we do have
quantification of it.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:00.880
So we could have a very fair
discussion with the patient.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.040
Say look, these
are the real risks.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.350
These are the potential
benefits to you.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.870
If you like it.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:07.740
Sure.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.210
And I think to
get to that point,

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.830
we probably need to do a
randomized controlled trial.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:16.092
Best instant therapy against
the islet transplant.

00:51:16.092 --> 00:51:18.050
And you come in with a
ticket at the beginning,

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.665
you either win an
islet transplant,

00:51:19.665 --> 00:51:22.170
or you win the pump.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:25.780
And the problem with that--
we want to do that trial.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.470
We'd all love to do that trial.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.430
The problem is, who's
going to fund it?

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.700
Who's going to pay for it?

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:34.007
And we don't have anybody
that's come forward to say,

00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:35.340
we really want to do that trial.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.960
We'll fund it for you.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.570
Maybe Google would.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.330
FEAUDIENCE: What would the
cost of a trial like that be?

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.920
And not that any of our
budgets can cover that, but

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.110
and also if we were wanting to
donate to diabetes research,

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.960
are there any
organizations that you

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.840
think are particularly--
maybe excluding yours--

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.180
to be unbiased, although
you can mention it,

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.534
that you think would
be particularly useful?

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:01.450
DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: OK.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.780
Maybe I'll answer
the second one first.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.230
So there are several
organizations--

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.460
international organizations
that raise money for diabetes.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.090
Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation, The American

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:18.710
Diabetes Foundation, Canadian
Diabetes Foundations,

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.630
and many others.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.790
So I don't think I can
concentrate on one.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.810
It wouldn't be fair
for me to do that.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:28.910
What I will tell you is that
in order to get to this point,

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.810
we've all done a
lot of research.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:32.840
And in order to get
to the next point,

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.930
we've got an enormous
amount of research to go.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.525
And I'm not sure that any of
these organizations, including

00:52:37.525 --> 00:52:42.570
the NIH, including the Kidney
Institute of Health research,

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:46.550
including several other global
funding research organizations.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.340
We're challenged.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.190
We don't have sufficient
funds to accelerate this.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.180
And so we need funds.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.400
So if we wanted to
do a trial, and let's

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.480
say we powered it
reasonably with five or 10

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.800
years of followup, and we
looked at complications.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.960
And we wanted ideally, probably
50, 60 patients in each arm.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.710
And the control
group patients would

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:10.630
be receiving standard
diabetes care anyway,

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.490
but they would
need extra testing.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:15.165
And in the islet transplant
group you can-- in Canada,

00:53:15.165 --> 00:53:18.230
it cost us $75,000
per transplant.

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.580
Two transplants, $150,000
in the first year.

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.840
Probably some additional
research costs for patients.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.570
So $200,000.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:26.260
I don't Know.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.885
If you want me to
guess, it's the order

00:53:27.885 --> 00:53:33.185
of the maybe $10 million. $10
million to $20 million perhaps.

00:53:33.185 --> 00:53:34.500
I'd have to work it out more.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.140
But it's not billions.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.951
It's doable.

00:53:38.951 --> 00:53:39.450
FRANK: OK.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.220
And with that, thank
you all for coming.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.720
And thank you very
much, Dr. Shapiro

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.428
for taking the time
to speak to us today.

00:53:44.428 --> 00:53:47.740
[APPLAUSE]
