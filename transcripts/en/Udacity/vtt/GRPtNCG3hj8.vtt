00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.282
So, how do we know if there are no long words? Well, if there are no long words

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:09.080
then long word will be an empty string. So, if long word dot equals the empty

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.565
string. And remember, we use dot equals because strings are objects then we

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:18.860
want to print out the message there are no long words. Otherwise, there is a

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.690
long word and we print that out. Now, if I run this looking for words with

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.806
length greater than 30, well, that's interesting. It looks like there is a word

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:32.310
with more than 30 characters. It's just joined up with a whole bunch of dashes.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.488
I bet there aren't any words longer than 60 characters though. That would just

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:39.469
be crazy, right? Alright, looks like this time we got, there are no long words.
