00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
&gt;&gt;male presenter: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.210
And welcome to this Google Author's Talk.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.900
And today, we have Ann Lee, who is a Senior
Fellow at Demos and Adjunct Professor of Economics

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.980
and Finance at New York University, a former
hedge fund partner and a frequent commentator

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.590
at networks like CNBC, FOX, and CNN.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.939
When she worked in China, she was a former
Visiting Professor at Peking University and

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.770
an economic advisor to Chinese economic officials.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.020
And today, she is here to talk about her book,
"What the US Can Learn From China: An Open-Minded

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.150
Guide to Treating Our Greatest Competitor
as Our Greatest Teacher."

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.530
Welcome.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.910
[applause]

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.039
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I really wanna thank Google for
hosting me today.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.829
It's such an honor.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.140
I flew in from New York and it's much warmer
here.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.080
And thank you all for taking time out of your
busy schedule to come hear my talk, especially

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.450
to such a serious topic like this because
I know that sex, money, and violence sell

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.280
and this book is missing all three.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.520
[laughter]

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.990
Actually, the other day I was thinking to
myself, "If my publisher wanted to sell more

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
books, perhaps he should have put on a different
cover that was more misleading."

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.690
Perhaps something of Kim Kardashian walking
down the wedding isle with Yao Ming.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.880
That might have been a little bit more "National
Inquirer."

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.220
But anyway, I'll get into the book now.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
Oftentimes, people do ask me, "Why did I write
this book?"

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.750
And it's a particularly interesting question,
especially for those who know me because I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.210
had spent at least a decade on Wall Street
as a bonds trader and credit derivatives trader.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.810
And so, I didn't do much writing then.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.679
In fact, a friend of mine said to me that
I was the only woman he ever met who replied

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.430
to his emails in one-word sentences.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.920
It was either "yes," "no," or "maybe."

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.269
So obviously, I was very motivated to write
an 80-thousand-word manuscript.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:31.430
And the truth of the matter is was I was very
concerned about the direction that the US

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.060
was headed.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.159
And this concern actually started as early
as 2005, when I was working at a very large

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.409
hedge fund.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:49.310
At the time, I was trading credit derivatives
and saw many structured product deals come

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.459
across my desk.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.640
And these products are what most people are
now known to be toxic assets--the ones that

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.579
caused the 2008 financial crisis.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.230
And I had seen a lot of irregularities in
these deals.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.620
And what confirmed my suspicions were that
I had attended some of these broker/dealer

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.140
dinners where I overheard some of these investment
bankers actually brag and joke about the fact

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.700
that they were able to secure billion-dollar
deals--secured with nothing but baseball cards.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.659
This was deeply concerning to me and I even
tried to raise the flag with the SEC, suggesting

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.909
that they investigate this market.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:39.609
But when it became apparent that nothing was
gonna get done, that was when I decided to

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.310
leave Wall Street.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.230
I had seen previous bubbles, such as the Asian
crisis, internet bubble, and I really believed

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:55.069
that this was gonna be far worse in that someone
had to warn the public and alert them of what

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.939
was happening.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.720
I went into academia at that point.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.379
And I proceeded to write a paper detailing
how some of this fraud was perpetrated.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.319
And I tried to send it to various government
officials and the media.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.870
In fact, one of my friends, who had worked
at FOX Business, received a copy.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.690
And so, when I got a call from a FOX producer,
I thought that I was being invited to talk

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.630
about my paper.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.840
Unfortunately, she asked me, "Ann, can you
please come on to debate whether Paris Hilton

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.220
is a great American hero because she's a big
consumer?"

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.340
Unfortunately, I didn't accept that invitation.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.450
But that was indicative of some of the mentality
that was going on leading up to the crisis.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:59.450
And so, when it finally happened, it was neither
surprising nor shocking to me.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.230
What really actually surprised me was to the
extent Wall Street and government having come

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.200
together.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.110
And so, when President Obama had Tim Geithner
and Larry Summers, the very people that had

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.320
Wall Street in their back pocket, join his
economic team, it wasn't Obama where I was

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.970
deriving my hope for most of the nation.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.640
Interestingly, it was really China.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:37.370
For some of you who may remember, China was
a mere backward agricultural society only

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.000
30 years ago.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.230
In fact, they were written off as a lost cause.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:49.630
So, even though China was this great world
empire for thousands of years, they had fallen

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:58.690
to practically a semi-colonial state 200 years
ago, when Western nations invaded the nation.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.940
And it was very shameful and embarrassing
to many Chinese at the time, to folks like

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.460
Deng Xiaoping and Xuan Li, who were the communist
party revolutionaries.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.420
When they were intellectuals going to Paris,
they experienced firsthand the prejudice and

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.610
the treatment that was very unfriendly from
foreigners.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.960
And they attributed a lot of this to the fact
that they thought it was because China was

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.300
such a weak nation.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.990
And so, they vowed to make China strong.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.300
And so, this small group of friends turned
this kernel of an idea into this big movement

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.750
that allowed them to eventually take over
the country in just 20 years.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.860
Unfortunately, when they took over the nation,
they did not succeed in making China strong.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.690
They, in fact, did the complete opposite.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.310
Because they were so married to ideology,
they had many of the wrong people in place.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.120
They obviously had some of the wrong policies
in place.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.520
And so, this plummeted the nation into a state
where millions of people died from starvation.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.740
In fact, more people died from that than in
World War II.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:27.200
But fortunately, some of these folks, such
as Deng Xiaoping, did not give up the dream

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.010
of making China strong.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.830
They continued and persisted in trying out
what would work for China.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.710
And through trial and error over many different
policies, they finally came together and found

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:47.620
a set of ideas that would help put China back
on the right track.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.620
These set of ideas are basically what I discuss
in my book.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:01.720
I wrote this book believing that these ideas
would actually be workable in a democratic

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.000
capitalist society--modified.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.130
But there were certain elements that are true
for all societies.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:19.120
And while I realize that these two countries
are very different, there are also many similarities.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.900
And I don't advocate everything China.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.860
What I'm talking about are some of the best
practices of China that we can learn from

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.610
because all nations have their weaknesses
and strengths.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.529
And if we only dwell on the weaknesses, we
are missing an opportunity to learn about

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:45.389
what they do right because learning can be
a two-way street.

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.439
They've learned plenty from us.

00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:49.769
And we can learn from them.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:56.310
Because while the US is a very strong nation,
we're still not perfect.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.690
We make many mistakes.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:07.060
And so, if we can find a way to set aside
our prejudices and the best from the West

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:14.950
and integrate them with the best of the East,
perhaps we can advance civilization and create

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.970
a better world for all.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:25.660
So, I do cover a lot of ideas in my book and
I'm not gonna have enough time to go over

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.420
all of them.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.180
But I would like to highlight at least a couple
major themes that I think are particularly

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.079
relevant in the Presidential Election year.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:44.829
One of the ideas I discuss is the idea of
leadership selection.

00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:52.779
Today, I think the United States is suffering
from a crisis of leadership.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:58.009
Our politicians are polling at historic lows.

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:59.940
Poll after poll show that.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:08.100
"60 Minutes" recently reported that Congress
had an approval rating of nine percent.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:14.730
And movements, such as Occupy Wall Street,
have been spreading like wildfire.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:21.790
These are very disturbing trends because as
soon as a nation, where the people do not

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:28.519
think their government is legitimate, government
could start taking more drastic actions in

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:35.149
order to maintain the status quo and keep
the people in government in power.

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:38.720
And we're starting to see signs of this.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:46.129
President Obama had signed a bill into law
on New Year's Eve so that any American now

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:54.550
can be detained indefinitely by the military
without trial, without evidence.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.980
And this is actually a serious incursion into
our civil rights.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:08.230
It makes it more important than ever now that
we get the right leaders in place.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:16.180
And while we've had all sorts attempts at
campaign reform as a way to improve the system,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:25.230
2008 still remains a record year where private
money went into the election cycle so that

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:34.001
today, democracy here is no longer really
"one person, one vote," but "one dollar, one

00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:35.001
vote."

00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:43.070
So, what can we learn from China in this regard,
especially since most people regard the Chinese

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.009
government as a dictatorship?

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:54.769
Well, if you ask many folks outside of the
US, in fact, you'll get a different opinion.

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:59.629
Some people regard China as having the best
technocrats in the world.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:04.720
And if you ask many of the Chinese citizens,
they have very high approval ratings of their

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720
government.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:12.670
Pew Research, out of DC here, has conducted
research polls, opinion polls in China for

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.329
several years now consistently showing that
the opinion polls of the government have been

00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:22.110
hitting over 80 percent.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:31.899
And this approval rating seems to be in sharp
contrast to the protests over land grants

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.949
in the country.

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:41.910
But those protestors tend to be very critical
of their local government officials, not of

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.220
the people who are running the show in China.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.329
So, how did they get this level of legitimacy
among their people?

00:12:52.329 --> 00:12:53.959
What can we learn?

00:12:53.959 --> 00:13:04.699
Well, the Chinese have a belief that the honor
of running a nation should only belong to

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:08.089
the people who have earned the right to do
it.

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:15.430
This idea of earned authority is very similar
to the idea of a corporation where we don't

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.430
elect a CEO to the top based on some popularity
contest.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.430
No.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.959
The person who gets to run the organization
has earned the right through an entire career,

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:37.200
proving that they have the skills and the
knowledge to produce beneficial change.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.410
And so, if you want to go work in this Chinese
central government, you first have to take

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.870
a competency test by the time you're 35.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.629
If you don't pass this test, then you must
stay in the private sector.

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:55.160
And this is a very difficult test.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.730
I personally have not seen it, but it has
a pass rating of less than 20 percent.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:06.420
So, right off the bat, they attract a lot
of the brightest minds in China to go work

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.189
for the government.

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:18.509
And by having that cut-off, they restrict
the conflict of interest that can happen between

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:23.579
the private and public sector--something that
we've seen in our own government.

00:14:23.579 --> 00:14:31.720
Now, once you become a government official
there, you then are rotated to different positions

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.879
in the government for five-year terms.

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:40.009
And you can't serve a position for more than
two terms.

00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:47.610
And while you're in this position, you get
evaluated 360 degrees ala McKinsey-style.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.850
And then if you do well, you get promoted.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.420
And if you don't, you get demoted.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.300
And your compensation reflects that.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:00.620
And they try to do this so that they're aligning
the government's roles with the interests

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:07.990
of society this way, so that it is about helping
produce productive change not based on money

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.310
and compensation alone.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:17.269
So for example, if you're government official,
you could be put in a position to be a university

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:20.250
president of a major university.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.980
Then you must demonstrate during that time
how you've improved that institution.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.190
Perhaps you've increased the number of foreign
exchange programs to other universities around

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.600
the world.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.199
Maybe the number of graduates from the university
went up in terms of their ability to get high-paying

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:41.199
jobs.

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:45.369
So, they get measured on a number of factors.

00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:49.600
And this happens throughout their entire career.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:57.680
So, by the time they get considered to be
a high-level official for the Politburo or

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:06.230
the Standing Committee, they would have already
served decades in their nation in various

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:14.069
roles, showing that they have produced productive
change and have benefitted millions of Chinese.

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:19.889
So, many of these Chinese citizens then view
that these people at the top have a collective

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:27.040
wisdom that they know what to do in terms
of leading a nation--that they have selected

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.170
the best people for the job.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:37.239
Now, how can we take that an incorporate it
into the US because I'm obviously not advocating

00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:41.529
that someone must go through the ranks of
government here to become President of the

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:43.600
United States?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.930
But what I'm saying is there's certain elements
that make sense.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.249
I suggest in my book, why not introduce a
competency test for policy-makers here?

00:16:54.249 --> 00:17:00.279
Today, the only are where we provide these
tests are to our foreign service, who become

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:02.790
our ambassadors to other nations.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:08.410
But virtually every other agency doesn't require
this.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:17.029
And our system today, where the saying "to
victor go the spoils" is more true than ever.

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:23.429
When President Obama or anybody else becomes
the Head of State, will have the Plum Book

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:29.309
where they can appoint different high-level
positions throughout government.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:35.000
These tend to go to people who are probably
their high campaign donors or other people

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.760
who they owe political favors.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.019
And this may not necessarily be in the public
interest.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:50.600
For instance, President Bush had appointed
Michael Brown to be head of FEMA during Hurricane

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.980
Katrina.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:58.110
This guy had no emergency management experience
whatsoever.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.780
And yet, he was charged to run this thing.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.340
And we saw the results of what happened.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:12.980
So, I am not suggesting we replace our systems,
but perhaps we improve it.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:20.010
And another idea is a thought, "Well maybe
we should restrict the revolving door."

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:26.539
Today, it's a well-known business model where
someone can go get elected into Congress,

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:34.019
or work in a regulatory agency, and then leave
and go the private sector, set up a shingle

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:40.080
on K Street and become a lobbyist and earn
millions of dollars that way.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:49.320
This sort of conflict of interest, again,
can be very harmful to the public interest.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.090
Another idea I bring up is perhaps we should
demand track records of people who want to

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.510
seek higher office.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:04.730
This could be a great way to vet who is qualified
so that they have to have shown they've led

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:11.890
an organization and have provided beneficial
change, that they have shown that they have

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.100
the moral compass to help society.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:26.750
Another major theme I wanna talk about is
the idea of having long-term visions because

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:36.460
today, I really worry that our nation is suffering
from a disease that I call "short-termism."

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:43.140
We have politicians who can really only think
in terms of two-year election cycles.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:52.549
We have a lot of corporations who have to
meet short-term profits demanded by Wall Street.

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:59.429
I don't think there are enough people who
are actually taking a step back and asking,

00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:06.000
"Where do we wanna be in 10, 20 years' time
and how are we gonna get there?"

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.960
So again, I turn to the Chinese system and
say, "Where can we learn here?"

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.570
The Chinese have institutionalized something
called "the five-year plans" as a way to avoid

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.970
the temptation to have short-term Band-Aids.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:31.519
I know a lot of folks have dismissed this
idea because they associate five-year plans

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:38.120
with central planning of top-down and of the
disasters under Mao.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:44.380
But what I'm suggesting today is that the
way they practice five-year plans now is very

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.740
different from what happened then.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:55.220
Today, it is more of a goal-setting exercise
where the government articulates their priorities

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.970
of where they'd like to see the economy in
the future.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:06.159
And therefore, they set performance targets
associated with different areas of the economy.

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:15.940
For instance, in their latest five-year plan--2011
to 2015--they articulate that they would like

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.210
to see a greener economy.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.570
So, how are they gonna get there?

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:27.830
They put specific performance targets such
as, they wanna reduce carbon emissions by

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:33.850
17 percent per GDP unit by the time they hit
2015.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:42.059
They want to increase energy efficiency in
buildings by 16 percent per unit of GDP.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:49.090
And the people who are charged with making
these changes will have the autonomy to come

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:55.350
up with a variety of solutions that will help
them get there that incorporate the power

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.260
of the private sector.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:06.399
So, they will use a combination of carrots
and sticks such as tax hikes on high polluting

00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:16.730
industries, tax incentives for clean tech,
and various other investments that will be

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:23.470
very inviting for foreign companies in the
US, in Europe, to come in and work jointly

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.850
with the Chinese in order to come up with
these solutions that will help them meet this

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.480
target.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:38.500
Now, the closest thing the US has to this
kind of top-down priority setting is the US

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.670
Federal Budget.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:50.340
The OMB basically prepares this for the President
that should reflect his spending priorities.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:56.740
And basically, they make the allocations to
different agencies.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.170
The difference is that there are almost no
performance targets associated with how we

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.760
allocate our taxpayer money.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:14.000
It is the equivalent of a CEO having a strategic
plan where he would hand over money to a department

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.380
and not demanding that they produce any results
as a result of having received that money.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:28.260
Now, if we have this situation, it is no wonder
that our taxpayer money goes into all these

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.880
agencies and it's like a black hole where
we don't see any results.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.740
After trillions of dollars of spending, we
still have significant unemployment in this

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.880
country.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.490
We are also the largest spender in health
care.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:51.809
And yet, we have some of the worst outcomes
in health care out of all developed nations.

00:23:51.809 --> 00:24:00.610
So perhaps, if we borrow this idea of setting
performance targets that the Chinese use,

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:08.480
it might drive more transparency and more
accountability in our government to help align

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.730
what they're doing with the rest of society.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:21.799
I guess I'm running a little low on time,
so maybe I'll just wrap up here for now and

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:25.600
then open it up to questions.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.100
And I understand there will be book-signing
afterwards.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.880
So, there's a microphone there, right?

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.970
Are there any questions?

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:43.650
&gt;&gt;male #1: So I actually don't doubt your
assertion that Chinese run by technocrats,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.780
at least at the top.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.920
I think Hu Jintao is widely respected as a
very technical person.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.259
My question is what's really their motivation?

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:59.280
Because it appears that in the developed world,
as well as in the developing world, most politicians

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.710
are motivated by money and power, right?

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.390
So that's why the corruption in the system.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.850
So, what motivates the top leaders in China
and why do think there's no corruption there

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.350
at the top?

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:19.380
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I think that it's a way of weeding
and trying to find the more enlightened people

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.690
to come to government.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.240
The corruption that we often hear about in
China is happening at the local government

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:32.690
level where they are running the smaller towns
and villages, like a Foster City or a Redwood

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.690
City.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:39.630
And these people do not take competency tests
and do not get rotated around.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:45.240
These people stay in these towns for 40 years,
right?

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.480
And that's where all the corruption is, where
they have absolute power and there's no way

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.330
to kick them out.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:57.060
And that's why the Chinese government, right
now, is trying to experiment with this idea

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:06.850
of democracy at the local level in order to
drive more accountability at those levels.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:14.299
I would think that the way they attract and
motivate these people, like I said, is the

00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:17.029
incentives system.

00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:20.840
And it probably comes partly cultural.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:28.679
Confucianism, which has been part the Chinese
culture as well as many Asian cultures there,

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:34.740
value scholarship not because it's supposed
to help make you wealthy.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:42.590
The idea is that education and educating oneself
is for the common good--for the common good

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.590
of society.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.290
If you are more educated and you understand
the complexities and you understand how to

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.350
be a good citizen, you make the society better.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:58.200
And that is a philosophy that I think many
of these people hold.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.570
And so, I actually address culture in another
chapter in my book.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.570
Yes.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.409
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi.

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:12.090
So, you mentioned earlier an interesting statistic
about the approval rating of--I think it was

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.570
around 80 percent or so.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.660
And my personal experience growing up, I grew
up in a very repressive country with a repressive

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:25.040
regime where the approval rating was officially
quoted as exceeding 90 percent and the president

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.320
was routinely elected with 99 percent of the
vote, even though those were basically manufactured

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320
numbers.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320
They were false.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.140
So, I probably am more cynical than some when
it comes to hearing these numbers, but I'm

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.570
wondering if you can talk a little bit more
about that.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.409
Eighty percent seems like an astonishingly
high approval rating.

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:44.259
And if true, it's remarkable and good.

00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:45.830
But I just wanted to hear your additional
thoughts on that.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.830
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: Yes.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:52.669
I would be skeptical, too, if they were coming
from Chinese polling services.

00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:58.100
But this is actually coming from an American
polling service who do similar polls with

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:05.590
Americans and find that consistently, around
20 percent of Americans are approving our

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.590
government.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:12.809
And so, they publish these results online.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:18.820
And so, because it's coming from an objective
source, I'm more inclined to believe that

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.460
and that they can't be manufactured that way.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:28.429
&gt;&gt;male #3: So you make the case that the top
leadership is more meritocratic because--

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:29.429
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I'm sorry, what?

00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:30.549
&gt;&gt; male #3: Is more meritocratic, meritocratic
because--

00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:31.549
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: Meritocratic.

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:32.549
&gt;&gt; male #3: Because--

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:33.830
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: The US or the--?

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.830
I'm sorry.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.830
Can you--?

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:36.830
&gt;&gt; male #3: The top.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.830
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: The top.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.509
&gt;&gt; male #3: You make the case that the top
leadership in China is more meritocratic because

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:43.340
they aren't driven by electoral politics,
[inaudible]-ism, and so on.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:51.000
So do you see that people in remote areas
of China, if they have the merit, like Tibet

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.490
or other regions, can make it to the top leadership
of China in Communist Party?

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.980
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: So the question is do the other
people believe they can make it to the top

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980
if they--?

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.980
&gt;&gt; male #3: Yeah.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.980
Do people believe in--?

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.980
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.720
And Hu Jintao and Wen Xiaobao are exactly
two examples.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.700
Both of them did not come from privilege at
all.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:18.240
They didn't have Revolutionary background
from their parents or anybody else.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.549
They came from the poor, rural areas of China.

00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:29.830
And because they were able to prove themselves
over time, pass the testing, get involved

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:33.460
and prove themselves through merit, they got
to the top.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:39.160
And therefore, in some ways it's almost more
democratic because it doesn't rely on you

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.650
being able to be a billionaire to run for
office, or that you sell your soul to a corporation.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:51.240
It's about you making it to the top on your
merits of your own performance.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.220
&gt;&gt; male #4: Hi.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:59.970
I wonder if you could explain for me what
fuels your optimism for the US.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:04.750
It seems to me we have one party that is now
giving us indefinite imprisonment without

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.750
trial.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.700
We have another that's openly discussing the
plausibility of abolishing the Department

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.100
of Education.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:16.210
And most interestingly, the public of the
US show willingness to vote for these nut

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.620
jobs.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:26.951
So, in a democratic system where people are
democratically racing for the bottom, how

00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.610
is it that you're still standing up here and
talking about policy and not simply moving

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.970
to a more sensible country?

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:42.919
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I believe my sense of optimism
comes from the fact that small groups of people

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:45.360
can affect powerful change.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.529
And that's why I started out with the story
about Deng Xiaoping and his other colleagues.

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:57.649
And even if we look at our own history in
the United States, we've made tremendous changes

00:30:57.649 --> 00:31:01.879
and reforms, which started with small numbers
of people.

00:31:01.879 --> 00:31:03.150
And it took a long time.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.010
It took many years to abolish slavery.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:12.360
It took decades also to give right to vote
to women.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.320
So, you have to fight hard for them.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.049
And obviously, the folks who benefit from
the system today are going to fight hard to

00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:25.330
maintain the status quo.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:31.879
But if more and more people understand and
spread the word, like what happened with Occupy

00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:37.720
Wall Street, I think that it's possible.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.860
And so, that is why I remain hopeful.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.650
&gt;&gt; male #5: Hi.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:50.390
So, if the approval rating is so high, why
is there so much censorship by the government?

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:56.210
They seem to be hiding things from the general
public and then Washington.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.610
So, if they are very popular, there is no
need to do something like that.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.570
So why do you think that's happening?

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.980
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I know that often comes up.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:17.340
And I would say that the government's reason
to me, when I was over there as a professor,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.260
was that they were worried not so much their
own legitimacy, because they're obviously

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:27.230
very popular, but that they worried about
people who are trying to be subversive to

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.370
the government.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:35.929
And this is probably no different than a fear
that our government has of Al Qaida trying

00:32:35.929 --> 00:32:42.009
to subvert and recruit people into that movement.

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:43.320
And so, what have we done?

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.870
We've actually gone around killing people
like Osama bin Laden.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:55.279
So, I think that this perception of a national
security threat is something they view as

00:32:55.279 --> 00:33:04.139
real, just like we view that putting in X-ray
machines at all our airports is a real security

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:08.389
threat, even though many people think it doesn't
work.

00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:17.899
So, I think it's easy for us to be judgmental
and critical about what other nations will

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:26.990
use in terms of their policies, but if we
only hear one side of the story, it's probably

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:32.830
not in our position to be saying they're doing
something right or wrong.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:39.990
But if, in terms of openness and about this
idea of censorship, I would say that yes,

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:44.210
it would be nice to see China be more open.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:51.749
And the direction has actually been more open
because back 30 years ago under Mao, everything

00:33:51.749 --> 00:33:53.250
was state controlled.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:57.909
There was no private press, no information
from the outside.

00:33:57.909 --> 00:34:00.110
And today, it's quite different.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:09.070
If you go to China, there are tens of thousands
of magazines, thousands of newspapers, hundreds

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:14.970
of thousands of books from outside of China
that get imported into China so that they

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:23.210
can develop a very robust discourse and introduce
lots of great ideas from the outside.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:29.900
And when I was there in China, I had witnessed
on Chinese TV very serious debates between

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.230
officials about different policies.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:39.440
Even a friend of mine, he was also at Peking
University, named Michael Pettis, he keeps

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.780
a blog on the website and he used to work
at Bear Stearns as an investment banker.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:52.829
And he even writes on his blog that the debates
about the currency and about many other issues

00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:57.349
are more fierce in China than even here in
the US.

00:34:57.349 --> 00:35:05.080
So, I think the censorship is probably overstated
in terms of what they do censor.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.990
And I would say that some of that censorship
does happen here as well.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:23.730
&gt;&gt;male #6: So, in the modern era, most officials
in high office in China come from an engineering

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:29.190
background, whereas in the US, most of them
come from a law background.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:34.760
How do you think this difference effects the
policies of the two countries and how can

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.290
we have more engineers in US politics?

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:39.420
[laughter]

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:46.050
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: I'm glad you asked that question
because I published an article recently in

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:53.559
The American Prospect addressing that idea
because not only do we want to have a more

00:35:53.559 --> 00:36:00.640
balanced legislature, it's also more immediate
in our job situation.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.490
Today, we have three million jobs that go
unfilled in the United States for six months

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.050
or longer.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.990
Most of them are in technical fields.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:15.319
And the hiring managers and the CEOs of a
lot of these companies basically say they

00:36:15.319 --> 00:36:19.560
can't find the talent to fill them.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.770
And when you look at what kind of degrees
that college graduates are having, in 2010,

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:32.640
over 80 thousand of them came from Performing
Arts and less than 13 thousand in Electrical

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640
Engineering.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:41.060
And so, we vastly need to rebalance our talent
portfolio in this country.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.930
And one of the ideas I suggested was given
that student loans can be so onerous to so

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:55.640
many kids, why not provide the incentive of
forgiving a student if they graduate with

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:02.210
an Engineering degree, or some other technical
degree in order to provide an economic incentive

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:06.339
for more students to study this area?

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:09.930
That could be one way of addressing it.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:20.059
And yes, the characters of debate and policies
do reflect the backgrounds of our leaders.

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:28.579
I talk about that in one of my chapters called
"Special Economic Zones," because while our

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:36.809
leaders can debate ad nauseum about whether
this policy is better than another policy,

00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:41.870
they do so without a lot of concrete evidence
and results.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:47.180
The Chinese however, basically say, "Why don't
we just test it out?"

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:54.750
They have a very scientific approach to economic
policy, so that it's very similar to a scientist

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.800
that says, "Well, we have this hypothesis.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.240
We think it will do this, but let's test it
out."

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.120
And that's what the Chinese do.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:09.110
A lot of the results are reported by independent
observers.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:15.000
And then they decide whether to rule out a
policy at a national level.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.030
And so, if we had more of that kind of systematic
thinking about testing our policies, we might

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.570
have a completely different economy at this
point.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:35.310
&gt;&gt;male #7: So, your idea that we set up objectives,
measure whether the objectives are achieved;

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.220
it's a very alluring idea.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.710
I like it, except it's got a few major problems.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.940
One is you have to set objectives that are
achievable.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.710
You have to get consensus for the objectives.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.109
And probably the hardest, you have to actually
have measures that say, "Yes, we achieved

00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:51.109
them."

00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:53.000
Actually, "It was our policies that achieved
them rather than something that was gonna

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
happen anyway."

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.809
So, I wonder whether the Chinese, when they're
measuring each other, how accurate they're

00:38:59.809 --> 00:39:01.210
being.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:06.030
If you take something that was at Mao's level
of industrialization, not very much, let in

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.470
lots of Western technology, you're gonna have
this rapid rate of industrialization.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.630
We've seen other countries with or without
very good government.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:19.849
So, do they know how much of the improvement
came from good government versus just letting

00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:21.670
capitalists do things?

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:28.980
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: Well obviously, things that happen
in an economy are very complex.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.430
And even today, many economists get those
things wrong, right?

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:38.100
There are economic models that miss many variables.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:44.190
I'm not saying that that system is perfect
or that you can completely tease out whether

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:48.290
it's just policies or some other exogenous
factor.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:56.030
But if you look at what happened with China
before, they started on these policies, they

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.640
clearly had plenty of cheap labor that obviously
were not productive.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.150
And if you think that's the only answer, you
can still look at Africa or many other places

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:10.869
where they are not growing and being as dynamic
as they are.

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:16.190
So clearly, there are things they're doing
right that are making sense here.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:26.190
And so, I suggest that if we aren't sure,
then why don't we test it out in different

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.190
areas?

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:33.309
Our 50 states used to be called 50 laboratories
of democracy.

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:41.690
Now, why can't we basically turn these 50
states into laboratories of economic opportunity?

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:47.849
And there really is no harm in doing it if
the federal government and the states work

00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:53.380
closely together to come up with the right
design of trying these things out because

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.850
there is no harm in just trying out and trying
to find the truth of the matter.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.210
So, I hope that--.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.490
Does that answer your question?

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.210
&gt;&gt; male #7: I guess what I'm getting at--.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.079
I'm not trying to actually disagree with you.

00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:06.310
I'm just saying that if we wanna do this,
it's not trivial.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.920
You don't just say, "Oh, let's make objectives.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.160
Let's go measure them."

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.500
If you were gonna go try to study China and
you were gonna figure out why are they successful,

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.360
it may well be--part of it, a large chunk
of it--is due to government.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.350
But how do you even tease that out?

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.700
Because they have a lot of different policies
that you're trying--.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.020
They may have various ones that are better
than us.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.540
How do we know which ones those are?

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.540
If the whole country is industrializing rapidly,
we can ascribe to the wrong factors and adopt

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.000
things that would actually be worse.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.660
So, how do we--?

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:39.920
&gt;&gt;Ann Lee: Well, my answer is that it always
does start with the government because anyone

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.910
that succeeds is the result of the institutions
and the support network that you find yourself

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:46.920
in.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.140
Even Warren Buffet had said publically, there
would be no way he can be Warren Buffet as

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.690
a billionaire if he had grown up in India.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:02.070
You are the product of what is around you
and the institutions that the government have

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.070
set up.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.070
All right.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.319
Well, thank you so much for your time and
attention.

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:07.890
I really appreciate it.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.230
[applause]
