1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,740
So we've talked about the main events
in Nmr spectroscopy for determining

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,000
structure that is about,
um,

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,300
about the chemical shift and about
spin spin splitting that that, uh,

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,330
allows you to tell how many
nearby nuclei there are a,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,390
today we're going to talk about,
uh,

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,420
some complications that make the
spectrum more complicated, uh,

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,430
and perhaps more informative, uh,
in terms of high order effects,

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,650
higher order effects in spins,

9
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,310
been splitting and then
about using Nmr to study,

10
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,410
not structure but to study rates.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,510
And we'll do some [inaudible]
labeling stuff there. So spin,

12
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,080
spin splitting with other nuclei besides,
uh,

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,570
besides protons next door.

14
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:56,100
And we actually saw some of this last
time with deuterium splitting with, uh,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
[inaudible] splitting.
For example,

16
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,800
if there's a signal like this and
you blow it way up by 30 times,

17
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,850
then you can see that what gives
these things that are so far apart,

18
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,360
126 hertz.
Do you remember this last one?

19
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:12,180
What are the size of splittings you
normally see for protons that are on

20
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:16,380
adjacent carbons there?
The order of seven hertz right here,

21
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,890
we got 126.
What's the big thing that's going on?

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,080
What makes a coupling so big?
Okay,

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,070
it's c 13 h in fact,
uh,

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,710
so 99% of the sample,
if you haven't specifically put,

25
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:37,711
see thirteens in there are see 12 but
about 1% or see 13 so you'll see that.

26
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:43,041
Now here's a paper from from 1959 which
first noted something interesting about

27
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:49,011
these see 13 h coupling constants that
they relate to the amount of s character

28
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,710
in the carbon atomic orbital
that's involved in the bonds.

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,330
Remember we said that the,

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:59,331
that the information has
to be communicated through
the electrons because the

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,790
action of of a magnets through space,

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,010
if you average overall angles of
rotation in a liquid goes to zero, right?

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,840
So you communicate through the bonds.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,080
The nice thing about that is so strong
for JC 13 age is the thisi 13 has just

35
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,460
one bond to get to the age.
So it's a very short path to communicate.

36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,930
Okay?
Now,

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,620
but you remember also that to do that
so that it doesn't average out as you

38
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,880
tumble the s you have to have
the electrons in an s orbital.

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,440
So the hydrogen uses it's s orbital,
that's all it's got essentially.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,570
But carbon can use SRP. So the
hybridisation, as they say here,

41
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,680
relates to the coupling
constant, uh, because they, the,

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,610
to communicate that electron must
be on the [inaudible] nucleus.

43
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,440
So this is a table from that paper.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,040
It gives the coupling constant
in units of per second,

45
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,810
those were then changed to be
called Hertz nowadays. Okay.

46
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,560
So here are a bunch of different,
and they're JC 13 h coupling constants.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,840
If we make a histogram of them,

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,050
you see that there's a group between 100
2,141 between 150 and 170 and another

49
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,130
group down around two 50. So there,
there are different groups evolved here.

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,640
There are three different populations.
We could draw the lines between them.

51
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,740
And then if we look to see what the
carbons are that bear these hydrogens that

52
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,420
show that splitting, uh, we could look
first at the very big ones down there.

53
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:33,421
And what's special about those carbons
that are splitting the hydrogens right

54
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,210
there? Triple bonded. So sp hybridization,

55
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,350
50% s in the bond to hydrogen,
right? The ones here,

56
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,850
the green ones, right, are
in aromatic systems, right?

57
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,500
So they have sp squared hybridization
except for cyclo propane.

58
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,670
Why would it have such a, such
a high coupling? Constant?

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,840
Why would it have a lot of s
character in the bond to hydrogen?

60
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,380
The carbon that's in a cycle of propane,
right?

61
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,460
Because it's bonds normally
or tetrahedral SPQ cubed.

62
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,700
But when you try to make a smaller angle,
right?

63
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,270
It's more p character in the, in the, uh,

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
in the bonds to the other carbons,

65
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,460
therefore more s character
coming out to the hydrogens.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,540
So we can actually see that
hybridization change in the Nmr.

67
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,520
And then these other are normal, a methyl
groups, SB cubed, hybridized carbons.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,020
So here in,
uh,

69
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,700
in Nmr we have direct evidence for this
hybridization stuff we talked about last

70
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:38,260
semester. Okay, so it's
SPSP squared s cubed.

71
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,480
Now here's a subtle point,
uh,

72
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,520
perhaps we shouldn't be spending
time on it, but it's so interesting.

73
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:50,521
And I suspect the curious among you
may have wondered about this because we

74
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,730
talked about a coupling goes
through the bonds, right?

75
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,370
So from h to see,
to see to age,

76
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,660
how about h to c to h?
That's a shorter path,

77
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,580
right? So methane, if you're
looking at one hydrogen,

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,710
how many other hydrogens, which you
think it would be coupled to three,

79
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,430
right? And they could be
in one, three, three, one.

80
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,320
So you should see a quartet for a
proton of ch four. But you don't,

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,970
you just see a single sharp peak.
So where did the splitting go?

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,670
And this is related to what we talked
about last time, where a book said that,

83
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,520
that there is the splitting constant,
a zero. And I said, that's not true.

84
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,140
The splitting constant is high,
might be 10, but it's not observable.

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,760
So why is it, why doesn't, why
don't you see quartets for ch four?

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,440
Okay, so here's a one of these spectrum.
Actually, if you, if you go up here, uh,

87
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:52,330
and you can click on that and
get taken to the website of a,

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,730
of chem two 20 where they have problems.

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,100
I'll work one problem later
in the class if we have time.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,140
But there are others you
can practice on there.

91
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,910
So this is a compound and I'll tell
you it's answer. It's cinnamic acid.

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,320
It's related to the Aldehyde
related to this acid cinema.

93
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,450
Aldehyde is the smell of cinnamon day.

94
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,350
So what do we expect when
we look at the Proton spot?

95
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,820
This is the proton spectrum of it.
What do we expect? Well, notice that,

96
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,890
that we can draw a resonance structures,

97
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,060
which will put positive charge
on the carbon with that hydrogen.

98
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,160
So remove electron density from that
hydrogen or from that one or that one or

99
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:31,970
that one.

100
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,650
So those all should be shifted down field
relative to where they would otherwise

101
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,510
be relative to the ones that
aren't blue. Right? So, uh,

102
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,550
when we,
when we look at the compound,

103
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:46,880
then we see these really
complicated peaks in here.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,430
We throw up our hands
trying to understand that.

105
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,110
And then we see here two
doublets really nice, Sharp,

106
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,880
clean things. So what do you think
the two doublets are out here?

107
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,320
Let's ignore that bit for the time
being and talk about these two doublets.

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,990
What do you, what's protons do you think
those come from? Which one is this?

109
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,480
Okay. And let me start going around the
compound. The O H is way down further.

110
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,870
We're not showing that. Okay, so I'll
go down. I come to his, this one.

111
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,670
What do you think that is
right now?

112
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,870
That's the one up here. This is where
a double bonds normally come, right?

113
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,530
Then you come here and that one
is a carbon on a hydrogen audit.

114
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,980
Double bonded carbon.
But it's down here because it's,

115
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,560
it's lost electron density,
right?

116
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,860
Where we drew resonance structure
where the blue ones were more positive.

117
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,340
And then here we have hydrogens that are
on the benzene ring shifted down this

118
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,630
way because of the ring shift,

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,440
the aromatic ring current that
we talked about last time, right?

120
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,430
And now there's a group of three
and a group of two. These are,

121
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,220
these are positive and are shifted down.

122
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:03,221
That's the group of to the group of three
here is these two plus this one which

123
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,560
would shift to be shifted down because
it's positive but up because it's far

124
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:14,090
from this sp squared carbon. Let's not
worry about why that is, but at any rate,

125
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,180
that's the benzene ones, but that's not
what we're going to talk about here.

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,800
What we're going to talk about is the
clean signals here and here. Okay?

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,660
Now this is measured with a
magnetic field of 7.05 Tesla.

128
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,810
That means it's a 300
megahertz spectrometer,

129
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,170
so instead of using parts
per million down here,

130
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:37,790
we could change to hertz if we wanted
to change to a frequency scale and in

131
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,310
terms of frequency,
if we call zero the middle,

132
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,720
then that's a lower frequency at the top,
higher frequency to the bottom. Okay?

133
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,170
Now it turns out that the ratio
of the chemical shift difference,

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,710
Delta measured in Hertz,
not in parts per million.

135
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,170
We want to be comparing apples
with apples here hurts with hertz,

136
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,620
so the chemical shift from here to
here is much bigger than the coupling

137
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,150
constant Jay,
right?

138
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,440
It's 24.4 times as large and
that's the pattern we see.

139
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,060
Now suppose we used a smaller
magnetic field, right?

140
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,620
What's going to happen?

141
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,630
The chemical shift in parts per
million will stay the same, right?

142
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,860
But it'll be the same fraction
of a smaller frequency.

143
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,980
If we use a smaller field,
the precession frequency gets smaller.

144
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,850
So if we measure in Hertz as we're doing
here, they'll come closer together.

145
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,470
But Jay will stay the same
because it doesn't depend on
the field, right? The Mag,

146
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,120
the magnets are not dependent on the
field right there. Coupling. Okay,

147
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:46,290
so what will happen? These two
doublets will move together, right?

148
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,350
So 2.89 it turns out the
ratio is 10 or 0.86 a Tesla.

149
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,010
It would be three notice incidentally
that this would be a much cheaper

150
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:02,850
spectrometer because it would,
it would have only attempt as big.

151
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,490
The magnetic field is the other one,
right?

152
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,520
But also those other peaks
are going to be in the middle.

153
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,250
Everything's going to be getting on top
of one another and I'm just showing you

154
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,010
what would happen to this double doublet.
Okay.

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,670
There is a 0.29 and finally,

156
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
if we're a hundred times smaller at 0.2
for the ratio of chemical shift to Jay

157
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:27,090
measured in the same units and hurts,
you get the purple pattern.

158
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,780
Now notice that the j is always the same,

159
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,370
the splitting between the two peaks, but
what do you notice between the doublet?

160
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,480
What's curious about this?
I mean,

161
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,530
I'm sure you all see

162
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,070
some of the peaks are disappearing and
others are getting stronger as they come

163
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,210
together,
right?

164
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:53,211
The outer peaks are getting very weak
and in the limit where the chemical shift

165
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,770
was zero,
right?

166
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,680
The difference as in methane,

167
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,390
then the outer peaks disappear
altogether and you just see one peak.

168
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,243
Okay?

169
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,490
Now notice that that part in the original
spectrum was a mess because all those

170
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:15,501
hydrogens of the of the benzene ring
have similar chemical shifts and they're

171
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,520
all coupled with one another.

172
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:20,790
So it's more of this same thing at
all on top of one another and very

173
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,350
complicated.
So we'll forget that.

174
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,920
Let's think about what causes this change.

175
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,770
This is so called higher order effect,

176
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,140
not the simple thing that
you have a chemical shift,

177
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,430
count the neighbors and get
one to two to one, one, three,
three, one, one, four, six,

178
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,830
four, one kind of thing. Okay?

179
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,831
So here we are plotting the energy in a
big applied field of different nuclear

180
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,100
spin states. And we're talking
about just two nuclei, okay?

181
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,900
So they could both be with the field that
would be low in energy or one with and

182
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:54,670
the other against or against them,
the other width.

183
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,820
And then they could both be
against the applied field.

184
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:01,870
So you'd have these different energies,
right? And that's the 100 megahertz. This,

185
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,880
that's the energy that it would take
to get from here to here, right? By,

186
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,590
uh, flipping the red spin would
be a hundred megahertz, right?

187
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,010
But now, so, but all of
these look the same, right?

188
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,250
Whether you do a red line and flip the
Red Arrow or do a blue line and flipped

189
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,480
the Blue Arrow there.

190
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:26,560
All the hundred megahertz or whatever
frequency or 300 megahertz in that

191
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,740
spectrum we were looking at before.
Okay.

192
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,120
So we're going to see just a
single peak at at first glance,

193
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,620
but if we hold men and magnify things
so we can see small differences.

194
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,810
So in large this center
portion by a factor of 10 to
the fifth so we can see the

195
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:44,311
difference.

196
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:48,490
It's just a part per million in the
difference between the environment of the

197
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:53,380
blue and the environment of the
Red Proton. Then as we expand that,

198
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,000
we see that they're not quite the same.

199
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,260
It's harder to flip the blue proton
than it is to flip the Red Proton.

200
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:02,830
The Blue Proton is in a higher field
because of the chemical shift difference

201
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,810
and if we call that difference Delta
over to now you'll notice that that made

202
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:12,811
the red line's shorter by Delta over to
and the blue lines longer by Delta over

203
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,270
to doing that.
Okay,

204
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,830
so now we're going to see a chemical shift
of Delta one is smaller by Delta over

205
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:21,371
to the other,

206
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,540
larger by Delta over to the differences
Delta that Kevin uncle shift. Okay.

207
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,010
So that's the chemical shift.

208
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,710
And now suppose the spins interact
not only with the big blue field,

209
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,390
but also with each other.

210
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,550
And just suppose that there are coupling
through these electrons is such that

211
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,920
they prefer to be anti parallel.

212
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,770
You could have the opposite
sign of the coupling constantly.

213
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:46,330
They could prefer to be parallel,

214
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,970
but let's suppose they
prefer to be anti parallel.

215
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,870
So the ones where they're anti
parallel will go down in Nrg,

216
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,190
the ones where their power parallel,
we'll go up in energy. Okay,

217
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,700
so let's do that.
Okay.

218
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,290
And now what happened to the,
to the red and blue peaks?

219
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,270
Notice that this red peak got this
red transition, went to lower energy,

220
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,450
but this one went to higher energy,
right?

221
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,490
And this blue one went to lower energy,
but this blue one went to higher energy.

222
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,760
Everybody see that?
So what's going to happen?

223
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,160
The red peak is going to split.

224
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,590
There's going to be a lower
and a higher red peak.

225
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,780
There's going to be a lower
in a higher blue peak.

226
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,190
So it's going to look like that, right?
And those that's going to be Jay,

227
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:38,191
if these shifts are Jay over for this
transition got longer by Jay over to this

228
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:44,680
one, got shorter by Jay over to, so
the difference between them as Jay now.

229
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,030
So that's where these,

230
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,330
in terms of the energy of the
things interacting with one another,

231
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,930
that's where we get chemical
shift difference and spins.

232
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,200
Been coupling Jay. Okay?
So that looks just fine.

233
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:59,330
And that's what's called
the first order spectrum.

234
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,800
That's what we've been talking about.

235
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,910
But there are higher order effects
and I think you'll find this cute.

236
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,590
Okay.

237
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,180
Because Jay does something else
besides just shifting these levels,

238
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,260
right?

239
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,790
It also mixes this state with this state,

240
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,700
okay? And it mixes them
into a sum and a difference.

241
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,880
And of course we've seen
things just like this before.

242
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,340
That's what it looks like
in the case of magnetism.

243
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,390
The sum has the two pointing
in opposite directions along Z,

244
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,410
but not along x. And the, and the, uh,

245
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,240
the difference has them pointing
opposite directions all together. Okay?

246
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,550
Now when you do that,
when you mix this with this,

247
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:47,780
you get the difference,

248
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,630
which turns out to be a little
lower in energy and the sun,

249
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,190
which is a little higher in energy.

250
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,080
And of course that's just like mixing a
p orbital on carbon with a p orbital on

251
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,040
oxygen and a CEO double bond. You mixed
the two, their energies don't match.

252
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,150
So you get this one has more of that in
it. This one has more of that and it,

253
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,620
oops, I wrote this wrong and that should
be red and blue. Okay, I'll change that.

254
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,170
Everybody with me.
So I didn't tell you exactly why these,

255
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,830
why it couples to this, but it does. Okay,

256
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,010
so this shifts those energies,
right?

257
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,831
So that,

258
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,330
notice that that makes the
reds a little bit smaller.

259
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,360
Both of the reds smaller,
right?

260
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,480
And both of the blues larger,
right?

261
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,370
So it shifted the reds to the right
and the blues to the left, right?

262
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,990
So the peaks aren't so Delta isn't exactly
what you thought it was going to be.

263
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,930
Right.
That is the shift.

264
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,980
The difference between the average of
those two isn't exactly the chemical shift

265
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,450
because of this higher order effect.

266
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,990
But there's something much more
interesting that happens, right?

267
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,400
That one is non magnetic.
Obviously they cancel one another,

268
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,960
but how about the other one?
It's not magnetic along Z,

269
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,610
right?

270
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,610
But it's just as magnetic along x
as either of those other states.

271
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,610
The top one of the bottom one is right,

272
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,250
so it has this resultant,

273
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,300
so it says magnetic perpendicular to the
main field as either the one that was

274
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:28,250
where they're both against the field
of the one where they're both with the

275
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:32,300
field. So this one is magnetic
and that one's not magnetic.

276
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
That is, this one can interact
with the magnetic field of light.

277
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,460
But this one can't interact with
the magnetic field of light.

278
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,170
So if we look over here,
we see that this one is weakened.

279
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,820
It's not interacting with light.

280
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,010
This one is interacting even
more strongly with light.

281
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,370
Hey,

282
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,050
now what that means is, so this one
is really strong in this one is weak.

283
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,410
Now in terms of interaction with light,
okay?

284
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,570
So this influences the intensity
of the transitions. Okay?

285
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,290
Now what it does is it makes the
ones that involve this level,

286
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:14,120
that's this red one in this blue one
gets stronger and these get weaker like

287
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:14,954
that.

288
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,443
Hey,

289
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,230
so what's going to happen over here?
This one, which is the shortest of all,

290
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,580
and this one, which is the longest of
all, this one in this one get weak,

291
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,810
or pardon me? Pardon me? Uh,
no. This is the longest of all.

292
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,380
This is the shortest of all this red one.
So those get weak,

293
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,250
but the inner ones get strong.
So it changes to look like that.

294
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,180
And the more you mix them,

295
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,500
the bigger they're separated by Delta
or Delta over to their mixed by Jay.

296
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,800
So the more the bigger Jay is compared
to Delta, the more they'll mix,

297
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,330
the more they'll be exactly like this,
which is when they're completely mixed in,

298
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:03,170
the stronger these will become in the
week or these will become so is the delta

299
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:07,310
gets smaller and smaller in terms of
Hertz. As you change the magnetic field,

300
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,690
the outer peaks shrink. And
the inner peaks grow, right?

301
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:16,220
So that's why methane has a single
peak and you can't see it splitting,

302
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,250
even though the coupling is still there,
you just can't see it.

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So the radio frequency light loses its
handle on the flanking peaks as Delta

304
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:30,680
becomes small compared to
Jay as shown here, right?

305
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,040
So by increasing Delta measured in Hertz,

306
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,770
that is by using an expensive big field,

307
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,450
you make things more like first order
spectra that are easy to interpret.

308
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,410
One to two, one to two to one, one,
three, three, one, one, four, six, four,

309
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:49,550
one and so on. Okay? So that's,

310
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,680
that's the subtle aspect.

311
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:56,681
Now we're going to talk about how you
use Nmr to study dynamics to study rates

312
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,150
and what we mean by the Nmr time
scale and how decoupling works.

313
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,750
Okay?
So we looked at this spectrum last time.

314
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,900
This is a spectrum of ethanol measure.

315
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:13,760
Does it says over here by your
own ta? Uh, they'll Lichter.

316
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,440
Okay. Now, if we look at these
three peaks with that we see there,

317
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,370
the Oah,

318
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,380
the ch two and the ch three and we analyze
these last time and saw that this is

319
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:27,860
a triplet. This is a triplet
both being split by this ch two,

320
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,250
but this one is a quartet of doublets.
Okay,

321
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:37,370
now that was measured in
dms. Oh, solvent, right?

322
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:41,490
For a special reason.
Remember that peak came from dms,

323
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:45,830
so that had a little hydrogen in
it as well as deuterium. Okay?

324
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,340
If we measured in chloroform was a little
bit of acid in there or a Phil did,

325
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:57,310
he measured this one as well. Notice
the peaks shift a little bit, right?

326
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,500
Especially the Oah peak shifts a lot,
right? The other shift a little bit,

327
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,630
this one, not too much. Okay.

328
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:08,770
But what's much more interested in than
these shifts is what the peaks actually

329
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:13,660
looked like in terms of their splitting.
Now bear in mind, this ohp cause here,

330
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,560
it's now over here, but I'm drawing
it here. So instead of a triplet,

331
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,860
it's now a singlet, right? And this one,

332
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:25,060
instead of being a quartet of
doublets is just a quartet.

333
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,070
No changes over here,

334
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,223
right?

335
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,273
So what's,

336
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,280
we've lost the splitting
between the age and the ch two.

337
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,570
It's no longer split.

338
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,870
It's not split by the ch two and
the ch two is not split by the age.

339
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,680
So what's going on when we
did this? In fact, let's all,

340
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,520
let's what happens if we
don't have the acid in there?

341
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,290
If we don't have the acid in there,
this peak moves way over here.

342
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,010
This one stays the same place.
We're still in chloroform solvent,

343
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,630
and this one stays the same place,
but the Oah really changes.

344
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,570
Okay, but look, but what's again,

345
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:11,980
much more interesting is what the patterns
look like. They look like that now,

346
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,253
right?

347
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,530
So this, instead of being
either a triplet or a single,

348
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:21,540
it is a really broad low peak,
right?

349
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,150
This one is, it still looks a little
bit like a quartet of Douglas,

350
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,360
but it's much broadened, right? This
one is the same as it was before,

351
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,553
right?

352
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,380
So something really funny is happening
here. Now let's look at the integral ills,

353
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,960
right? Okay. So within experimental error,

354
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,680
the it's one to two to three,
right?

355
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:48,760
It's 0.96 to two to 3.04 in uh,

356
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,830
in dms. So, okay,

357
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,370
in a CDCL three it's 1.0 to 2.0 to
3.05 again with an experimental error.

358
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:00,460
One, two, three.

359
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,470
But the one that had a little bit of acid
in it is much more interesting, right?

360
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,880
It's two to three. That's
fine. But this is bigger.

361
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,810
1.1400000000000001.
So that peak,

362
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,040
this peak here,

363
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,050
the sharp peak here in the one
that has acid in it, right,

364
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,910
is bigger.
They're more protons there than just one.

365
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,890
How did that happen?

366
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,180
It's an average of both the Oah that's
on the alcohol and the h plus right now.

367
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,330
Let's see, how did that happen? Well,

368
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,360
h plus can go onto the alcohol and then
the age that was on the alcohol can come

369
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,390
back into the solution.

370
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,620
So we've exchanged those two H's and if
that happens rapidly there h is moving

371
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:57,110
all over.
Most of the time they're on alcohol,

372
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,560
but sometime 14% there
on h there is h plus.

373
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,680
And what you're seeing is the
average of those in this case.

374
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,860
So this is averaging the H's
are zipping around from Mali,

375
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,560
not only from,
uh,

376
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,820
not only between acid and alcohol,
but from one alcohol,

377
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:23,030
two another alcohol,
right? By way of the acid.

378
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,070
And what that means is,

379
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,330
remember the reason we see splitting
is that there are these spin isomers.

380
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,950
There are different molecules in there.

381
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:35,300
Some molecules have the neighboring ch
two both up, some have them both down,

382
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,010
some have one up and one down.

383
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,030
But if you're zipping from
molecule to molecule very rapidly,

384
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,930
you see the average,
which is nothing, right?

385
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,640
So when we have acid in there and it's
averaging very fast by going on and off

386
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:54,590
and then going to different molecules,
right? Then we see sharp peak here,

387
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:59,450
the splitting disappears
here. What's going on? Okay,

388
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,300
well how about the Roi h
chemical shift, that thing? Okay.

389
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,050
It's the average of many
hydrogen bonded structures.

390
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,390
So because they're, the hydrogen bonds
keep getting made and broken very rapidly.

391
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,940
So you average among many
different hydrogen bonds,

392
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,420
but the age stays with
the original molecule.

393
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:23,870
It's not going from molecule to molecule
and just breaking hydrogen bonds and

394
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:28,280
going back and forth and that and how
fast you do that and how much you do.

395
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:32,510
It depends on concentration on what the
solvent is on the temperature and so on.

396
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,420
But how about the spin spin splitting
between the ch two in the, Ooh, right?

397
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,720
That can be the average involving
h exchange among many molecules.

398
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,210
It's fast if you have h plus,

399
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,150
it's slow in dms. So, so in dms,

400
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,160
so you saw h is staying
with their molecule and you
see they're splitting in h

401
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:01,340
plus they go from molecule to
molecule fast. You see the average.

402
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,130
And what happens if you don't,
if you have chloroform,

403
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,660
but you don't have the h plus,

404
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,030
it's some kind of averaging is beginning
to happen it looks like. So let's,

405
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,470
so it's clear that if you have h
plus in there, it can zip around.

406
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,130
What happens if you're just making
and breaking hydrogen bonds? Well,

407
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:22,820
you could have three, uh, uh,

408
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,880
alcohol's hydrogen bonded together in
a circle k and they could trade which

409
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:30,921
hydrogen.

410
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:35,921
So this is a mechanism for exchanging
hydrogens from one alcohol to another.

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,960
And then as you go,
as the tremor comes apart,

412
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,650
the molecules become another tremor
and do this exchange another, another,

413
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,570
another. This is a
mechanism, a slow mechanism,

414
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,290
much slower than this h plus thing,
right?

415
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,160
Which can allow slow averaging of the H's,
right?

416
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,630
But if you have dms, l was the
solvent. This doesn't happen. Why?

417
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,910
Because dms, oh, falls forms very
strong hydrogen bonds with Doh,

418
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,710
and it doesn't form these trimers in
which the hydrogens can shift from one

419
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:12,600
molecule to the other, right? If, if
DMS, so we're a strong enough base,

420
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,620
it could pull the h off and
be like an acid catalysts.

421
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:21,450
That would be a base catalyst. Pull it
off one molecule, put it on another one,

422
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,140
right?
But it's not that strong base.

423
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,050
It's just strong enough to forbid
forming those hydrogen bonded trimers.

424
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,180
Okay, so we can get this
averaging, but wait a second.

425
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,080
We looked at this one a couple of lectures
ago when we were looking at IIR and

426
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:40,290
we said that even though this
was said to be an anhydrate,

427
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,280
it had these water peaks and we said
there were two kinds of water peaks.

428
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,550
They're the ones that are hydrogen
bonded here and the ones that are not

429
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:51,330
hydrogen bonded. That's
two different peaks, right?

430
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,520
But shouldn't those average the
same way they do it in Nmr, right?

431
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,740
Where whereas you make one as Molly,

432
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,160
you go from molecule to Mali is
molecules come apart and come together.

433
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,680
Hydrogen bonding,
you quickly average those.

434
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Why don't you get averaging in the IRR
when you do get averaging in the Nmr?

435
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,700
Another question is what's fast?

436
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,810
How fast does it have to be to see a
blur or to see the average as a sharp

437
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:26,310
average rather than to see the
two distinct things? Okay? Now,

438
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,680
uh, this particular sample is a solid,
so you could imagine that these,

439
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,250
that these are held in place by
the surrounding molecules, right?

440
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,990
But you see the same effect in solutions.
So that's not the difference. Okay.

441
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,910
Now notice that in are we have wave
numbers here that tell us how fast this is

442
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:47,160
vibrating and how fast this is vibrating.

443
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,410
And this one is a 110 times 10
to the 10th hurts. And this one,

444
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,190
this Ooh bond is 102 times
10 to the 10th hurts.

445
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,170
That is the difference between them
is 10 to the 11th hurts. Right?

446
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,470
Whereas the difference we were looking
at in the alcohol things were a hundred

447
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:10,380
hertz or a few hundred hertz at most.
Okay.

448
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,690
So this is a much bigger frequency
difference here in IRR than it was an Nmr.

449
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,310
Now what does that have
to do with anything?

450
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,840
How long does it take to
measure a frequency? Precisely

451
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,800
how long is long for
purposes of an average? Okay,

452
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:33,030
well suppose you have two
different swings. I'm going
to put these two guys on,

453
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:37,590
swings up to the ceiling and they'll
start swinging and they swing at a certain

454
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:42,520
rate, right? But they won't swing
it exactly the same rate. Okay.

455
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:47,290
If this, if this, if the, uh, if they're
a little bit different, the two swings.

456
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,520
Okay. So suppose one of them
is pretty fast swinging.

457
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,410
One of them swings at 20 hertz and
the other swings swings at 21 hertz.

458
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,620
Right. And I'm going to try to
push them, but I'm not gonna,

459
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,470
I'm not gonna adjust the
frequency I'm pushing out.

460
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:06,130
I'm just going to sit here
and go bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,
Bom, Bom, Bom, bom, Bom, bom.

461
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,490
And I'm going to do it at 20 hertz.
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

462
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,970
So the guy that's swinging
naturally at 20 hertz,

463
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,210
I always push him every time
he comes just right. Okay.

464
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,010
So the light field in the,
in the I our case or the Nmr case,

465
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,860
uh,
matches perfectly for 20 hertz,

466
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,220
but it doesn't match for 21 hurts.
Of course.

467
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,610
Now if I just did it for a little while
on the 21 hurts just for a little while,

468
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,910
it would be all most in phase
and I'd be pushing them. Right?

469
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,230
But after a little while,

470
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:42,160
we get out of phase and I'm pushing when
he's coming in and pulling when he's

471
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:46,810
going and so on. So it's gonna,
it's gonna get out of whack. Now,

472
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,630
how long does it take to get out of whack?
Right?

473
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:53,680
How long do I have to be doing this in
order to find out that I'm not really

474
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:57,670
doing anything with it? Well,
notice that a one pulse,

475
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,130
a one second pulse samples,

476
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:04,690
the full range of phases
from being completely in
phase to coming back to being

477
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:09,190
completely in phase again. So if I
do it for one second, I get nothing,

478
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,980
okay? It just cancels on this
one. Everything was golden,

479
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,450
okay.

480
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,660
But obviously then there's
no net interaction with the
light in that one over a

481
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,880
course of one second.

482
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,180
So a one second light pulse can clearly
distinguish between 20 hertz and 21

483
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,860
hurts everybody with me.

484
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,300
That means suppose we have 22 hertz.

485
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:42,820
Okay. A swing that I'm trying with my
light to hit, but I'm going at 20 hertz,

486
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,550
right? So that goes through two
complete cycles there. In fact,

487
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,380
it goes through one complete cycle.

488
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,160
You can tell it's not
working after only half, uh,

489
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,400
after only half a second.
Um,

490
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,490
that is one over the difference in lambda
that's long enough to sample the full

491
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,540
range,
favorable and unfavorable.

492
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,470
So I can more quickly tell the
difference when the frequencies are more

493
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,070
different. Right. It depends on
one over the frequency difference.

494
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:20,050
That's how long I have to go to know that
I'm not gonna get any action out of it.

495
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,380
Okay. Now, here's the interesting thing.

496
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,430
Suppose the frequency is changing in time.

497
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,960
It's averaging a proton is jumping from
one position to another and changing its

498
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:33,580
frequency.
Okay?

499
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,610
Suppose that it goes for
20 at 22 hertz for awhile.

500
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,570
Then at 20 hertz for awhile it's in a
different environment than at 22 hertz.

501
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,660
Then at 20 Hertz,
then at 22 hertz,

502
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,410
then at 20 hertz for awhile.
Okay.

503
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,890
Jumping back and forth randomly
at a certain rate. Okay.

504
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,540
Now obviously that's not going
to work with the 22 hertz light.

505
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,270
It goes in and out of phase,
right?

506
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,360
So we won't get any absorption of 22
hertz light supposedly tried 20 hertz

507
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:09,470
light. So we'll move it up there.
Again, it goes in and out of phase,

508
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,090
right? No Pr, no profit in that one.

509
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,700
But suppose I tried 21 hurts

510
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,820
right now.
It stays pretty much in phase,

511
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,360
so it's averaging properly.
Right.

512
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:30,800
And so what will you will see is we
have a very good match at 21 hurts the

513
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:34,730
average frequency and we'll
see a single sharp peak. Uh,

514
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,380
21 hertz will work 20 hertz won't.
22 we'll, we'll see an average peak.

515
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,281
What's the,

516
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:45,281
what's determining it's how long the
pulse is compared to the difference in

517
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:50,180
frequency. If the pulse is
long enough, uh, that, uh,

518
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,010
as long as the difference in
frequency, then we can tell it. Okay.

519
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,690
So when do peaks average?

520
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,250
When Adam's don't stay put long enough
to tell the difference in frequency

521
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,830
between the two sites that
they're changing between.

522
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,530
So if two peaks differ by a hundred Hertz,

523
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,790
you have to count for a hundredth of
a second roughly to tell them apart.

524
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,870
Okay.
But in the eye,

525
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:18,200
are they differed by 10 to the 11th hurts?
Right.

526
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,580
So the exchange of position would have
to be 10 to the 11th times a second.

527
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,980
Right. In order to be able to see
separate peaks, right? And, and that's,

528
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,570
that's as fast as Adam's vibrate. They
can't change their partners that rapidly.

529
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,800
Right?

530
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
So that's why in the IRR you don't see
averaging when you do see it in the Nmr,

531
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,550
because the Nmr differences
in frequency are small.

532
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,490
Just a few hurts or a few
hundreds of hurts, right?

533
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,930
So if something happens in 100th of a
second, you can see separate peaks for it.

534
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,190
Okay.

535
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,400
But you can't do that in the IRR because
the differences in frequency are so

536
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,990
large.
Okay.

537
00:34:56,991 --> 00:35:00,410
So this gives rise then to
what's called the Nmr timescale.

538
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Now suppose you had Cyclohexane
d 11 it gives this spectrum,

539
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,100
right?

540
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,100
It gives spectrum for axial
and equatorial hydrogens,

541
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,540
right?
Incidentally,

542
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,830
notice that that's sort of as if this
were like benzine with a ring current,

543
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:23,090
it gets shifted down when it's out beside
and shift it up when it's along the

544
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:26,210
axis.
At least that's a way to remember it.

545
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,580
I'm not really sure that
that's the explanation.

546
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,990
I'm not really sure that that a
ring current is true. But anyhow,

547
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,020
you can remember which is
which if you want to, okay,

548
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:40,650
now notice this is a
special Molecule d 11 why?

549
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:45,530
Just one proton? And the reason is
that you get very complicated spins,

550
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:46,364
spins,
splitting.

551
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,190
If these are all hydrogen because
the axial will be split by that.

552
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,080
This equatorial will be split by that
axial one because they don't have the same

553
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,580
chemical shift,
right?

554
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,300
So they're going to split one another
and then they'll all be also be split by

555
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:02,310
these with different
coupling constants and so on.

556
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:07,110
So we make all those deteriorate, we get
sharper peaks so we can study it. Okay,

557
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,060
so it's d 11 right?

558
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,020
But notice this is at minus
89 degrees centigrade.

559
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,250
And watch what happens if
you start warming up that
the difference between the,

560
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,420
the difference in a chemical
shift is 0.48 parts per million.

561
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,900
And this was measured in
an old spectrometer in,

562
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,710
in 1964 by frank bovie at bell labs.
And at the difference here is,

563
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,780
is 0.48 parts per million at
60 megahertz or it's 29 hertz.

564
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,980
We got to put it in frequency. If we
want to talk about this kind of thing.

565
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,980
So 29 hertz difference in frequency.
Okay,

566
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,470
now we go from minus 89 to minus 68.

567
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,890
The peaks get broad to
minus 63 broader still.

568
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:54,630
And moving in at 60,

569
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:59,220
they coalesce and become a single
peak at minus 60. At minus 57,

570
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:03,300
it starts sharpening up and sharpened up.
Still more at minus 49.

571
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:07,230
And what do you think that looks
like at room temperature? So single,

572
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,840
really sharp peak,
sharp as these are sharper.

573
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,390
So it's detangle sharp peak up there.
Uh, even if you have c six h 12,

574
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,960
because it's flipping back and forth
rapidly enough that it's averaging the

575
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:26,361
chemical shifts and once the chemical
shifts become the same on average,

576
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,480
then you can't see the
splitting anymore. Okay? So,

577
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,450
so cyclohexane gives a single sharp peak,

578
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,280
but this allows you to tell
how fast, because you know
this frequency difference,

579
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,090
right?

580
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,680
So it turns out that they less to
give a single peak when it's about,

581
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,430
uh, at about that same, uh, the lifetime
is about the same as that. It's,

582
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,790
it's,
it's actually four times that.

583
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:55,350
But for qualitative purposes it's the
same at the time they coalesce. So,

584
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,090
so it's about, it's about a hundred
times a second, right? That it,

585
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,980
that it's flipping back and forth at minus
60 degrees. But you can measure this,

586
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,910
you can fit these lines to theoretical
calculations for rates at other

587
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,744
temperatures.

588
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,670
Or you can go to a different spectrometer
which has the same chemical shift

589
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,680
difference,
but a bigger frequency difference.

590
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,030
And then get at what temperature you
have that frequency or four times that

591
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:24,390
frequency, right? So that's a
great way to measure the rates.

592
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,520
And by measuring the rates
at different temperatures,

593
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,740
you can get what the barrier is.

594
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:32,490
And that's where we got the number from
last semester when we were talking about

595
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,990
confirmational analysis,

596
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,130
we said that the barrier for flipping one
chair to another in Cyclo hexane is 10

597
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,710
and a half kilocalories per mole.
And that's where you get it.

598
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,260
It's not easy to measure
something like that,

599
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,050
but Nmr allows you to do it right.

600
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,500
So this is a handy way to measure really
fast rates and very small barriers that

601
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,270
correspond to these fast rates.

602
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,510
So the Nmr application and dynamics is
very important for studying a fast rate

603
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,710
processes. Now let me see. I
at the time, yeah, we got, uh,

604
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,590
let me just go very quickly. I'm going
to go really quickly through this, so to,

605
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,360
so we can get to a little
bit of something else.

606
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,170
But this was the kind of question
that I might ask on an exam. Uh,

607
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,520
the first part of the question one
had to do with making this molecule.

608
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,370
We've talked about making
Hemi asset towels before,

609
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,480
but the relevant part here is
question two, which was the sketch,

610
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,220
what you'd expect for the Nmr
spectrum of that compound. Okay.

611
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,770
So let's look at the different,
uh,

612
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,270
groups and you predict what we're going
to get in terms of chemical shift.

613
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,410
First A, how about its chemical shift?
Where do you expect that on the spectrum?

614
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,950
The OAH, it'll be downfield
because of the, oh,

615
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,700
but it'll be almost any place because
of the hydrogen bonding and so on.

616
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,550
That has a big range.
And how about the splitting?

617
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,160
Yeah.
Should it be a singlet doublet,

618
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:01,160
a triplet court that quintet?

619
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,160
One four, six, four one.

620
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,400
What determines the splitting of this?

621
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,230
Jeez.

622
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,760
How many protons are on the
next adjacent Adam? Right?

623
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,340
So here we coupled through this
bond, this bond, uh, to here,

624
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,960
right? These are too far away.
Those are removed by one, two,

625
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,940
three, four bonds. But to
hear it's only one, two,

626
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,940
three bonds. Right? So it
should be a doublet, right?

627
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,970
Everybody agree?
It should be a doublet.

628
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,700
Sebastian,
you shake your head slightly is on,

629
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,910
it depends in dms. So it would be a
doublet, but mostly you don't use that.

630
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:52,030
And in chloroform it would be exchanging,
right?

631
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:54,130
So you wouldn't see the splitting.
Okay.

632
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:58,750
So it could be almost any place between
one and six for hydrogen bonding and the

633
00:40:58,751 --> 00:40:59,950
splitting is probably,

634
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:04,390
it would be a broad singlet because
of rapid ohia exchange. Okay.

635
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:08,130
Now let's go to be, where
should that be? Kind of cool.

636
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,120
We'll ship way up the
right way. Up The left,

637
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,310
in the middle,
almost to the right.

638
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,550
Okay, so it's c h three
is that are on, it's a co,

639
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,360
it's hydrogens that are on the carbon
and the next atom is carbon too.

640
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,460
That's up at the right. Right. But it
has a couple of oxygens here. Right.

641
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,250
So it'll be shifted down a little bit.
Okay.

642
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:34,910
Slightly de shielded by two
atoms on the neighboring carbon.

643
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,360
So one might predict someplace between
one and two and there's a compound that's

644
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:44,640
very like that. That isn't 1.3
okay. How about the splitting?

645
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,143
Okay.

646
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:51,510
By this one, now it has three bonds
to get from here to here. Right?

647
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:54,960
So that should be a splitting.
There's no exchanging there. Okay.

648
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,020
So it should be a one to one doublet
split by Jay should be about seven hertz.

649
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,510
Okay. Now how about c?
What should it look like?

650
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,450
Where should, what should its chemical
shift be relative to say these hydrogens?

651
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,030
Eric was saying, I said double it.
Quadruple. I knocked the splitting.

652
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:21,280
Where's should watch it?
The chemical shift. B first.

653
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,063
Okay.

654
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,520
It's attached to a carbon.
What's that carbon attached to Amy.

655
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,410
Their oxygen. So will be shifted
down more than this one was right,

656
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:37,320
because it's closer to
the oxygen's. Right. So,

657
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,290
so it's de shielded by two oxygen
atoms on the same carbon. Right. So,

658
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,770
uh, it'd be between four
and a half. There's a real,

659
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,040
there's a analog that's at
4.7. Okay. Now how about Derek,

660
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,780
now you tell us about the
splitting of this one.

661
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,980
I think it's a doubling or
tripling or quadrupling downwards.

662
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,450
I don't know that it would be if it were
split by this, that makes it a quartet.

663
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,990
Alright. Yeah. And this
would make it a doublet,

664
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,810
except we already said that
that's probably exchanging,

665
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,530
it would depend on the solvent,
right?

666
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,170
So probably it would just be a one to
three to three to one quartet, right.

667
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,710
Ajay about sonar. It's okay. Let's
keep going. How about this one?

668
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,090
What's that going to be like,

669
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,503
Jack?

670
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,560
Chemical shift for that ch three,
pardon me?

671
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,300
Maybe about two because it's attached
to a carbon which bears oxygen,

672
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:35,100
right? So, so slightly de shielded by
the assets rather like this one. Right.

673
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:38,910
Which is attached to a carbon which
bore two oxygens. So not as far down.

674
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,680
Is that okay? The 1.1. Okay. And
how about the splitting of that one,

675
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:44,514
Jack?

676
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:51,410
Just the Dublin because these are
too far away. Okay. One, two, one,

677
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:55,570
double at seven hertz. Okay. Now let's
go to e. What's it gonna look like

678
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,900
about its chemical shift?
Debbie,

679
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,893
be,

680
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,130
yeah, because it's got an oxygen on
the same carbon, right? Right. So it's,

681
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,880
it's 3.8 out that,
okay.

682
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,510
And how about its multiplicity?
How many hydrogens? Splitting it,

683
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,780
three Vons away.

684
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,873
I can't hear.

685
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:34,290
Well, we already that this one is
going to be a doublet split by that.

686
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,600
If that's true, if, if this one
splits these than these, split that.

687
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,070
And so does the top ones.
So how many altogether?

688
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,580
Six. So it'll be seven lines
in the binomial intensity,

689
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,960
right? Seven line, multiply from the
six atoms on the neighboring carbons.

690
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,050
Seven Hertz. Right. So that's going to be
really, you know, the whole bunch of them.

691
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,920
Seven lines. Okay. Now how about F,

692
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,310
Chris? Same as D, right? It's
got the same conductivity as d,

693
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,890
same hydrogen coupling and so on,

694
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,780
but it's slightly de shielded by the
Austrian out on that. So that's this.

695
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,100
I copied that from here and I copied
this from here. And that's what you said,

696
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,650
but it's different from d

697
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,550
because here is a chiral center.

698
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,870
So one of those is our pro our and
the other is pro s, right? They,

699
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,970
they're different within other
chiral center. So in fact,

700
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:40,530
when you look at a situation like that,

701
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:44,970
there are two that are really close
to one another, two doublets. Okay.

702
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,390
There they're about the same.
But I, I, I caught you. What?

703
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,600
All right. Yeah, you do see
that not in every molecule.

704
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:58,440
Notice that's an ice appropriate group
to ch three s on a Cah attached to

705
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,490
something. If the rest of the molecule
is chiral, those will be different.

706
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,860
Right? That depends on what the
molecule is. Sometimes hardly,

707
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,070
hardly observable,
but very often you can see it.

708
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,320
I saw one when I was a graduate student,

709
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:16,770
I got a spectrum like that and I couldn't,
I said, what the heck is going on?

710
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,180
So that was a standard question I would
ask on exams down here of graduate

711
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:25,740
students at that time after I
learned it myself. Okay, now,

712
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,350
proton decoupling.
Um,

713
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,850
let me just start this and then
we'll show the example next time.

714
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,420
So we have JC 13 h here.
Okay,

715
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,050
now notice that when we put this in a
magnetic field, a certain magnetic field,

716
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,490
the Proton, we'll precess at 100
megahertz. How about the c 13? Well,

717
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:49,470
it precess it a hundred megahertz.
No, because it's a much weaker magnet.

718
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,790
It doesn't feel as much torque.
It doesn't precess as fast, right?

719
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,470
So the h has a steady
field in that direction,

720
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,730
or there are other ones that have exactly
the same steady field in the opposite

721
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,830
direction. Now see, see,

722
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:07,740
13 is 25 megahertz.

723
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,020
It's only a quarter as strong as a magnet.

724
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,080
So it precesses much more slowly.

725
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,490
It's a smaller magnet and
it can be either up or down.

726
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,900
Okay? So both of these things
are happening when we put
it in a magnetic field.

727
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:27,150
Okay? And here's the Nmr spectrum. And
we've seen that and saw the, the uh,

728
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,780
the satellites that the,
these come that peak,

729
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,760
this peak comes from.
See twelves,

730
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,000
this is from [inaudible]
when they're down.

731
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,300
And this is the Proton precession when
the c 13 is up reinforcing the applied

732
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:47,470
field, okay? And at the same time,
if we looked at the c 13 spectrum,

733
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,710
notice that essentially all of of
hydrogen is protium only 0.015%,

734
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,750
very little as deuterium.

735
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,680
So you don't see that big peak in the
middle here because all the hydrogen is

736
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,060
either this way or this
way, right? And the amount,

737
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,470
the magnitude of this splitting in
both cases, 125 hertz, that's fine.

738
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,090
Okay, so now suppose we
do something really cute.

739
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,430
Suppose we've put two
radio frequencies in, okay,

740
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,810
one one at 100 megahertz,
one at 25 megahertz, right?

741
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:23,920
But what we're going to do it,

742
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,540
the way we're going to do it is to have
irradiate 100 megahertz all the time.

743
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,990
So what does that,
but just do a pulse,

744
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,260
a 90 degree pulse of the c 13 to twist
it down into the plane and then allow it

745
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,410
to precess and that's what we're going
to listen to, to see if we got a signal.

746
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,720
We're going to listen to the c
13 while irradiating the age.

747
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,370
Now what effect does that happen?

748
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,980
If you were in a frame
rotating a hundred megahertz,

749
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,510
you'd see that this little hundred
megahertz field is going to cause this,

750
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,670
this the hydrogens to precess
like this to go up, down,

751
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,080
up, down, up, down. What determines
how fast they go up and down,

752
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,290
how fast they've precess.
What determines that?

753
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,250
It's how big this field is,
how strong the field is.

754
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:18,370
The stronger the field, the
faster the precession. Okay,

755
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,860
so that means h is going
to be up then down,

756
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:24,970
then up then down and how fast it's
going up, down, up, down, up, down.

757
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,770
Depends on how much power
we put into our radio. Okay?

758
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,770
If we do it fast enough,

759
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,000
we see the average of the [inaudible]
and decouple the spectrum.

760
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:42,001
We can see the c 13 spectrum without
the h splitting it by making the H's

761
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,190
quickly go up and down.
How fast do they have to go up and down

762
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,550
in order to average the 125
hertz splitting to be nothing,

763
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:56,020
to just be a single Pete,
how fast.

764
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,363
Yeah.

765
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,350
Once you've had time
to review the lecture,

766
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:03,510
you'll be able to answer that
about 125 times a second,

767
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,090
right? The frequency differences, how
fast you have to flip to average. Right?

768
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,360
So if you put enough
power on the hydrogen,

769
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,940
you remove the splitting
from the c 13 specter,

770
00:50:14,941 --> 00:50:17,550
which can be handy as we'll
show you the next time.

771
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,253
Okay.

772
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:25,560
So the decoupling power determines the
rate of this precession and this we'll

773
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:26,370
see next time.
