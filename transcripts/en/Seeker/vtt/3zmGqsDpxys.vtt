00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.980
Scientists have just invented a way to pull
something as valuable as diamonds out of thin

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.830
air, and doing so MIGHT help solve the global
warming problem.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.459
Hi everyone, I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer
for Discovery News, and I’m here to chat

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.370
today not about black holes, asteroids or
spaceships, but instead, I’m going to focus

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.850
on something a little more down to Earth that
could have a global impact.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.250
And that something is carbon nanofibers.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.500
Or more precisely, the PRODUCTION of carbon
nanofibers.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
This material is commonly used in high-end
electronics and could be used to greatly improve

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.320
carbon composite materials that are used in
applications where strong, lightweight material

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.940
is a necessity, such as aircraft or spacecraft.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.440
Normally, the fabrication of this material
is rather expensive, preventing it from being

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.949
used in more applications -- often cheaper
materials, such as certain plastics, will

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:46.949
suffice.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.649
But now, scientists from George Washington
University, have invented a solar powered,

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.239
low energy system that can convert atmospheric
carbon dioxide into valuable carbon nanofibers.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.859
Yes, I said carbon dioxide… from the atmosphere…

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.819
I think you know where I’m going here.

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.430
According to BBC News, in laboratory tests,
scientists put together a bath of molten salts

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.910
and dropped some electrodes into the bath.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.760
Then they passed an electrical current through
the salt and let it do its thing.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.400
Through a chemical reaction, a black, sooty
residue began to form around the electrodes

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.460
-- and that black stuff was carbon nanofibers.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.100
And it’s quite impressive -- the system
converts carbon dioxide into this carbon residue

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520
at a rate of 10 grams per hour.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.400
And this is just a laboratory test!

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.860
Can you imagine what it could do once the
system is optimized and, potentially, scaled

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.290
up for industrial use?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.460
This is what its inventors are thinking: Scale
it up and tap into a limitless supply of carbon

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.460
dioxide.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.170
But perhaps one of their more lofty goals
is to possibly help slow the global warming

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410
trend by pulling carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.070
Carbon dioxide, as we all know, is a potent
greenhouse gas and our burning of fossil fuels

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.310
is showing few signs of abating, sadly.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.751
According to the EPA, in 2013, the US alone
generated over 5 billion metric tons of carbon

00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:59.650
dioxide -- from power plants, industry, land
use and vehicles.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.360
So, not including the CO2 that’s already
in the atmosphere, there’s certainly a huge

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.740
reservoir of the stuff that could be used
as a resource for industrial-scale carbon

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.330
nanofiber factories.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.970
But other scientists aren’t convinced that
these factories can be scaled up to pull enough

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.580
carbon dioxide out of the air to make a difference
on the global warming impacts of the greenhouse

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.580
gas.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.700
But the way I see it, at least it’s a start.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.791
Also, as the technology will be producing
a limitless supply of carbon nanofibers, it

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:29.140
could transform industrial applications for
the material, driving down the price, and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:43.819
potentially revolutionizing certain products

00:02:43.819 --> 00:03:03.670
and technologies.
