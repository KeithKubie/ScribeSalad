00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.606
 Sal Khan lives in California. 

00:00:04.668 --> 00:00:08.814
 Sarisha Sadeed over half the world away in Dubai. 

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:12.491
 Their lives are interconnected, but Khan doesn't know. 

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:16.167
 This is the story of how one man helps education in the world 

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:20.033
 but they never see themselves with their students. 

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.334
 Where does your passion come from? 

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.499
 Well, I think I always liked to teach. 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.467
 He is a man who has won a lucrative place in Silicon Valley. 

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.433
 It might look like a boring job. 

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.783
 I'm full of negative feelings now, 

00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:37.316
 but when it comes to managing education, it's never about money. 

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.216
 Khan could make millions. 

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:44.783
 He was one of the most successful students of his college with a perfect point score in SATs (a standardized test for US universities). 

00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:49.382
 Then MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) came to Bill Clinton. 

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:54.497
 Then Harvard Business School, where he got to the hedge funds and it suited him. 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.549
 But Khan, who had a wife and son who supported him, threw it all behind. 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.094
 Many people think I'm a little crazy. 

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:03.967
 Obviously you know that if you have every waking hour to sneak into the room 

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:06.100
 and create math video and put it on Youtube. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.398
 People then come up with the question: "What is it?" 

00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:11.926
 This is happening, Khan's Youtube videos. 

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.983
 Let's do a few more examples and I think you could get into it. 

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:18.798
 Users around the world have been clicked at least 9 million times. 

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:20.481
 Topics range from mathematics, 

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.061
 to chemistry and economics. 

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:27.718
 You can use these videos for each educational field. He really helps. 

00:01:27.718 --> 00:01:31.717
 One of the users is nineteen-year-old Sirisha from Dubai, studying the second year of college. 

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:37.136
 She says the videos help her understand the fabric. 

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:40.657
 I spend about two days before each test 

00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:44.434
 watching videos and understanding the little details they explain. 

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:48.916
 This gigantic virtual school comes from the smallest places. 

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:53.149
 From a small dressing room converted to Salo's room. 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.846
 This is where it is able to reach around 80,000 users looking for education in a month. 

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:03.600
 It all started a few years ago when a cousin wanted some online math tutorial. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.914
 Quite soon, other relatives began to ask for similar help. 

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:10.971
 Suddenly, the people Sal didn't know began to watch these tutorials. 

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:14.466
 You need to teach people math terms and then find out 

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.380
 it's all connected. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.508
 There is still a small proportion of people going on Youtube and going googlit to find the biggest common divisor. 

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.875
 People did that. 

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:26.394
 Now they have Khan's school. 

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:30.883
 Videos are short and created simply using Sal's voice and elements 

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:33.482
 with a simple black background and graphics 

00:02:33.482 --> 00:02:36.683
 There are many people who need help with something. 

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:39.066
 It doesn't matter if it's mathematics, other science or anything else. 

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:44.941
 And I think that the fact that they will find these videos on Youtube is ideal. 

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.783
 There are many people like Sarah Saldeeds. 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.354
 She and her friends refer to Khan as "men with colorful thoughts". 

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:55.495
 Whatever you think of him or his teaching, 

00:02:55.495 --> 00:03:00.700
 the success of his website confirmed his decision to leave hedge funds. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.797
