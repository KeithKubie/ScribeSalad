[Bang] [Cheerful whoop]

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.620
[Laughs]

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.440
Hi I'm Andre Meadows and welcome to Crash Course Games!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.860
Over the next twenty weeks, we're going to have some fun.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.880
I mean Crash Course is *always* fun but this
time we're gonna have fun talking about games.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820
Now of course we're gonna talk about video games:

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.180
your Ataris, your Nintendos, your Sega Genesiseses, your Play Stations, your XBOXs.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.020
But not just video games - also hand held games
mobile games, tabletop games, board games,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.120
card games, sports games, virtual reality games

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.960
Even games going as far back as Ancient Egypt and China games you might not have ever heard of before,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.220
but mechanics in those games that're still prevalent in games today!

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.540
That's a lot of games! But before we get in all these games, allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.060
My name is Andre! Ever since I was a little kid I was into computer and video games.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.280
I used to have a Nintendo Entertainment system - of course - before that I had an Atari 2600.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.460
And before that, I had a Texas Instrument TI994A.
Nerd cred!

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.100
And today I have my own Youtube channel
Black Nerd Comedy where I talk about all kinds of

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.700
retro, nostalgia, pop and geek culture goodness like TV shows, movies, cartoons and of course: video games.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.220
Now video games might be a leisure activity but unlike what your parents told you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.060
when you were a kid, or today, as a kid — or adult —
they are NOT a waste of time!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
You know, video games that we play, they have a lot to tell us about the experiences of being human.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.220
As a matter of fact, humans have been playing games pretty much as long as there have been humans.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.900
And I can tell you, the stakes have changed a little since ancient times:

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.120
I mean, I hate coming in last in Mario Kart as much as the next guy,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.980
But in Ancient Egypt, if you were bad at games

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.920
You could end up in Ancient Egyptian Hell...

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.680
which is kinda like Rainbow Road.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.540
So in this series we're gonna play some games, we're gonna talk some history, maybe some science,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.000
even look into gaming's future, and above all we're gonna have some fun

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.280
learning about this universal human behavior:
People playing games.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.380
