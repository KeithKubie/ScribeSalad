00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.708
- [Instructor] A company
screens job applicants

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:05.360
for illegal drug use at a certain stage

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.230
in their hiring process.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.867
The specific test they use
has a false positive rate

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:16.611
of two percent and a false
negative rate of one percent.

00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:20.106
Suppose that five percent
of all their applicants

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:22.942
are actually using illegal drugs

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:25.713
and we randomly select an applicant.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.430
Giving the applicant test positive,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.353
what is the probability that
they are actually on drugs?

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:35.151
So let's work through this together.

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:36.868
So first let's make sure we understand

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.059
what they're telling us.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.615
So there is this drug test
for the job applicants

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.782
and then the test has a false
positive rate of two percent.

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.056
What does that mean?

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:50.723
That means that in two
percent of the cases,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.994
when it should have read negative,

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:57.201
that the person didn't do the drugs,

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:59.313
it actually read positive.

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:00.913
It is a false positive.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:03.891
It should have read negative
but it read positive.

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:05.234
Another way to think about it.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.964
If someone did not do drugs
and you take this test,

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:10.673
there's a two percent chance

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:14.296
saying that you did do the illegal drugs.

00:01:14.296 --> 00:01:18.163
They also say that there
is a false negative rate

00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:19.594
of one percent.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:20.854
What does that mean?

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:24.112
That means that one percent of the time

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:27.979
if someone did actually
take the illegal drugs,

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.593
it'll say that they didn't.

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:32.335
It is falsely giving a negative result

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.909
when it should have given a positive one.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.465
And then they say that five
percent of all their applicants

00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:39.849
are actually using illegal drugs.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.720
So there is several ways
that we can think about it.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.416
One of the easiest way
to conceptualize is just,

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:48.205
let's just make up a large
number of applicants,

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.904
and I'll use a number where
it's fairly straightforward

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:53.193
to do the mathematics.

00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:57.360
So let's say that we start
of with 10,000 applicants.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:01.155
I will both talk in absolute numbers,

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.591
and I just made this number up.

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:04.644
It could have been 1,000,
it could have been 100,000,

00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:06.588
but I like this number 'cause
it's easy to do the math

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:08.671
better than saying 9,785.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.188
This is also going to be
100% of the applicants.

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:17.031
Now they give us some
crucial information here.

00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.949
They tell us that five percent
of all their applicants

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.230
are actually using illegal drugs.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.440
So we can immediately
break this 10,000 group

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.420
into the ones that are doing the drugs

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.500
and the ones that are not.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
So five percent are actually on the drugs,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.955
95% are not on the drugs.

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:41.705
So what's five percent of 10,000?

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:44.323
So that would be 500.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.566
So 500 on drugs, on drugs.

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:55.674
Once again, this is five percent
of our original population.

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:57.616
And then how many are not on drugs?

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:59.616
Well 9,500 not on drugs.

00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:08.380
And once again, this is 95%
of our group of applicants.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.105
So now let's administer the test.

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:15.831
So what is going to
happen when we administer

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:19.707
the test to the people who are on drugs?

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:23.071
Well the test, ideally,
would give a positive result.

00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.886
It would say positive for all of them,

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:26.895
but we know that it's not a perfect test.

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.475
It's going to give
negative for some of them.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.663
It will falsely give a negative
result for some of them,

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:35.203
and we know that because it
has a false negative rate

00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:36.534
of one percent.

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:40.701
Of these 500, 99% is going
to get the correct result

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.895
in that they're going to test positive.

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:48.145
So what is 99% of 500?

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:53.273
Well let's see, that would be 495.

00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:55.856
495 are going to test positive.

00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.987
I will just use a
positive right over there.

00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:04.404
And then we're going to have one percent,

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:09.895
which is five, are going to test negative.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.141
They are going to falsely test negative.

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.969
This is the false negative rate.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.816
If we say, what percent of
our original applicant pool

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:22.105
is on drugs and tests positive,

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:23.855
well 495 over 10,000.

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:26.340
This is 4.95%.

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:32.667
What percent is of the
original applicant pool

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:36.514
that is on drugs but
tests negative for drugs?

00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:38.834
The test says that hey
they're not doing drugs.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:41.876
Well this is gonna be five out of 10,000.

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:43.543
Which is 0.05%.

00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:50.354
Another way that you could
get these percentages.

00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:53.395
If you take five percent
and multiply by one percent,

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:55.895
you're goin to get 0.05%.

00:04:57.116 --> 00:04:59.184
500ths of a percent.

00:04:59.184 --> 00:05:02.654
If you take five percent
and multiply by 99%,

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:05.237
you're going to get 4.95%.

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.599
Now let's keep going.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.612
Now let's go to the folks
who aren't taking the drugs.

00:05:09.612 --> 00:05:11.463
And this is where the false positive rate

00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:13.814
is going to come into effect.

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:18.285
So we have a false positive
rate of two percent.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.785
So two percent are going to test positive.

00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:25.169
What's two percent of 9,500?

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.752
It's 190 would test positive

00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.037
even though they're not on drugs.

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:36.764
This is the false positive rate.

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:39.159
So they are testing positive,

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.958
and then the other 98% will
correctly come out negative.

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.208
The other 98%, so 9,500 minus 190,

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:52.681
that's gonna be 9,310 will
correctly test negative.

00:05:56.404 --> 00:06:00.199
Now what percent of the
original applicant pool is this?

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.032
Well 190 is 1.9%,

00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:09.221
and we could calculate
it by 190 over 10,000

00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:13.661
or you could just say two
percent of 95% is 1.9%.

00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:16.596
Once again, multiply
the path along the tree.

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:18.429
What percent is 9.310?

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:22.382
Well that is going to be 93.10%.

00:06:24.597 --> 00:06:27.350
You could say this is 9,310 over 10,000

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.915
or you can multiply by the path

00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:31.570
on our probability tree here.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.487
95% times 98% gets us to 93.10%.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.384
But now I think we are ready
to answer the question.

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:42.877
Given that the applicant tests positive,

00:06:42.877 --> 00:06:46.722
what is the probability that
they are actually on drugs?

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:49.106
So let's look at the first part.

00:06:49.106 --> 00:06:52.071
Given the applicant tests positive.

00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:55.220
So which applicants
actually tested positive?

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.794
You have these 495 here tested positive,

00:06:57.794 --> 00:06:59.961
correctly tested positive,

00:07:01.674 --> 00:07:04.654
and then you have these
190 right over here

00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:06.301
incorrectly tested positive,

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.969
but they did test positive.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.598
So how many tested positive?

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:14.098
Well we have 495 plus 190 tested positive.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.657
That's the total number
that tested positive,

00:07:19.657 --> 00:07:23.340
and then which of them
were actually on the drugs?

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.631
Well of the ones that tested positive,

00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:28.214
495 were actually on the drugs.

00:07:30.477 --> 00:07:32.310
We have 495 divided by

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.330
495 plus 190

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.477
is equal to 0.7226.

00:07:49.272 --> 00:07:51.911
So we could say approximately 72%.

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:53.828
Approximately 72%.

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:58.789
Now this is really interesting.

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.527
Given the applicant tests positive,

00:08:00.527 --> 00:08:03.362
what is the probability that
they are actually on drugs?

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:05.209
When you look at these false positive

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:07.721
and false negative rates,
they seem quite low,

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:10.847
but now when you actually
did the calculation,

00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:13.467
the probability that someone's
actually on drugs is,

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:15.909
it's high, but it's not that high.

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:18.292
It's not like if someone
were to test positive

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:20.827
that you'd say oh they are
definitely taking the drugs.

00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:23.056
And you could also get to this result

00:08:23.056 --> 00:08:24.709
just by using the percentages.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.538
For example, you could think in terms of

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:28.885
what percentage of the original applicants

00:08:28.885 --> 00:08:30.746
end up testing positive?

00:08:30.746 --> 00:08:34.090
Well that's 4.95% plus 1.9%.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.257
4.95, we'll just do it in
terms of percent, plus 1.9%,

00:08:40.765 --> 00:08:45.376
and of them, what percentage
were actually on the drugs?

00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:47.793
Well that was the 4.95%.

00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:54.072
And notice this would give
you the exact same result.

00:08:54.072 --> 00:08:56.995
Now there's an interesting takeaway here.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:58.294
Because this is saying,

00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:00.315
of the people that test positive,

00:09:00.315 --> 00:09:03.120
72% are actually on the drugs.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.252
You could think about
it the other way around.

00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:07.650
Of the people who test positive.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.146
495 plus 190, what
percentage aren't on drugs?

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:14.002
Well that was 190,

00:09:14.002 --> 00:09:18.002
and this comes out to
be approximately 28%.

00:09:19.537 --> 00:09:21.620
100% minus 72%.

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:25.760
If we were in a court of law

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.610
and let's say the prosecuting attorney,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.792
let's say I got tested positive for drugs

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.681
and the prosecuting attorney says

00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.054
look, this test is very good.

00:09:34.054 --> 00:09:36.859
It only has a false
positive rate of two percent

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:41.782
and Sal tested positive, he
is probably taking drugs.

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:44.989
A jury who doesn't really
understand this well

00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:47.246
or go through the trouble
that we just did might say,

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:50.582
oh yeah Sal probably took the drugs.

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:51.964
But when we look at this,

00:09:51.964 --> 00:09:54.502
even if I test positive using this test,

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:59.270
there's a 28% chance that
I'm not taking drugs.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.303
That I was just in this
false positive group,

00:10:02.303 --> 00:10:06.307
and the reason why this
number is a good bit larger

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:07.465
than this number

00:10:07.465 --> 00:10:10.580
is because when we looked
at the original division

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.705
between those who take
drugs and don't take drugs,

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:14.953
most don't take the illegal drugs.

00:10:14.953 --> 00:10:17.930
Two percent of this larger group

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.118
of the ones that don't take the drugs,

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:22.316
well this is actually
a fairly large number

00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:25.415
relative to the percentage
that do take the drugs

00:10:25.415 --> 00:10:27.434
and test positive.

00:10:27.434 --> 00:10:29.294
So I will leave you there.

00:10:29.294 --> 00:10:32.148
This is fascinating not just
for this particular case,

00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:35.519
but you will see analysis
like this all the time

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.023
when we're looking at
whether a certain medication

00:10:38.023 --> 00:10:40.485
is effective or a certain
procedure is effective.

00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:43.607
It's important to be
able to do this analysis.
