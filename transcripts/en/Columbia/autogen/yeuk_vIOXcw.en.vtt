hi I'm Matt Kelly there's gonna be a few

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.540
hi I'm Matt Kelly there's gonna be a few
 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.300
hi I'm Matt Kelly there's gonna be a few
visuals in here so you won't have to

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310
visuals in here so you won't have to
 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.340
visuals in here so you won't have to
read so much text hopefully but the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350
read so much text hopefully but the
 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.630
read so much text hopefully but the
project for the incentive award that I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640
project for the incentive award that I
 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.040
project for the incentive award that I
did was visualizing digital collections

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050
did was visualizing digital collections
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.780
did was visualizing digital collections
of web archives so the problem we

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790
of web archives so the problem we
 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.360
of web archives so the problem we
basically want to solve is for sites

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370
basically want to solve is for sites
 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.279
basically want to solve is for sites
that when you put a URI into something

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289
that when you put a URI into something
 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.150
that when you put a URI into something
you don't know initially what you're

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160
you don't know initially what you're
 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.920
you don't know initially what you're
going to get fat and if say that's been

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
going to get fat and if say that's been
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.990
going to get fat and if say that's been
archived over time all the site likely

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000
archived over time all the site likely
 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.760
archived over time all the site likely
changes and so we want to do is try to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770
changes and so we want to do is try to
 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.439
changes and so we want to do is try to
get the aboutness of the site as change

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449
get the aboutness of the site as change
 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.300
get the aboutness of the site as change
over time so in this case with apple how

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310
over time so in this case with apple how
 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.790
over time so in this case with apple how
it's changed your math drastically over

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800
it's changed your math drastically over
 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.990
it's changed your math drastically over
the maybe 20 years that it's existed so

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000
the maybe 20 years that it's existed so
 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.180
the maybe 20 years that it's existed so
but if we try to do that for every

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
but if we try to do that for every
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.540
but if we try to do that for every
moment that we have apple has about

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
moment that we have apple has about
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.950
moment that we have apple has about
17,000 Mentos in in our archive alone

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960
17,000 Mentos in in our archive alone
 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.720
17,000 Mentos in in our archive alone
not counting the other archives I'm so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730
not counting the other archives I'm so
 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.100
not counting the other archives I'm so
trying to do this for all of these

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110
trying to do this for all of these
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.430
trying to do this for all of these
different screenshots is very expensive

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440
different screenshots is very expensive
 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.110
different screenshots is very expensive
in addition to that there's also many

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120
in addition to that there's also many
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.060
in addition to that there's also many
redundancies as you can see from the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070
redundancies as you can see from the
 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.040
redundancies as you can see from the
ones that are circled here there is not

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050
ones that are circled here there is not
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.209
ones that are circled here there is not
necessarily useful to see these

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219
necessarily useful to see these
 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.470
necessarily useful to see these
redundant mentis we're trying to get a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480
redundant mentis we're trying to get a
 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.690
redundant mentis we're trying to get a
summarization for what the site has been

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700
summarization for what the site has been
 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.029
summarization for what the site has been
about over time and how it's changed um

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039
about over time and how it's changed um
 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.160
about over time and how it's changed um
so there's a couple different methods of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170
so there's a couple different methods of
 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.360
so there's a couple different methods of
summarization that you can use to do

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370
summarization that you can use to do
 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.829
summarization that you can use to do
this can include all the mementos as I

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839
this can include all the mementos as I
 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.690
this can include all the mementos as I
said before it's a very expensive both

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700
said before it's a very expensive both
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.490
said before it's a very expensive both
temporally spatially and cognitively

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500
temporally spatially and cognitively
 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.899
temporally spatially and cognitively
expensive to actually look this

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
expensive to actually look this
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.880

collection of many different screenshots

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890
collection of many different screenshots
 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.520
collection of many different screenshots
and try to get what the gist is of how

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530
and try to get what the gist is of how
 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.820
and try to get what the gist is of how
it's changed but if you try to randomly

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830
it's changed but if you try to randomly
 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.060
it's changed but if you try to randomly
pick mementos from the collection that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070
pick mementos from the collection that
 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.679
pick mementos from the collection that
you receive you end up missing important

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689
you receive you end up missing important
 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.600
you receive you end up missing important
captures that are that a representative

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610
captures that are that a representative
 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.570
captures that are that a representative
of how the page has changed in addition

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580
of how the page has changed in addition
 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.030

to that doing image differentials trying

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040
to that doing image differentials trying
 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.350
to that doing image differentials trying
to figure out how the painters change by

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360
to figure out how the painters change by
 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.950

comparing every single memento is a very

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960
comparing every single memento is a very
 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.270

template expensive to generate all those

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280
template expensive to generate all those
 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.920
template expensive to generate all those
but also do the image differential so

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930
but also do the image differential so
 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.210
but also do the image differential so
what we actually came up with in our

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
what we actually came up with in our
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.550
what we actually came up with in our
research was to take the text content of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
research was to take the text content of
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.490

these different Mentos compare them in
account with a summarization based on

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240
account with a summarization based on
 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.499
account with a summarization based on
the HTML of the pages so in the case of

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509
the HTML of the pages so in the case of
 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.690
the HTML of the pages so in the case of
this this individual Apple memento that

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
this this individual Apple memento that
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.270
this this individual Apple memento that
you see here we can crawl that and we

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280
you see here we can crawl that and we
 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.370
you see here we can crawl that and we
can get totally the HTML without having

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
can get totally the HTML without having
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.450
can get totally the HTML without having
this petrol and the other resources that

this petrol and the other resources that
 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.889
this petrol and the other resources that
are associated with it from that we

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899
are associated with it from that we
 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.690
are associated with it from that we
generate a sim hash value a sim patch

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
generate a sim hash value a sim patch
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.600
generate a sim hash value a sim patch
value is a means of a sort of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610
value is a means of a sort of
 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.149
value is a means of a sort of
fingerprinting the the markup in this

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159
fingerprinting the the markup in this
 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.839
fingerprinting the the markup in this
case but it's meant more to identify

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849
case but it's meant more to identify
 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.190
case but it's meant more to identify
similarities between different text

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
similarities between different text
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.959
similarities between different text
contents rather than differences like

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969
contents rather than differences like
 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.000
contents rather than differences like
other hashes so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
other hashes so
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.589
other hashes so
let me go over stimpacks a little bit so

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599
let me go over stimpacks a little bit so
 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.179
let me go over stimpacks a little bit so
if you have an HTML snippet here it

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189
if you have an HTML snippet here it
 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.130
if you have an HTML snippet here it
actually chopped up the HTML and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
actually chopped up the HTML and
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.690
actually chopped up the HTML and
generates a single character for it so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
generates a single character for it so
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.119
generates a single character for it so
this project was just 64 bits impasse to

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129
this project was just 64 bits impasse to
 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.270
this project was just 64 bits impasse to
compare the different Mentos and so in

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
compare the different Mentos and so in
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.770
compare the different Mentos and so in
this case this moment to be represented

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
this case this moment to be represented
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110
this case this moment to be represented
by c3 and many other characters then 9f

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
by c3 and many other characters then 9f
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.089
by c3 and many other characters then 9f
one here I'm so comparing sim half to a

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099
one here I'm so comparing sim half to a
 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.530
one here I'm so comparing sim half to a
couple different hashing algorithm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
couple different hashing algorithm
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.899
couple different hashing algorithm
algorithms on the case of md5 have two

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909
algorithms on the case of md5 have two
 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.759
algorithms on the case of md5 have two
things that are very similar here so the

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769
things that are very similar here so the
 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.170
things that are very similar here so the
talk when you see a bunch of a is there

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
talk when you see a bunch of a is there
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.869
talk when you see a bunch of a is there
with the blue a highlighter and be in

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879
with the blue a highlighter and be in
 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.009
with the blue a highlighter and be in
the second one that's the same string

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
the second one that's the same string
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.080
the second one that's the same string
you get a radically different strings as

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
you get a radically different strings as
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.630
you get a radically different strings as
outputs in it so comparing conventional

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
outputs in it so comparing conventional
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.819
outputs in it so comparing conventional
hashes to sim hash you actually want to

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829
hashes to sim hash you actually want to
 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.589
hashes to sim hash you actually want to
find the similarity between through

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599
find the similarity between through
 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.099
find the similarity between through
either then identify subtle differences

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109
either then identify subtle differences
 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.490
either then identify subtle differences
so in sim hash you see the a that's a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
so in sim hash you see the a that's a
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.839
so in sim hash you see the a that's a
representative there generates this C 3

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849
representative there generates this C 3
 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.039
representative there generates this C 3
character but if you run that same

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
character but if you run that same
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.289
character but if you run that same
string with the be substituted you get

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299
string with the be substituted you get
 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.559
string with the be substituted you get
the a4 but you get very similar other

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
the a4 but you get very similar other
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.599
the a4 but you get very similar other
characters in the results for so the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609
characters in the results for so the
 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.710
characters in the results for so the
basis of this is if we have two

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720
basis of this is if we have two
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.479
basis of this is if we have two
different HTML pages and they've changed

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489
different HTML pages and they've changed
 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.250
different HTML pages and they've changed
over time to be able to identify the

over time to be able to identify the
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.330
over time to be able to identify the
similarities between these different

mementos we can identify the parts that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
mementos we can identify the parts that
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.680
mementos we can identify the parts that
have changed and if they've gotten past

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
have changed and if they've gotten past
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.789

they've changed to a sufficient degree
 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.449
they've changed to a sufficient degree
to warrant them being included in

summarization so like I said we want to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
summarization so like I said we want to
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.129
summarization so like I said we want to
identify the similarities rather than

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139
identify the similarities rather than
 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.879
identify the similarities rather than
difference in this and we want to remove

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889

then it's likely that the screenshots
are going to be very similar and not

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

see the subtle differences in here but

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819
see the subtle differences in here but
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:57.949
see the subtle differences in here but
if we actually highlight them in here

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959
if we actually highlight them in here
 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.250
if we actually highlight them in here
you can see that if we have a sim hash

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
you can see that if we have a sim hash
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.159
you can see that if we have a sim hash
if we have a threshold to be of

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169
if we have a threshold to be of

differences we call the Hamming distance

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
differences we call the Hamming distance
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.250
differences we call the Hamming distance
in here so Hamming distance is merely

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260
in here so Hamming distance is merely
 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.069
in here so Hamming distance is merely

that we use a sliding pivot in this case
so everything prior to momenta through

so everything prior to momenta through
 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.420
so everything prior to momenta through
we based off of some initial pivot so

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430
we based off of some initial pivot so
 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.770
we based off of some initial pivot so

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:54.019
crash so if say you you do it one day
and then a year later you go and you

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:54.029
and then a year later you go and you
 

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.430
and then a year later you go and you
want to get another summarization for it

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440
want to get another summarization for it
 

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.410
want to get another summarization for it

summarization in contrast is where you

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.230
summarization in contrast is where you
 

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.960
summarization in contrast is where you
actually pre generalized stuff you feed

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:20.970
actually pre generalized stuff you feed
 

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.269
actually pre generalized stuff you feed
a big list of your eyes you basically

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279
a big list of your eyes you basically
 

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.120
a big list of your eyes you basically
say I want thumbnail summer stations for

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.130
say I want thumbnail summer stations for
 

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.700
say I want thumbnail summer stations for
say all these your eyes and Alexa five

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:29.710
say all these your eyes and Alexa five
 

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.340
say all these your eyes and Alexa five
and I want to make sure to I'm expecting

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.350
and I want to make sure to I'm expecting
 

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.120
and I want to make sure to I'm expecting
people to come and look at these

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.130
people to come and look at these
 

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.310
people to come and look at these
summarization so I want to pre generate

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:35.320
summarization so I want to pre generate
 

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.510
summarization so I want to pre generate
these so that's capable of doing this

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:36.520
these so that's capable of doing this
 

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.370
these so that's capable of doing this
machine as well and it makes it so it's

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:38.380
machine as well and it makes it so it's
 

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.690
machine as well and it makes it so it's
not necessarily on demand but it makes

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:39.700
not necessarily on demand but it makes
 

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.490
not necessarily on demand but it makes
it so it's more responsive whenever

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:41.500
it so it's more responsive whenever
 

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.720
it so it's more responsive whenever
someone comes if they come in the energy

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:42.730

or I that isn't include that it will

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.410
or I that isn't include that it will
 

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.710
or I that isn't include that it will
default to online generation and then

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720
default to online generation and then
 

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.690
default to online generation and then
you'll have that within your data set

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:48.700
you'll have that within your data set
 

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.250
you'll have that within your data set
there's a couple different adaptive

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.260
there's a couple different adaptive
 

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.080
there's a couple different adaptive
strategies so generating all these uh

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.090
strategies so generating all these uh
 

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.660
strategies so generating all these uh
these sim patches is extremely expensive

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.670
these sim patches is extremely expensive
 

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.460
these sim patches is extremely expensive
so there's actually a by default if you

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:56.470
so there's actually a by default if you
 

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.410
so there's actually a by default if you
don't specify a strategy it will first

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:58.420
don't specify a strategy it will first
 

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.630
don't specify a strategy it will first
try out summarization and if there's a

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:00.640
try out summarization and if there's a
 

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.820
try out summarization and if there's a
certain threshold of mementos we're

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:02.830
certain threshold of mementos we're
 

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.590
certain threshold of mementos we're
going to take like ours to generate it

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600
going to take like ours to generate it
 

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.500
going to take like ours to generate it
will go to a naive strategy and actually

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:07.510
will go to a naive strategy and actually
 

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.270
will go to a naive strategy and actually
do something like like random and give

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.280
do something like like random and give
 

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.070
do something like like random and give
you back a summarization to get over

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.080
you back a summarization to get over
 

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.420
you back a summarization to get over
that you can actually explicitly state

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.430
that you can actually explicitly state
 

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.340
that you can actually explicitly state
that you want out summarization and it

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:14.350
that you want out summarization and it
 

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.810
that you want out summarization and it
will go and grind for those hours to go

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:15.820
will go and grind for those hours to go
 

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.940
will go and grind for those hours to go
and generate always a screen shots but

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:17.950
and generate always a screen shots but
 

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.330
and generate always a screen shots but
it gives sort of am a way to be adaptive

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.340
it gives sort of am a way to be adaptive
 

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.100
it gives sort of am a way to be adaptive
and more usable in this case so if you

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.110
and more usable in this case so if you
 

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.360
and more usable in this case so if you
just want to get something up real quick

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:24.370
just want to get something up real quick
 

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.470
just want to get something up real quick
can you want to see it you can do that

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480
can you want to see it you can do that
 

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.130
can you want to see it you can do that
so the other different strategies I

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:29.140
so the other different strategies I
 

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.480
so the other different strategies I
talked about before the random strategy

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.490
talked about before the random strategy
 

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.800
talked about before the random strategy
where you pick the k2 Mentos and we get

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:31.810
where you pick the k2 Mentos and we get
 

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.160
where you pick the k2 Mentos and we get
a uniform selection over the whole time

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.170
a uniform selection over the whole time
 

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.800
a uniform selection over the whole time
at the interval every every m-f momento

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:37.810
at the interval every every m-f momento
 

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.560
at the interval every every m-f momento
we get we pick a we picked that and

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:40.570
we get we pick a we picked that and
 

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.660
we get we pick a we picked that and
include that in the summarization and a

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:42.670
include that in the summarization and a
 

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.220
include that in the summarization and a
temporal interval where we go out year

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.230
temporal interval where we go out year
 

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.920
temporal interval where we go out year
year year until we have enough Mentos

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:46.930
year year until we have enough Mentos
 

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.540
year year until we have enough Mentos
and if we need to be back built from the

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:48.550
and if we need to be back built from the
 

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.250

comparing it we did a couple studies on

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000
comparing it we did a couple studies on
 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.010
comparing it we did a couple studies on
to what is a more than more than

bunch of thumbnails where that threshold

00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440
bunch of thumbnails where that threshold
 

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.190
bunch of thumbnails where that threshold
is about k equals 15 or anything above

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:02.200
is about k equals 15 or anything above
 

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.079
is about k equals 15 or anything above
that then then it's kind of hard to say

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:04.089
that then then it's kind of hard to say
 

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.699
that then then it's kind of hard to say
to visualize those all at once for

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:05.709
to visualize those all at once for
 

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:07.680

it's hard to really see which ones are

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160
it's hard to really see which ones are
 

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.010
it's hard to really see which ones are
the unique ones if they all similar in

this case so to be able to take this all

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:16.540
this case so to be able to take this all
 

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.870

in at once one of the findings were not

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880
in at once one of the findings were not
 

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.460
in at once one of the findings were not
from Mars but from previous work and we

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:20.470
from Mars but from previous work and we
 

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.380
from Mars but from previous work and we
use that as a basis as kegels 15 so in

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.390
use that as a basis as kegels 15 so in
 

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.880
use that as a basis as kegels 15 so in
this case we compared dr. Nelson's

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:23.890
this case we compared dr. Nelson's
 

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.079
this case we compared dr. Nelson's
homepage over time to a couple of

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:25.089
homepage over time to a couple of
 

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.360
homepage over time to a couple of
different strategies so on the right you

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.370
different strategies so on the right you
 

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.040
different strategies so on the right you
can see the grid view which is a little

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.050
can see the grid view which is a little
 

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.170
can see the grid view which is a little
more informative than the cover flow

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.180
more informative than the cover flow
 

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.880
more informative than the cover flow
view which is not as pretty of course

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:32.890
view which is not as pretty of course
 

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.990

and this one to attract people to your

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000
and this one to attract people to your
 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.490
and this one to attract people to your
site versus the cover flow of you but it

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:35.500
site versus the cover flow of you but it
 

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.080
site versus the cover flow of you but it
allows you to see the summarization a

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.090
allows you to see the summarization a
 

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.570
allows you to see the summarization a
little better so see the one on the left

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:39.580
little better so see the one on the left
 

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.680

is the random strategy and despite

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:42.690
is the random strategy and despite
 

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.879
is the random strategy and despite
the randomness you still get a lot of

00:17:43.879 --> 00:17:43.889
the randomness you still get a lot of
 

00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:45.169
the randomness you still get a lot of
this very early mentos again these are

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179
this very early mentos again these are
 

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:46.940
this very early mentos again these are
temporarily sorted so you get the big

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:46.950
temporarily sorted so you get the big
 

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.669
temporarily sorted so you get the big
red page in the top left for the random

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679
red page in the top left for the random
 

00:17:49.679 --> 00:17:50.629
red page in the top left for the random
strategy which were just picked because

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:50.639
strategy which were just picked because
 

00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:52.730
strategy which were just picked because
of uniform randomness but in our

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740
of uniform randomness but in our
 

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.200
of uniform randomness but in our
strategy of a summarization you can see

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.210
strategy of a summarization you can see
 

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.600
strategy of a summarization you can see
that those very similar Mentos were not

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.610
that those very similar Mentos were not
 

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.710
that those very similar Mentos were not
included in summary because they were

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720
included in summary because they were
 

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.899
included in summary because they were
they did not pass the threshold to be

00:17:59.899 --> 00:17:59.909
they did not pass the threshold to be
 

00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:01.129
they did not pass the threshold to be
included so there's only one of those

00:18:01.129 --> 00:18:01.139
included so there's only one of those
 

00:18:01.139 --> 00:18:02.629
included so there's only one of those
because the page basically didn't change

00:18:02.629 --> 00:18:02.639
because the page basically didn't change
 

00:18:02.639 --> 00:18:04.249
because the page basically didn't change
I'm you can see some of the other Mentos

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:04.259
I'm you can see some of the other Mentos
 

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:07.159
I'm you can see some of the other Mentos
for example the one in the top row third

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:07.169
for example the one in the top row third
 

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:09.860
for example the one in the top row third
and fourth column there look very

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:09.870
and fourth column there look very
 

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.539
and fourth column there look very
similar but the somewhere on the page

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:11.549
similar but the somewhere on the page
 

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:13.070
similar but the somewhere on the page
there wasn't enough of a difference for

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080
there wasn't enough of a difference for
 

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.289
there wasn't enough of a difference for
Jack's be included a second one so maybe

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299
Jack's be included a second one so maybe
 

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:16.639
Jack's be included a second one so maybe
he was doing a little change on the

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:16.649
he was doing a little change on the
 

00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:18.320
he was doing a little change on the
footer or maybe some of the text content

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.330
footer or maybe some of the text content
 

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.879
footer or maybe some of the text content
that made it look different but you can

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:19.889
that made it look different but you can
 

00:18:19.889 --> 00:18:22.310
that made it look different but you can
see that some of the other ones nearby

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320
see that some of the other ones nearby
 

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.889
see that some of the other ones nearby
if you look a little closer you can see

00:18:24.889 --> 00:18:24.899
if you look a little closer you can see
 

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:28.600
if you look a little closer you can see
that each consecutive memento looks

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.610
that each consecutive memento looks
 

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.529
that each consecutive memento looks
slightly different than the last one if

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539
slightly different than the last one if
 

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:31.879
slightly different than the last one if
not drastically different versus the

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:31.889
not drastically different versus the
 

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:33.440
not drastically different versus the
previous one you see identical

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.450
previous one you see identical
 

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.600
previous one you see identical
consecutive mementos more frequently so

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:35.610
consecutive mementos more frequently so
 

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.310
consecutive mementos more frequently so
that's just for the random strategy so

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320
that's just for the random strategy so
 

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.930
that's just for the random strategy so
if you actually use use the interval

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940
if you actually use use the interval
 

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.149
if you actually use use the interval
shred you get a similar thing because he

00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159
shred you get a similar thing because he
 

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:43.570
shred you get a similar thing because he
kept that page over time you're getting

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:43.580
kept that page over time you're getting
 

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.759
kept that page over time you're getting
you're getting try the intervals every

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:46.769
you're getting try the intervals every
 

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:48.710
you're getting try the intervals every
every every case memento you're getting

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720
every every case memento you're getting
 

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.169
every every case memento you're getting
the same ones over and over again so

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179
the same ones over and over again so
 

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:52.730
the same ones over and over again so
ideally the interval and the temporal

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740
ideally the interval and the temporal
 

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.009
ideally the interval and the temporal
interval should should match up in the

00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:55.019
interval should should match up in the
 

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:57.320
interval should should match up in the
end so in the temporary neural you get

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.330
end so in the temporary neural you get
 

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.149
end so in the temporary neural you get
something very similar just basically

00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159
something very similar just basically
 

00:18:59.159 --> 00:19:00.560
something very similar just basically
because he had that same page for the

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.570
because he had that same page for the
 

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.720
because he had that same page for the
longest amount of time you get the same

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:02.730
longest amount of time you get the same
 

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.830
longest amount of time you get the same
screen shots over and over again so

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840
screen shots over and over again so
 

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.269
screen shots over and over again so
again these are very naive strategies

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:05.279
again these are very naive strategies
 

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:06.680
again these are very naive strategies
but because he had such a high

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.690
but because he had such a high
 

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.450
but because he had such a high
concentration you say mementos in there

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460
concentration you say mementos in there
 

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.869
concentration you say mementos in there
our method actually does not include

00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:11.879
our method actually does not include
 

00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:13.610
our method actually does not include
those in for good reason because they

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620
those in for good reason because they
 

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.619
those in for good reason because they
don't actually give you any information

00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:15.629
don't actually give you any information
 

00:19:15.629 --> 00:19:17.509
don't actually give you any information
about the badness of the page I've got

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:17.519
about the badness of the page I've got
 

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.710
about the badness of the page I've got
the asynchronous polling and you can see

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720
the asynchronous polling and you can see
 

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.879
the asynchronous polling and you can see
this on here Josh you've done this live

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:19.889
this on here Josh you've done this live
 

00:19:19.889 --> 00:19:21.619
this on here Josh you've done this live
so you can say it because I think

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:21.629
so you can say it because I think
 

00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:22.820
so you can say it because I think
they'll be more useful we got way back

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:22.830
they'll be more useful we got way back
 

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.110
they'll be more useful we got way back
integration so it looks like in here and

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120
integration so it looks like in here and
 

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.930
integration so it looks like in here and
that's fully customizable and how you

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940
that's fully customizable and how you
 

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.860
that's fully customizable and how you
would include it in the service

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:27.870
would include it in the service
 

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.930
would include it in the service
embedding as well as you can include it

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940
embedding as well as you can include it
 

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.399
embedding as well as you can include it
in page use an object or I frame from

there's actually a live service up where

00:19:36.139 --> 00:19:36.149
there's actually a live service up where
 

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:37.490
there's actually a live service up where
you can use it for you and if you just

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500
you can use it for you and if you just
 

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.019
you can use it for you and if you just
want to put in bed on your site and try

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:39.029
want to put in bed on your site and try
 

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:41.299
want to put in bed on your site and try
it and i'm going to try a very quick

this is the different visualizations you

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360
this is the different visualizations you
 

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.940
this is the different visualizations you
can go through here and again this is

she's at dr. instance so if you want to

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:50.309
she's at dr. instance so if you want to
 

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:51.950
she's at dr. instance so if you want to
run this on dr. you can we stood up to

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960
run this on dr. you can we stood up to
 

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.570
run this on dr. you can we stood up to
do that we have the grid view as well

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580
do that we have the grid view as well
 

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.890
do that we have the grid view as well
which is a different view you get them

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900
which is a different view you get them
 

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.720
which is a different view you get them
made a data by clicking on these and see

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:56.730
made a data by clicking on these and see
 

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.549
made a data by clicking on these and see
that sort of thing as well as we got a

00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559
that sort of thing as well as we got a
 

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:02.270
that sort of thing as well as we got a
time line display here where you can

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280
time line display here where you can
 

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.530
time line display here where you can
actually zoom in and get the

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:03.540
actually zoom in and get the
 

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.230
actually zoom in and get the
concentration of mentos over time so and

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240
concentration of mentos over time so and
 

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.980
concentration of mentos over time so and
these are supposed to be a little

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:06.990
these are supposed to be a little
 

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.630
these are supposed to be a little
thumbnails but something is broken in

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640
thumbnails but something is broken in
 

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.260
thumbnails but something is broken in
the code so yeah you can see doc Nelson

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.270
the code so yeah you can see doc Nelson
 

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.330
the code so yeah you can see doc Nelson
had a lot of pages around those red ones

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340
had a lot of pages around those red ones
 

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.510
had a lot of pages around those red ones
that you saw before were like 2003 or

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520
that you saw before were like 2003 or
 

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.650
that you saw before were like 2003 or
something like that and because of the

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660
something like that and because of the
 

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.850
something like that and because of the
high concentration she got a lot of red

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860
high concentration she got a lot of red
 

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.980
high concentration she got a lot of red
ones and the more naive strategy so with

you detect off topic pages in your

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:17.330
you detect off topic pages in your
 

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.020
you detect off topic pages in your
collections so we've all heard about

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.030
collections so we've all heard about
 

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.160
collections so we've all heard about

so they host these curated web

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:26.730
so they host these curated web
 

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.500
so they host these curated web
collections and so here's the user view

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:30.510
collections and so here's the user view
 

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.630
collections and so here's the user view
if you want to go and look at archive it

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640
if you want to go and look at archive it
 

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.410
if you want to go and look at archive it
and if you're a curator here's your view

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:36.420
and if you're a curator here's your view
 

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.070
and if you're a curator here's your view
so and we saw this with the start crawl

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080
so and we saw this with the start crawl
 

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.520
so and we saw this with the start crawl
now button got pressed and so what our

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:43.530
now button got pressed and so what our
 

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.400

kind that lets you do is you specified

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:46.410
kind that lets you do is you specified
 

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.340
kind that lets you do is you specified
your seed your eyes for your collection

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:49.350
your seed your eyes for your collection
 

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.120
your seed your eyes for your collection
and then you can specify how frequently

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.130
and then you can specify how frequently
 

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.090
and then you can specify how frequently
or how deep you want these crawled and

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100
or how deep you want these crawled and
 

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.790
or how deep you want these crawled and
then you know archive it goes off and

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:58.800
then you know archive it goes off and
 

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.919
then you know archive it goes off and
crawls and you know you can start these

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:00.929
crawls and you know you can start these
 

00:22:00.929 --> 00:22:01.430
crawls and you know you can start these
into that

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440
into that
 

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.259
into that
and five and come back ten years later

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:03.269
and five and come back ten years later
 

00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:04.999
and five and come back ten years later
and want to analyze it and there's

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:05.009
and want to analyze it and there's
 

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:08.409
and want to analyze it and there's
they're still data there but they

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:08.419
they're still data there but they
 

00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:11.090
they're still data there but they
archive it also gives you nice tools to

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100
archive it also gives you nice tools to
 

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.610
archive it also gives you nice tools to
be able to look and see what's in your

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620
be able to look and see what's in your
 

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.129
be able to look and see what's in your
collection when have you collected there

00:22:16.129 --> 00:22:16.139
collection when have you collected there
 

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:18.799
collection when have you collected there
are things here shown in this image on

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:18.809
are things here shown in this image on
 

00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:21.860
are things here shown in this image on
file type you can also get information

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:21.870
file type you can also get information
 

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.039
file type you can also get information
about when pages of 40 Ford but the

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:25.049
about when pages of 40 Ford but the
 

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:27.220
about when pages of 40 Ford but the
thing that we wanted to look at is the

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.230
thing that we wanted to look at is the
 

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.570
thing that we wanted to look at is the
aboutness of the page so when is the

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580
aboutness of the page so when is the
 

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.240
aboutness of the page so when is the
page going off-topic from that original

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.250
page going off-topic from that original
 

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.289
page going off-topic from that original
seed that you want it in your collection

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:35.299
seed that you want it in your collection
 

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:38.749
seed that you want it in your collection
so this is you know may basically aimed

00:22:38.749 --> 00:22:38.759
so this is you know may basically aimed
 

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:43.190
so this is you know may basically aimed
at curators in how to you know maybe

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200
at curators in how to you know maybe
 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.869
at curators in how to you know maybe
there are pages you want to take out of

00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:44.879
there are pages you want to take out of
 

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:46.779
there are pages you want to take out of
your collection because they aren't

00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:46.789
your collection because they aren't
 

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:48.590
your collection because they aren't
reinforcing where your collection is

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600
reinforcing where your collection is
 

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.100
reinforcing where your collection is
about so we all know that pages can

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.110
about so we all know that pages can
 

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.830
about so we all know that pages can
change through time they can have subtle

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840
change through time they can have subtle
 

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.480
change through time they can have subtle
changes but they can also just go off

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:56.490
changes but they can also just go off
 

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.940
changes but they can also just go off
topic and so this is a page from the

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:58.950
topic and so this is a page from the
 

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.269
topic and so this is a page from the
Egyptian revolution in politics site and

00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279
Egyptian revolution in politics site and
 

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.350
Egyptian revolution in politics site and
this is one of the presidential

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360
this is one of the presidential
 

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.210
this is one of the presidential
candidates of that time and later there

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220
candidates of that time and later there
 

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.259
candidates of that time and later there
was a database error and then yes mean

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:12.269
was a database error and then yes mean
 

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:14.060
was a database error and then yes mean
promises that this Arabic says there was

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.070
promises that this Arabic says there was
 

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.360
promises that this Arabic says there was
a financial problem then it came back on

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:17.370
a financial problem then it came back on
 

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.340
a financial problem then it came back on
topic they got everything fixed but it

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:19.350
topic they got everything fixed but it
 

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.639
topic they got everything fixed but it
had a site redesign then the site was

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:22.649
had a site redesign then the site was
 

00:23:22.649 --> 00:23:25.549
had a site redesign then the site was
hacked and currently the domain has

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559
hacked and currently the domain has
 

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:31.310
hacked and currently the domain has
expired so from this one page over sixty

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320
expired so from this one page over sixty
 

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.590
expired so from this one page over sixty
percent of the archived versions at

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600
percent of the archived versions at
 

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.810
percent of the archived versions at
archived it for this page are actually

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820
archived it for this page are actually
 

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.869
archived it for this page are actually
off topic now if you're a curator you

00:23:38.869 --> 00:23:38.879
off topic now if you're a curator you
 

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:41.090
off topic now if you're a curator you
may want to save the version where the

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100
may want to save the version where the
 

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.799
may want to save the version where the
page was hacked that might have some

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:42.809
page was hacked that might have some
 

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:45.769
page was hacked that might have some
historical value for you but you

00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:45.779
historical value for you but you
 

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:47.090
historical value for you but you
probably don't want the database error

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100
probably don't want the database error
 

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.529
probably don't want the database error
you probably don't want the financial

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539
you probably don't want the financial
 

00:23:48.539 --> 00:23:49.820
you probably don't want the financial
error and I'm sure you don't want the

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:49.830
error and I'm sure you don't want the
 

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.720
error and I'm sure you don't want the
domain has expired error so how do you

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:53.730
domain has expired error so how do you
 

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.940
domain has expired error so how do you
find these and you know this can be a

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:55.950
find these and you know this can be a
 

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:01.369
find these and you know this can be a
problem in your pages so social media

00:24:01.369 --> 00:24:01.379
problem in your pages so social media
 

00:24:01.379 --> 00:24:04.340
problem in your pages so social media
pages can also go off topic we found so

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:04.350
pages can also go off topic we found so
 

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.470
pages can also go off topic we found so
this is one from the Occupy collection

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480
this is one from the Occupy collection
 

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.529
this is one from the Occupy collection
and a little bit later it redirects just

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539
and a little bit later it redirects just
 

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:11.749
and a little bit later it redirects just
to facebook com so either the account

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:11.759
to facebook com so either the account
 

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.820

crawler grabs now is just the you know

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980
crawler grabs now is just the you know
 

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:27.620

facebook.com template so what do these

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:27.630
facebook.com template so what do these
 

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.830
facebook.com template so what do these
web pages look like over time so we've

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840
web pages look like over time so we've
 

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.930
web pages look like over time so we've
been introduced to this terminology

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940
been introduced to this terminology
 

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.210
been introduced to this terminology
before but just one more time so a time

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220
before but just one more time so a time
 

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.159
before but just one more time so a time
map is the list of a you are eyes

00:24:37.159 --> 00:24:37.169
map is the list of a you are eyes
 

00:24:37.169 --> 00:24:39.139
map is the list of a you are eyes
mementos and I'm going to use the the

00:24:39.139 --> 00:24:39.149
mementos and I'm going to use the the
 

00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:41.299
mementos and I'm going to use the the
memento and time at terminology here a

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:41.309
memento and time at terminology here a
 

00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:43.580
memento and time at terminology here a
lot so all the times that this page has

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:43.590
lot so all the times that this page has
 

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.370
lot so all the times that this page has
been captured and so when we were

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380
been captured and so when we were
 

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.879
been captured and so when we were
looking at how these time maps change we

00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:49.889
looking at how these time maps change we
 

00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:51.919
looking at how these time maps change we
identified it five different classes in

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:51.929
identified it five different classes in
 

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:54.619
identified it five different classes in
terms of is it on topic or is it off

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:54.629
terms of is it on topic or is it off
 

00:24:54.629 --> 00:24:58.700
terms of is it on topic or is it off
topic we have always on stem function on

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:58.710
topic we have always on stem function on
 

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.889
topic we have always on stem function on
where it starts on topic and then goes

00:25:00.889 --> 00:25:00.899
where it starts on topic and then goes
 

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:03.710
where it starts on topic and then goes
off topic and remains off topic step

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720
off topic and remains off topic step
 

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.110
off topic and remains off topic step
function off where it starts off topic

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120
function off where it starts off topic
 

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.200
function off where it starts off topic
and then becomes on topic oscillating

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.210
and then becomes on topic oscillating
 

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.700
and then becomes on topic oscillating
like the example I showed where it goes

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:10.710
like the example I showed where it goes
 

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.060
like the example I showed where it goes
on and off and then always off so yes

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.070
on and off and then always off so yes
 

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.789
on and off and then always off so yes
there are some pages that this de seed

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799
there are some pages that this de seed
 

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.399
there are some pages that this de seed
was just bad so it never actually was on

00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:19.409
was just bad so it never actually was on
 

00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:21.889
was just bad so it never actually was on
topic and we have real world examples of

00:25:21.889 --> 00:25:21.899
topic and we have real world examples of
 

00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:26.210
topic and we have real world examples of
all of these here on the slide so just a

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220
all of these here on the slide so just a
 

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.570
all of these here on the slide so just a
couple quick examples so the step

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580
couple quick examples so the step
 

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.210
couple quick examples so the step
function on this is about the Egyptian

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220
function on this is about the Egyptian
 

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.610
function on this is about the Egyptian
revolution and then at some point the

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620
revolution and then at some point the
 

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.009
revolution and then at some point the
domain registration is lost and actually

00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:37.019
domain registration is lost and actually
 

00:25:37.019 --> 00:25:38.990
domain registration is lost and actually
if you see the number of the Mintos and

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000
if you see the number of the Mintos and
 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.879
if you see the number of the Mintos and
the red boxes are greater than the

00:25:40.879 --> 00:25:40.889
the red boxes are greater than the
 

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:43.369
the red boxes are greater than the
number in the green boxes so you have a

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:43.379
number in the green boxes so you have a
 

00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:46.009
number in the green boxes so you have a
lot of mementos here that are not going

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:46.019
lot of mementos here that are not going
 

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:50.840
lot of mementos here that are not going
to be on topic for you another case we

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:50.850
to be on topic for you another case we
 

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.899
to be on topic for you another case we
have is an oscillating exciting so we

00:25:53.899 --> 00:25:53.909
have is an oscillating exciting so we
 

00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:55.730
have is an oscillating exciting so we
saw the one previously where there were

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740
saw the one previously where there were
 

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.700
saw the one previously where there were
errors in the site but there are also

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:58.710
errors in the site but there are also
 

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.490
errors in the site but there are also
just topic changes so this is the time

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500
just topic changes so this is the time
 

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.480
just topic changes so this is the time
map from the BBC's Middle East page and

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.490
map from the BBC's Middle East page and
 

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.350
map from the BBC's Middle East page and
this is from the Egyptian revolution

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360
this is from the Egyptian revolution
 

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.330
this is from the Egyptian revolution
collection so maybe the curator only

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340
collection so maybe the curator only
 

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.730
collection so maybe the curator only
wants those BBC pages that show the

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740
wants those BBC pages that show the
 

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.289
wants those BBC pages that show the
Egyptian revolution on the front page

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299
Egyptian revolution on the front page
 

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:17.810
Egyptian revolution on the front page
this page actually talks about all sorts

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820
this page actually talks about all sorts
 

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.610
this page actually talks about all sorts
of stuff so we've identified some places

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620
of stuff so we've identified some places
 

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.159
of stuff so we've identified some places
where it was about Iraq or Syria or

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:22.169
where it was about Iraq or Syria or
 

00:26:22.169 --> 00:26:24.619
where it was about Iraq or Syria or
Palestine but then it came back and

00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:24.629
Palestine but then it came back and
 

00:26:24.629 --> 00:26:26.299
Palestine but then it came back and
there were certain places where it was

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:26.309
there were certain places where it was
 

00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:27.570
there were certain places where it was
actually about Egypt

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:27.580
actually about Egypt
 

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.300
actually about Egypt
so the curator may want to call those

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:30.310
so the curator may want to call those
 

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.810
so the curator may want to call those
that are not necess even though there's

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:33.820
that are not necess even though there's
 

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.580
that are not necess even though there's
nothing wrong with the page itself so

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:38.590
nothing wrong with the page itself so
 

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.910
nothing wrong with the page itself so
what we found is we looked at I think

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:41.920
what we found is we looked at I think
 

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.060
what we found is we looked at I think
this is from about 15,000 mementos from

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.070
this is from about 15,000 mementos from
 

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.790
this is from about 15,000 mementos from
three collections that we looked at and

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:47.800
three collections that we looked at and
 

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.310
three collections that we looked at and
we found that most time maps are always

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320
we found that most time maps are always
 

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.160
we found that most time maps are always
on so that's good so there there there

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.170
on so that's good so there there there
 

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.070
on so that's good so there there there
but there's a pretty significant number

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080
but there's a pretty significant number
 

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.280
but there's a pretty significant number
where these off topic pages sneak in so

00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.290
where these off topic pages sneak in so
 

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.430
where these off topic pages sneak in so
eight to eleven percent or step function

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440
eight to eleven percent or step function
 

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.770
eight to eleven percent or step function
on so something has happened to the page

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:04.780
on so something has happened to the page
 

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.550
on so something has happened to the page
and you have a you know generous set of

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:08.560
and you have a you know generous set of
 

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.500
and you have a you know generous set of
off-topic things and if that page is

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:10.510
off-topic things and if that page is
 

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.270
off-topic things and if that page is
still being crawled you're continually

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.280
still being crawled you're continually
 

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.790
still being crawled you're continually
adding to the number of off topic

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:14.800
adding to the number of off topic
 

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.320
adding to the number of off topic
mementos a few step function off and

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:19.330
mementos a few step function off and
 

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.660
mementos a few step function off and
then also a pretty significant number of

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:21.670
then also a pretty significant number of
 

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.030
then also a pretty significant number of
these oscillating ones and these

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.040
these oscillating ones and these
 

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.560
these oscillating ones and these
oscillating ones are going to be

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:25.570
oscillating ones are going to be
 

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.160
oscillating ones are going to be
difficult to find by hand because you

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.170
difficult to find by hand because you
 

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.050
difficult to find by hand because you
have to go in and look at every single

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:31.060
have to go in and look at every single
 

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.080
have to go in and look at every single
memento to figure out what's going on so

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.090
memento to figure out what's going on so
 

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.960
memento to figure out what's going on so
this is what our tool is here to help

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:36.970
this is what our tool is here to help
 

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.630
this is what our tool is here to help
you identify and note that you know a

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640
you identify and note that you know a
 

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.030
you identify and note that you know a
very small percentage just a couple we

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:42.040
very small percentage just a couple we
 

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:47.130
very small percentage just a couple we
found that we're always off so what

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.140
found that we're always off so what
 

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.900
found that we're always off so what
types of different ways can we detect

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:48.910
types of different ways can we detect
 

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.650
types of different ways can we detect
these off topic pages so the first thing

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:52.660
these off topic pages so the first thing
 

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.540
these off topic pages so the first thing
we need to do is we need to go from an

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:54.550
we need to do is we need to go from an
 

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.670
we need to do is we need to go from an
archive at collection to terms because

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:56.680
archive at collection to terms because
 

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.110
archive at collection to terms because
we're going to use the terms in the

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.120
we're going to use the terms in the
 

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.570
we're going to use the terms in the
webpage to figure out if the memento is

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:00.580
webpage to figure out if the memento is
 

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.450
webpage to figure out if the memento is
on topic or off topic so we grabbed the

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:03.460
on topic or off topic so we grabbed the
 

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.250
on topic or off topic so we grabbed the
seed you our eyes from the front end of

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.260
seed you our eyes from the front end of
 

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.460
seed you our eyes from the front end of
our private and we get the time map of

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:08.470
our private and we get the time map of
 

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.010
our private and we get the time map of
the seed your eyes from the CDX well now

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:11.020
the seed your eyes from the CDX well now
 

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.380
the seed your eyes from the CDX well now
I note that we have a we have a

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.390
I note that we have a we have a
 

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.870
I note that we have a we have a
essentially a mirror of archived it from

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880
essentially a mirror of archived it from
 

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.000
essentially a mirror of archived it from
about two thousand three and so we're

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.010
about two thousand three and so we're
 

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.560
about two thousand three and so we're
doing our processing for these

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:22.570
doing our processing for these
 

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.250
doing our processing for these
experiments on our local copy so then

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.260
experiments on our local copy so then
 

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.660
experiments on our local copy so then
actually you get the time maps we get

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:27.670
actually you get the time maps we get
 

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.300
actually you get the time maps we get
the HTML from the work files use the

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:30.310
the HTML from the work files use the
 

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.610
the HTML from the work files use the
boiler pipe library to extract the text

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:32.620
boiler pipe library to extract the text
 

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.700
boiler pipe library to extract the text
and then we do you know your typical

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:34.710
and then we do you know your typical
 

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.030
and then we do you know your typical
term analysis

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.040
term analysis
 

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.700
term analysis
a couple libraries and stemming and stop

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:41.710
a couple libraries and stemming and stop
 

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.450
a couple libraries and stemming and stop
word removal we looked at six different

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:45.460
word removal we looked at six different
 

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.910
word removal we looked at six different
similarity metrics so we looked at once

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:47.920
similarity metrics so we looked at once
 

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.090
similarity metrics so we looked at once
based on textual content we did the TF

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.100
based on textual content we did the TF
 

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.750
based on textual content we did the TF
IDF and did cosine similarity of that we

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760
IDF and did cosine similarity of that we
 

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.100
IDF and did cosine similarity of that we
looked at the intersection of the 20

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
looked at the intersection of the 20
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.580
looked at the intersection of the 20
most frequent terms Jaccard similarity

00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:58.590
most frequent terms Jaccard similarity
 

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.560
most frequent terms Jaccard similarity
coefficient then we also looked at a

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:01.570
coefficient then we also looked at a
 

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.310
coefficient then we also looked at a
semantics based version basically with

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320
semantics based version basically with
 

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.290
semantics based version basically with
the eye toward something like that BBC

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:07.300
the eye toward something like that BBC
 

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.220
the eye toward something like that BBC
site where you know it's not going down

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:10.230
site where you know it's not going down
 

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:15.120
site where you know it's not going down
but the topic itself has has changed and

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.130
but the topic itself has has changed and
 

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.870
but the topic itself has has changed and
then also a couple of structural

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880
then also a couple of structural
 

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.770
then also a couple of structural
differences and I'll see you a couple

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:19.780
differences and I'll see you a couple
 

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.730
differences and I'll see you a couple
examples here so for textual content we

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:23.740
examples here so for textual content we
 

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.820
examples here so for textual content we
had the these three methods and so these

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:26.830
had the these three methods and so these
 

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.430
had the these three methods and so these
are two of the pages from the

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440
are two of the pages from the
 

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.140
are two of the pages from the
presidential candidate I showed before

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.150
presidential candidate I showed before
 

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.840
presidential candidate I showed before
and we're always comparing to that first

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:33.850
and we're always comparing to that first
 

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.980
and we're always comparing to that first
memento so we compare you know a

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:37.990
memento so we compare you know a
 

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.540
memento so we compare you know a
candidate mementos of the first one then

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:39.550
candidate mementos of the first one then
 

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.210
candidate mementos of the first one then
towed this one the similarity between

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.220
towed this one the similarity between
 

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.040
towed this one the similarity between
these is pretty high that we have

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:44.050
these is pretty high that we have
 

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.300
these is pretty high that we have
different values for the different

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:45.310
different values for the different
 

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.360
different values for the different
methods when we go to the one where the

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.370
methods when we go to the one where the
 

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.910
methods when we go to the one where the
domains expired now we do the Texan

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:50.920
domains expired now we do the Texan
 

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.790
domains expired now we do the Texan
mullerian at 0 for all of them so that's

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:53.800
mullerian at 0 for all of them so that's
 

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.180
mullerian at 0 for all of them so that's
kind of an obvious candidate the other

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.190
kind of an obvious candidate the other
 

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.140
kind of an obvious candidate the other
thing we wanted to look at was on pages

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.150
thing we wanted to look at was on pages
 

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.020
thing we wanted to look at was on pages
like for example the BBC you may have

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.030
like for example the BBC you may have
 

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.420
like for example the BBC you may have
pages that are on topic but they don't

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.430
pages that are on topic but they don't
 

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.350
pages that are on topic but they don't
exactly share the top terms so if you

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360
exactly share the top terms so if you
 

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.750
exactly share the top terms so if you
had a page it had Tahrir Egypt and army

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:12.760
had a page it had Tahrir Egypt and army
 

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.240
had a page it had Tahrir Egypt and army
and a page that had Cairo Morsi and

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.250
and a page that had Cairo Morsi and
 

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.790
and a page that had Cairo Morsi and
protests you and I would realize that

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:17.800
protests you and I would realize that
 

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.550
protests you and I would realize that
those are still on the same topic but we

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:20.560
those are still on the same topic but we
 

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.350
those are still on the same topic but we
needed to find a way so that the

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360
needed to find a way so that the
 

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.810
needed to find a way so that the
algorithm could realize that those were

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:24.820
algorithm could realize that those were
 

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.960
algorithm could realize that those were
the same topic so what we did is we

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:27.970
the same topic so what we did is we
 

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.450
the same topic so what we did is we
submitted these terms to the being

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:30.460
submitted these terms to the being
 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.300
submitted these terms to the being
search engine API and ground the

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.310
search engine API and ground the
 

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.000
search engine API and ground the
snippets that resulted and then we took

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.010
snippets that resulted and then we took
 

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.830
snippets that resulted and then we took
that snippet test and did the

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840
that snippet test and did the
 

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.010
that snippet test and did the
tokenization in terms and then reran a

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:41.020
tokenization in terms and then reran a
 

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.070
tokenization in terms and then reran a
similarity measure and so here we're

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080
similarity measure and so here we're
 

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.830
similarity measure and so here we're
able to get point 7 similarity between

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840
able to get point 7 similarity between
 

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.900
able to get point 7 similarity between
these two pages

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:49.910
 

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.750
and then for structural methods we

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760
and then for structural methods we
 

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.150
and then for structural methods we
wanted to see is there a really cheap

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:55.160
wanted to see is there a really cheap
 

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.570
wanted to see is there a really cheap
way to do this so for content length we

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:58.580
way to do this so for content length we
 

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.990
way to do this so for content length we
can just look at the HTTP headers to see

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000
can just look at the HTTP headers to see
 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.210
can just look at the HTTP headers to see
how many bytes have changed and then

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:04.220
how many bytes have changed and then
 

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.740
how many bytes have changed and then
it's also pretty easy to count the

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:05.750
it's also pretty easy to count the
 

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.590
it's also pretty easy to count the
number of words so we have the example

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:08.600
number of words so we have the example
 

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.720
number of words so we have the example
here we started out with a hundred words

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:10.730
here we started out with a hundred words
 

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.030
here we started out with a hundred words
and then went to 109 even though the

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.040
and then went to 109 even though the
 

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.640
and then went to 109 even though the
page changed dramatically we're just

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:15.650
page changed dramatically we're just
 

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.410
page changed dramatically we're just
looking at you know how many words were

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:17.420
looking at you know how many words were
 

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.450
looking at you know how many words were
there and so this was a nine percent

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:19.460
there and so this was a nine percent
 

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.290
there and so this was a nine percent
increase in the number of words if we go

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.300
increase in the number of words if we go
 

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.300
increase in the number of words if we go
here to where you get an error page the

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:25.310
here to where you get an error page the
 

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.140
here to where you get an error page the
number of words is going to

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.150
number of words is going to
 

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.030
number of words is going to
significantly decrease so it went down

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.040
significantly decrease so it went down
 

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.450
significantly decrease so it went down
to five words and that's a ninety-five

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.460
to five words and that's a ninety-five
 

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.540
to five words and that's a ninety-five
percent decrease so negative 0 point 95

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:34.550
percent decrease so negative 0 point 95
 

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:39.820
percent decrease so negative 0 point 95
in our example so we built a gold

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:39.830
in our example so we built a gold
 

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.060
in our example so we built a gold
standard data set to evaluate these six

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.070
standard data set to evaluate these six
 

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.030
standard data set to evaluate these six
methods and we went through and we

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.040
methods and we went through and we
 

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.540
methods and we went through and we
picked three archival collections occupy

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:49.550
picked three archival collections occupy
 

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.940
picked three archival collections occupy
Egyptian revolution in politics and the

collection these are all pretty large

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.390
collection these are all pretty large
 

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.810
collection these are all pretty large
collections so we sample seed you our

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:58.820
collections so we sample seed you our
 

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.820
collections so we sample seed you our
eyes from them and then we sample the

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:00.830
eyes from them and then we sample the
 

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.830
eyes from them and then we sample the
mementos from those but we still ended

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840
mementos from those but we still ended
 

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.410
mementos from those but we still ended
up with 15,000 mementos that we manually

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:05.420
up with 15,000 mementos that we manually
 

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.600
up with 15,000 mementos that we manually
labeled or i should say yes mean

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:07.610
labeled or i should say yes mean
 

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:12.220
labeled or i should say yes mean
manually labeled and we have these

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.230
manually labeled and we have these
 

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.890
manually labeled and we have these
manually labeled sets if any of you are

you can email us and we'd be happy to

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.150
you can email us and we'd be happy to
 

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.090
you can email us and we'd be happy to
share that with you but right now the

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.100
share that with you but right now the
 

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.700
share that with you but right now the
format we have is just a text format and

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:24.710
format we have is just a text format and
 

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.790

label one means it's on topic label 0

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:27.800
label one means it's on topic label 0
 

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.430
label one means it's on topic label 0
means it's off topic in our future work

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440
means it's off topic in our future work
 

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.440
means it's off topic in our future work
we want to make this be kind of an

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:32.450
we want to make this be kind of an
 

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.140
we want to make this be kind of an
annotated or extended time out format so

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.150
annotated or extended time out format so
 

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.490
annotated or extended time out format so
it's a bit more machine readable so we

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:39.500
it's a bit more machine readable so we
 

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.920
it's a bit more machine readable so we
evaluated these six methods at 21

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:41.930
evaluated these six methods at 21
 

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.100
evaluated these six methods at 21
different thresholds from 0 to 1 and

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:45.110
different thresholds from 0 to 1 and
 

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.290
different thresholds from 0 to 1 and
like I said before we assume the first

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:47.300
like I said before we assume the first
 

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.560
like I said before we assume the first
memento was on topic we also combined

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:50.570
memento was on topic we also combined
 

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:54.310
memento was on topic we also combined
two methods using or to find the best

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320
two methods using or to find the best
 

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.710
two methods using or to find the best
combination method that gave us 15

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720
combination method that gave us 15
 

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.960
combination method that gave us 15
different test combinations and then

00:32:59.960 --> 00:32:59.970
different test combinations and then
 

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.150
different test combinations and then
average the results at each threshold

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.160
average the results at each threshold
 

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.800
average the results at each threshold
over the three test collections we

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:06.810
over the three test collections we
 

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.810
over the three test collections we
looked at five different metrics here

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820
looked at five different metrics here
 

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.810
looked at five different metrics here
false positives false negatives yes I

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820
false positives false negatives yes I
 

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.970
false positives false negatives yes I
always forget which is which this is a

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980
always forget which is which this is a
 

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.690
always forget which is which this is a
very helpful image in our case false

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:17.700
very helpful image in our case false
 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.000
very helpful image in our case false
positives or on topics that are labeled

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.010
positives or on topics that are labeled
 

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.030
positives or on topics that are labeled
as off-topic false negatives are off

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.040
as off-topic false negatives are off
 

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.670
as off-topic false negatives are off
topics labeled as on topics and so then

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:25.680
topics labeled as on topics and so then
 

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.640
topics labeled as on topics and so then
we also looked at accuracy f1 score in

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:28.650
we also looked at accuracy f1 score in
 

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.850
we also looked at accuracy f1 score in
the AUC the area are under the ROC curve

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860
the AUC the area are under the ROC curve
 

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.580
the AUC the area are under the ROC curve
and that's looking at the false positive

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:34.590
and that's looking at the false positive
 

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.400
and that's looking at the false positive
rate versus the true positive rate and

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:37.410
rate versus the true positive rate and
 

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:42.410
rate versus the true positive rate and
basically higher is better so what we

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:42.420
basically higher is better so what we
 

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.530
basically higher is better so what we
found is that cosine similarity

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:44.540
found is that cosine similarity
 

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.830
found is that cosine similarity
performed really well for the the best

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840
performed really well for the the best
 

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.360
performed really well for the the best
single method if you're only going to

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:50.370
single method if you're only going to
 

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.180
single method if you're only going to
use one we found for these collections

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:53.190
use one we found for these collections
 

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.810
use one we found for these collections
cosine with a threshold of point 15 so

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820
cosine with a threshold of point 15 so
 

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.820
cosine with a threshold of point 15 so
if the pages had a point 15 similarity

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:01.830
if the pages had a point 15 similarity
 

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.280
if the pages had a point 15 similarity
or higher we said these are on-topic if

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:04.290
or higher we said these are on-topic if
 

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.070
or higher we said these are on-topic if
it's points15 similarity or lower these

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080
it's points15 similarity or lower these
 

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.370
it's points15 similarity or lower these
are probably off topic and since we

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:10.380
are probably off topic and since we
 

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.440
are probably off topic and since we
manually label these we can compute the

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:12.450
manually label these we can compute the
 

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:14.720
manually label these we can compute the
false positives and the false negatives

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:14.730
false positives and the false negatives
 

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.160
false positives and the false negatives
and we ended up with a AUC score of 0

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:19.170
and we ended up with a AUC score of 0
 

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.950
and we ended up with a AUC score of 0
point nine six one these are sorted by

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960
point nine six one these are sorted by
 

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.650
point nine six one these are sorted by
the f1 score and so we got on pretty

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:24.660
the f1 score and so we got on pretty
 

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.750
the f1 score and so we got on pretty
high measures for all of these when we

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760
high measures for all of these when we
 

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.770
high measures for all of these when we
combined two methods cosine combined

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780
combined two methods cosine combined
 

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.400
combined two methods cosine combined
with word count worked out as the best

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:34.410
with word count worked out as the best
 

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.860
with word count worked out as the best
overall method the nice thing about this

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:36.870
overall method the nice thing about this
 

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.930
overall method the nice thing about this
one is that again word count is really

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940
one is that again word count is really
 

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.880
one is that again word count is really
easy right once we've done all the stuff

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:40.890
easy right once we've done all the stuff
 

00:34:40.890 --> 00:34:42.500
easy right once we've done all the stuff
to be able to compute cosine similarity

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:42.510
to be able to compute cosine similarity
 

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.960
to be able to compute cosine similarity
we essentially just have to count the

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:44.970
we essentially just have to count the
 

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.820
we essentially just have to count the
words and so we can combine those

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:46.830
words and so we can combine those
 

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.050
words and so we can combine those
relatively cheaply so then the next

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060
relatively cheaply so then the next
 

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.600
relatively cheaply so then the next
thing we wanted to do was let's test out

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:53.610
thing we wanted to do was let's test out
 

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.600
thing we wanted to do was let's test out
this cosine word count method and so

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:56.610
this cosine word count method and so
 

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.340
this cosine word count method and so
we're going to look at other archive it

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:58.350
we're going to look at other archive it
 

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:02.270
we're going to look at other archive it
collections so we picked 11 archive at

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280
collections so we picked 11 archive at
 

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.300
collections so we picked 11 archive at
collections and they were a range

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:05.310
collections and they were a range
 

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.070
collections and they were a range
governmental event-based theme-based

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080
governmental event-based theme-based
 

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.890
governmental event-based theme-based
they had time spans of one week to seven

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900
they had time spans of one week to seven
 

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.390
they had time spans of one week to seven
years

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400
years
 

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.099
years
some small and some really large and so

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:16.109
some small and some really large and so
 

00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:18.140
some small and some really large and so
what we what we have is we ended up with

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.150
what we what we have is we ended up with
 

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.420
what we what we have is we ended up with
an average precision of point 92 on

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:20.430
an average precision of point 92 on
 

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.089
an average precision of point 92 on
these 11 archive at collections and and

00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099
these 11 archive at collections and and
 

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:25.880
these 11 archive at collections and and
I'll just break this down here with the

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:25.890
I'll just break this down here with the
 

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.279
I'll just break this down here with the
with the pointer these in this top

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:28.289
with the pointer these in this top
 

00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:31.579
with the pointer these in this top
section actually had a precision of one

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:31.589
section actually had a precision of one
 

00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:35.620
section actually had a precision of one
so we detected these number of off-topic

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:35.630
so we detected these number of off-topic
 

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.900
so we detected these number of off-topic
mementos and we manually looked at all

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:38.910
mementos and we manually looked at all
 

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.630
mementos and we manually looked at all
of those and we confirm that though yes

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640
of those and we confirm that though yes
 

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.430
of those and we confirm that though yes
those were all off topics so that's 0

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440
those were all off topics so that's 0
 

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.700
those were all off topics so that's 0
false positives we cannot detect the

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:46.710
false positives we cannot detect the
 

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.440
false positives we cannot detect the
false negatives because we didn't look

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.450
false negatives because we didn't look
 

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.440
false negatives because we didn't look
at every single one of these thousands

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:51.450
at every single one of these thousands
 

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.140
at every single one of these thousands
of mementos but at least this gives you

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.150
of mementos but at least this gives you
 

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.500
of mementos but at least this gives you
a starting point and then down here at

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:57.510
a starting point and then down here at
 

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.339
a starting point and then down here at
the bottom our algorithm detected no

00:36:00.339 --> 00:36:00.349
the bottom our algorithm detected no
 

00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:04.309
the bottom our algorithm detected no
off-topic mementos which you know we

00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319
off-topic mementos which you know we
 

00:36:04.319 --> 00:36:07.519
off-topic mementos which you know we
hope is good right and then the ones in

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:07.529
hope is good right and then the ones in
 

00:36:07.529 --> 00:36:10.370
hope is good right and then the ones in
the middle there were several off-topic

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380
the middle there were several off-topic
 

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.910
the middle there were several off-topic
mementos and we did identify a few false

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920
mementos and we did identify a few false
 

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.549
mementos and we did identify a few false
positives here another thing I want to

00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:16.559
positives here another thing I want to
 

00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:18.769
positives here another thing I want to
mention is I have in this table the

00:36:18.769 --> 00:36:18.779
mention is I have in this table the
 

00:36:18.779 --> 00:36:21.049
mention is I have in this table the
affected you are I are so the affected

00:36:21.049 --> 00:36:21.059
affected you are I are so the affected
 

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:23.299
affected you are I are so the affected
seeds because you could have one bad

00:36:23.299 --> 00:36:23.309
seeds because you could have one bad
 

00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:25.099
seeds because you could have one bad
seed right that gives you lots of

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:25.109
seed right that gives you lots of
 

00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:27.319
seed right that gives you lots of
off-topic mementos and so we wanted to

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:27.329
off-topic mementos and so we wanted to
 

00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:29.990
off-topic mementos and so we wanted to
look at how widespread are these

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000
look at how widespread are these
 

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.059
look at how widespread are these
off-topic mementos in the collections so

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:35.069
off-topic mementos in the collections so
 

00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:37.670
off-topic mementos in the collections so
just to summarize kind of what we did

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680
just to summarize kind of what we did
 

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.890
just to summarize kind of what we did
for this study we looked at these six

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900
for this study we looked at these six
 

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.529
for this study we looked at these six
methods to look at similarity between

00:36:42.529 --> 00:36:42.539
methods to look at similarity between
 

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:45.680
methods to look at similarity between
mementos and a time map tested them on a

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:45.690
mementos and a time map tested them on a
 

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.630
mementos and a time map tested them on a
gold standard data set from three or

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640
gold standard data set from three or
 

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.880
gold standard data set from three or
kvick collections and then evaluated the

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:49.890
kvick collections and then evaluated the
 

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.670
kvick collections and then evaluated the
best approach on 11 diverse or kyvich

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680
best approach on 11 diverse or kyvich
 

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.640
best approach on 11 diverse or kyvich
collections and so we found that

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:55.650
collections and so we found that
 

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.559
collections and so we found that
combining cosine similarity at threshold

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:57.569
combining cosine similarity at threshold
 

00:36:57.569 --> 00:37:00.680
combining cosine similarity at threshold
point 10 and change in size using word

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:00.690
point 10 and change in size using word
 

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.809
point 10 and change in size using word
count at threshold negative 0 point

00:37:02.809 --> 00:37:02.819
count at threshold negative 0 point
 

00:37:02.819 --> 00:37:04.720
count at threshold negative 0 point
eight five gives the best performance

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:04.730
eight five gives the best performance
 

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.279
eight five gives the best performance
and so again the change in size using

00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:07.289
and so again the change in size using
 

00:37:07.289 --> 00:37:09.559
and so again the change in size using
word count this threshold means that if

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:09.569
word count this threshold means that if
 

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:11.750
word count this threshold means that if
between the first memento and your

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760
between the first memento and your
 

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.180
between the first memento and your
candidate memento the candidate memento

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:14.190
candidate memento the candidate memento
 

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.519
candidate memento the candidate memento
the word count decreased by more than

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:16.529
the word count decreased by more than
 

00:37:16.529 --> 00:37:18.829
the word count decreased by more than
eighty-five percent then it's likely off

00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839
eighty-five percent then it's likely off
 

00:37:18.839 --> 00:37:20.580
eighty-five percent then it's likely off
topic

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:20.590
topic
 

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.060
topic
and then we got point 9 to average

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.070
and then we got point 9 to average
 

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.280
and then we got point 9 to average
precision on these 11 archive at

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:26.290
precision on these 11 archive at
 

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.430
precision on these 11 archive at
collections so we built a tool so you

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440
collections so we built a tool so you
 

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.730
collections so we built a tool so you
can use this so we have a pet Python

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:32.740
can use this so we have a pet Python
 

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.270
can use this so we have a pet Python
command-line tool it right now just does

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280
command-line tool it right now just does
 

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.880
command-line tool it right now just does
cosine similarity and it uses our best

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:38.890
cosine similarity and it uses our best
 

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.850
cosine similarity and it uses our best
default threshold at point 15 for that

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:41.860
default threshold at point 15 for that
 

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.270
default threshold at point 15 for that
and it all operates on live time map so

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280
and it all operates on live time map so
 

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.250
and it all operates on live time map so
we'll go to archive it and actually grab

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:47.260
we'll go to archive it and actually grab
 

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.530
we'll go to archive it and actually grab
the time map and it's available on

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:49.540
the time map and it's available on
 

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.010
the time map and it's available on
github here's an example with the

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.020
github here's an example with the

github here's an example with the
Maryland State document collection you

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320
Maryland State document collection you
 

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.570
Maryland State document collection you
can actually just specify the archive it

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:00.580
can actually just specify the archive it
 

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.090
can actually just specify the archive it
collection ID here and then the

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.100
collection ID here and then the
 

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.860
collection ID here and then the
threshold you can change it if you would

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:04.870
threshold you can change it if you would
 

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.590

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:07.600
like and it goes and grabs the seed list
 

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.500
like and it goes and grabs the seed list
and downloads the time maps and

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:10.510
and downloads the time maps and
 

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.950
and downloads the time maps and
downloads the mementos and then we'll

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960
downloads the mementos and then we'll
 

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.900
downloads the mementos and then we'll
print out for those that it thinks are

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:15.910
print out for those that it thinks are
 

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.600
print out for those that it thinks are

maryland state docs have you noticed in

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:25.390
maryland state docs have you noticed in
 

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.050
maryland state docs have you noticed in
our evaluation we said it had zero

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.060
our evaluation we said it had zero
 

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.190
our evaluation we said it had zero
off-topic mementos but this test was run

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200
off-topic mementos but this test was run
 

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.590
off-topic mementos but this test was run
in late 2013 and 2014 which is after the

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:37.600
in late 2013 and 2014 which is after the
 

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.860
in late 2013 and 2014 which is after the
data set that we have local to ODU so

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:40.870
data set that we have local to ODU so
 

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.810
data set that we have local to ODU so
there are new off topic mementos in that

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:42.820
there are new off topic mementos in that
 

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.040
there are new off topic mementos in that
collection the other thing will we can

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.050
collection the other thing will we can
 

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.750

allow with this tool is that you can

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760
allow with this tool is that you can
 

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.660
allow with this tool is that you can
pick a single time map and detect off

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:51.670
pick a single time map and detect off
 

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.780
pick a single time map and detect off
topic pages so then this alleged allows

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:54.790
topic pages so then this alleged allows
 

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.690
topic pages so then this alleged allows
you to look at time maps not necessarily

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:57.700
you to look at time maps not necessarily
 

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.030
you to look at time maps not necessarily
in archive it so this will be any time

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.040
in archive it so this will be any time
 

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.490
in archive it so this will be any time
map that's so way back capable this

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:02.500
map that's so way back capable this
 

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.770
map that's so way back capable this
should work for and so it downloads

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:04.780
should work for and so it downloads
 

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.750
should work for and so it downloads
these and then prints out the the

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760
these and then prints out the the
 

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.330
these and then prints out the the
similarity and the URI and so just to

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:11.340
similarity and the URI and so just to
 

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.460
similarity and the URI and so just to
state again we don't remove anything we

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.470
state again we don't remove anything we
 

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.140
state again we don't remove anything we
don't touch your collections we are just

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.150
don't touch your collections we are just
 

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.840
don't touch your collections we are just
offering a list of potential things you

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:18.850
offering a list of potential things you
 

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.780
offering a list of potential things you
might want to look at if you want to

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:21.790
might want to look at if you want to
 

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.740
might want to look at if you want to
kind of co your your collection so we're

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:25.750
kind of co your your collection so we're
 

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.110
kind of co your your collection so we're
continuing to work on this we're going

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.120
continuing to work on this we're going
 

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.690
continuing to work on this we're going
to add some enhancements to our tool

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:30.700
to add some enhancements to our tool
 

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.080
to add some enhancements to our tool
we're going to add

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.090
we're going to add
 

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.820
we're going to add
similarity methods word count will be

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:33.830
similarity methods word count will be
 

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.250
similarity methods word count will be
the first one we add the other thing we

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:36.260
the first one we add the other thing we
 

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.800
the first one we add the other thing we
want to allow is for you to be able to

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:38.810
want to allow is for you to be able to
 

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.110
want to allow is for you to be able to
run this on your local CDX and work

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.120
run this on your local CDX and work
 

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.270
run this on your local CDX and work

repository we also want to look at what

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:47.990
repository we also want to look at what
 

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.270
repository we also want to look at what
are the characteristics of the

are the characteristics of the
 

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.250
are the characteristics of the
collections and the time maps that

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:51.260
collections and the time maps that
 

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.120
collections and the time maps that
affects choosing these thresholds so we

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.130
affects choosing these thresholds so we
 

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:57.700
affects choosing these thresholds so we
didn't want to create you know here's

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:57.710
didn't want to create you know here's
 

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.350
didn't want to create you know here's
the best threshold for the Egyptian

00:39:59.350 --> 00:39:59.360
the best threshold for the Egyptian
 

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.850
the best threshold for the Egyptian
revolution when here's the best one for

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:00.860
revolution when here's the best one for
 

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.070
revolution when here's the best one for
human rights we wanted some threshold

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:03.080
human rights we wanted some threshold
 

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.230
human rights we wanted some threshold
and method that would work you know

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240
and method that would work you know
 

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.140
and method that would work you know
reasonably well for lots of collections

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.150
reasonably well for lots of collections
 

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.580
reasonably well for lots of collections
but there may be something we can

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:09.590
but there may be something we can
 

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.080
but there may be something we can
discover that would help you kind of

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.090
discover that would help you kind of
 

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:13.390
discover that would help you kind of
fine tune these for your particular

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400
fine tune these for your particular
 

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.500
fine tune these for your particular
collection and then kind of farther out

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:17.510
collection and then kind of farther out
 

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.590
collection and then kind of farther out
we want to look at detecting off-topic

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:20.600
we want to look at detecting off-topic
 

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.160
we want to look at detecting off-topic
seeds in a collection so maybe you've

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.170
seeds in a collection so maybe you've
 

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.330
seeds in a collection so maybe you've
had people suggest seeds to you and you

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:28.340
had people suggest seeds to you and you
 

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.070
had people suggest seeds to you and you
know you have a lot of seeds and you

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.080
know you have a lot of seeds and you
 

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.540
know you have a lot of seeds and you
haven't been able to go through and look

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:31.550
haven't been able to go through and look
 

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.090
haven't been able to go through and look
at them all to see if they really fit

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.100
at them all to see if they really fit
 

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.640
at them all to see if they really fit
your collection or not can we use this

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:36.650
your collection or not can we use this
 

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.640
your collection or not can we use this
type of tool to figure out you know are

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:39.650
type of tool to figure out you know are
 

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.770
type of tool to figure out you know are
these seats that you should include or

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:41.780
these seats that you should include or
 

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.390
these seats that you should include or
not and so that's involved with

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400
not and so that's involved with
 

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.870
not and so that's involved with
determining the aboutness of the entire

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880
determining the aboutness of the entire
 

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.920
determining the aboutness of the entire
collection rather than a time map so

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:50.930
collection rather than a time map so
 

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:54.400
collection rather than a time map so
again I thank you and again we we are

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:54.410
again I thank you and again we we are
 

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.740
again I thank you and again we we are
grateful for your support and I'll do a

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:56.750
grateful for your support and I'll do a
 

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.730
grateful for your support and I'll do a
quick plug we just found out on yes

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:00.740
quick plug we just found out on yes
 

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.690
quick plug we just found out on yes
friday that this paper from the result

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:04.700
friday that this paper from the result
 

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.700
friday that this paper from the result
of this work was accepted at TP dl and

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:06.710
of this work was accepted at TP dl and
 

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.730
of this work was accepted at TP dl and
we'll be presenting that later in the

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:09.740
we'll be presenting that later in the
 

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:23.750
we'll be presenting that later in the
fall so thanks

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760
 

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.150
how long did the algorithm team take to

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160
how long did the algorithm team take to
 

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.740
how long did the algorithm team take to
run when you're doing a for like the

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:28.750
run when you're doing a for like the
 

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.109
run when you're doing a for like the
data set because I presume cosine

00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119
data set because I presume cosine
 

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:33.390
data set because I presume cosine
similarity does take a while to run when

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400
similarity does take a while to run when
 

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.040
similarity does take a while to run when
you're doing it on a large collection I

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.050
you're doing it on a large collection I
 

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.140
you're doing it on a large collection I
would have to ask yes meeting about that

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.150
would have to ask yes meeting about that
 

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.840
would have to ask yes meeting about that
in terms of yeah because she she ran the

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:39.850
in terms of yeah because she she ran the
 

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.359
in terms of yeah because she she ran the
experiment so I don't know how long it

00:41:42.359 --> 00:41:42.369
experiment so I don't know how long it
 

00:41:42.369 --> 00:41:45.450
experiment so I don't know how long it
took you and I don't know if Miss

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:45.460
took you and I don't know if Miss
 

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.760
took you and I don't know if Miss
yasmeen has considered but I saw the

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:47.770
yasmeen has considered but I saw the
 

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:49.410
yasmeen has considered but I saw the
kernel based search was pretty

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:49.420
kernel based search was pretty
 

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.070
kernel based search was pretty
interesting it could be coupled with the

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.080
interesting it could be coupled with the
 

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.740
interesting it could be coupled with the
lda for topic detection as well as the

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:55.750
lda for topic detection as well as the
 

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.390
lda for topic detection as well as the
ner for named entities and that could

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400
ner for named entities and that could
 

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.430
ner for named entities and that could
also be matched to find the similarities

00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440
also be matched to find the similarities
 

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.380
also be matched to find the similarities
between docs it's just a suggestion I

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:01.390
between docs it's just a suggestion I
 

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.550
between docs it's just a suggestion I
don't know if that's been right right

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560
don't know if that's been right right
 

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.280
don't know if that's been right right
and I think that may be helpful also

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:05.290
and I think that may be helpful also
 

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.950
and I think that may be helpful also
when you're looking at the entire

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960
when you're looking at the entire
 

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.600
when you're looking at the entire
collection because yeah we're

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:09.610
collection because yeah we're
 

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.980
collection because yeah we're
considering that you know for a

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:10.990
considering that you know for a
 

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.560
considering that you know for a
particular time map hopefully the terms

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:13.570
particular time map hopefully the terms
 

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.660
particular time map hopefully the terms
are not going to change too much but

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:15.670
are not going to change too much but
 

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.220
are not going to change too much but
when we move to a collection it may be

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:17.230
when we move to a collection it may be
 

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.500
when we move to a collection it may be
much broader and so we may need to do

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:19.510
much broader and so we may need to do
 

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.240
much broader and so we may need to do
some more you know kind of a broader

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:21.250
some more you know kind of a broader
 

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.280
some more you know kind of a broader
analysis when we look at all the seeds

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:23.290
analysis when we look at all the seeds
 

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:27.540
analysis when we look at all the seeds
in a collection ok the other thing to

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:27.550
in a collection ok the other thing to
 

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.450
in a collection ok the other thing to
mention is you could use this tool with

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:30.460
mention is you could use this tool with
 

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.950
mention is you could use this tool with
what not presented because you want to

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960
what not presented because you want to
 

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.900
what not presented because you want to
get the off-topic mementos out of your

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:33.910
get the off-topic mementos out of your
 

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.359
get the off-topic mementos out of your
collection before you do your thumbnail

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:36.369
collection before you do your thumbnail
 

00:42:36.369 --> 00:42:40.349
collection before you do your thumbnail
summarization what are the consequences

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359
summarization what are the consequences
 

00:42:40.359 --> 00:42:43.170
summarization what are the consequences
if the assumption that the first memento

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:43.180
if the assumption that the first memento
 

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.340
if the assumption that the first memento
is actually on topic proves to be false

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:46.350
is actually on topic proves to be false
 

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.940
is actually on topic proves to be false
so you'd probably get a a long list of

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:49.950
so you'd probably get a a long list of
 

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:53.940
so you'd probably get a a long list of
you know not of off-topic mementos and

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:53.950
you know not of off-topic mementos and
 

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:57.540
you know not of off-topic mementos and
so one thing that we could this would

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:57.550
so one thing that we could this would
 

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.120
so one thing that we could this would
require work you know get a cooperation

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.130
require work you know get a cooperation
 

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.099
require work you know get a cooperation
from the curator to kind of figure out

00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:02.109
from the curator to kind of figure out
 

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:05.070
from the curator to kind of figure out
at what point did your time map actually

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:05.080
at what point did your time map actually
 

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.160
at what point did your time map actually
go on topic the one of the examples that

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:08.170
go on topic the one of the examples that
 

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.930
go on topic the one of the examples that
we filmed and basically the seed got

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:09.940
we filmed and basically the seed got
 

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.940
we filmed and basically the seed got
added before the site was really live

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:11.950
added before the site was really live
 

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.500
added before the site was really live
and so you get the kind of the Apache

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:13.510
and so you get the kind of the Apache
 

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:17.070
and so you get the kind of the Apache
default page and so you know we could

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.080
default page and so you know we could
 

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.920
default page and so you know we could
add a you know a switch in the code that

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:19.930
add a you know a switch in the code that
 

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.620
add a you know a switch in the code that
lets you specify okay don't start

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:22.630
lets you specify okay don't start
 

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.650
lets you specify okay don't start
looking until the 5th momento

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660
looking until the 5th momento
 

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.930
looking until the 5th momento
or whatever but yeah you basically you

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940
or whatever but yeah you basically you
 

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.880
or whatever but yeah you basically you
just want to reset it to what is really

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:28.890
just want to reset it to what is really
 

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:33.049
just want to reset it to what is really
zero Michelle why didn't you use sim

00:43:33.049 --> 00:43:33.059
zero Michelle why didn't you use sim
 

00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:35.630
zero Michelle why didn't you use sim
hashes in this work because Matt was

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640
hashes in this work because Matt was
 

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:43.849
hashes in this work because Matt was
using say mattress 12 and you didn't i'm

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859
using say mattress 12 and you didn't i'm
 

00:43:43.859 --> 00:43:47.960
using say mattress 12 and you didn't i'm
not i'm not sure exactly why we picked

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:47.970
not i'm not sure exactly why we picked
 

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.620
not i'm not sure exactly why we picked
these so that the thing is is that if

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:51.630
these so that the thing is is that if
 

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.279
these so that the thing is is that if
you want to detect we wanted to stay

00:43:55.279 --> 00:43:55.289
you want to detect we wanted to stay
 

00:43:55.289 --> 00:43:57.559
you want to detect we wanted to stay
with terms rather than just kind of

00:43:57.559 --> 00:43:57.569
with terms rather than just kind of
 

00:43:57.569 --> 00:44:00.890
with terms rather than just kind of
character differences so that you know

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900
character differences so that you know
 

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.599
character differences so that you know
because we're trying to do what is the

00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:02.609
because we're trying to do what is the
 

00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:05.390
because we're trying to do what is the
topic of the page rather than you know

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400
topic of the page rather than you know
 

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.880
topic of the page rather than you know
did they just get rearranged so I think

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:07.890
did they just get rearranged so I think
 

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.920
did they just get rearranged so I think
trying to keep these into into terms

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:09.930
trying to keep these into into terms
 

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:27.670
trying to keep these into into terms
fits this particular goal better

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680
 

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.740
you
