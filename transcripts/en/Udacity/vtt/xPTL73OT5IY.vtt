00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's go ahead and try this here,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and we'll play around with it in our browser.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So right now, these 3 radio buttons have 3 different names.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's give them all the same name--so instead of being "q", "r", and "s",

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we're going to make them "q", "q", and "q".

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Okay. We Save this,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we go to our browser

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and Reload the page.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now we have our 3 radio buttons again.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And now, when I select the first one, it behaves as we expected.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I select the second one,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it will unselect the first one--so that's cool.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So now we can only select one option

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and things work as we expected.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And when I submit the form, we see that: q=on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because that was the name of the inputs.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A major downside to this is that,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
no matter which radio button I selected,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"q" still says it's equal to "on".

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So that's not particularly helpful because we want to know

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which radio button is selected.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, that is what the value parameter is for,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and let's take a look at that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here we are in our Editor again, and we're going to learn

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
about another parameter--this one's called "value".

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So I'm going to add a value parameter to each of these inputs.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'll make the first one be "one"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and I'll make the second one be "two"--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I'll make the third one be "three".

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So now we have: type="radio" name="q"--for all 3 of these,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but the first radio button has the value "one",

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a second has value "two", and the third one has value "three".

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's go ahead and try this out in our browser.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Okay. I've reloaded the form

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and now I'm going to select one of these radio buttons.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's go with the second one, and I would like you to tell me

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what happens when I click Submit.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So what will the value of the "q" parameter in the URL be

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when the form is submitted with the second radio button selected?
