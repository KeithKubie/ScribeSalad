00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.980
*welcome*

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.900
1979 was an inflection point for both popular music

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.340
and for who in the next decade would become pop music's biggest star -

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.660
Michael Jackson.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.160
♫ Michael Jackson - Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough ♫

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.560
It's hard to think back on that period now to a time before Michael Jackson became

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.860
Michael Jackson,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:30.040
a world-famous megastar whose work is so ubiquitous, it's less like music and more like the air we breathe.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.720
But 1979 was before all that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.500
It was before Thriller and Beat It and Billie Jean and Smooth Criminal.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.680
It was four years before the world first saw Jackson do the moonwalk on Motown 25

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.940
and critically for him at the time, it was ten years after I Want You Back and the hits of The Jackson 5.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.720
In the intervening years as Michael entered adolescence

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.740
and outgrew the cute little boy that the world wanted him to be forever

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.720
he released four solo albums that tried to bridge the gap from his Motown roots to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.760
whatever was supposed to come next.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.460
The last of those, Forever, Michael, failed to crack the top half of the Billboard 200.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.640
♫ Michael Jackson - Push Me Away
you push me away ♫

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.520
♫ you push ♫

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.940
♫ you push me away ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.660
In the late '70s Jackson's pop domination was far from a foregone conclusion.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.140
But behind the scenes he was paying attention to the changing trends in music

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.320
and in the mid to late '70s there was one trend that was growing faster than any other

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.980
♫ Bee Gees - Saturday Night Fever ♫

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.200
In 1977 the disco subculture was juiced by an unlikely hit film - Saturday Night Fever

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.000
of course disco had been around for almost 10 years by then

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.880
growing out of soul and funk music and out of black Latino and LGBT cultures,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.900
though you wouldn't know it watching John Travolta dance to the Bee Gees for an all-white crowd.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.720
But a year later Jackson and his brothers had a disco hit with Shake Your Body Down To The Ground

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.280
and at that point the stage was set for what would become Michael's

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460
re-arrival as a show-stopping solo artist.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.520
in August '79 Jackson released Off The Wall

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.820
the first of three partnerships with producer Quincy Jones.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.600
The first single off that album was Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.300
a song that Jackson wrote himself and co-produced and his first number-one in seven years.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.600
The song was a worldwide smash - one that still has legs forty years later.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.740
I think it's been played at every wedding I've ever been to.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.000
For Jackson it was the crossover hit that helped him turn a corner in his career.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880
It was number one on the soul charts,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.100
but more importantly it was a pop hit. It was inspired by disco and funk

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.320
but it was more than that.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.520
When we listen to the song now it doesn't carry the historical baggage of disco.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640
As music professor N. Danielson says:

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.660
"In the popular imagination Don't Stop is pure dance music."

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.380
There are reasons for this beyond Jackson's undeniable charisma as a performer. That certainly plays a big part,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.920
but if you look closer at the musical DNA of Don't Stop you can see why the song has such appeal.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.100
The first place to look is the rhythm,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.460
grounded by bass drum and bass guitar and richly layered with snare drum

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.180
shakers, guitar and Jackson banging on a glass soda bottle.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.500
This is the part of the song that makes you want to dance.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.640
As Danielson notes, the rhythm is taking a lot of its cues from funk music

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.320
which emphasize the first beat in every measure of 4.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.720
Something that was made famous by James Brown.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.720
This emphasis is one thing that makes the song more dance-able.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.300
Another is syncopation, or something that disturbs the regular flow of the beat.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.280
Syncopation creates tension in music that you want to resolve with your body

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.900
In the case of funk, that syncopation can be very complex and very noticeable.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.300
But in Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Jackson minimizes the distance between the beat

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.100
and it's syncopated sound,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.320
which comes only a handful of milliseconds before.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.860
Danielson calls this micro rhythm.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940
The beat still has funk, but it registers subconsciously,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.400
resulting in a cleaner feeling sound, something that attracts a mainstream pop audience.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.340
A cleaner sound is also a feature of disco

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.400
and Don't Stop's rhythm is incorporating those elements as well.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.820
The shaker for example is sounding consistently every 16th note.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.400
and the main pulse though emphasizing the first beat in every measure,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.960
is designed to combine the bass guitar and the bass drum to create the same sound every time,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.260
as opposed to funk or rock, where you can mostly hear the difference between instruments.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.140
On top of this undercurrent of rhythm which is balancing the features of funk and disco

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.680
Jackson spreads a tapestry of sounds

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.480
that fill in the gaps between beats and help to smooth everything out

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.560
(strings and horns, electric piano)

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.140
again, reaching for that clean surface that defines the pop sensibility.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.880
The icing on the cake is the harmony and Jackson's falsetto.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.880
As Ethan Hein points out over at his blog,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.980
The song only has two chords: A and B,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.900
which alternate back and forth to create a trance-like modal groove; something

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.100
more associated with Eastern music than Western

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.940
and above this Jackson sings a melody marked by the first two notes in the first two syllables in every line.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.920
These notes are D sharp and A.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.800
and the interval between them is what's called a tritone

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.740
As Hein says the relationship between these notes is somewhat off-kilter and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.460
your mind notices that and that infuses the song with an urgency that it wouldn't otherwise have.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.380
As I said before Jackson's charisma here is unmistakeable.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.760
This is where the world was introduced to the grunts and tics that would become a signature of his style.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.340
Don't Stop is effectively the birth of a new artist;

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.140
one who would take over the world in the decade to come,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.300
and this song goes a long way to explaining how and why that happened.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.660
You can see Jackson and Jones taking the syncopation of funk, the pulse of disco, the vibe of Eastern music

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.140
even the structure of a rock song with its verse-chorus verse-chorus pattern

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.680
complete with a euphoric bridge by Greg Phillinganes.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.480
Jackson recalibrates all these elements toward the end of pure pop music

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.420
and electrifies them with the power of his voice.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.820
The song is greater than the sum of its parts. It's something new and exciting:

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.620
it's the sound of Michael Jackson.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.920
[interviewer] Do you wanna stop?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.840
- No. Don't stop 'til you get enough.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.860
[interviewer] And you haven't had enough...

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.980
- I had... No way!

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.340
No way.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280
Hey everybody~

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.600
thank you so much for watching

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.720

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.180
unbelievable to me

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.060
So this is the official first video of my 30s

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.080
I can't believe I'm saying that and it was a great one to work on for the past few weeks just

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.560
because I got to jam out to Off The Wall for my birthday

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.340
