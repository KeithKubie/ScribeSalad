and you know it's a ridiculous idea that
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.770
and you know it's a ridiculous idea that
we separate ourselves in this way which

we separate ourselves in this way which
 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.500
we separate ourselves in this way which
is true but it's also very facile way of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
is true but it's also very facile way of
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.059
is true but it's also very facile way of

useful myth and that's the only way it's

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489
useful myth and that's the only way it's
 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.580
useful myth and that's the only way it's
been able to endure for as long as it

and so what I mean by that is we look at
 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.089
and so what I mean by that is we look at
things now we talk about race we tend to

these problems we should all just look

these problems we should all just look
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.789
these problems we should all just look
at each other as humans but the fact of
