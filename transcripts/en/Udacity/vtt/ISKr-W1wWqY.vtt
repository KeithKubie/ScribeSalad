00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
One good representative of distributed version control systems, is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.320
GIT. A distributed version control system that was initially designed

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.297
and developed by Linus Torvalds. I'm pretty sure you

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:14.140
know who Linus Torvalds is. He's basically this guy who

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.070
started and created the Linux operating system. And Linus

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.140
was unhappy with the existing version control systems, and wanted

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.610
a different one. He wanted to use it for maintaining

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.330
the Linux kernel. In particular, he wanted one with some

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.550
key characteristics. For example, the fact that it was distributed. He

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.470
wanted it to be fast. He wanted it to have a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.660
simple design. And he wanted to have a strong support for

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.370
parallel branches, because many people were contributing to the kernel at the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.620
same time. And therefore there many different branches of development. And

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.120
finally, he wanted for the virtual control system to be able to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.070
handle large projects. As the Linux kernel is, and to do

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.480
it in an efficient way. So if you want to get an idea

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.210
of how popular GIT is today, there was a survey performed across the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.330
Eclipse IDE users, and it showed that in 2013 GIT was used by

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.950
about 30% of the developers. So the, it had a 30% adoption rate.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.430
So we will use a GIT as a version control system for the class.
