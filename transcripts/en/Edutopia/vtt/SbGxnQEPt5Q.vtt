00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Narrator] Order up.

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:03.672
(crowd talking)

00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:07.668
- [Customer] Can I have
a hot chocolate, please?

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:10.000
- Hot chocolate.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.833
What's your name?

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:11.880
- Emily.
- Emily.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.890
- [Narrator] Cafe Vine students
learn how to be efficient.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.100
They learn how to be problem solvers.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.834
They're very creative, and
they also learn confidence.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.270
(coffee grinding)

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.110
These are things that will carry over

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.740
and help them in whatever
field they end up working.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.063
- Mallory?

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:30.063
- Mallory again.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.242
(bus driving)

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.810
- The vision of the school

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.497
is to provide students

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:44.420
with every opportunity
possible, open every door.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.280
That means taking the
learning out of the classroom,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.750
making it real, making it come alive,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.820
so that we're really tapping into

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.638
every student's strengths.

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:55.802
- We've noticed that kids had an interest

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.030
to work with outside companies.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.707
They were interested in entrepreneurship,

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:03.930
so the notion came up of
actually having a startup company

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.310
in the building.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.469
- Cafe Vine is a student-run coffee shop

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.469
that serves students and teachers.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.198
- Good morning, madam.

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:12.546
How may I help you?

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:15.525
- We thought that the
cafe would be a great

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.650
business model for the
high school students.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.599
The kids see what it would be like

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.089
to have a real job and
what are some of the skills

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:23.784
that they need to take with them.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:24.950
- Please sign.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.730
- You learn time management.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.810
You learn how to think on the spot.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.750
You learn how to communicate very well.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.970
- At first I thought it
was gonna be very easy

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.552
to do everything, but back
there with lots of people

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:38.870
behind the counter, it's really hard.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.580
- All right, everyone,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.400
how did this morning go?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.160
The Cafe Vine elective
meets for an hour each day.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.882
The students apply to the elective,

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:49.610
and it has to fit in with their schedule.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.800
At the very start of class,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.060
we talk about how the morning shift went.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.600
How many people were doing bagels today?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.815
- It was Kaitlin and Christian.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.530
They were just kinda back and forth,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.650
just hopping on other things
if we needed help, and that--

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.520
- I think first and foremost, we bond.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.157
We know how to create a team.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.206
"You have that, I have
this, let's work together."

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:09.130
I think that's a great
skill that we learn in Cafe.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.900
- [Dana] During the
second half of elective,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.970
they can do small group skill training.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.220
- All the students will
get to do all the roles,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.811
whether it's a prep or a barista

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:20.240
or a cash management.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.905
- The attention to detail
that I learned in Cafe

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.440
has definitely made me a better student

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.090
in my academic classes

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.310
'cause you have to listen in Cafe.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.160
You really have to make sure

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.030
you're getting every
single detail correct.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.630
- [Narrator] You're gonna go
ahead and dip down once now.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.388
We teach them the origin of the bean

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:35.540
and about the roaster.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.170
Once this gets to about 350,
we're gonna start our roast.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.240
We teach the kids
different colors and smells

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.870
and temperatures of each batch.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.153
See what you smell in there,

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:48.540
and then write it down on the paper.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.214
- [Dana] Cafe Vine students sell the beans

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:52.750
to different coffee shops locally.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.960
- That was what really reeled me in,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.220
was how to run a business.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.264
It wasn't so much making
coffee or roasting beans.

00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:00.693
It was more how does that operate?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.510
- [Dana] One of the things
that we work on often

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.950
is inventory.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.890
- [Narrator] Do we not
have the other cups?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.490
There's 13--
- We can't just go

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.560
wasting supplies.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.990
The cafe does have a budget
that you have to manage.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.015
- [Dana] We also have a
scheduling app called Homebase.

00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:21.380
- [Vincenzo] I have to
manage who works what day.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.930
- We'll also talk about new ideas

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.370
or what to add onto the menu.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.320
- [Dana] If there's
anything that looks like

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.549
we need to tweak it a little
in terms of the prices

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.020
or...

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.853
Okay.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.970
- [Eli] For a lot of students,
it is their first real job,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.150
so we give them the chance
to have that experience.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.160
- The cafe does give us
some real, tangible skills

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.055
that we can apply to real world.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.093
- That's 3.50.

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:43.926
- [Narrator] There's
something just really unique

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:46.840
and special about being
involved day-to-day

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.440
and to feel the rhythm of what it's like

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.750
to be in a startup.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.880
- [Kaitlin] It definitely creates chaos,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.040
but it's a good flow.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.799
By the end of the shift, you feel good.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.430
- [Narrator] Order up.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.547
- I love it all (laughs).
