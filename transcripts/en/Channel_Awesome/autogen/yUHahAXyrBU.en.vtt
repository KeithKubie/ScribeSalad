when we get to these really tough

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
when we get to these really tough
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980
when we get to these really tough
moments and really the big thing for me

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
moments and really the big thing for me
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.249
moments and really the big thing for me
is the acting in these movies are so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
is the acting in these movies are so
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.530
is the acting in these movies are so
good you know in the first one you kind

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
good you know in the first one you kind
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690
good you know in the first one you kind
of had more the you know the upper class

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
of had more the you know the upper class
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160
of had more the you know the upper class
with the goofy costumes and they were

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
with the goofy costumes and they were
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899
with the goofy costumes and they were
all going over the top and stuff which

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
all going over the top and stuff which
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850
all going over the top and stuff which
kind of makes sense because it's the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
kind of makes sense because it's the
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.010
kind of makes sense because it's the
media and if our media has taught us

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
media and if our media has taught us
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960
media and if our media has taught us
anything is that we're just giving more

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
anything is that we're just giving more
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.910
anything is that we're just giving more
and more over-the-top and I should know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
and more over-the-top and I should know
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.539
and more over-the-top and I should know
so it's something where when you get to

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549
so it's something where when you get to
 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.190
so it's something where when you get to

know exactly what's going on what the

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.110
know exactly what's going on what the
 

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.840
know exactly what's going on what the
answer is what the best thing to do is

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:58.850
answer is what the best thing to do is
 

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.030
answer is what the best thing to do is
what good is what evil and any of this

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040
what good is what evil and any of this
 

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.800
what good is what evil and any of this
stuff so many people you think are good

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:02.810
stuff so many people you think are good
 

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:03.970
stuff so many people you think are good
can be awful so maybe if you thought

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:03.980
can be awful so maybe if you thought
 

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.130
can be awful so maybe if you thought
awful can do good things and by first of

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:06.140
awful can do good things and by first of
 

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.620
awful can do good things and by first of
all these things and I think this is a

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.630
all these things and I think this is a
 

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.730
all these things and I think this is a
very clear sign that you just gotta do

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:12.740
very clear sign that you just gotta do
 

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.430
very clear sign that you just gotta do
the best you can and you're never gonna

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440
the best you can and you're never gonna
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.199
the best you can and you're never gonna
have all the answers and all these

00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:17.209
have all the answers and all these
 

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:18.790
have all the answers and all these
people that tell you I have the answers

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800
people that tell you I have the answers
 

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.570
people that tell you I have the answers
I know they don't they are guessing and

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:22.580
I know they don't they are guessing and
 

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.550
I know they don't they are guessing and
they might be closer to the real answer

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560
they might be closer to the real answer
 

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.530
they might be closer to the real answer
than the rest of us that are guessing me

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.540
than the rest of us that are guessing me
 

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.710
than the rest of us that are guessing me
I don't know like I'm not a political

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880
person I never pretend to be or any of
 

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.639
person I never pretend to be or any of
that stuff or even with films I don't

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:33.649
that stuff or even with films I don't
 

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.530
that stuff or even with films I don't
know what's going on behind the scenes

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:35.540
know what's going on behind the scenes
 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.079
