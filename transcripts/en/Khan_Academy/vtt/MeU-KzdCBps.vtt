00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.118
- [Voiceover] As we start to graph lines,

00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:04.300
we might notice that they're
differences between lines.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.760
For example, this pink or
this magenta line here,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.361
it looks steeper than this blue line.

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:13.681
And what we'll see is
this notion of steepness,

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.404
how steep a line is, how
quickly does it increase

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:18.719
or how quickly does it decrease,

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.716
is a really useful idea in mathematics.

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:25.160
So ideally, we'd be
able to assign a number

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.357
to each of these lines
or to any lines that

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:29.563
describes how steep it is,

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:33.278
how quickly does it increase or decrease?

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:35.577
So what's a reasonable way to do that?

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.497
What's a reasonable way to assign a number

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:40.058
to these lines that
describe their steepness?

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:43.061
Well one way to think
about it, could say well,

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:45.461
how much does a line increase

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:48.781
in the vertical direction

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.892
for a given increase in
the horizontal direction?

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.388
So let's write this down.

00:00:54.038 --> 00:00:56.606
So let's say if we an increase

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.358
increase, in vertical,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.560
in vertical,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.382
for a given increase in horizontal

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:07.924
for a given increase

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:10.292
a given increase

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:12.773
in horizontal.

00:01:13.623 --> 00:01:17.340
So, how can this give us a value?

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.927
Well let's look at that
magenta line again.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.299
Now let's just start at an arbituary point

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.244
in that magenta line.

00:01:24.244 --> 00:01:25.176
But I'll start at a point

00:01:25.176 --> 00:01:26.466
where it's going to be easy for me

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.532
to figure out what point we're at.

00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:30.731
So if we were to start right here,

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.423
and if I were to increase
in the horizontal

00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:36.280
direction by one.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.360
So I move one to the right.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:40.066
To get back on the line, how much

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.342
do I have to increase in
the vertical direction?

00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:45.714
Well I have to increase in
the vertical direction by two.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:47.951
By two.

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:49.444
So at least for this magenta line,

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:52.062
it looks like our increase in vertical is

00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:54.761
two, whenever we have an increase in

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.084
one in the horizontal direction.

00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:00.585
Let's see, does that
still work if I were to

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:03.386
start here, instead of
increasing the horizontal

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.917
direction by one, if I were increase in

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.519
the horizontal direction...

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.657
So let's increase by three.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:11.722
So now, I've gone plus three

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:12.790
in the horizontal direction,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.206
then to get back on the line,

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:15.929
how much do I have to increase
in the vertical direction?

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.336
I have to increase by one,
two, three, four, five, six

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:22.426
I have to increase by six.

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.028
So plus six.

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:27.489
So when I increase by three

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.225
in the horizontal direction,

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:32.983
I increase by six in the vertical.

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:34.701
We were just saying,
hey, let's just measure

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:35.653
how much to we increase in vertical

00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:37.325
for a given increase in the horizontal?

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:39.415
Well two over one is just two

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.831
and that's the same
thing as six over three.

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:44.479
So no matter where I start on this line,

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:46.887
no matter where I start on this line,

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:51.053
if I take and if I increase
in the horizontal direction

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.991
by a given amount,

00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:54.631
I'm going to increase twice as much

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.210
twice as much

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.239
in the vertical direction.

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:01.493
Twice as much in the vertical direction.

00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:03.919
So this notion of this
increase in vertical

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.617
divided by increase in horizontal,

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:09.027
this is what mathematicians
use to describe

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:10.211
the steepness of lines.

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:12.543
And this is called the slope.

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:14.669
So this is called the slope of a line.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.525
And you're probably
familiar with the notion

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.637
of the word slope being
used for a ski slope,

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:24.201
and that's because a ski slope
has a certain inclination.

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:25.582
It could have a steep
slope or a shallow slope.

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:29.149
So slope is a measure for
how steep something is.

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.867
And the convention is, is
we measure the increase

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:35.172
in vertical for a given
in increase in horizontal.

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:38.628
So six two over one is
equal to six over three

00:03:38.628 --> 00:03:40.744
is equal to two, this
is equal to the slope

00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:42.416
of this magenta line.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.252
So let me write this down.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.108
So this slope right over
here, the slope of that line,

00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:52.708
is going to be equal to two.

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:54.598
And one way to interpret that,

00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:56.778
for whatever amount you increase in the

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.339
horizontal direction,
you're going to increase

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.745
twice as much in the vertical direction.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.309
Now what about this blue line here?

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.983
What would be the slope of the blue line?

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.268
Well, let me rewrite another
way that you'll typically

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:09.758
see the definition of slope.

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:12.223
And this is just the
convention that mathematicians

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:13.515
have defined for slope

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:14.607
but it's a valuable one.

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:16.580
What is are is our change in vertical

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.042
for a given change in horizontal?

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.655
And I'll introduce a new notation for you.

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:25.680
So, change in vertical,

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:27.908
and in this coordinate,

00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:30.125
the vertical is our Y coordinate.

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.213
divided by our change in horizontal.

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:35.466
And X is our horizontal coordinate

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.536
in this coordinate plane right over here.

00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:42.346
So wait, you said change in but then you

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:43.465
drew this triangle.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:45.880
Well this is the Greek letter delta.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.248
This is the Greek letter delta.

00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:52.474
And it's a math symbol used
to represent change in.

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.237
So that's delta, delta.

00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:59.319
And it literally means, change in Y,

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.649
change in Y,

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.214
divided by change in X,

00:05:04.657 --> 00:05:06.602
change in X.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:08.720
So if we want to find the
slope of the blue line,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.994
we just have to say, well
how much does Y change

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:13.201
for a given change in X?

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.618
So, the slope of the blue line.

00:05:17.228 --> 00:05:19.997
So let's see, let me do it this way.

00:05:23.876 --> 00:05:25.502
Let's just start at some point here.

00:05:25.502 --> 00:05:28.242
And let's say my X changes by two

00:05:28.242 --> 00:05:31.515
so my delta X is equal to positive two.

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:33.257
What's my delta Y going to be?

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:34.511
What's going to be my change in Y?

00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.367
Well, if I go by the right by two,

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:38.411
to get back on the line,

00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.014
I'll have to increase my Y by two.

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:44.345
So my change in Y is also
going to be plus two.

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:46.190
So the slope of this blue line,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.442
the slope of the blue line,

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:51.809
which is change in Y over change in X.

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.311
We just saw that when our
change in X is positive two,

00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.449
our change in Y is also positive two.

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.771
So our slope is two divided by two,

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:01.863
which is equal to one.

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:04.440
Which tells us however much we increase in

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.971
X, we're going to increase
the same amount in Y.

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:09.630
We see that, we increase
one in X, we increase

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.709
one in Y.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:12.404
Increase one in X, increase one in Y.

00:06:12.404 --> 00:06:14.703
&gt;From any point on the line,
that's going to be true.

00:06:14.703 --> 00:06:17.291
You increase three in X,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.391
you're going to increase three in Y.

00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:22.063
It's actually true the other way.

00:06:22.283 --> 00:06:24.130
If you decrease one in X,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.941
you're going to decrease one in Y.

00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:28.541
If you decrease two in X,

00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:30.621
you're going to decrease two in Y.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.694
And that makes sense from
the math of it as well

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:37.806
Because if you're change
in X is negative two,

00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:39.547
that's what we did right over here,

00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:41.660
our change is X is negative two,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.542
we went two back,

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:45.445
then your change in Y is going
to be negative two as well.

00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:47.906
Your change in Y is
going to be negative two,

00:06:47.906 --> 00:06:50.088
and negative two divided by negative two,

00:06:50.088 --> 00:06:53.246
is positive one, which
is your slope again.
