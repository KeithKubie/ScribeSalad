00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.160
I'm going to be
totally honest with you:

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.879
I don't really spend a lot of time
thinking about my bodily functions.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.490
For the most part.
Maybe sometimes.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.650
But in the next few episodes,
I'm going to be talking

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.660
about all of the organ systems
that make our lives possible,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.070
even occasionally pleasant!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.380
And to start it all off, I'm
going straight to mission control:

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.400
the Nervous System!

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.420
Pretty much every animal,
except for some really simple ones,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.289
have nervous systems,
which is great,

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.769
because it's what lets things
do things like: have behaviors.

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.120
It makes you the sentient,
living thing that you are.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.649
The whole set-up here:
your brain, your nerves,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.260
your spinal cord, everything

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.909
is made up of specialized cells
that you don't find

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.379
anywhere else in the body.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.479
Most of those are neurons, which,
you've seen them before,

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.879
they look kind of like a tree
with roots, a trunk and branches.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.639
Neurons bundle together
to form nerves,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.029
pathways that transmit
electrochemical signals

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:00.959
from one part of
your body to another.

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:02.959
So, when you bite
into a piece of pizza-

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.090
I love it when there's
pizza in the video...

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630
The receptor neurons in
my taste buds recognize

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.880
I'm eating something salty
and fatty and awesome.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.060
And they carry that information
along a nerve pathway to my brain.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.159
And then my brain can
be like "Yeah! Pizza!"

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.490
and then it can respond
by sending back information

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.520
through different nerve
pathways that say:

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.259
"You should eat more
of that pizza!"

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.000
And despite what my
brain is telling me,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.159
I'm going to try to not
eat any more of that pizza.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.390
You wouldn't think that
it's terribly complicated

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.600
to know that pizza tastes good and
to tell someone to eat more pizza.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.520
But it turns out that our brains

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.079
and our nervous systems
are crazy complicated.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.140
Your nervous system basically has
a big old bureaucracy of neurons,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.640
and it's divided into
two main departments:

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.399
the central nervous system and
the peripheral nervous system.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.159
Central and peripheral.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.979
The central nervous system,

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.990
basically your brain
and your spinal cord,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.219
is responsible for
analyzing and interpreting

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.479
all those data that your
peripheral nervous system,

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.469
all of the nerves outside
of your brain and spine,

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.909
collects and sends its way.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.679
Once the central nervous system
makes a decision about data,

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.119
it sends a signal back through to
the peripheral nervous system

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.709
saying "Do THIS thing!"

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.629
Which the peripheral nervous
system then does.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.980
Both of these systems contain
two different types of neurons:

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.540
afferent and efferent.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.849
Afferent and efferent
are biological terms,

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.180
and they're horribly
confusing, and I apologize

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.159
on behalf of the entire
institution of biology for them.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.150
Afferent systems carry
things to a central point,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.010
and efferent systems carry
things away from a central point.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.400
So afferent neurons carry
information to the brain

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.430
and spinal cord for analysis.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.599
In the peripheral nervous system,

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.610
afferent neurons are
called sensory neurons,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.540
and they're activated
by external stimuli

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.129
like the complex and
glorious flavor of pizza

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.019
and then they convert
those data into a signal

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.909
for the central system to process.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.659
The central nervous system
has afferent neurons too,

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.590
and there they bring information
into special parts of the brain,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.959
like the part of the brain
that goes, "Mmmmmm, salty!"

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.209
Efferent neurons carry
information out of the center.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.819
In the peripheral nervous system,

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.989
they're called motor neurons
because many of them

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.319
carry information from the
brain or spinal cord

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.140
to muscles to make us move,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.709
but they also go to pretty much
every other organ in your body,

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.470
thus making them, like, work
and do stuff to keep you alive.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.360
In the central system, efferent
neurons carry information

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.730
from special parts of
the brain to other parts

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.980
of the brain or spinal cord.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.239
Of course if it ended there,
it would be way too simple

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.900
and no good bureaucracy
just has two departments.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.239
So the peripheral nervous
system is actually made up of

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.390
two different systems with
two very different jobs:

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.489
the somatic nervous system
and the autonomic nervous system.

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.409
The somatic system controls
all the stuff you think about doing

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.140
like all the information
coming through your senses,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.829
and the movement of your body
when you want it to make movements.

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.810
But here's something interesting:

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.489
Since we're totally in
love with our brains

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.329
as sort of the center
of all being, of ourselves,

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.500
we think that all
the information about

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.930
everything going on in our
bodies goes to our brains

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.530
for some kind of decision.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.329
Not so!

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.019
Sometimes, like when
we touch a hot stove,

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.620
the afferent neurons
carry the signal "HOT!"

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.030
to the central nervous
system, but that information

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.359
doesn't even ever
get to the brain

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.549
the spinal cord actually
makes that decision

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.969
before it gets to the brain,

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.090
sends a message directly
back to the muscle saying,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.870
"Get your hand off the
freakin stove, *******!"

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.349
This bit of fancy nerve-work
lets the spinal cord

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.690
make decisions rather than the
brain, it's called the reflex loop.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.690
So, the other branch of
the peripheral nervous system,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.820
the autonomic system,
carries signals

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.910
from the central nervous system
that drive all of the things

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.190
your body does without
thinking about them:

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.670
your heartbeat, your
digestion, breathing,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.800
saliva production, all
your organ functions.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.620
But we're not done yet here.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.500
We need to go deeper.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.920
The autonomic nervous system
has two divisions of its own:

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.410
the sympathetic and
parasympathetic.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.420
And the jobs that these two
perform aren't just different

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.130
they're completely
opposite, and frankly,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.390
they're always vying for
control of the body

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.640
in some kind of nervous
system cage match.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.260
The sympathetic division is
responsible for, like,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.450
freaking out.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.910
You've probably heard
this talked about

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.520
as the fight-or-flight response.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.800
In other words, stress.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.950
But stress isn't all bad:

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.150
it's what saves our lives
when we're being chased

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.520
by saber toothed tigers, right?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.660
The sympathetic system prepares
our body for action

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.460
by increasing the heart
rate and blood pressure,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.020
enhancing our sense of
smell, dilating the pupils,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.000
activating our adrenal
cortex to make adrenaline,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.870
shutting down blood
supply to our digestive

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.340
and reproductive systems
so there will be

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.870
more blood available
for our lungs

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.760
and muscles when we
have to, like, RUN!

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.920
Even though you're not in
a constant state of panic

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.180
at least, I hope not,
I kind of am

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.060
that system is running
all the time, every day.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.900
But right next to it is
the parasympathetic division,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.390
working hard to make sure
we take it nice and easy.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.540
It dials down heart rate and blood
pressure, constricts our lungs,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.870
makes our nose run,
increases blood flow

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.600
to our reproductive junk,
our mouths produce saliva,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.040
encourage us to poop and pee.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.920
It's basically what we have
to thank for taking a nap,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.240
sitting in front of the TV, going
to the bathroom and getting it on.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.910
So, consider yourself lucky you've
got both the stress response

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.210
and the chill-the-heck out
response, working side-by-side

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.380
because together they create
a balance, or a homeostasis.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.110
Now, that's what the
nervous system does.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.190
Next we have to talk
about how it does it.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.370
The neurons that make up our
nervous systems make it possible

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.070
for our bodies to have their
very own little electric systems.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.760
So to understand how they work you
have to understand their anatomy.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.370
Like I said before, a typical
neuron has branches like a tree.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.870
These are called dendrites,
and they receive information

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.510
from other neurons.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.710
Neurons also have a single axon
the trunk of the tree

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.120
which is branched at the end and
transmits signals to other neurons.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.320
The axon is also covered in
fatty material called myelin,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.460
which acts as insulation.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.790
But the myelin sheath
isn't continuous,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.980
there are these little bits of
exposed neuron along the axon,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.820
which have the sweetest
names in this whole episode

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.990
they're called the
Nodes of Ranvier.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.430
Which seems like an excellent
working title for the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.640
8th Harry Potter novel.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.980
Harry Potter and the
Nodes of Ranvier.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.580
Anyway, these nodes allow signals
to hop from node to node,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.980
which lets the signal travel
down a nerve faster.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.950
This node-hopping, by
the way, has a name.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.350
It's called saltatory conduction.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.760
Conduction because it's
electrical conduction

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.560
and saltatory because
saltatory means leaping.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.340
Finally, the place where an
axon's branches come in contact

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.220
with the next cell's
dendrite is called a synapse,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.000
and that's where neurotransmitters
pass information from one neuron

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.920
to the next.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.840
Now, think back to, or
just go watch the episode

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.930
we did on cell membranes,
where we talked about

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.540
how materials travel
down concentration gradients.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.580
Well, in much the same way,
all neurons in your body

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.820
have a membrane potential,
a difference in voltage,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.670
or electrical charge,
between the inside

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.030
and the outside
of the membrane.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.960
You might also remember
that this buildup of voltage

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.360
is handled in part
by a sexy little protein

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.500
called the sodium-potassium pump.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.980
Basically, the pump creates
a voltage differential,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.730
like charging a battery,
by moving 3 positively charged

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.140
sodium ions out for every
2 potassium ions it lets in,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.620
creating a net negative
charge inside the cell

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.900
relative to the outside.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.430
When a neuron is inactive, this
is called its resting potential,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.950
and its voltage is
about -70 millivolts.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.200
But in addition to the pumps,
neurons also have ion channels.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.180
These are proteins that
straddle the membrane,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.480
but they're a lot simpler
and don't need ATP to power them.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.330
Each cell can have more than 300
different kinds of ion channels,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.640
each tailored to
accept a specific ion.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.300
Now, don't zone out here,
because all of this stuff

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.970
has got to come into play
when a neuron becomes active.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.890
This happens when an input
or stimulus creates a change

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.370
in the neuron that
eventually reaches the axon,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.500
creating what's called
an action potential

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.620
a brief event where the
electrical potential of a cell

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.210
rapidly rises and falls.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.010
When action potential begins,
like when a molecule of sugar

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.919
touches one of my sweet tastebuds,
some ion channels open

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.620
and let those positive
sodium ions rush in,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.709
so that the inside starts
to become less negative.

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.519
With enough stimulus, the
internal charge of the neuron

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.189
reaches a certain threshold, which
triggers more sodium channels

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:47.259
to respond and open the flood
gates to let even more ions in.

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.379
That's happening on one tiny
little area of the neuron.

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:52.759
But this change in voltage
creeps over to the next bunch

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:55.889
of sodium channels, which
are also sensitive to voltage,

00:08:55.889 --> 00:08:57.069
and so they open.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:59.449
That exchange triggers the
next batch, and the next batch,

00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:00.550
and so on down the line.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.689
So this signal of changing
voltage travels down

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:04.319
the neuron's membrane
like a wave.

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:07.399
But remember, the myelin sheath
insulates most of the neuron,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.490
and just leaves those
little nodes exposed,

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.100
so instead of being a steady wave,
the wave jumps from node to node,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.029
speeding up the travel time of
action potential down a neuron:

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.430
That's your saltatory
conduction at work!

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.060
When the wave reaches
the end of the neuron,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.910
it triggers the release of
neurotransmitters from the neuron

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.600
through exocytosis, and those
neurotransmitters then float

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.709
across the synapse
to the next neuron

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:30.439
where they trigger another
action potential over there.

00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:33.550
Now, by this time, so many
sodium ions have gotten inside

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.930
the first neuron that the
difference between the outside

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.050
and the inside is
actually reversed:

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.829
The inside is positive
and the outside negative.

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:42.370
And it seems like neurons
hate that more than

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.889
pretty much anything else,
so it fixes itself.

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:48.089
The sodium channels close
and potassium channels open up.

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:51.670
The positive potassium ions
rush down both the concentration

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.139
and electrochemical gradients to
get the heck out of the cell.

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:56.920
That brings the charge
inside the cell back down

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.730
to negative on the inside,
and positive on the outside.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.360
Notice, though, that now the
sodium is on the inside

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.329
of the cell and the potassium
is on the outside

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:06.730
they're in the opposite
places of where they started.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.019
So, the sodium-potassium
pumps get back to work

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:11.689
and burn some ATP to pump
the sodium back out

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:14.680
and the potassium
back in, and phew!

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.360
Things are now back at
the resting potential again.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.829
So, that, my friends,
is how action potential

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:22.990
allows neurons to communicate
signals down a whole chain

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.589
of neurons from the outer reaches
of the peripheral nervous system,

00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:28.990
all the way up the spinal
cord and to the brain,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.170
and then back out agian.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.550
So, let's zoom out, and look
at the broad view here.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.149
I'm gonna take a
bite of this pizza.

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:35.850
All my tastebuds have
neurons in them.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.389
Each of my taste buds
contains between 50-100

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:40.199
specialized taste
receptor neurons.

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:43.050
Chemicals from this beautiful
pizza dissolve in the saliva

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.069
and then stimulate the
dendrites on the afferent neurons.

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:48.499
This generates a bunch of
action potentials that travel

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:51.990
from the afferent neurons in
my tongue all the way to my brain,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.860
which is like, "My goodness,
I think that's pizza!

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.139
Let's have another bite!"

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:57.970
The brain then sends
messages through

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.449
the efferent nerve pathways
to do all sorts of things:

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:04.060
1. Chew, which involves
constricting the muscles

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.180
in my jaw over and over again.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.939
2. Lower my head down
to catch another bite,

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.860
which involves moving all
kinds of neck muscles.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.819
3. Swallowing, which involves
constricting the muscles

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:16.769
in my throat and esophagus.

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:20.660
4. Opening my mouth again
to receive another bite.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.790
That signal is also
going to my jaw.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.389
And that's not even to mention
what's going to go on

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:26.399
with the digestion
of this bad boy,

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.870
driven by the autonomic
nervous system.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.129
But digestion is still
a couple episodes from now.

00:11:32.129 --> 00:11:34.269
Hopefully there
will be more pizza.
