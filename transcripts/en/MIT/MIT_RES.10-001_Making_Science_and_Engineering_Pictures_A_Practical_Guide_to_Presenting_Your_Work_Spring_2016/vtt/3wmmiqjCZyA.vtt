PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680
We are about to start
week two of our course.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.580
Week two is very
rich in content.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.820
Quite a lot of material for
you to see in your videos.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.730
Take your time.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.930
That's the beauty
of these courses.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.420
You do it according to your
own drummer, so to speak.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.510
But we think we've got some
very exciting and important work

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.630
for you ahead.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.950
What you're going
to do is going to be

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.430
using interactive tools online.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.970
You're going to
look at aperture,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.900
you're going to look
at point of view,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.120
you're going to
look at exposure,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.100
you're going to look at ISO,
all those highly technical

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.836
issues that you have to know.

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:52.380
I'm going to continue to say
to you, read your manual.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.570
There's no way I could teach you
every camera there is around.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.290
But now we get to the
nitty-gritty of the course

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.740
and you're going to
have a blast, I promise.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.470
Have fun.
