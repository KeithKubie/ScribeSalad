00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.280
Problem 43.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.260
Mia found the area of this
shape by dividing it into

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.180
rectangles as shown.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.090
Mia could use the same method to
find the area for which of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.260
these shapes?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.530
What technique can we use to
figure out the area by

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.200
dividing it into rectangles?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.280
So let's see.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.660
What do we have here?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.340
Can we divide this
into rectangles?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.090
We can divide into a bunch of
triangles, but we can't divide

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.310
this into a bunch
of rectangles.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.760
Or we could have done
it this way as well.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.550
There's multiple ways
to think about it.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.580
You could have it like this,
and you can draw a bunch of

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.890
triangles like that.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.410
But you can't divide this
into rectangles.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.210
This one here, you can't divide
it into rectangles.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.210
You could divide it into
triangles and rectangles, but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.160
not necessarily just
rectangles.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.470
And this here, I really
don't know.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.550
It looks like there's some
type of typo in my test.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.890
Because obviously I could divide
both of these things

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.890
right here.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.270
The way I'm looking at it,
I see squares here.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.310
So obviously I could divide
that into rectangles.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.390
But my guess is, if I had to
guess, is that this was a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.180
triangle, maybe, before.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.110
If it was a triangle, then I
couldn't divide this into

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.700
rectangles.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.785
But maybe this was something
like this.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.130
I don't know.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.380
I'm only guessing.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440
If it did look like this, then
we could divide it into

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.000
rectangles the same way that
she did up here, and figure

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.910
out its area.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.080
So assuming that there was
some type of typo in this

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.745
problem, I'm going to
go with choice D.

00:01:40.745 --> 00:01:43.170
If choice D was supposed to look
like a figure like that,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.540
then you could actually divide
it into a bunch of rectangles.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.100
Problem 44.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.830
Oh, I see.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.920
You know what these
probably were?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.830
These were probably to show us
that these are right angles

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.150
right there.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.760
So that that's a right angle,
that's a right angle.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.700
And maybe-- well, I don't
know what else they're

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.590
trying to show us.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.440
Who knows?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.610
You see what I'm going at.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.440
There's clearly some type
of typo on that problem.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.419
44.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.500
Simplify.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.910
x squared minus 3x plus
1, minus x squared

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.840
plus 2x plus 7.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.980
So let's just write it out.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.610
We have x squared
minus 3x plus 1.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.800
Then we have to distribute
this minus sign.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.970
So minus x squared
minus 2x, right?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.470
Minus times plus.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.740
Minus 2x.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.010
Minus times plus 7 is minus 7.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.760
So you have an x squared
minus an x squared.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.230
They cancel out.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.530
Right? x squared minus
x squared is 0.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.210
Then you have minus
3x minus 2x.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.920
Is minus 5x.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
And then you have 1 minus
7, which is minus 6.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.340
So you're left with minus 5x
minus 6, which is choice C.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.020
Problem 45.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.700
What are the coordinates of the
x-intercept of the line 3x

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.660
plus 4y is equal to 12?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.000
They want to know
the x-intercept.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.170
Remember, the x-intercept,
if this is a line--

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.510
and this is a line.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.890
Let me draw the axes.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.840
Say the line looks-- I don't
know what it looks like.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.730
Say the line looks something
like this.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.810
The x-intercept is the value
when y is equal to 0.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.040
The x-intercept is going to
be some value x and 0.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.050
So let's figure out what
this x-intercept is.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.380
So we can even look here.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.030
This is definitely not
an x-intercept.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.500
This is a y-intercept.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.850
This is a y-intercept.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.910
In order to be an x-intercept,
in order to be on the x-axis,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.480
your y value has to be 0.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.880
So the choices are
either B or D.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.550
And so if y is 0, let's just
solve the equation.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.680
So 3x plus 4 times
0 is equal to 12.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.040
Or we get 3x is equal to 12.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.080
That's just 0 right there.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.940
So x is equal to 4.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.260
So the x-intercept
is 4 comma 0.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.480
x is 5, y is 0.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.480
So this is our choice
right there.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.640
46.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.930
Which of the following
statements

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.630
describes parallel lines?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.380
And parallel lines are just
two lines that never

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.140
intersect, that have the same
slope an they don't sit on top

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.690
of each other.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.480
So those would be two parallel
lines right there.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.830
Same y-intercepts but
different slopes.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.550
No, I just said, they have to
have the same slope and they

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.110
never intersect.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.890
So they can't have the
same y-intercepts.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.300
So it's not that one.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.510
Same slope but different
y-intercepts.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.720
That looks right.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.010
They're parallel, but they're
not on top of each other.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.450
Or they have the same slope.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.330
Opposite slopes.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.880
If they had opposite slopes,
they would intersect.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.500
Can't be that.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.160
Opposite x-intercepts but
same y-intercepts.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.150
No, that's not necessarily
the case.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.290
So our answer is B.
