Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from w n y s

Speaker 2:          00:11          oh look, it's so it's hard to kill another human being anymore, right? We, our fangs have retreated, hands are weak. But as we've lost this ability to kill each other, we've gained an ability to read each other's tone of voice and facial expression. And often what's missing in these interactions is one side of that equation. Uh, whether it's the police not seeing somebody because they're running through an alley with their gun drawn and, and it's dark or shining a flashlight in someone's face where that person can't see the officer's expression. There's some mass cause there's some breakdown in that, in that equation that makes handicaps us from a normal human interaction. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad by him, Robert Krulwich, this is Radiolab. And today we are once again taking a deep dive into Tampa Bay Times reporter Ben Montgomery's mountain of data about police shootings in Florida. So to refresh your memory from, so we've tried to account for every single police shooting from January 1st of 2009 to um, December 31st of 2014. And we've just to remind you, Ben and [inaudible], his team

Speaker 1:          01:26          at the Tampa Bay Times collected data from 828 police shootings. And there's all kinds of stories that you can tell about this data. Last week we looked at police training and race and racism and obviously there's so much more than can and should be said about all of that. But this week we're going to go in a very different direction. Maybe Matt, you just want to set this up for us. Yes. So we want to tell this story because it actually plays out this, uh, this idea that Ben just mentioned that there's this sort of communication breakdown that happens and it does it in a very particular way because when one of these cases comes before a court, the court more often than not will only look at the moment that the cop involved in the shooting pulled their trigger. You don't consider any other moment. It's only the objective facts on the ground of the moment, the officer applies force.

Speaker 1:          02:14          So the thing that we found compelling about this story is that in this case you can actually see, and kind of a rare instance you can like, as you can step in and see all the little moments that lead up to that moment and you realize how complicated these interactions get. So this particular story, it's a story about white couple, uh, Andrea and Rick Sheldon and we're actually going to start the story with Rick. So on one of my trips, uh, to Florida, Ben and I drove to the northeast corner of the state of near Jacksonville to Rick's place. It's sorta like the, the wilds of Florida. Hi. How you doing Matt? Kielty nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Like sort of thoughts that great wild. Oh, that's a big bird back there. What all, what all do you have on the property? Pretty much a little bit of everything.

Speaker 3:          03:00          He clicks rain water and barrels. He's got potatoes, tomatoes, squash, these organic cartons, ducks, goats, a lot of animals. Turkeys, big turkeys. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh, a couple of dogs in the house. Oh, you are so excited. I'm gonna hit stop in this case, the battery [inaudible] uh, eventually we all sit down and Rick's living room. Rick sat cross-legged on the couch. Um, Rick, I was just wondering if we could, uh, I pulled up a chair across from him if we could talk about your case, but even backing up before everything happened, um, can you just tell me about, about your, about your wife? I met Andy. Um, she was down here visiting her mom and, uh, we hit it off straight from the get go. Where'd you, where'd you guys meet? Tradewinds lounge. Downtown. St Augustine. At a bar downtown? Yup. Yup. What'd she look like?

Speaker 3:          03:58          Oh, knock out 10 dark dark hair. How tall? Oh, short little thing. If I flipped to you, make the first move a no, we kind of made the same move the same time. And I can remember telling her, you know, we have a live burn tomorrow. Rick was in China to be a firefighter at the academy and one of our last events and uh, that I'd call her whenever I got done and we'd go have dinner. She's like, no, you're not going to call me. You just gonna come over. I'm like, I'm going to be stinky. She's like, nope. Cause I know that if you go back to your place, you're gonna pass out tired and I'll never see you again, so you're just going to come over here and take a shower. And I showed up, I ate dinner. So that was a date number one?

Speaker 3:          04:40          Yep. Pretty much. So Rick says they just, you know, sort of connected. And so the data for about a year, she moved down here and then, um, two of them got married and she went to nursing school. Later became a hospice nurse. Rick, uh, eventually became a firefighter for Jackson fire rescue. If we were to, uh, to jump ahead to the night in question, could you just like back up to like the beginning of the day and just kind of walk me through? Yeah, we woke up extra early. What Day is this? Um, April the 15th. 2012 yeah. Okay, so you woke up? Yeah. Um, we were in at our cabin and Georgia getting it ready, getting it all set up and whatnot and uh, it was going to be a retirement place anyway, packed up, came home, long drive, long hot drive when we got home, you know, started unpacking the car a little bit and started doing a little bit of this, that and the other, doing a little bit chatting and talking about dinner and having a couple of drinks, whatnot. What happened after that?

Speaker 3:          05:36          Now? I don't know. We just kinda started getting grumpy at each other and getting grumpy. Now we talked about this for a while. I'm just wondering if you can remember just kind of any detail of, of what you guys were talking about. Um, and Rick didn't want to get into it. I'd rather not make a statement about that right now. Just about the conversations you guys were having. I'd rather not make a statement about that right now. Okay. Oh, you can say according to the police report is that Rick and Andy got into this screaming match and Rick says that he felt himself shortness of breath, chest pain, starting to kind of unravel, lost a concentration and ability to think. Rick says he's had problems with PTSD for quite a while. It goes back to his former job as a paramedic. And I'm like, I can't take this.

Speaker 3:          06:20          I need to walk away. Grabbed a bottle out of the refrigerator and I got in my truck and I went and I was like, okay, I'm just going to go fishing. Drove down this dirt road for about five miles. I went to the big pond down there, but right over by the pond I was stuck. His truck gets stuck in the mud. I was axle deep. So you opened up this bottle of Tequila and he starts drinking. He keeps drinking. Eventually pop some pills, sleeping pills. Next thing I remember was, um, you know, um, I remember having problems. I remember being upset. I remember having my, you know, it's PTSD. It sucks.

Speaker 3:          06:57          I remember, um, calling my boss going, hey, I need some help. And, um, ask for help. Ask for, um, employee assistance program help, you know the suicide hotline. Oh, you thought you were suicidal in that moment? Um, no. I just thought I was losing it. And in what way is it just like, I'm just trying to put you off digging. Yeah, stop digging. You don't want to look in his head. It gets that bad. Yeah. Um, did he say anything to you? I don't remember the conversation. Okay. What happened after that? Um, next thing I know I've got the cops calling me going. Where are you?

Speaker 4:          07:39          Hello Richard.

Speaker 3:          07:41          This is recording that phone call.

Speaker 4:          07:43          Deputy Halston was sheriff's office. I Bet I done. Hey, we're, uh, we're trying to come out here and help you. Um,

Speaker 3:          07:50          it's about 11, 15 at night and deputy tells Rick that he and a few other deputies are walking down this dirt road to Rick's place because they'd gotten a call that Rick was possibly suicidal, that he'd gotten into a fight with his wife.

Speaker 4:          08:01          Um, where are you at? I have no idea though.

Speaker 3:          08:07          It tells the deputy that he got in his truck, drove a ways away

Speaker 4:          08:09          until I got stopped and I opened it and I've been enjoying myself. Your wife had the house? Yeah, it's still okay. Everything all right there at the house. Everything's okay at the house. Okay. We're mass to dispute. Can you

Speaker 3:          08:29          ws well can I get her phone number? Cause he'd like to make contact with her.

Speaker 4:          08:32          We want to make sure everybody's safe cause you know we got deputies out here. It's dark, you know, and we don't want her to think that we're somebody proud and stuff. So when we want her to know it was worse, so hoppy, I was the best way we can make contact while her eight, two, three,

Speaker 3:          08:44          Rick gives the deputy his home phone number.

Speaker 4:          08:46          You write this down. All right. Okay. So we're gonna, we're going to try to make contact with heart and then um, um, I must be on the phone with you. We're going to try to get another deputy to call her so that we can get her to come outside. Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:04          To have them talk for about another minute.

Speaker 4:          09:06          You're not playing all harm yourself or anything, are you? Nah Man. Huh? Nah, just [inaudible] was last night and you just want to leave.

Speaker 1:          09:22          So at this point, the deputy standing at the edge of Rick and Amy's driveway, Rick is still a few miles away over at his truck. When suddenly in the background of the call, you just hear

Speaker 5:          09:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:38          fired. Who? That was firing shots.

Speaker 1:          09:46          That's Rick trying to figure out what happened.

Speaker 4:          09:52          Debbie.

Speaker 5:          09:56          Huh?

Speaker 4:          10:00          Heavy d p d.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Well, what, what happened there? Okay, so, um, what we know is while the deputy was talking to Rick, the other officers that were with the deputy, uh, had gone ahead and gone up to the house. Rick's wife, Andy heard something came out of the House with a shotgun. The deputies say that she pointed the shotgun at one of the deputies. They opened fire and she was shot and killed there on the front porch. Did they say, did they identify themselves or like how did the police surprise her? OK. Okay. So actually, uh, so Ben and I were able to get all of the police dispatch recordings from that night. And if you go through these recordings, what you hear is this crazily drawn out version of what Ben was talking about at the top of the story, the disconnect that happens between the deputies and the dispatchers and what they're thinking, hearing and seeing and what's actually happening.

Speaker 1:          11:03          Okay, so if you rewind to about 40 minutes before that shooting, the first thing that happened was Rick called his boss. Now we don't know exactly what was said in that phone call because it wasn't recorded. But what we do know is that Rick's boss left that conversation believing that Rick might be possibly suicidal, that there've been a fight at the house, that Rick a had some guns with him in his truck cause Rick and Andy had gone camping and that there was gun back at the house. But anyways, the first thing that happened after that

Speaker 6:          11:30          call,

Speaker 1:          11:32          it's Rick's bosses, he's a fire chief, calls fire dispatch, who calls a sheriff dispatcher who ropes in another,

Speaker 6:          11:37          the St John's county sheriff's office can help you,

Speaker 1:          11:38          sheriff dispatcher. And what happens is all three dispatchers get on the line

Speaker 6:          11:41          and who is what? Who is that? The woods trying to figure out what's going on. His wife is no dad.

Speaker 1:          11:47          Eventually the sheriff dispatcher, this is a special number three. He's just like,

Speaker 6:          11:52          okay, let me just call the Stephen Jenkinson information. I'll call the fire chief back. Try and figure this out. I'll tell you this job site right now,

Speaker 1:          12:00          right around the time that dispatch number three is making that call somehow another sheriff's dispatch or a fourth dispatch here to Charlie Walker Shack decides to put out a call for a welfare check and basically ask a couple of devotees to go to Rick's house and make sure everything's okay.

Speaker 6:          12:11          Okay. It's advised that he is in the woods and it has a handgun,

Speaker 1:          12:15          which is true. Rick says he had one in the back of the truck, but he says it wasn't loaded, but then things start to get more complicated because when dispatcher number three gets a hold of Rick's boss, the fire chief.

Speaker 6:          12:24          That's Greg. Can you just start with giving me some details? He called him. What's his issue? What's the deal? It's, it says when Rick called him, I said, Gee, if I'm out here on into woods, my wife gave to me with a gun. He just couldn't take it anymore. And then he hung up on no,

Speaker 1:          12:40          Rick denies having said anything like that to his boss and his boss. As you'll hear, it does seem to walk some of the back, but all right, thank you. Yep. Things are kind of already set in motion cause then supposedly dispatch number four relays the chief story to the deputies in route.

Speaker 6:          12:53          Wife has a signal zero handgun is chasing the male who took medication on the right. He's hallucinating or what's going on,

Speaker 1:          12:59          but then that same dispatcher does special four calls. Rick's boss, the fire chief.

Speaker 6:          13:03          Okay. Now his wife is chasing him

Speaker 1:          13:06          and he's like, well Chasey Yep.

Speaker 6:          13:08          Information that he told me to his wife had a gun,

Speaker 1:          13:11          which Rick says he said, but just that there was a gun in the house. That's it.

Speaker 6:          13:14          Uh Huh. And hottie plumber in the woods. Okay. Is she starting to kill him? You didn't say anything like that. Clarification. Male half is hiding from his wife who signaled zero with the handgun in fear of her or trying to get more. 10 43 48 four. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          13:32          And this is what Ben is talking about, about these sort of clouds of miscommunication because by the time the police show up at this house for what is normally a welfare check,

Speaker 6:          13:40          south Radio Williams, now she has a shotgun inside the house. She has pills. I'm like, Hey, what'd you got? She's chased them off into the woods. What's that address?

Speaker 1:          13:49          He's also armed, maybe even hallucinating. So the deputies, they uh,

Speaker 6:          13:54          damn dork out here were blocked out walking. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:56          I'll pull up in a blackout.

Speaker 6:          13:58          Just be careful. Um,

Speaker 1:          14:02          the nature of the police lights, they get out of the cars, they don't even turn on their flashlights and they start walking down this road to Rick's place. And one of the deputies even puts on these night vision goggles because they think this woman has chased her husband and the woods.

Speaker 6:          14:13          Supposedly he's in the woods by his house. So just send out too. And is the deputy stopped walking down this dirt road towards spritz place. Pepper first situation gets more intense. What just happened? What did you do? Get it out. Dolls Gum.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Cause like the neighbor's dog is starting to freak out, but eventually, okay, we're here. We're B six deputies get to the edge of Rick's Treadway

Speaker 6:          14:35          go. I'll call you back. Okay, thank you. Bye. Be careful.

Speaker 1:          14:38          It's actually right around here. About 40 minutes after Rick made that first call to his boss,

Speaker 6:          14:44          the Rick gets a call from the deputy. Oh, it's your fault. I bet. Higher down.

Speaker 1:          14:49          So you know the two of them talk for a while. Deputy's trying to figure out where Rick is and eventually you ask.

Speaker 4:          14:53          So say your wife's daughter, your wife's got a gun? No, I took all the guns with me except for she's got 12 gauge. Okay. Okay. Everything all right up there at the house

Speaker 1:          15:04          and Rick slate. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          15:05          Does bringing folks at the house, we're fine. Just okay. We're last to dispute. No reason to be worried.

Speaker 1:          15:11          But as the deputy is talking to Rick,

Speaker 4:          15:15          um, I must be on the phone

Speaker 1:          15:16          for the deputies start walking up Rick's driveway. They want to check on Andy so they get up to the house. Two of them walk up onto the porch. One of them, he looks through the bedroom window where Andy is and she has no reason to believe the police are anywhere on her property. She was asleep and presumably she heard a noise, grabbed the shotgun in the house and came outside. Now in this moment, all we really have to go on is what the cops said they saw, which is Andy came out through the front door wearing nothing but her underwear holding the shotgun. The cop save. They identified themselves. They were screaming at her to drop the gun. They say that Andy took a step forward, leveled the shotgun against her shoulder, and then they opened fire. If I have 24 shots, they hit Andy at least eight times. She fell to the porch. Uh, some of the police officers rushed to her, began performing first aid. Eventually they radio for an ambulance and paramedics showed up and pronounced Andy dead at the scene.

Speaker 5:          16:14          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          16:19          Did at this point, do you have any idea what happened,

Speaker 3:          16:20          honey? No, not a clue. I realized that I needed to snap out, wake up, get my ass in gear and find out what's going on. But Rick's truck

Speaker 1:          16:30          was stuck and so it took a few hours, but eventually the cops figured out where he was sent a crew over to meet him.

Speaker 3:          16:34          Yeah. The ground crew came over and picked me up, handcuffed me, and put me in the back of a pickup truck and took me to headquarters. They got them out of the car. I brought him into headquarters, put me in a room, typical interrogation type room. And then I started noticing that they were, um, being very, very friendly. Some people saying something about, you know, my, my camping equipment in the truck. I remember them, um, uh, authorizing me to have a cigarette and the broom. And then we pretty much went through the same questioning that we've gone through so far. And, uh, at which time they um, informed me that um, they had come out to the house to check on Andy and um, she had come to the door and there was an altercation and they shot and killed her.

Speaker 3:          17:21          That was the phrasing. It is pretty much, yeah. And altercation. Yes. When you hear something like that, I mean, I can't even fathom how you respond to some news like that. I still can't fathom responding to it. Did you say anything to them? Am I under arrest? Get these fucking cuffs off me. How long did it take them to, to uncuff you? I don't remember. Were you saying anything to him while you were still cuffed from that moment on? I pretty much, well, I mean, what do you say when somebody looks at you and says your wife is dead? We shot and killed her. Yeah. The, the absolute implosion of your mind. Just the searing pain. They explosive feeling the need. Do I get angry? Do I get sad? Do I break down and cry? Do I fall apart? Do I hold it together long enough to where I can figure out what the hell just happened. You know what you did what? You went out to my house in the middle of night and you shot my wife. I mean, how do you respond to that? I mean, to this day I'm still six, seven, 20, 50 times a day asking myself,

Speaker 5:          19:15          what are you talking about? You mean she can't be dead? What are you talking about? No, no.

Speaker 3:          19:28          Did you see her at all after the shooting? Yes. It's about two weeks afterwards. Where was that at? The funeral home. Um, went over to the funeral home and I'm sorry, my feet are going to sleep. Yeah, no. Um, and reached down and kiss her and um, felt the edge of what I thought was a casket move and it was that time that realized that she was on a cardboard box that just had frill on it to make it look pretty. Did you say anything to her?

Speaker 5:          20:07          Oh yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          20:13          Told her that we really need to do something about her hair because it was a mess. And the rest of what I said to her is between me and her. I you break. Yeah, no, of course. Um, take a break.

Speaker 1:          20:38          I put the microphone down. Rick got up and went over the kitchen, import himself a pretty big glass of vodka. Um, we of just walked around

Speaker 3:          20:48          the property for a while. We kept talking. Eventually Rick pulled out this computer bag that he keeps buried in his closet. Yeah. Grandma. Of all the shooters involved, it's this bag full of and the shots fired. [inaudible] all the police reports that were made about that night. Uh, medical examiner's autopsy report. Yeah. You Know How many times I've sat down and just written through all the questions I have. Yeah. The autopsy report that said that there was no sir previous surgeries really, she just had her gallbladder taken out. Is it, these are just questions that constantly kept going on. You know, coward says the, he made eye contact with her. That's deputy Thomas Calgary and she with him. Okay. So a guy is standing at the window. You've seen the elevation of the window compared to wearing wherever a six foot tall person that's standing at it.

Speaker 3:          21:36          You're really telling me that you made eye contact. Rick also has all the recordings of the police dispatch. How many times have you listened to those recordings? Countless. Nonstop. Is that like a daily thing? Hourly. He says he just can't stop asking himself. How did this happen? And then eventually a, who's got the map? Rick walked us outside, uh, diagrams back and said, Rick went back inside, came back out with this map that his lawyers had tron up. Take this map and position yourself in the positions where the shooters were at. He started having me and Ben, uh, walk through the shooting of his wife, kind of like going and placing herself where each officer was. This one down here, he's the one that testified that he couldn't see what he was shooting at. He just knew that the other guys were shooting. See, he's on the other side of the, and the other side of that tank. He watches over close to the portrait. One of the officers was, and you can see some of the bullet holes in the house. Yeah, here. There I say that's it. So bullet went through. You're tore up, tore up the uh, plastic. Then we were off the front porch over in the front yard with three. The deputies were, so they see her come out and they started moving across like this.

Speaker 5:          22:54          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          22:57          Shooting a almost naked woman on our front porch in the middle of the night in the middle of the swamp.

Speaker 5:          23:08          Fuck them.

Speaker 1:          23:46          about four months after Andrew Sheldon was shot and killed, the state attorney's office sent a letter to the Florida Department of law enforcement that it conducted investigation in the shooting saying that there'd be no charges brought against the officers stating that what they did was a quote, justifiable use of deadly force. Rick has filed a civil complaint on behalf of the estate of Andrea Sheldon. The complaint alleges each officer involved in the shooting violated civil rights, used excessive force, didn't follow training policy and procedure and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Rick. When we reached out to the Saint John's county sheriff's office, they said they could not comment on the case pending litigation.
