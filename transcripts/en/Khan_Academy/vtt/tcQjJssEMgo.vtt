00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.127
We're asked to translate and dilate the
unit circle to map it onto each circle.

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:09.285
This is the unit circle right over here;
it's centered at (0,0),

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.613
it has a radius of one. That's why we
call it a unit circle.

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.293
When they say translate, they say move it
around.

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:20.492
So that would be a translation of it.
Then dilating it means making it larger.

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:26.246
So dilating that unit circle would be
doing something like that.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:30.646
So we're going to translate and dilate this
unit circle to map it onto each circle.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:34.191
So, for example, I can translate it so
that the center is translated

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.755
to the center of that magenta circle, and
then I can dilate it

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:41.905
so that it has been mapped on to that
larger magenta circle.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:45.239
I can do that for a few more. I'm not
going to do it for all of them.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.770
This is just to give you an idea of what
we're talking about.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.235
So now I'm translating the center of
my -- it's no longer a unit circle --

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.242
I'm translating the center of my circle to
the center of the purple circle

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:59.405
and now I'm going to dilate it so it has
the same radius.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:00.896
And notice, I can map it.

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:06.235
And so if you can map one shape to another
through translation and dilation,

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:10.297
then the things are, by definition they
are going to be similar.

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:14.483
So this is really just an exercise in
seeing that all circles are similar.

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:19.510
If you just take any circle and you make
it have the same center as another circle

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.912
then you can just scale it up or down

00:01:23.912 --> 00:01:27.697
to match the circle that you moved it
to the center of.

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:28.724
So there you have it.

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:33.977
Hopefully this gives you a sense that
all circles are similar.
