00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.450
&gt;&gt;Zach: Alright, thank you! It's awesome to
be here at the company that, in many ways,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.350
made the production of this book possible
and which has multiple, multiple copies of

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.840
the book stored within its vast and comprehensive
archive of all the worlds culture already

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.690
whether it knows it or not; thanks to my Gmail
account.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.449
As Will said, I grew up in Montana where manly
men and even more impressive women kind of

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.500
run the show athletically. I, myself, as you
can probably tell from my pathetic appearance,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.520
grew up in a sort of more frail, bookish,
inward-looking child. Although, I was always

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
a big sports fan.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.611
So, from an early age I was trying to figure
out how I related to this world of sports

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:56.329
and outdoor activity in a way that made sense
for me and yet, was also true to my essentially

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.190
nerdy nature.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.520
So, a few years ago, in Portland while I was
working as a newspaper reporter, I started

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.470
writing about sports. And I, I began to gravitate
toward these sports that were, in one way

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
or another, sort of a DIY approach to sports.
And, and there were a lot of different aspects

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.640
of that in a spectrum of activities that I
felt qualified.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.110
So, that, this book kind of grew out of that
exploration of sports that were outside the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.619
realm of the mainstream, majorly professional
sports; sports that were being done by individuals

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.280
in groups, more or less self-organized or
on a DIY level.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.750
So, with that said, I'm gonna read a couple
passages that I think sort of get to what

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.750
the book is about.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:53.820
"It's amazing what you can learn with your
head jammed between two rugby player's thighs.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.080
It was a dank October evening, and I was at
work on a story about the Oregon Jesters women's

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.590
rugby team. They invited me out to a practice,
and at the coach's suggestion, I brought my

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.720
soccer cleats. I soon found myself ordered
to crouch to the scummy turf, then wedge my

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.950
head between the legs of the two players in
front of me. These women, a 'prop' and a 'hooker,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.109
applied a stubbly vice grip to my skull, pressing
from each side in an apparent effort to reduce

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:25.739
my ears to pulp. Then I reached up between
my new friend's legs to grab the waistband

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.170
of their grit-spackled shorts. I heard the
hooker growl. 'Grab crotch, not hair,' she

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.969
said. 'It sucks when that happens.'

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:41.559
'Okay.' Intimate arrangements complete, we
formed a compact human battering ram, or 'scrum'.

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:46.799
We smashed full-force into an iron sled called
the Dominator. The Dominator looked like something

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.480
that would be useful in taking out a Frankish
castle. My face was about a foot off the ground,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.000
and I could only hear barnyard squelching
as we hurled ourselves against this torture

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.279
device. Thirty seconds later, I wobbled to
my feet. 'Well done, rookie,' the prop said.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:06.449
'Well done.' I nodded my head, now smaller,
in gratitude.

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:11.749
The Jesters turf, once grass, was now reduced
to an oozy and foul-smelling black muck. From

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:16.560
here, I could see the outermost edge of the
sport's world. Lacrosse players bellowed on

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.090
the next field over. Just across the rugby
field's boundary, two guys were exercising

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.200
attack dogs. A few street lamps, orange and
hazy in the perpetual Portland mist, provided

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.029
the only light. I felt like I was in the right
place, even though I hadn't expected near

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.709
decapitation.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.809
I was writing about my new rugby friends for
Portland's alternative weekly newspaper, which

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:44.900
had drafted me out of Montana to edit its
music section in 1999. Not long after I arrived

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.260
in Portland, perhaps feeling that an endless
diet of underfed and emotionally bereft Indie

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.920
rock bands threatened to zap, sap the zest
from life, I started badgering my employer

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.739
to assign me sports stories. My editors agreed
to let me cover this self-declared beat under

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.109
the mistaken impression that I would generate
actual news about sports of interest to the

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.089
public at large. I planned to do the opposite.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:12.689
I covered bike messenger races and adult soapbox
derby. While this direction didn't exactly

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:18.350
endear me to my editors, I felt that I had
pierced the polished surface of mainstream

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.071
sports. And that was before the thing with
the rugby players thighs. So, what did it

00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:27.930
mean; all this fumbling around on the margins
of sports? I thought I detected faint but

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.400
definite tremors, something stirring underground.
Yes, the major leagues now achieved new frontiers

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.919
in hype and pomp every season, but what if,
at the same time, a revolution was taking

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.720
shape? What if a whole, alternative sporting
nation, a more perfect union of independent

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.169
athletes' nonconformist fans, wildcat leagues,
and gorilla clubs scattered across the country

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.389
could rise up and challenge the mainstream?

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.630
I began to dream big, imagining that a total
inversion of the sports power structure was

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.680
occurring just out of sight somewhere near
the rugby practice field. I admit that it

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.669
sounds a little far-fetched and dreamy, but
I knew that vaguely similar upheavals had

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.860
happened before. If you think about it, major
league sports could be the athletic equivalent

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.099
of stadium rock. The production values are
awesome, but the scale is alienating and the

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.800
egos are enormous. The bitchy, psycho-dramas
of the Kobe-Shaq Lakers recalled Fleetwood

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.900
Mac in full, wife-swapping, meltdown mode.
Tiger Woods once reminded me of James Taylor

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.370
in his bland excellence. Now we know he's
more like a less entertaining, one-man, Motley

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.650
Crue. The excesses of stadium rock, of course,
inspired punk rock, which insisted that anyone

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.909
who could play three chords could, and should,
form a band. Now, I thought, the same thing

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.979
could happen in sports. How great it would
be if I wasn't simply crazy. I thought the

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:47.750
raw ingredients for a renegade sports movement
existed, but obviously, they had yet to emerge

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.389
as an identifiable, cultural force, unless
you count self-aware, urban twenty-somethings

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.539
tendency to form dodge ball teams. Perhaps
I was engaged in wishful thinking, so I decided

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.460
to go exploring beyond the boundaries defined
by newspaper sports pages, talk radio, and

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.370
24-hour cable. I wanted to see if sports counterculture
I hoped for really existed, or if it could.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.130
As I stood on the rugby field that night,
checking my spinal column, I began to think

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.340
I was getting somewhere. If I survived, it
would be fun. So, I started to, I started

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.800
to seek out athletes and events on the sort
of stranger end of the sports world. And before

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.300
long, I found this bike race in Iowa, called
the Trans Iowa, which is organized by one

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.050
man, who's named Mark Stevenson, but who is
known to everyone as Guitar Ted because of

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.690
his teenage love for Ted Nugent. So, I knew
right away, before I even met him, that Guitar

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.759
Ted was a man after my own heart."

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.530
And the Trans Iowa sounded like something
I needed to check out. It was a 300 mile endurance

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.159
race that begins at 4 o'clock in the morning
in a small town, leads the participants through

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:59.919
the middle-of-nowhere Iowa farm company, Iowa
farm country for hours on end with no support,

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.999
no kind of outside assistance, nothing like
the Tour de France style, cars driving alongside

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:11.740
them with spare bikes and, you know, extra
drugs if they need them. So, nonetheless,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.409
this sport was a, this event was attracting
dozens of participants from all over the country

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.099
and seemed to have kind of a little bit of
a, sort of an underground legend growing around

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:25.301
it. So, I went to Iowa to, to track the Trans
Iowa and meet Guitar Ted. And this a little

00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:29.249
bit of what occurred.

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:36.300
Hawkeye, Iowa, population 489. At Trinity
Lutheran Church, the sign announces that at

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.240
8 am, just six hours from now, Pastor Mike
Horn will deliver a sermon entitled, 'Safe

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.650
in God's Hands.' A spooky moon shines down.
I am not wearing pants. Leaning into the passenger

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.810
side door, I rummage around inside the red
Pretender, my rented Pontiac pseudo sports

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.540
car, fighting the entropic storm of granola
bar wrappers, empty soda cans, separating

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.580
gas station coffee cups, crumpled clothes,
and dried yellow-tan mud. I find my thermal

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.499
long johns, hop around on the cold gravel
as I pull them on, then step into car hard

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:17.830
cargo pants and hiking boots crusty with grime.
The good people of Hawkeye can now rest easy;

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.389
not that local sensibility seemed too delicate.
Ten minutes before, a pickup truck lumbered

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:26.990
around the corner at the tell-tale pace of
a DUI dodger and bumbled over the curb and

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.449
into the middle of the lawn across the street.
A woman jumped out and sprinted inside the

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:37.469
house. She left the driver's side door open.
She left the country radio station on, blaring.

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:42.959
The latest Nashville hits now pound through
Hawkeye's half dozen comatose streets. First,

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:48.130
I expect the cops to come. Then I realize
there probably aren't any. Ten yards away,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:53.830
a man called Guitar Ted leans against his
car, a blue, beat to shit Honda. He's drinking

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.850
Red Bull, talking. Since 4 o'clock the previous
morning, I followed Guitar Ted down hundreds

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.870
of miles of dirt roads and two lane highways,
with long frequent stops; he's been drinking

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.360
Red Bull and talking pretty much the entire
time. 'Man, some of these people in these

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.890
small Iowa towns,' he continues, pointing
over at the pickup truck between poles at

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.760
his little aluminum can. 'They're bad; I mean
they can get wild. You think these farm towns

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.111
would be all nice and quiet and traditional
small-town America, and I guess in a sense

00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:26.089
they are, but when the bars close.' I can't
really follow it. I like Guitar Ted a lot.

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:29.839
Caravan with a man for 22 straight hours and
he either becomes your temporary brother,

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:35.519
or an enemy for life. But, Jesus Christ, like
I said, 22 hours; he shows no signs of weakness,

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:38.300
exhaustion, or imminent silence.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.570
Right now, I could strangle Guitar Ted through
his wolf man beard, curl up on Trinity's porch

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.850
and beg Pastor Mike for forgiveness and sanctuary,
'safe in God's hands'. This whole thing, pogoing

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.620
around pantless in some forsaken hamlet on
a diet of power bars and gas station coffee,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.529
waiting in the deep-freeze for a pack of bicyclists,
for the love of God? Right now, I blame Guitar

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:08.100
Ted. We are tracking the Trans Iowa, a 300
plus mile, non-stop, endurance bike race through

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:14.410
some of Iowa's most beautiful and least vehicle
hospitable quadrants. A race, entirely the

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.339
product of Guitar Ted's febrile mind. He is
the race commissioner, course designer, referee,

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:27.280
time-keeper, logistician, and prize committee.
I guess that makes me the press corps. The

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.680
Trans Iowa enjoys no sanction from any official
cycling organization, no status with any kind

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.640
of recognized competitive framework, it charges
no entry fee, and offers no cash prize of

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.540
value greater than the price of a bottle of
whiskey. It provides no support, no course

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.940
marking aside from Guitar Ted and, in this
case, me, standing roadside every 50 miles

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.430
or so, and operates on a strict 'every man
for himself' basis as far as health and safety

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.410
go. It traverses roads that Iowa transportation
authorities see fit to post with 'Enter at

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.230
Your Own Risk' signs.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.300
The previous year, rain turned the course
into a mud sluice and not a single contestant

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.829
finished. Still, about 60 riders started Trans
Iowa version three at 4 o'clock yesterday

00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:14.000
morning. At least a few of them are still
alive and on course. In Hawkeye, Guitar Ted

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.310
and I hope to catch sight of the leader, a
rider named Ira Ryan. 'You're pretty much

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:24.089
guaranteed a bar fight at 2 am in any one
of ooh, light,' Guitar Ted points down the

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:29.209
deserted road, past the pickup truck. A tiny,
blinking, white speck wobbles just beyond

00:11:29.209 --> 00:11:34.460
the weak penumbra of one of Hawkeye's few
streetlights. Ira Ryan, a bony shard of a

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.250
man in a red windbreaker and Lycra tights,
takes shape out of the gloom, canted forward

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:44.620
over the handlebars of gunmetal, gray bike
he welded together himself. Ira is a 30 year

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.769
old native Iowan, a professional custom bike
frame builder, a cycling zealot, and by virtue

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:55.470
of winning the first and only completed Trans
Iowa back in 2005, the events current defending

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:01.480
champion. As he blows past us, Ira crushes
his petal with an automatic remorselessness,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.730
steering by glazed stare. Later, he doesn't
remember much about this scene. Hawkeye itself,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.310
he recalls, is a smudge in the periphery,
indistinguishable amid visual hallucinations

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:17.019
of phantom cows and ghostly rival cyclists
and split seconds of lost consciousness. At

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:22.149
this point, Ira has ridden over 200 miles
with no sleep; the brain chemistry gets a

00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:26.740
little dicey. As Ira's flashing taillight
fades into the darkness at Hawkeye's far end,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:34.540
I, likewise, feel delirium setting in. Of
course, delirium is the Trans Iowa's point."

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:43.040
So, I'll let you all discover the rest of
the glory of the Trans Iowa, if you so desire.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.481
But, beyond self torture of this sort, and
Ira specifically said that one of the things

00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:55.009
that motivates his cycling career is his love
of the "glory of suffering," as he puts it.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:13:00.949
On a less, sort of painful level, a lot of
what this book is about is this sort of joy

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:04.800
of participating in things and doing things
yourself, even if you're not particularly

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:11.569
good at them. Particularly, if you can do
it in a way that feeds your social life, or

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:17.431
enriches your sphere of acquaintances or circle
of friends or things like that. It's, a lot

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:21.670
of the book is about the sort of the social
side of sports and the exuberant joy that

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.810
you can find playing games with your friends,
or making new friends through sports. So,

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:31.500
I'm gonna conclude with one more passage,
which is about a soccer team that I was on

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.740
about 12 years ago in my hometown in Montana,
called "The Carnies."

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.440
"The global soccer explosion, well under way
elsewhere, hadn't quite happened yet in late

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.029
1990s Missoula. Social trends tend to wash
over Montana about a decade late and about

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:54.560
half the time, this is a good thing. Isolation
breeds creativity, so my friends and I were

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.920
used to making our own fun. Sometimes, that
meant hauling a rented generator down to the

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.529
riverside to power a show by an extreme leftist
punk band on tour from North Dakota. All too

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:11.500
often, it meant weekends aptly described as
lost. In '97 and '98, it meant the Carnies

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:18.060
football club. The Carnies wore black t-shirts.
Our team crest consisted of a hand drawn shield

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:25.410
bearing a skull, a switchblade, and a bottle
marked 'XXX.' When I solicited a sponsorship

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:31.940
at a local sports bar, the owner gave me a
blank look and said, 'Soccer, huh? Well, I

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:38.060
guess. We wanna see you guys in here after
every game, ordering plenty of beer. You think

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.449
you can do that, buddy?' I thought we could.
I can't say for sure, but I feel confident

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:47.610
that Missoula Coed Division One never before
saw, and never again would see, a team as

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:53.370
awful as us. For our debut match, about 30
rookie Carnies, lured perhaps by the team

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:58.899
captains talk of 'plenty of beer', showed
up. Our sideline resembled a protest against

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.620
the World Trade Organization, and every substitution
opportunity devolved into total chaos. If

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.779
memory serves, we trailed a well-kempt team
from a law firm 5-nil at half-time. The referee,

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:15.110
a tallow skinned, 50-something character,
who wore a vintage Santos FC warm-up suit

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:21.519
and chain smoked throughout the entire half-time,
strolled over. 'Captain,' he said. 'You've

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:26.899
got to get your team organized.' I didn't
ask if he had any tear gas I could borrow.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:31.950
We did bag a consolation goal in the second
half. A Carnies striker, one of the handful

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:38.079
of our players with real playing experience,
nailed a scorcher from 25 yards out. A fantastic

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:42.339
goal from any perspective, it must have looked
especially beautiful to him, because he was

00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:45.889
on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time.

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:52.040
As the season progressed, the Carnies improved
a little. A Belarusian man, named Pavel, a

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.520
paternal gent with salt and pepper hair who
none of us had ever met, mysteriously started

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.630
showing up promptly at game time to play for
us every week. He proved good for a couple

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.610
goals a game.
Our pugnacious goalkeeper, a National Guardsman

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.170
who both served in Afghanistan and played
bass in Missoula's most venerable punk band,

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.399
put a little muscle in our defense. So did
the linebacker from the Montana's Grizzlies

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:18.990
football, the other kind, team, recruited
by my brother who spent much of his time in

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.490
Carnies black trying to start fights with
opposing players. Our female players, it turned

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.180
out, were much better than our men. For some
reason, the Carnie women tended to be more

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.100
physically fit and less lifestyle impaired
than their male counterparts. I don't know

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:38.699
why. Other teams, genuine amateur athletes
seeking bonified recreational competition,

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:44.170
I suppose, seemed unimpressed by our freewheeling
approach to the game. 'This is ridiculous,'

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:50.019
one snotty hotshot whined to our referee.
'These guys don't belong out here.' His team

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:54.730
had just scored three goals in 15 minutes
while dodging homicidal slide tackles, so

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.970
maybe he had a point. That didn't stop me
from screaming, 'That was for you, motherfucker,'

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:06.400
when we, Pavel, leveled the score in a game
that we, meaning Pavel, almost stole. The

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.410
Carnies put together an immaculate, winless
streak. No other team, however, could match

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:16.260
our party record. About half the core squad,
including me, lived in a nine bedroom, decommissioned

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.470
nunnery behind Missoula's oldest Catholic
church. By post-match midnight, a choreographed

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:26.580
wrestling match usually took place in the
living room with Heinz 57 used as fake blood.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.890
We discussed tactics, technique, and line-ups,
but soon enough the day's soccer results started

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:36.310
to feel irrelevant, compared to the olive
oil belly flop contests on the kitchen floor.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:42.170
Sadly, Pavel never joined us. I believe he
was a religious man."

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:48.100
So that will conclude the reading portion
of today's events. If anyone has any questions

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.700
for some perverse reason, I will do my best
to provide an equally perverse answer. But

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.830
if not, thanks very much.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:18:01.280
[applause]

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280
Questions?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.280
You, sir.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.230
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Yes, you say you--

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.780
&gt;&gt;Zach: To the mic. This is being recorded
for posterity.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.341
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Thank you very much for coming,
Zach. You said you remain a sports fan and

00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:25.500
I just wanted to hear kind of your take on
the media that surrounds famous, almost celebrities,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.540
or sports stars, like, kind of all the media
around Tiger Woods and--

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.540
&gt;&gt;Zach: Sure.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.540
&gt;&gt;membermale1: his slew of--

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.340
&gt;&gt;Zach: His incredible conquest--

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.340
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Yes.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.340
&gt;&gt;Zach: record, yes.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.340
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Exactly. And, and, another--

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.500
&gt;&gt;Zach: I mean, he is a cute guy, but you
know, he's got kind of a built-in advantage

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.920
of having so much cash. You know, yesterday
I was sitting in a, in a restaurant here in

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.560
San Francisco, eating lunch and they had the
TV on with the sound off and it was one of

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.740
these, sort of, sports, sports writer, round
table discussion shows featuring, you know,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.670
these crusty, ancient, dinosaur sports columnists
from newspapers around the country. And they

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.750
had a, you know, it was one of these things
that you see on CNN or ESPN, where there's

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.500
the four screen, the four sections of the
screen and it's one man's face in each of

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.500
the screens and they were all talking. And
I don't even know what they were talking about

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.520
because the sound was off. And these four,
old, white dudes were sitting up there like

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.170
and they're all talking, they were moving
their hands and like, gesticulating at one

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.810
another and you couldn't hear 'em and you
lost nothing with the sound being off. I mean,

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:26.020
it's like, a lot of the-, it's, this is not
unique to sports, obviously. This is a sort

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.660
of a plague that infests our culture, but
a lot of the discussion about sports in this

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.330
country is just people talking, and not saying
anything. The appetite for sports information

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.390
and the sort of commercial demand for it has
grown to the point where 90% of what you see

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.960
and hear and read it, about sports isn't really
about sports at all. It's about the business

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.970
side of things, or celebrity gossip about,
you know, whatever terrible offense against

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:56.620
common decency that Ben Roethlisberger has
recently committed. And, I, I guess part of

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.930
the reason I wrote the book was the desire
to cut through all of that, not saying that

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.840
mainstream sports or big time sports are illegitimate,
obviously they have a huge audience, and I'm

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:12.450
part of that audience. But, to say that, you
know, that stuff is not what really what sport

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.760
is about. I mean, sport is about experiencing
things, doing things that you otherwise wouldn't

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.630
do, having fun, and getting out there and
being part of the world rather than passively

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:29.030
sitting back and listening to this endless
stream of garbage about Tiger Woods or what

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.710
are, you know, whatever the topic du jour
is. So, I guess that's, you know, my response

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:38.680
that I would give. The book is sort of an
attempt to kind of like, claw some real meaning

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.650
out of sports and drag it away from those
people that are just, you know, jabber jawing

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.650
about it all the time.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.740
Miss.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.330
Go to the mic.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.770
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: I'm just wondering if you
have any thoughts on like, the gym culture,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.810
gym rats, people who like, pump iron?

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:03.530
&gt;&gt;Zach: I mean, I, I've been a member of a
gym and I, I don't, I would never discourage

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:08.130
anyone from trying to be healthy or fit, except
a lot of people think I am with this book

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:15.690
that's all about, you know, terrible, drunken,
mad cap antics. But, I find it a little bit

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:21.250
depressing. You know, I find, I find when
I walk past a gym in any city, I look through

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:27.600
the window and I see ranks and ranks of people
on treadmills with their ear buds in, watching

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.211
Fox News or CNN or ESPN, and going like this

00:21:30.211 --> 00:21:31.330
[footsteps]

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.470
I, I just, you know, it's almost s-, like
a suicidal; makes me feel almost suicidal.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.130
The, and it's kinda, you know

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.130
[sighs]

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.800
you know, sports are sport or athletic activity,
one thing that is an underappreciated thing

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.871
about it, is it's kind of funny. Like, at
least at the level that I do it, the level,

00:21:51.871 --> 00:21:57.410
a lot of people do sports on, it's like, it's
kind of ridiculous. I play soccer for this

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:04.200
team called The Unicorns now. We often get
beaten very badly. I am a terrible player.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.530
So, it's, it's, you know, in addition to like,
you know, exercise or staying fit or whatever,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.551
it's also an, sports also provide me, personally,
an opportunity to sort of laugh at myself.

00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:21.130
I feel like that unseriousness is lacking
in, in the gym world. It's sort of like, in

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:28.250
the, in the minds of the gym owners of America,
all Americans are like, thoroughbred horses.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.010
They just need to be like, pumped full of
specialty beverages and like, run really hard

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.050
and then toweled off and sent back out to
the pasture. I, you know, I mean, I'm, I'm

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.142
not saying that it doesn't have a place in
the world, but there's more to life.

00:22:40.142 --> 00:22:50.660
&gt;&gt;membermale3: There's been like a recent
in surge, I guess like, increase in organized

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.590
competitions of alternative stuff--

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.590
&gt;&gt;Zach: Yeah.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:58.390
&gt;&gt;membermale3: There's this thing called "The
Tough Mudder" in New York where they go on

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.290
this mountain that's usually a ski mountain
and there--

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.270
It's like, in April so it's really muddy--

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.270
&gt;&gt;Zach: Right.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.170
&gt;&gt;membermale3: and you're running up the mountains.
It's an obstacle course--

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.630
and doing all this stuff. There's one in England
called "The Tough Guy Challenge" and I guess

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.970
it's been going on for like, a couple decades.
Do you see like an increase in that kind of

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:20.780
organized sort of different type of sport?

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.280
&gt;&gt;Zach: Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are,
there are, literally hundreds or probably

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.860
thousands of sports and events that I could
have put in the book, but I didn't for, you

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.570
know, simply trying not to drive myself too
insane. I mean, there's this thing in Tennessee

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.690
called "The Barkley Marathon", which is this
like, harrowing sounding endurance marathon

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:43.690
through basically, like, it sounds like, the
world's most inhospitable terrain. Like, there's

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.450
this forest of sticker bushes in Tennessee
that they make these guys run through and

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.740
essentially, no one has ever finished it.
Just to up the ante, the organizer serves

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.370
all the participants a mandatory dinner of
uncooked chicken the night before--

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.370
[laughter]

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:02.650
so, anyway, this is getting us off the topic
and into something quite disgusting. But,

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.500
I think that, you know, I mean this is gonna
sound like a cliché, especially being at

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.741
Google, but the fact that the Internet now
allows people to organize on such a sort of

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:18.600
spontaneous and seamless basis has created
this exponential increase in these kind of

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600
DIY events.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.620
&gt;&gt;malemember3: Do you think, I feel like San
Francisco would be like a great place, there's

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.290
a lot, there would be a lot of activity there.
But, what city have you seen that's, is--

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:33.220
&gt;&gt;Zach: Well, I, I mean, solely for the purposes
of my own laziness and limited budget, I did

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.000
a lot of the book in my home city of Portland.
But, I think, you know, there's a, there's

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.500
a sort of, as I describe them, the "left coast
nerd cities" which I would, I would categorize

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:48.180
San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, and
probably Vancouver, British Columbia in that

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:54.960
group. These cities that tend to attract and
foster these sort of, I don't know what you

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:03.700
would call them, alternative approaches to
fun and also have a-, enough critical mass

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.810
of people that are interested in doing different
things that they, that they spawn endless

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.550
numbers of these groups. So, Portland's a
great one. You know, but it was impressive

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:18.630
to see things thriving in places like Iowa.
I went to Austin, Texas for the Roller Derby

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:25.121
National Championships. Austin is like, the
global capital of roller derby. There's things

00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:29.800
all over the country, you know, I mean, and
that, that was one really nice aspect of working

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.490
on the book is just discovering like, "Oh,
yeah!" Rediscovering, in my case since I'm

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.630
from Montana and I'm totally aware that people
in quote-unquote, fly over country, have,

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.001
you know, all these weird things that they
do. But, discovering that all over the country

00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:44.820
there are these cool events and cool people
that are putting things together. I don't

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.060
know if that answers your question, but I'm
done talking about it now.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.190
[audience chuckles]

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:56.820
&gt;&gt;memberfemale4: So, you just kind of briefly
mentioned that like, the Internet has-, allows

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:01.390
people to organize these types of things a
little bit more and kind of gives that access

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:06.802
to more people and also with just more media
in general, like if you get, you know, a really

00:26:06.802 --> 00:26:10.580
big TV package you can get channels that's
like the alternative sports or those types

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.990
of things.
How ever else do you think, and I don't know

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.410
if you touch on this in the book or not, but
some of that mass media also contributes to

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.410
the dilution--

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.410
&gt;&gt;Zach: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:24.030
&gt;&gt;memberfemale4: so what is kinda your, I
guess, opinion on kinda what is that fine

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:28.650
line having media be a good thing to kind
of bring exposure to all these sports, but

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.760
then also media being part of the, the problem
in diluting the--

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.660
&gt;&gt;Zach: Well, I think roller derby is an interesting
example of a sport that is confronting this

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.230
issue right now. I mean, roller derby has
gotten a tremendous, since roller derby was

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:46.690
revived less than a decade ago, it's very
serious, but also, it's an interesting thing.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:51.990
It's seriously competitive; it has a frivolous
sort of image of women in tight outfits with

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.120
weird names, fighting each other on a track
and bands playing at half-time and everybody

00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:02.860
getting really drunk. But, it has also spawned
this incredible proliferation of national

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.150
leagues, or teams, city leagues around the
country and then national competition and

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.510
very serious tournaments.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:13.630
And yet, most of the media attraction it has
intent-, it has attracted has focused on the

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.260
sort of superficial side of its appeal, which
is these kind of rock and roll chicks who

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.450
like to fight and beat each other up. They
don't ever, the media coverage rarely delves

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:27.481
into the seriousness and the sort of, the
intense nature of the sport. I mean, if you

00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:32.370
watch two of the top roller derby teams in
the country go at it with something on the

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:37.140
line, it's as intense as anything you can
imagine. It's like the Yankees and Red Sox

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.390
in the seventh game of the LCS or something.
I mean, it's just the animosity, the tactics,

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.750
the speed, the strength, the damage, the bruising.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:51.180
So, here's a sport that's obviously found
some sort of unlooked for, unexpected national

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.790
success. It's attracted a fair amount of media
attention. There's a Drew Barrymore movie

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.990
which I actually thought was pretty good,
I was pleasantly surprised I guess I would

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:07.100
say. But yet, what is really, what I found
really special about it, which is the, this

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.811
sort of grass roots manifestation of sports
for that basically attracts people that were

00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:17.460
never involved in sports before, it kind of
gets pushed to the wayside. And they're definitely

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.030
wrestling with, with what sort of television
coverage they want, what kind of media coverage

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:28.510
they think is appropriate, what sort of level
of sponsorship or involvement with outside

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:34.390
financing they can deal with while continuing
to maintain control of the sport at sort of

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.391
grass roots nature. So I think that there
comes a point where it's a fine line.

00:28:38.391 --> 00:28:42.820
I mean, you know, I don't think that, I don't
think the guys at the Trans Iowa really need

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:48.930
to worry about this issue so much, but I think
that, you know, when something like roller

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.780
derby or bike polo, which is another sport
that's gone from being, you know, a scrappy

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:58.230
sportplayed by about 15 people around the
country, to having a very recognizable core

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.221
of national or international support. Eventually,
it gets to the point where you have to say,

00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:06.450
"Well, what's going to happen to our sport?
Is it going to become just another part of

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:13.660
the sort of mainstream sports or alternative
sports or extreme sports spectrum, where TV

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:19.150
and corporate sponsorship play a role? Or
do we keep it, or do our best to keep it underground?"

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.480
I don't know if there's a right answer to
that question, but there's certainly a time

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.110
when a line is crossed. And I think it's about
the time when a player cashes the first check

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.110
from Red Bull.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:39.560
Anything else? All right, seeing none. Thanks
very much and thanks a lot.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:39.640
