00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 We all passed through miserable moments where we felt ready to eat anything. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.800
 But, what if your only choice: human flesh? 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.700
 Most of us have heard of eating the instance, but what will happen if people eat? 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.780
 In principle, if we look at insects, snails, fish and amphibians, we will see that they eat each other a lot. 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.000
 For example, the mother's cancerous spider puts non-fertilized eggs for its young to eat, 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.280
 Once they have finished eating the eggs, they offer themselves a night in a process called Matriphagy, 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.820
 But for mammals, eat a rare instance. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.400
 It is usually due to environmental stresses, such as with rabbits when young children eat at difficult situations. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.500
 French paleontologists found human bones of a primitive human being a hundred thousand years old. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
 Bone fractures appeared to extract the brain and eat the brain. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.960
 And traces of cutting with a tool indicating that the tongue and thigh were also eaten. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.400
 Even in the 20th century, the use of the analogy was used for medical reasons when human blood was prescribed treatment for some. 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.140
 This brings us back to the first question, 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.080
 You are at risk for any blood-transmitted disease such as hepatitis or Ebola that the victim may be carrying. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.660
 As well as the risk of infection of E. coli bacteria and gastrointestinal bacteria at the victim. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.360
 Speaking of blood, we certainly have red meat. This is due to myoglobin (a protein linked to iron and oxygen, found in the muscle tissue). 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 What is your nutritional value? 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.120
 Hassan, your thigh is worth about ten thousand calories, and your heart seven hundred calories, and your body full eighty-one thousand calories. 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.620
 But about half of those calories come from fat or fatty tissue, which means you are not the most appropriate option for dieters. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 Although the pastries say that our taste is between pork and calf, and nice cooking robots we classified as bacon, 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 There is still a greater risk in the so-called primitives. 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 Though not fully understood, prions are copies of a normal protein that has been altered so that it loses its function and becomes contagious. 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.580
 Distorted proteins can distort similar healthy proteins, causing a chain reaction and disease. 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.140
 Precisely, the disease causes brain disease in the brain, giving it a spongy appearance and, ultimately, death. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 However, unlike viruses, bacteria, fungus or parasitic infections that contain DNA or ribosomal DNA, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Braids do not contain nucleic acids, which means they do not kill by radiation or heat 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.000
 These infectious glands may exist in any of the nerve tissues including organs and muscles. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.700
 But they are more common in the brain and spinal nerve tissue. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.020
 That is, the risk of infection is high if you consume meat containing the primates. 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.000
 All the brain, and the risk will rise dramatically! 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 In the 1950s, researchers discovered that a number of members of the Furai tribe (tribe in Papua, New Guinea) 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 Suffering from a disease called Kuro or Laughter Disease. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.000
 The disease loses the human control of his feelings and then the functions of his body, and eventually subject him to death. 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.680
 It turns out that Kuro was (Bryon's disease) caused by their funerary rituals. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.320
 The Faurai believe that it is better to eat the dead they love rather than to eat worms and insects. 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 The weather is believed to have died down, but the incubation of the Prairian disease could last for 50 years. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That is, other cases of the disease may appear. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Therefore, although cannibalism is not necessarily harmful to you, especially if the meat is free of prairies, 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 But the risk of infection is high, and nothing worth the risk! 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 Be a beef steak, unless you are a human being, there are a lot of creatures that eat like them, keep going! 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.680
 See our section on the strangest ten creatures you eat in nature, here. 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.240
