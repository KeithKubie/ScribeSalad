you know I often speak about an
 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.519
you know I often speak about an
innovation ecosystem and and I say that

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
innovation ecosystem and and I say that
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.340
innovation ecosystem and and I say that
there are four key things that such an

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350
there are four key things that such an
 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.940
there are four key things that such an
ecosystem has to possess the first is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
ecosystem has to possess the first is
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490
ecosystem has to possess the first is
strategic focus and that strategic focus

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
strategic focus and that strategic focus
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.890
strategic focus and that strategic focus
can be a national strategic focus which

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
can be a national strategic focus which
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.550
can be a national strategic focus which

about you know what the big issues are

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
about you know what the big issues are
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.769

what are the great things we need to

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:36.569
what are the great things we need to
 

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.619
what are the great things we need to
think about it's always important

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
think about it's always important
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.009
think about it's always important
because it helps to sort of size the

key element is capital but when people

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
key element is capital but when people

think of capital they tend to think of

think of capital they tend to think of
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.680
think of capital they tend to think of
financial capital and it is one key

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
financial capital and it is one key

doesn't matter because there won't be
