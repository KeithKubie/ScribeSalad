WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
Do you know what?
I'll see you later,
man.
Five oh three two

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.350
[inaudible] and we're live.
Yes,
dude.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.390
Fucking crazy weekend.
Huh?
What the hell?
Watch those three title fights.

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.583
That was like,

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.110
he was really funny because we were talking about this and you were like,

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.490
this is probably one of the best cards ever,

7
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:25.200
but we have a high likelihood of all decisions.
Yeah,
yeah.
Boy was I wrong.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.460
Goddamn was I wrong?
I make some good pics but every now and then I just,

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.660
I looked at the matchup.
I'm like,

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.050
everyone's so close in competition and skill wise.
I was like,

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.330
we're going to get a lot of decisions,

12
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.780
which I don't mind and then as we're watching,
I'm glad I was wrong.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.560
As you're watching like coal Lee Shit,
best UFC card ever.

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.130
I don't know what was the most surprising outcome too.

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.690
It's like did you just crack yourself and just hit the antlers?
Jamie,
a CTA.

16
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.830
Just rent.
I told you there was a bad idea to put that thing there.
All right,

17
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:57.540
we're going to put it out like a red light.

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.670
We've got an elk antler right over near with Jamie has to want it.

19
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.580
It's the,
it's the hat with a brim,

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.100
like the brim flock been there forever and I'm not stare right.

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.530
Racial awareness and getting used to the space.
Fuck man.
Um,

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.560
so I think maybe one of the most impressive things or confusing or unexpected

23
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.960
was how fucking good GSP looked.

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.110
That dude's gone for four years,

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
comes back and immediately I see them moving around and popping a jab and I'm

26
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.970
like,
Jesus Christ,
he looks like GSP.

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.010
He now hold.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see.
I wasn't,
I wasn't that.

28
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.080
And everyone's like,
oh,
here's Schild the hate or no,

29
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.620
I wasn't that in love with GSPS performance.

30
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.120
I thought he looked good.
I thought he looked heavy.
I didn't think he looked as,

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
you know,
obviously he put on some pounds thick.
He was thick,
thick,

32
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.520
like three musketeer thick.
I thought he put,
he put on some pounds in his cardio,

33
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:00.030
wasn't that great.
And yet could go for days before.
Yeah,

34
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.580
he definitely was suffering a little bit because of that.

35
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.210
And also it has to be a big factor for years off just the nerves and all the

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.320
huge factor and a struggle to hold Bisbing down.

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.670
This makes fucking heart and you know,

38
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:14.160
honestly taking him down was one of the worst things that could have happened.

39
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.510
He got cut the fuck up.

40
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:18.870
It's been top work down there and when I was worried if it went to decision,

41
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.490
I thought Bisping's actually winning even though just he got him down for that

42
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:25.050
portion.
If the,
if the,

43
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:29.100
hopefully the judges see that Bisping's doing the damage done that should count

44
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:30.510
in their eyes.
I agree.

45
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530
I agree 100% the only time that's ever really counted though in a,

46
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.860
in a fight is Kevin Randleman versus boss Rutan.
Remember Kevin Random?

47
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.920
I took boss written down,

48
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.640
but bas Rutten was beating the shit out of him from the bottom and random and

49
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:42.480
dude and do anything in bed.

50
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.160
A lot of people who are super outraged after that decision.
Yeah,

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.920
that was a weird one because most of the fight was spent with boss on the bottom

52
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.740
and random and on top.
That's old school.
I think,

53
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.610
I think just be obviously looked great.
Pass the test.
I didn't see,

54
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.290
I always look what's next.
I didn't think,

55
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.190
I thought Bisping was super hesitant because for this reason they trained

56
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.001
earlier.
Right.

57
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.630
They train in 2008 and I guess I guess 2006 so a while ago I guess GSB just kind

58
00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:10.870
of mopped the floor with them,
like kind of do whatever we want.

59
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.330
So then I think GSPs camp and their,
their thinking was all right,

60
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.480
middle middleweights really not where we should be at,

61
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.030
but business is kind of easy picking for us.

62
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.400
We might as well go get the belt from here if we're going to do this big

63
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.840
comeback.
So I,

64
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.840
so I think he thought it was a good match up and I think because they trained

65
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.560
prior that wasn't normal busy being busy and pushes the pace.

66
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:32.690
I think he was so worried about the takedown.
Rightfully so.
I don't,

67
00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.410
I don't think that business Dan looked great to me either.
No,

68
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
he looked very super hesitant and staff and he looked like father time was like,

69
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.510
Yo man,
tonight,
tonight,
I don't think it was a father time thing.

70
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.511
I think it was in the back of his mind and he was very openly admitting that GSP

71
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.650
dominated those training sessions that they had in 2006 and he was saying,
look,

72
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.290
I'm much better than I was back then,
which I'm sure he is,

73
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.580
but you can only get so much better.
It's also a mental thing like,

74
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.440
like Dan when he did that and he's impossible to get off.
So yeah,

75
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.420
I think he was very reserved,
but I just,
I thought again,

76
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.670
I thought after four years,
hell yeah George,
like good.

77
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.540
Did George looked good enough to beat like a Whitaker or Yoel Romero?

78
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.960
Probably not.
Not to hate on his,
not to hate on what's going on right now.

79
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:17.860
Cause the epic night,

80
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.960
I just look at the real middle weights gaining Whitaker,
UL,
Luke,

81
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.020
Rockhold.
It went with those cardio problems.
I was like,

82
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.980
this was a fun one and you're crazy if you think he's gonna fight again.

83
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.900
85 they didn't happen?
I don't think so either.

84
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.610
I can promise you that's not happening.

85
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.250
I think he drops right back down and wants to fight and Woodley neck.
Yeah.

86
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.370
When I was thinking about him fighting and Woodley's no fucking picnic.

87
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.030
That's not a cakewalk.
Matchup wise,
it's very tough for GSP.

88
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.910
We know Woodley's been dealing with a shoulder injury.

89
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.870
He hurt his shoulder pretty bad in that fight early in the Thompson fight.

90
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.040
And so what he does about that is what?
That,
that that's what,

91
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.120
that's what's up in the air.
If he chooses to have surgery,
I believe he has.

92
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.970
I don't know if he's talked about it,
but I think he has a labor.
I'm tear.

93
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.820
So it was the question is what he decides to do about that.

94
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.090
I heard him say about Colby Covington and we should talk about him.

95
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:11.350
He's killing me.
Right.
Leave it.
Yeah,
but a good way.
But he was saying,
he goes,

96
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.130
yeah,
my shoulder's messed up,
but it's good enough where I could whip Colbys ass.

97
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.840
That was a good enough to whip GSP.
Probably not,
but Whitaker's out to.
Yeah.

98
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.430
If you,
if it occurs almost back,
if they do another intern belt had welterweight,

99
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.010
I'm going to bus,
I'm going to freak out if there's more intern belt on.

100
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.340
Where the fuck out?
If they do,
who would do,
what would they do?
Well,

101
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:35.020
if Woodley has to do surgery and then GSPs one Covington.
Oh my God.

102
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.520
Or GSP versus someone down there.
GSP versus somewhere.
We get a lot of press.
Yep.

103
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.170
They think they got over a million paper view by Saturday night.
I hope so.
Yeah.

104
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.920
I hope so.

105
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.160
I thought I thought it was going to do around seven hundreds they might've got a

106
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.550
million just from Canada.
They said Canada was tracking higher than the paper.

107
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.690
The paper view for Mayweather versus Macgregor.
Yeah.
Canada.
Come on.

108
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.250
Canada's crazy for GSP Robinson,
GSP.

109
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 1>I mean he won the athlete of the year back in the UFC was like not nearly as</v>

110
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.540
popular.
It's true.
He's gray.
Rhonda and pre Connor.

111
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.080
He won athlete of the year till now.
I'll see.
There's the Conor McGregor effect,

112
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:10.460
but there's no one that you'll see.

113
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.430
You can go to Canada and sell out the bell center.
Do you know giant Trump?

114
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.670
Now you can do that.
His next fight,
you can go up there and do that.
Oh my God,

115
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.720
his next fight.
Now he's the middle weight champion of the world.
Holy Shit.

116
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.410
Jesus Christ known as contract.
And Dana said this,

117
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.770
but contracts are like pinky swears in the UFC there kind of like,
all right,

118
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.850
whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

119
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.630
I think you know in his contract he has east end,

120
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.100
he said this and it's in his contract.

121
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:37.700
He has to defend the middle for the middleweight title.
But again,

122
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.000
I don't think it's gonna happen cause you hear if Freddie Roach talked about how

123
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.690
85 is not where he wants to be at when they asked him what's next.

124
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.790
And then also remember all this adds up.

125
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.040
It's easy to figure out enough to be fucking Sherlock Holmes.

126
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.790
Whitaker was cage side.
If that fight was next,
the way you rip your promos,

127
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.620
bring Whitaker into the cage.
They're like,
Nah son,
you're good.
You sit there,

128
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.150
you ain't coming in here.
We don't need that right now.
Sober.
October's over.

129
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.640
It's definitely over.
Yeah.

130
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.760
I don't know man Whittaker a I'm sure would want that fight,
but hell yeah.

131
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.150
You want that fight.
I don't think GSP was ever really considering it.
No,
I don't.

132
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.470
It's just not a possibility.
I think Julie's next,
but yeah,

133
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.990
with Woodley injured,
here's the real queasy question.
Um,

134
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.430
if Connor defends against Tony,
and that's a big fight,

135
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.070
which I heard is a march.
That's the rumors.

136
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.330
What do you think about GSP versus God?
I know,
right?

137
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.010
I'm whispering because it's crazy.

138
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.130
A lot of things have to happen in order for that to line up.
So condoms,

139
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.470
Tony Little weight,
which I think he's down to do.

140
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:49.050
He was a gorilla when I interviewed him at the weigh ins and I put my arm on it.

141
00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:54.020
I was like,
fuck dude,
he's giant.
It's too much.
It was just too much.
It was like,

142
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.420
Ooh.
Yeah,
it's just,
he's way bigger.

143
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:59.070
Like he looked like 200 plus pounds when he got into his frames.

144
00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:03.200
So much bigger than Conor.
But just the magnitude of that fight,
they do that.

145
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:04.034
A catch weight,

146
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.250
that's a super fight when we're talking about super fights now that's a mother

147
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:12.251
fucking super five would have to be at one 70 but if they did do it at one 70

148
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.190
Connor would have to get through.
Tony GSPs going to have to beat Woodley.

149
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.300
Then you get to end of next year.

150
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.060
There's a lot that's the lineup because Connor Beaton,
if Tony's a giant him,

151
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.200
even if he doesn't,
it's still super flight.
Right?

152
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.830
If he loses by devastating knockout,
it's not a super fun.
And you know,

153
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:31.010
probably to see,
not going to see GSP and yet,
you know,

154
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.050
the thing about Woodley is if Woodley wins,

155
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:35.860
you're probably going to the hospital unless your name's Wonderboy.

156
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.380
And then we'll probably go into sleep on the couch as a fan.
Well one,

157
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.200
but Wonderboy fight at least went to decision.

158
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.050
But there was moments in that fight where it looked like wonder boy was going

159
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:48.710
out.
Hell yeah.
I mean,
Woodley puts people,
excuse me,

160
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.670
Woodley puts people to sleep mean he hits fucking heart.
But here's the question.

161
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:57.030
Like what,
how much damage has been done to shoulder and what needs to be,
I mean,

162
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.610
it's a labor him tear,
whatever sort of a tear it is.

163
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.410
Can it be fixed with stem cells?

164
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.860
Can it be fixed with rehab or is it damaged to the point where he's going to

165
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:08.580
need surgery?
Because if he does,
he's likely out a year.
That's what Cain had.

166
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:13.110
Cain had labor.
Surgery comes out for a year.
That's a rough one to,
to to reform.

167
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.580
Yeah.
It's not,

168
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.050
it's not an easy road back and especially [inaudible] excuse me.

169
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.910
For someone who has that,
um,
wild po punching style like Woodley,

170
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:27.780
think about how much fucking torque that guy puts in his punches and he might be

171
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:31.230
the heaviest hitter in the history of the 170 pound division.

172
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.910
You watch that fight with Josh Koscheck a watch that fight with Jay hair on
dude.

173
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.600
He had at the Johnson was cutting the 70.
That's begs to differ.
That's different.

174
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.650
He had no business being done.
Yeah,
but I hear you,
especially right now.

175
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.840
He know he's talking about coming back as a heavyweight.
I know.

176
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.130
And which is good cause that division needs it.
Does need them.
But why is he?

177
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.170
I don't get it.
Yeah,
I don't get it either.

178
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.200
He said he didn't want to fight anymore,
but he's like,
he's done well.

179
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.420
He thought he was done.
He thought that's the life he wants.

180
00:09:57.421 --> 00:09:59.670
Then when you're there you're like,
oh this sucks.
Oh wait,

181
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:02.640
I feel actually pretty good.
I can go to heavyweight.
Not Cut all that way.

182
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.290
I wonder in the division slim,

183
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.670
but how much weight is it really cutting at two oh five probably 30 pounds.

184
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.560
You think you've walked around up at two 35 so he's a freak man.

185
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:17.220
It's so much weight.
So,
so much weight.
He's absolute freak.

186
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.070
So I made a good point.
Use either you or DC who,
by the way,
my MVP,

187
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.890
everyone tore it up.
Ms Square Garden,
DC.
DC is stealing my heart man,

188
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.940
as a commentator.
That mother is good.
He's bringing some personality to it.

189
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.540
He's himself.
Yes,

190
00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:34.830
he sees himself like in Brasilia a little too excited in the cage,

191
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:37.700
but he's great man til the shock killer shot thriller show.

192
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.480
He's great when he's like,
ah,
I can't talk right now.
So No,
I love that.

193
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:46.620
When when rose one and he starts yelling out,
fuck round.
Yes,
I want that.

194
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:51.540
I want that too.
That's what I want.
Yes.
Everyone doing it.
Take notes.
Be Yourself.

195
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.510
DC's not being fake.
Yeah,
but he's living in the moment.

196
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.300
DC is fucking hilarious.
Yeah.

197
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.660
DC has one of the best personalities ever when you're hanging around him,

198
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.580
like outside of commentary,
outside of the fire.
People don't know him and it's,

199
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.443
it's a,

200
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.690
it's a goddamn shame that people boo him love that they should love him.

201
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.220
His personality is amazing.
So when he's himself,
that himself is great.

202
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.020
Like me and him are always,
excuse me,
God damn weed.

203
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.320
Me and him are always laughing and slapping each other on these.
Awesome.

204
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.340
Brian laughing.
He's the best.

205
00:11:24.341 --> 00:11:26.640
He grew up in locker rooms so he's going to know that Chit Chat.

206
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.560
You know what I'm saying?
He knows the vice.
I'll funny,

207
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:33.030
smart and he knows a shit load about wrestling to what a,
what an asset he is.

208
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:35.880
Whenever there's some sort of a take down attempt or someone doing something

209
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:37.650
wrong and he can explain it.
That's the,

210
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.590
that's the future man and he's good at it and wants to do it.
Yeah,

211
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:45.030
he's great man.
He's great,
but the thug rose home was my favorite.
He's hilarious.

212
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:49.170
He's just being himself.
But it was either him or you that made the point of,

213
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.170
you know,
you really got to give it up to Woodley for what he did to wonder,
boy,

214
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:57.530
when you see what wonderful,
we did a 100% with Wonderboy.
Does everybody,
well,

215
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.270
everybody,

216
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:03.270
this is the reason why I felt it was unfair to criticize Woodley because if I

217
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.870
was in Woodley's corner,
I would have told him to fight the exact same fight.

218
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.300
Like people have said to me after the comedy,
like,

219
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:13.750
why didn't you say that that fight was boring?
I go,
go was,
it wasn't boring.

220
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.670
It wasn't boring to me while I was happening.

221
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.940
It might be boring if you knew what happened and you had to watch the four

222
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:19.774
rounds before.

223
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.560
If you're not like really into tactics and try to figure out what's happening.

224
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.750
But to me there's just dire consequences to any mistake you make against
Woodley.

225
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.940
And there's dire consequences against wonderful,
really wonderful.

226
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.960
I think w with woodland,
the Wonderboy battle,

227
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:39.010
I think they're just bad dance partners,
but I also think you make one mistake,

228
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:41.920
and against Wonderboy especially,
you know,
Woodley be in shorter,

229
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:45.500
you're in a lot of fucking trouble.
And he knew that.
Now to me,

230
00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:48.520
the fight wasn't great.
There weren't great.
That last one was in great,

231
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.290
but there were times when it was good,

232
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.620
but I think the way Woodley dealt with it and kind of figured it out,

233
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.000
you said this on the,

234
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:58.240
on the commentary on the broadcast where that might be the only way to beat

235
00:12:58.241 --> 00:12:59.960
Wonderboy.
Yep.
That's it.
It's gonna.

236
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.960
It's not gonna be exciting fights and I can be great.

237
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.790
And Woodley figured that out.
Now when you go to the Maya fights,
like God dammit,

238
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.470
you know,
when he'd go over there and then it's another thing.
But again,

239
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.410
the Maya fight though,
if he did hurt his shoulder early in the fight,

240
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.660
think about dealing with a guy who was one of the best fucking nightmares ever.

241
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.080
Nightmare ever.
Being in a position where you can't use one of your arms,
right.

242
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.710
Nightmare.
You almost have to fight the way he fought against Maya.

243
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.550
You don't want to go to the ground and people like kill you,

244
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.460
fucking Tyron Woodley,
apologist,
your timing Woodley lever.
No,
it is what it is.

245
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.333
I,

246
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.790
I think it just lined up for him where it's like this was this,

247
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.130
this is the much you're dealing with.
Then you get the shoulder,

248
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.680
he needs a guy like Colby.
Yes.

249
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.680
Cory comes in and I sent you a screenshot of his,

250
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.000
I will up to this Twitter where Colby and his twist Jon Jones.

251
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.830
I told Coby,
this was saying on my show.
I was saying,
you know,
people say,

252
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:56.470
hey man,
let's not cross the line and with Colby,
you listen to me right now.

253
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.160
You find that line,
you fucking run through it.
Whatever you're doing is working,

254
00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:00.730
man,

255
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.730
don't get racist but run through that fucking line and he's from Brazil on his,

256
00:14:06.201 --> 00:14:09.400
his fucking social media presence has gone through the roof.
Like when people,

257
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.170
when people think of him has gone through the roof,

258
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.290
most more people were talking about him now than ever before was ranked number

259
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:18.460
three.
Number three in the world.
They're talking about a title shot.
Well,

260
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.720
he did beat the shit out of Damien Maia.
He beat the off in Brazil,

261
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:25.900
wore his ass out and it was only a three round fight.
I mean,
who knows?

262
00:14:25.901 --> 00:14:28.350
It was a five round fight.
He might've got to stop.
It will stop them.
Yeah.

263
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.740
Very mom might've beating the shit out of him.
Yeah.
And Colby is,

264
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.790
he's young,
he's brash.
He's fucking tough as shit.
Look at this.

265
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.210
John Jones says the George Saint Pierre.
Hey George Saint Pierre.

266
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.250
You've always been one of my biggest inspirations.

267
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.140
Show the world how great you can be tonight praying for you.
Toby coming to says,

268
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.380
shut up.
Loser,
exclamation point.

269
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:52.550
You're the biggest fuck up in the history of sports.

270
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.580
Hashtag UFC seven to 17 two places.

271
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.600
Why is he going so hard in the paint at Jon Jones?
He doesn't care man,

272
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.460
but it's working because I like what row says in the rose.

273
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.430
I thought was the biggest MVP of the night,
but I liked what rose says.

274
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:09.390
She's like,
man,
I'm sick of this fight culture.

275
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.830
Rammer guys are just going super hard in the paint talking shit and not being

276
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:15.740
themselves like I'm a good person.
Let's be nice to each other.
I'm like,
Kelly,

277
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.490
I love that shit rose.
And then I opened up my Twitter but he told me,
I'm like,

278
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.590
but then that also made sense like you have this angel,
you know what I'm saying?

279
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:27.320
A demon on my shoulder like Gat Colby.
No rose,
this is nice.
You know,

280
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.270
it all makes sense.
Look,
it's exciting.
The shit talking is exciting.
Yeah.

281
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:35.960
I like when they make up afterwards.
That's what I'm happy.
Yeah,
I'll talk plenty.

282
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:39.680
Shit.
They fight and then they make up TJ and Cody really didn't,

283
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.980
I really don't like I respect you.
And then Cody Cody's like,
yeah,
I respect them,

284
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.040
but I,
everything I said was true.
Fuck that guy.
Well,
when,

285
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.650
when Tj got in his face right after the stoppage and was like touching his
facts,

286
00:15:49.651 --> 00:15:51.430
when she gets out screaming out,

287
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.680
when you're dealing with a fight of that magnitude and there's that much high

288
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:57.020
emotion and passion,
there's going to be a little bit of that.

289
00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.950
But I never send anybody to do that before.
I never saw anybody wind by stoppage.

290
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.470
And then when the guy gets up just fucking out of it,

291
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.490
t J's in his face at the top of his lungs with his mouth touching his face.

292
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:13.340
Like he was kissing him like he was a baby bird and he was like on his tippy

293
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:17.660
toes,
like [inaudible] stature,
just shredded too.
Amazing picture.
But that,

294
00:16:17.661 --> 00:16:22.610
but again,
you know,
with Cody had all that ammunition just the week of like,

295
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:27.230
oh,
I didn't knock you out,
drops the video.
And I was like,
Oh fuck.

296
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.110
I think one of the worst things that happen,
uh,

297
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.580
for Cody is that he got that knockdown cause we'd like to do it again.

298
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.180
What you're saying in practice or in the first fight in the first round.

299
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.890
Look at that.
That is insane.
I mean,
are coaches,
yeah,
lip to lip.

300
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:46.730
Currently they're kissing essentially kissing Cody is completely out of it.

301
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:50.240
Right?
It just got knocked out cold.
I wasn't sure if he was out cold,

302
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.070
but if you watch the stop it,
she stops moving.
He got hit a buzzer stoppage.

303
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.090
He came right back.
God,
I should stop coughing.
Right.
All let both those guys,

304
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.660
he came right back.
He got back up like pretty quickly,

305
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:06.080
but I think that's conditioning and just realizing that he,
you know,
he came to,

306
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.850
but he's a monster Co.
Look at the Tj shredding shred here.

307
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.310
How the fuck is he going to cut 10 more pounds to go down and fight mighty
mouse.

308
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.700
Mm.
Do they do a catch weight to the belts?
Really fucking matter.

309
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.470
They're going to do it at one 25 John One toy.
Tj Sweat.
When I talked to Tj,

310
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.470
he swears he didn't make,
he goes all day easily.
You might be able to hit it too.

311
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.570
Hey,
mighty mouse.
Who else do you get in a fight,

312
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.800
but if he gets a Mike Dolce behind him or George Lockhart or one of those weight

313
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:34.400
cut teachers to list.
Yeah,
he has someone.
He does.
He has some guy.
He's a monster.

314
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:35.780
That's why it looks like that right now.

315
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.150
Here's some new guy that he moved to California four.

316
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.860
If you get a guy who's awake,
cutting expert,
I bet he could probably do it.
Oh,

317
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.690
he'll do it for sure.
He wanted to do it.

318
00:17:44.691 --> 00:17:47.420
Originally he was already making the cut when he thought it was going to happen.

319
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.920
It was like it.
He goes,
it's no problem.

320
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.270
Was very disappointed in that fight and I see his point,

321
00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:54.320
but I also see my knee mouses point.
Mighty mouse is pointing as liquid.

322
00:17:54.321 --> 00:17:57.060
If TJ doesn't make the cut and then I lose the fight.

323
00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.000
Like what if he doesn't make the weight and then I lose the fight to him.

324
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.290
He's like,
that's a big deal and I don't.
Yeah,
and I don't set the record.
Yeah.

325
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.160
He wanted to set the record.
The record was giant him.

326
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.100
He wanted to set the record in his weight class.
So he said,
look,

327
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:08.934
I have one requirement,

328
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.140
let Tj when a fight at one 25 then fight at one 25 let him win and then I'll

329
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.880
have them come over or get them jacked as after you one.
That's real too man.

330
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.710
I mean that's some raw shit.
That's some raw emotion.
Where there,
how much?

331
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.780
There was so much during an fight.
Three more times.

332
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.720
There's so much shit talking going on.
A new,
so personal for these two.
Yeah.

333
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.070
Boy He look bad.

334
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.250
When he got clipped you got clipped at the end of the first round and it looks

335
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:35.550
like wow,
really bad.
We'll be has a piston for a right hand.

336
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.380
Unbelievable speed.

337
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.400
But then he came back real quick like at the beginning of the second round,

338
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:44.190
he looked fine.
He looked amazing.
He looked fine,

339
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.600
like didn't look at anything's wrong with them.

340
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.770
They start throwing a lot more kicks.
And did you see what a Tj said?

341
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.620
Cause they're like,
oh,
you're going to give uh,
Cody immediate rematch.
He goes,

342
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:55.230
hell no.
Look at the fire out to walk through to get back here.
He goes,

343
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:56.840
it doesn't work like that.
True.
He was,

344
00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.600
does not work like that to fight what three guy?
I have to wait over a year.

345
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:03.840
Fight three monsters.
You got to find out Linacre.
Yeah.
By the way,

346
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:07.290
he fucking neutralized Linacre too.
That was one of the more,
in my opinion,

347
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:10.260
one of the more fascinating fights because I don't think there's another guy in

348
00:19:10.261 --> 00:19:13.770
the division that would have neutralized Linacre in that way and not getting hit

349
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.740
agree.
You didn't mean maybe Dominic Dominic.

350
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.780
But the thing about t j versus Dominic is Tj is more kick oriented.
T TJ can,

351
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.730
he's not the,
Dominic doesn't have kicks,

352
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:26.700
but I think Tj has more flexibility is more loose in the outside key.

353
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:30.360
Tj Wins by head kick.
Right.
He head kicks guys.
He will,

354
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:32.910
he will do all of the above.
You know,
he's,

355
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.420
he doesn't have a in any way eliminated arsenal and I don't know what they're

356
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:40.240
going to do next.
But you know,
Dominic was,
Jimmy Rivera is a tough,
tough,

357
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.650
tough to me.

358
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.760
I don't know what Jimmy Rivera as a Fox like Tang nightmare people,
people,

359
00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.793
he's undefeated.

360
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.690
He kind of mopped the floor with your I favor like he's no joke man flying under

361
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.980
the radar.
But yeah,
he is.
And his head is twice as big as either one of us.

362
00:19:55.981 --> 00:19:58.890
The tank at that weight class and his,
his low kick,

363
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:02.330
that low kicked that everyone's doing that below the calf kick or that calf
kick.

364
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.370
God Damn,
that is a debilitating kick dudes.
My dark horse,

365
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.000
no one's really talking about,
I'm like God,
he's a showman guy.
You know,

366
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:10.980
when I was,
uh,
uh,

367
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.850
in the martial arts in New York in like that area,

368
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.610
tigers showmen had like a whole chain of karate schools and I'm,

369
00:20:18.611 --> 00:20:22.110
I'm sure they did competitions and stuff.
I'm pretty sure,

370
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.760
but no one ever would have thought they would become like a powerhouse for MMA.

371
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.930
But they've had quite a few like really talented fighters last there.

372
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.950
Well,
they had that kid with the green hair.
The fuck's his name.

373
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.520
Bantamweight Gentlemen.
Oh.
Uh,
I didn't even fucking talking about God.

374
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.920
My campus members,
I do.
Dan Stop.
He stopped fighting.

375
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.730
I did.
It kind of just dipped out.
Right.
He's like,
I'm out.
They have that kid,

376
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.950
so this is going to be a lot of,
they have that kid,
I can't remember this either.

377
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.360
Sorry to put you on the spot.
Oh yeah.

378
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.190
Where at one of his other guys had this crazy choke that uh,

379
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.160
we had to like go over in the gym and try to figure out yes.
Yeah.

380
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.030
Those garden.
No.
Yep.
Sorry.
Louis Louis goes,
no,
he was one of my faves though.

381
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.890
Tough dude.
He's a,
he's a believe he's a tiger Schulman guy.
I'm pretty sure.
Um,

382
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.140
and then,
uh,
there's been a few other guys too.

383
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.430
The only one who's going to get a rematch on the card is Yolana.

384
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.930
She deserves it after,

385
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:26.790
after defendant tile that many times he hit murked in that first round.

386
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.570
I think she's that,
that qualifies for immediate rematch.
Well,

387
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.890
I think that's where the big money is for sure.
I mean,

388
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.400
people are gonna want to see that.
That's a big fight because when,

389
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.320
when you wanna um,
walked out to the pop from the audience was immense.

390
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.590
She's finally become like this star that they've been putting all this promotion

391
00:21:45.591 --> 00:21:49.580
into her.
She's winning fights.
Yeah.
She was kind of thriving in it a little,

392
00:21:49.581 --> 00:21:52.800
almost a little too much,
which is one of the Canadian should loss.
Yeah.
Yeah.

393
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.870
The little bit of the Rhonda Syndrome,
they're little bit,
well,

394
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:57.240
I don't know if it's that,
but you know,

395
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.210
she was definitely doing a lot of press and a lot of fucking tremendous amount

396
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.710
of pressure,
but I'll tell you what,
dude,

397
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.610
when she was talking to the camera and she was talking to rose and she's like

398
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.090
the Boogie woman coming for you.
Who you women come in for you.

399
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.500
I can fucking do scared.

400
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.380
I was legitimately the greatest like promo all time.
I was like,
Boogie woman.

401
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:22.210
What the Fuck I did?
When you see her looking at rose in her eyes,

402
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:25.210
like staring into your soul and she's talking all kinds of crazy shit,

403
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.370
I'm going to fuck you up.
I'm going to hurt you.

404
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.960
And rose is saying the Lord's prayer at some demonic shit.
I was like,
why?

405
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:34.060
I asked rose.
They're already saying.
She's like,

406
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.640
I was saying the Lord's prayer and she didn't even look at you.
Anybody.

407
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.580
She wouldn't look okay.
I was like,
all right.
I'm like,
wow,
this is for Rico.
Yes.

408
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.630
Easy to say.
In retrospect.
I knew then something special was going to happen.

409
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.510
Hell No.
I thought real.
I was like,
Roseney see a psychiatrist.

410
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.750
That's why when I saw that way and I'm like,
we need to get rose some help.

411
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.320
Pace up forever.
I'm like,
you know what?
We need some professional help.

412
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:59.740
But after the fact,
knowing the result that rose won by knockout,

413
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:02.260
it makes it even all the more profound.

414
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.830
Now you can see motherfuckers just reciting the you want to talk about,

415
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:10.660
I hope the UFC realizes and I think they do.
That's a fucking star.

416
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.550
That's rose real stone.
Hell yeah.
No real stars.
The look,

417
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:19.270
she's a skinny five years old.
She's got the look.
She shaves her head.

418
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.900
She's a beautiful stranger.
Sing Lucas
that 11 Lucas.

419
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.750
So in she's 12 she's 12 she's 11.0 she's,

420
00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.570
yeah,
and she's like a genuinely good person.

421
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:33.900
Like when she was talking after the fight,
she's like,
just child beating.

422
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.010
Just be nice to each other.
Here's the thing Joe,

423
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.000
that's really coming from the fans gravitate towards that nice person.
Oh yeah,

424
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.750
for sure.
When you look like her and you weigh 115 pounds,
you're a woman.

425
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:47.840
You fuck up the Bogie.
Yeah.
[inaudible]

426
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.930
I'll guarantee you man,
if,

427
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.750
if she doesn't become as big as star as any other woman in MMA,

428
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:58.630
I would be stunned.
Damn,
that'd be stylized position.
Cause she's a good person.

429
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.660
She's worked hard.
Misha Tate got some star out of it.

430
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.920
Rhonda clearly got the biggest right for sure.
Rhonda got the biggest by far.

431
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:09.290
She was the biggest like as far as timing,

432
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.470
it was her insane domination or sure opponents just weren't on our level until

433
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:19.640
they were right.
So until she fought Holly,
they weren't really on our level.

434
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.940
And she also had this new thing,

435
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.750
which was the female ass kicker,
this thing that didn't exist before.

436
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.860
So in that way,

437
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.980
like one of the most unique athletes ever besides Ali and,

438
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.870
uh,
who the coal miner's daughter,
Christy Martin member,

439
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:40.340
Christy Martin from back in the old Tyson fights fight on the undercard,

440
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.870
the coal miner's daughter.
Remember that?
Sure.
But they're pioneers,

441
00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:45.680
but it's different.
Yeah.
Not that much.

442
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:49.090
Like Laila Ali got few people paying attention to better be able to batch your

443
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.660
dad's Muhammad Ali for God.
What the fuck that mean?
It's a shoe in.
Yeah,
man.

444
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.390
But being George Lucas,
his daughter,
like you're going to be,
you know,

445
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.560
in star wars we're fucked.
Yeah.
But it just never,

446
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.410
it never hit the levels that it hit with Rhonda.
No.
Right.

447
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.590
But I think that it's possible that rose could be the biggest star in MMA today.

448
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.930
I've really think so.
I don't think anyone's ever going to be a Rhonda,

449
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.890
because that was a,
the first one,
you know,
it was crazy.
Yeah,
I agree.

450
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.370
But rose could be gigantic.
I mean,
I really think she,
I mean,

451
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:22.040
who knows if she could be as big as Rhonda,
but she could be gigantic.

452
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.070
I really think so.
Yeah.
I like that she's true to herself.

453
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.600
She's fucking robot you'll to do.
She does wild shit.
She throws up arm bars.

454
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.860
I mean she,
she does wild shit.
That fucking karate hottie fight,

455
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:37.820
which she had kicked her and choked her out.
Dude,
she's a little savage.

456
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:39.850
She keeps on your back.
Ooh.
The thing that,

457
00:25:39.851 --> 00:25:43.310
that division is kind of stacked though.
Like you want to do a lot of people,

458
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.310
but for rose there's a lot of tough competition is very tough.

459
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.620
Competition is tough competition standing up too.

460
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.560
There's a lot of good strikers in that division case scenario though,

461
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:54.020
especially for the USC and rose,
cause I'm,
you know rose,

462
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:56.720
my favorite friend and that division come from Denver.

463
00:25:56.721 --> 00:26:01.640
But you know that that division for her to defend it and build a star like the

464
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:05.330
head and Yolanda,
that's when you get a star.
But if that belt circulating,
it's,

465
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.840
we get,
the public doesn't gravitate towards that.
We don't like that.

466
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.501
And you know,

467
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:14.120
she's likely going to have to fight Karolina who went five hard rounds with you,

468
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:17.120
Ana and three rounds with her.
Was it three or five rounds with her?

469
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:20.630
Which she wanted a decision.
It was a three,
right?
I think it was three.

470
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.390
There's just go on drudge.
Jessica drives a monstrous fight with Claudia.

471
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.640
Good Dasia Jessica drudge beat the shit out of claw.
You get,
Hey.
Yeah.

472
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.870
She beat the brakes off shit out of her.
That was the man handling.

473
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.550
Nope.
No offense.
Whoa man.
Handling.

474
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.500
She will manhandled her.
She,
she strong strong arms.

475
00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:46.830
She's sheets smash.
She hulk smashed.
She straight up.
Hulk smash.
She straight up.

476
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.820
Straight up.
I was like,
Jesus Christ man.

477
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.420
He's only seen an ass whooping like that since cyber got ahold of some bitch.

478
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.690
Didn't we wash that one live?
Did we do a fight companion for that?
Did we?

479
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.580
I don't think we did cause I'm huge.
Claudia Fan.
I think she's so hot.
Yeah,

480
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:06.960
she's very pretty right.
Yeah.
She's taken a break though.
Well,
you know what man,

481
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.470
the Bonnie only has so many wars in it too.
She couldn't,

482
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:12.570
that there was a lot of people were talking about with the Alana,

483
00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.600
they're thinking about you on or like think about your monitoring.

484
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.370
In fact though.
But before the fact,
before the fact,

485
00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:19.530
there was some discussion we're talking about,
look,

486
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.970
I didn't think that rose was going to do that.
No,
fuck.
Oh,

487
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.150
I'm just going to get I bet on it.
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah,
I did.
Yeah,
I did that on rose.

488
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.810
Good.
Well she's such a big underdog.
Four to one uh,
shit.

489
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:34.380
She was plus I think I get it.
Plus 500 I posted it,
whatever it was.

490
00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.150
I got $500 on her one.
I forget how much to grant them,
but that's nice.
Yeah.

491
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.440
Just because rose,

492
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.500
she has that x factor where she's just explode for for a while,

493
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.300
for a female fighter.
Yet she's wild.
But it's hard to train for and you know,

494
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:50.200
at the beginning of the fight,
you know you want it.

495
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.640
She had done nothing to wanna all you'll know one would get in her face.

496
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.760
She put her fist out,
touch her fist with her face.
You know,

497
00:27:56.761 --> 00:28:00.120
you wanna was really trying to get in her head and the whole time roads going

498
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:03.180
off,
father who art in heaven,
hallowed some scary shit.
Scary Shit.

499
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.180
But when the actual face down came phase down,

500
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.670
when they're standing in front of each other and they were about to fight,

501
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:11.640
you want to talk and all the crazy shit and she got close to her.

502
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.690
Rose pushed her away.
She's like,
bitch,
get the fuck outta here.
And that's,

503
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.510
and that's when he,
that's when he got dirt and she did work.

504
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.010
What the fuck she do on landed up punch.
She lands like [inaudible].

505
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.240
She's like Ugh,
but rose open strong with a leg kick.
And I was like,
oh Jesus.

506
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:29.320
And then she threw that leap and Hook Dick.

507
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.990
Trevor Whitman is a bad motherfucker.
Well when you have Trevor Whitman,
yeah,

508
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.820
he is a fun is a mastermind.
Phenomenal Strike Vm.
A focus on one fighter.

509
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:43.370
He's a mass.
Justin is rose Carwyn.

510
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.400
Nate more card come on just to fly flight in Denver just to work on his jab.

511
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.290
Just gagey training now with,
think about,

512
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.830
think about this fight that he's got with Eddie Alverez.

513
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.840
Trending now for Eddie offers gauge is what is this fucking record?

514
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.770
It's something insane.
20 [inaudible] or something like that.
G A t.
H,
you know,

515
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.860
I was suppose to him,
he's got an insane record.

516
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.130
He'd been in mopping the floor with those c level c level fighters in the world

517
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:11.730
series,
but still is fun.
Still the Michael Johnson 14 and 18 and,

518
00:29:11.731 --> 00:29:16.020
oh look at that one.
Submission to decisions.

519
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:20.580
15 knockouts.
But Damn,
I know Trevor,

520
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.830
when when gay t fight sometimes technique goes out the window and goes animal.

521
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.240
Fuck it dude.
He's,

522
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:30.360
which is why being a level he's wild is shit that Michael Johnson fight showed

523
00:29:30.361 --> 00:29:33.000
that Michael Johnson hurt him,
you know,

524
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:37.060
tagged him hard and he came back and smashed him.
Eddie Alvarez fight.

525
00:29:37.061 --> 00:29:39.020
It's through great fight.
Fuck yeah.

526
00:29:39.021 --> 00:29:42.430
It's a great fight because people forget but gave g his background

527
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.520
<v 0>is wrestling.
Yeah.
He was amazing.
Rest at University of Northern Colorado.</v>

528
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.020
Freak athletic freak vision is awful too.

529
00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:52.490
He squints he has those classes all the time.
I'm like pro,
oh fuck.

530
00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:53.680
Let me get that fixed.

531
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.550
I don't think you can get lasik and fight the commissioner's.
Dot.
You.
They don't,

532
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.710
they don't let you do Lasik,
but it'll day you could do the other kinds.
Pr.

533
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.440
I don't know.
PD,
I want to say.

534
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:06.460
I almost said PDK like there's two different kinds.

535
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:08.020
There's like [inaudible] something like that.

536
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.290
The other kinds of we'll use a scalpel.
Yeah.

537
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.450
The one that they use a scalpel apparently they can do,
that's the Russian shit.

538
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:16.910
That's what I had done,
I think.
Yeah.
What was wrong with your vision?
Uh,

539
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.460
I'd have contacts and glasses.

540
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.050
I've seen guys fight with those and they lose a contact and they drop it and

541
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:26.850
then they got to keep fighting and now you're like one eye's kid.

542
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.610
NC State with soft contacts in your eyeballs out.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

543
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:34.420
I got lasik after I was playing Lacrosse game and I was zoning out and I was in

544
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:38.230
Denver and it's cold and like contact froze and like you're in.
I was like,

545
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:41.350
now I was like,
oh fuck.
And then someone to hit me and it shattered in my eye.

546
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.360
Oh Jesus Christ you to hard contact.
Yeah.
Hard one.
Oh my God.

547
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.520
What'd you get hit with a ball or a stick?

548
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.020
I think some do just lit me up or something.

549
00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:55.210
My fucking context fucking shredded.
And I was like,

550
00:30:55.211 --> 00:30:59.650
I need to unplanned,
you know,
sports or man,
I can fucking content.

551
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:01.720
I used to always freak me out about classes.

552
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:05.210
Like if someone got punched with glasses on,
the glass went into their eyes.

553
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.060
I mean,

554
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.970
well they used to have those thick gastroenteritis thick as like athletic ones.

555
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.840
My poor brother used to wear those can use Kurt Rambis or some shit.

556
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.920
Even those though.
What if those things break their show fucking thick?

557
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.940
Like at the there what like,
uh,
the president's windows are made.
Oh,

558
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:24.190
you can make it like out of a,
like a plexiglass today.

559
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.950
It doesn't necessarily have to be glasses in classes,
like a thick,
thick plastic.

560
00:31:27.951 --> 00:31:31.930
So really can't bring a super nerdy,
no chips when he wear that thing.

561
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.830
So it's funny to me when basketball players can look like a broken nose or

562
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:39.790
something like that.
And then forever they have this fucking mask on too much,

563
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:42.110
right?
Yeah.
Too much.
Too much.
What's the leak?

564
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.940
Is what we see for the next few weeks too.
Well,
it's,
well,
it's crazy.

565
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:49.590
It's like this dude.
Oh,
come on ma.
Carbon fiber too.
I love it.

566
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.620
Lebron James had one of those.
A lot of people have had it,

567
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:57.040
but did Lebron where because of an injury or did you were just to be a beast?
No,

568
00:31:57.041 --> 00:32:01.180
you can't wear that shit.
Give me a close up on that.
It does what?
Kimmy?

569
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.950
That's insane.
It's carbon fiber.
No,
I love it.
It does.
The one right now.

570
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.600
I want to wear one.
Just black go out.
Shit goes down.

571
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.700
The nose is such a terrible design.

572
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.120
I know you had your nose fixed after the Cro cop fight.
God.

573
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.560
But I just see so many people get their no smashed like the,

574
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.930
they had a close up of cowboys.
Oh,
Kobe had one too.
Huh?

575
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.250
Almost everyone's had one cause they all hurt their nose.

576
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.510
That's it's like Zorro than it's pretty bad ass.
It does look pretty bad ass.

577
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:30.670
But seriously,
I want one too though.
Bitch ass shit.

578
00:32:30.671 --> 00:32:33.400
If you think about all this stuff that fighters go through,
come on.

579
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.630
Cody's Cody's was rough.
Let me,
uh,

580
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.980
capitalist cowboys rough Darren till caught him with that elbow.
That fucking

581
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.830
<v 1>snapping down elbow.
I know.
We did the fight companion for that one.</v>

582
00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.940
I know I told you dude,

583
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:47.390
Vinny shoreman would not stop raving about Darren till he would not stop raving

584
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:50.770
before the fight.
And shoreman knows his shit.
He was like,
Ma,

585
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.410
I've never seen anything like it for the kids going to be a champion.
Yeah.

586
00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.770
Most people from Liverpool,
he doesn't have to fight lined up,

587
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:02.710
but I'm surprised he wants to play Wonderboy blogs.
Watch the shit out of,

588
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.550
watch this shit.
Oh,
I wouldn't mind till verse Colby.

589
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.310
Let this young lions kill each other.
You know what I'm saying?

590
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:14.600
Like why not?
Yeah.
But if you're a fan of high level striking,

591
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:18.620
you tell me Wonderboy versus Darrin tail wouldn't be insane to watch it all.

592
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:21.450
God watch this shit.
If I'm Wonderboy though,
I'm like,
come on,

593
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:26.240
take that fucking monster.
And what does e seven old man and he's,

594
00:33:26.241 --> 00:33:30.890
he just be schmozzle doll.
He shoots,
he's enormous deals.
A big no,

595
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.160
no one tried to fight some big,
the only get wants to find me with like,
uh,
uh,
uh,

596
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.000
Mike Perry,
Mike planting the parents to find him,

597
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:39.230
but he only a huge fight coming up.

598
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.390
He's fine ponds and that Lbo you've got to concentrate on and obi definitely not

599
00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:46.900
a consequence.
Jump Pato over.
How about your boy?
Johnny Hendricks was like,

600
00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.910
I figured it out.
I'm going to Jackson's let me try this out.

601
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.560
[inaudible] your son.
Yeah,
he fought the fucking eraser.
Dude.

602
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:58.790
That guy's scary.
Even Post Usada scary.
Hold up.

603
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.450
Erase or listen to me right now that golden snitches good.
Better.

604
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.930
I don't know what all they did all these years being figured out.

605
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.190
I've got to figure it out.
I looked at his body,
I thought,
what the fuck dude,

606
00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:12.920
he's so jack.
He's jacked in shape.
Good luck.

607
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.040
Might be the best looking dude in the UFC so we can do it on the planet.

608
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:18.023
He's straight up.

609
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.160
I didn't want to come off as gay with his shirt off.
If it particular,

610
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.400
she's too aggressive there,
but they're doing the post fight a showdown.
I'm like,

611
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.820
I bet he slammed all the green card girls if you wanted to.
As he was talking,

612
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:35.060
I'm like,
this dude is just slang dick out.
Get it right there.

613
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:38.150
When he was standing next to a giant shakers at the way,
and so I was like,
no,

614
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:41.630
Johnny,
I'm not a middle weight.
This is,
this is a middle weight.

615
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.510
This is a big middle.
May his soul look how much bigger he is in Johnny.
I mean,

616
00:34:45.511 --> 00:34:50.090
and she shreds
and the fight was basically an assault.

617
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.230
It was an assault.

618
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:55.160
You would never believe that Johnny Hendricks was a former world champion of you

619
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:57.920
saw the way the eraser beat the shit out of him.
I mean,

620
00:34:57.921 --> 00:35:01.670
he just beat the shit out of them.
Johnny fire back.
I mean,
he's tough.

621
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.160
He tried through some leg kicks,
threw some punches,

622
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:09.050
but he was just getting fucking destroyed and just walked down and smashed,

623
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.970
kick to the body over and over again.

624
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.380
He was wincing after the first kick blind nomez second kick to the body.

625
00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:18.920
He got hit with you.
See wincing.
And here was when he clipped Johnny Hendricks.

626
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:23.480
I mean it was no contest,
unfortunately for Johnny and that the flight,
if you,

627
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:24.890
if you want to faint,
just looked in there like,

628
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.310
oh he got got out of the crowd to fight this dime piece.
Like look at that.

629
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.460
Oh this guy who likes to drink beers fighting this diode piece,

630
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:34.430
Brazilian well might be the best league in Brazilian of all time.
By the way,

631
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.310
Johnny is just not the same guy.
He's just not the same guy.

632
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:42.060
And you could speculate all day.
That's why,
you know what I'm saying?

633
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:42.780
Like you're like,

634
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.900
I think sometimes people halon guys for what they've done lately,

635
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:48.540
but for Johnny Hendricks,
I mean you've had a great career.

636
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:50.880
Brother had a great career,

637
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:54.270
but some time in a weight class above I should be.
I agree.

638
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.050
Cause he doesn't want to watch his diet.
I think it's a number of things,

639
00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.900
but you know,
I just,
man,
there's nothing to hang your head on.

640
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.360
You got to your world champion,
man.
Yeah.
You know,

641
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.030
a lot of people think you'd beat GSP.
Like you've had a great fucking crime man.

642
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.150
A lot of people,
a lot of people.
And now a good argument to that could really,

643
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.800
you could really have a real,
I mean if you were just objective,

644
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:14.970
he didn't have a dog in the fight,

645
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.160
you could have a real interesting conversation about who won that function

646
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.120
argument there.
Sure.
And I,
and I think if you're Johnny,
you know,

647
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:24.600
and he's probably taken a lot of abuse online and I wish you would stop,

648
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:27.990
but it's all good man.
You've had a good go.
I hope he doesn't take abuse.

649
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.040
Really what we should do,

650
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:33.300
we should be praising heaps on Paula Kosta cause that guy's scary.

651
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.120
He's fucking terrifying.
That guy's the future.

652
00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.350
He's a legit as fuck around.
But yeah.
Well who knows.

653
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.310
I would like to see someone test him.
I'd like to see him again.

654
00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:45.960
So like a real strong hundred 85 pound wrestler.

655
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.920
I think he's four known UCA and all knockouts for three.

656
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:53.490
You all knockouts is last two.
He merch dudes.
So what we got to see his,

657
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:56.910
he's for real and he's a future.
How's he know how much of a Gq or some shit,

658
00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.410
I'm telling you,
man,
I'm fucking,
when I was watching I was like,
what the fuck?

659
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.860
Well,
that could be the one thing that doesn't mean Weinstein next to him.

660
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.080
Fucking,
I mean,
good looking dude,
man.
Maybe that could be,
what does a man just,

661
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.110
Oh,
just young pussy.
When you're that good looking,
it's probably,

662
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:16.020
it's gotta be hard.
It's got to be hard to say no super hard.

663
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.710
And as he gets more and more famous,
you know it's going to be famous for sure.

664
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.860
For sure.
For sure.
It keeps smashing people that way.
Looking that way.

665
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.250
Smashing people that way.
That's trial.
Both son,
if he's not famous,

666
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:30.760
he should sue the UFC.
You'll look at this face,
Shit.

667
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.660
Fuck him on the front cover of the WII video game for gut.
They useless fucks.

668
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.760
It just,
Johnny looked two weight classes lighter than them.

669
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.210
Johnny looked like he was a welterweight and uh,

670
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.640
the eraser looked like he was a light.

671
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.410
Johnny's just lost men and like go into Jacqueline's and I'm not knocking

672
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:51.720
Jackson Jackson,
one of the greatest capital all the time still is.

673
00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:55.470
But when fighters go there because they've seen how much success they've had,

674
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.100
it's literally heaven's waiting room.
It's the fucking,
you know,

675
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.530
it's the Florida of fighting camps.
The tread serve.
Yeah,
here's a solution step.

676
00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.970
But if you're going there,
it's probably not the answer.
What's also,

677
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:09.300
you gotta think the years that he wasn't there and those play a factor in its

678
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:09.841
development.

679
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:12.810
It's not like you just get right back to where he should have been like,
oh,

680
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:16.140
here's the answer.
No,
you were training wrong for all these years.

681
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:21.000
And it's performance dwindled pretty substantially except for the one fight with

682
00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:23.190
Hector Lombard that's,
which is really interesting.

683
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.990
That was like the one fight where a,
he actually looked pretty good.
Yeah,
he did.

684
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.030
And he beat Lombard.
You know,
who's still fucking dangerous?
And I was like,
look,

685
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.980
Johnny Hendricks looks like he's back.
And that wasn't that long ago.

686
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:40.000
Hell knows last year.
But there was another guy who shouldn't be at 185 pounds.

687
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:42.010
So he fought a guy who's like him,

688
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.210
a thick dude who's really a one 70 that doesn't have the best diet in the world.

689
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:51.160
I don't care what anybody says.
You know that you shouldn't be criticizing him.

690
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:53.860
You shouldn't.
You know,
you don't walk a mile in his shoes and you know,

691
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:57.670
maybe his body doesn't want to respond and cutting down to one 70 anymore.
Stop.

692
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.120
Just be honest.
And I'm a Johnny Hendrix Fan.
Look at his body.

693
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:06.150
You should not be fighting the best professional fighters in the world unless

694
00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:10.690
you're a heavyweight and you have a body like that with all that extra body fat

695
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:13.900
that does you no good.
It's not aiding your performance in any way,
shape,
or form.

696
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.490
It is 100% a sign of a lack of either planning.

697
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.610
We didn't plan your diet out in advance where you're too heavy or too much body

698
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:26.611
fat coming into camp or poor discipline or poor organization of your diet where

699
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:30.160
you don't understand like what foods you should and shouldn't be eating.

700
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.960
When a guy's training for a three round fucking fight at the top of the heap in

701
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:36.340
the UFC middleweight division,

702
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.400
you've got to think this guy has got to be doing some goddamn rigorous shit.

703
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.350
The American public,
if they're watching this going,

704
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.070
if this fucking guy can't look good,
how am I going to look good?
And I'm not,

705
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:47.140
I'm kind of exaggerating because Johnny didn't look terrible,

706
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.630
but like I think it was worse,

707
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:53.860
cause hopefully look great coastal elite statute and we don't all have to look

708
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:56.390
like a bodybuilder where some of the toughest guys like Evan Dunham,

709
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.600
he doesn't have a bodybuilder physique,
but he's not,

710
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.250
he doesn't have any extra weight on them.

711
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.080
That extra weight is not doing you any good.

712
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.060
[inaudible] boys not willing to need yeah.
Events,
you know,
bodybuilding of it,

713
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:09.060
but he doesn't have a fucking extra pound on them.
You know north,

714
00:40:09.061 --> 00:40:10.600
there's Woodley Willie's fucking shredded,

715
00:40:10.601 --> 00:40:13.360
he's got the best body and the division Woodley could win the Olympia,

716
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.330
he could win Mr Lily's top five just January.

717
00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:20.020
Just got into it 100% he's got phenomenal genetics,

718
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.240
but anyway he's not,

719
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:27.390
you can't be competing at the highest levels of the sport given up that much of

720
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:30.940
an advance.
Like if that was a good agreement that you had like all right,

721
00:40:30.941 --> 00:40:34.780
we could fight a one 85 but you have to be 20% body fat and I could be 10 like

722
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:36.460
what?
Especially this day and age,

723
00:40:36.461 --> 00:40:40.440
like mixed martial arts to such a high levels like do.
I was just going over the,

724
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:44.100
the welterweights the other day and I'm like,
Holy Shit,
Holy Shit.

725
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.670
There's so much talent.

726
00:40:45.671 --> 00:40:48.070
Like the UFC in the welterweight division is such good hands.

727
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.160
There's so much young killing talent.

728
00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.350
If you're not taking every advantage of the the techniques and you're training,

729
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.640
you're left in the dust.
And Jonny is from that old school kind of training.

730
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.370
You know what I'm saying?
Like he's an older cat man.

731
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.030
Well what he was talking about when he was talking about training in Texas that

732
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.320
he couldn't spar hard with people or they wouldn't come back,

733
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.820
that he had to like take it light on them.

734
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:11.520
And then what he really loved about going to Jackson's,

735
00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:13.360
he was dealing with a real high level fighters all the time.

736
00:41:13.361 --> 00:41:17.200
So he's getting great training in which I fought,
was great to hear,

737
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.550
but it's not great that he spent so much time doing it the other way.

738
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.450
I don't know,
2017 you lose your,
you lose your focus,

739
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:28.990
you lose the drive and you just start going through the motions if you're not

740
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:30.490
being challenged all the time.

741
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:34.070
And he was obviously being challenged in competition,
but he should have been

742
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.940
<v 0>with a real camp a long time ago.
The great,
what happened with him,
he had some,</v>

743
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.730
he was with team take down,
they had some sort of a well did agreement.

744
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.160
So he was a team take down,
he came from Oklahoma state,
right,
national champion,

745
00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:50.360
whatever,
70 time,
all American,
just a monster.
And then the deal was,

746
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.360
is there going to support them financially with,
you know,
a house,

747
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:57.290
food training camp.
They take care of all that and give you like a salary salary,

748
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.970
but once you make it or we're taking 50% of everything and when you're young up

749
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:04.010
and coming hungry fighter like that's a great deal.

750
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.610
Until you become Johnny Hendricks and become the world champion,

751
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:12.470
like hold up 50% I appreciate what you guys did for him,
but God damn man,

752
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.180
like you're rob me blind here.
This is crazy.
So he had to go separate ways.

753
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.720
Here's the question then.
A big rig steakhouse did Dave,
that was a terrible idea.

754
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.830
I would eat there though.
Did they?

755
00:42:21.831 --> 00:42:23.770
I would eat there just for the story or the room.

756
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.630
That should be a selfie while hold off the menu.

757
00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.150
But I'll hate on it if it was a good job.
You leave a Yelp review like pro tip.

758
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.640
Have you ever Yelp reviews?
I've never have you ever.
That's why we're friends.

759
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.810
Have you ever,
have you ever,
have you ever blessed the comment on Youtube?
Nope.

760
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:45.140
That's why we're friends.
Have you ever hated on a guy on Instagram?

761
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.730
I don't think so.
No.
Me Neither.
No,
not really.
My style.
No.
It's waste of time.

762
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.410
Yet my friends don't do that.
I don't have any friends that I don't get young.

763
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.990
Who the fuck you gonna to do?
There's only so much time in this world.

764
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.770
You should use choose to use it wisely.
I was doing a mls show.

765
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.350
Some guy asked me a question,
stood up and goes,
hey man,

766
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.910
have you read the Youtube comments?
I won't stop there.

767
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.290
I've never read a youtube comment in my laugh.
My man,
so there's no court.

768
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:13.040
He goes,
really?
Never went.
Not once.
I'm too busy creating material for you guys.

769
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.060
I'm not reading comments.
Man was like,
all right.
No doubt he's trying to rights.

770
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.200
He's trying to tell you something.
He wrote some shit.
Really mean probably,

771
00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:24.020
probably trolling.
Probably.
Maybe he felt that he was friendly with it.

772
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.760
Hopefully not.
Um,
we're not hating on a garlic.
Johnny.
I love John.

773
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:32.810
Like I said,
there's,
there's no reason it is reality right now.
Look,

774
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:36.900
we sound like we're saying this and he looks like,
you know,
like Paula Kosta.
Yes.

775
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:41.150
Sometimes I think people confuse hate and,

776
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:46.040
and being a critical of a,
of a performance or reality.
Yeah.

777
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.790
But,
but also like when,
when they go,
you're hating on the UFC,

778
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.140
the UFC sometimes we talked about pay per view numbers or the last papers,

779
00:43:52.141 --> 00:43:56.510
and I'm like,
listen,
I have nothing to do with the way they promote the fighters,

780
00:43:56.511 --> 00:44:00.050
all that stuff.
If the numbers are low,
I literally have nothing to do with that.

781
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:05.030
I just give my thoughts on what is going on in the landscape of the UFC.
Hey,

782
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:06.260
pull up.
That's actually eating.

783
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:09.680
Pull up a picture of Johnny Hendricks with a beer in his hand with his shirt
off.

784
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:13.160
He's got a picture where his gut is enormous.
It's used to be about two 25 yeah.

785
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:16.610
Between five to get up to 25 that you can do.

786
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.970
You just can't do that.
And he could do that.
And because he was the champ,

787
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.070
you know,
at the time,
a while ago was a long time ago.
This Day and age,
right?

788
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:28.130
The game's evolving so fucking fast as a welterweight man.

789
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:30.530
You better have your shit together.
You better have your shit together.

790
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.550
I was looking division.
How scared for people?
Yeah.
Name off.

791
00:44:33.551 --> 00:44:35.790
I'll use baby training right now.
Yeah,
it's a,

792
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:39.770
it's a series shark tank and it's a good combination of upcoming new guys and

793
00:44:39.771 --> 00:44:44.160
ventral.
Yeah.
There's an awesome just combination of everybody in there.

794
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.240
There's one,
but there's a better one.
We see him from the side.
Yeah,
above it.

795
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:52.610
Right above it.
With the hat on.
Look at this one.
What?
That's whatever.

796
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:57.480
Go to the one with the red shirt.
That's incredible.
I don't give a fuck.

797
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.000
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

798
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:02.610
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Is that real?
That's,
that's real.

799
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:06.000
How could that be real?
There's no way he ever got that bag.
Is there,
come on.

800
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:10.980
He likes to eat,
Bro.
What?
He had biceps surgeon and said,

801
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:15.960
fuck it.
What year was this though?
Last week?
2014 oh,

802
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:20.620
he had bicep surgery three years ago.
Dude,
that'll,
that'll take you back a year.

803
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.390
Right by itself.
That probably,
uh oh his arm.

804
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.690
Oh,
okay.
What did he eat?

805
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:34.830
Rocks.
Meat.
They inject into his arm,

806
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:37.590
his under his stomach,
you know?
Yeah.
Again,

807
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:40.960
I love Johnny and we're not hating on Johnny.
No,
you just,
it,

808
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.960
there's just no room for anything other than excellence at one 70 now or even

809
00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:50.910
one 85 now.
But,
but also for killer for the sport and where it's evolved that,

810
00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.760
you know,
you're in the NFL,
you can't get away with that.
And the NBA,

811
00:45:54.761 --> 00:45:55.650
he can't get away with that.

812
00:45:55.651 --> 00:45:59.280
The UFC is getting there at a high level where maybe you better have all your

813
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:03.780
bases covered,
getting lit the fuck up.
These certainly classes.

814
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.210
Dude.
How about o s p

815
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.370
takes a fight on 11 days notice.
It was like,
yeah,
I'll do it.

816
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.310
Hey Oof.
Crazy head kick.

817
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.250
And he landed a head kick earlier in the fight.

818
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.450
Same kick and we were talking about a two.
We're like,
look out for his left kick.

819
00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:25.950
He's got a brutal left kick and then boom,
right on the button.

820
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:30.450
Walk away home,
man.
I mean,
it was crazy.
It was so powerful that God,

821
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.310
Doug just walked away out cold,
just out cold.
He silently on this,

822
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:39.540
a little bit of a rampage at two oh five two you know he has three von flue

823
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:43.680
chokes.
Yes.
Crazy man.
Cause he's not a Jujitsu guy.

824
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.280
There's only been training with this or even five on flue chokes ever.

825
00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:50.850
He's got three of them look up prior to that baseball bat against the head.

826
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:54.630
So dude and bright on the jaw to great win.
Yeah.

827
00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:59.000
And it was a good fight up until then.
You know the head turn,

828
00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.560
turn corners doing well especially with his wrestling.
Yeah.
But then Osb,

829
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.510
just so explosive man.
Jamie just wants to keep it from showing it to him.

830
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.700
Poor get toward Croix man.
Poor Cory.
Yeah.
That's a rough way to go out.

831
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.150
Yeah.
The whole card was insane.
Right.

832
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:20.130
That may for me as far as the surprises,
three three titles on the line.
Yeah,

833
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.370
just the best UFC of all time and GSP going.

834
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.270
Like when he clipped him with that left hand,
going to the ground,

835
00:47:27.271 --> 00:47:29.530
ground and pound and then go into the rear naked choke.

836
00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:31.450
And then pulling them asleep.
I gotta be honest.

837
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:35.470
I'm surprised Bisbing net retire with you after the fight.
Yeah.

838
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:38.170
I feel like we're still gonna go.
I'm like,
well what are you gonna do?

839
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.080
It's gonna fight somebody else.
Who?
Yo Romero.

840
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.450
Don Da Don da Don Danta.

841
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:50.110
You'll just waiting back there.
Bisping Beats Yoel Romero.

842
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.850
They will light England on fire.

843
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.560
God dammit.
They have that fight in London.
I mean,
think about it.
I mean,

844
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.430
Michael got choked unconscious.
He got dropped with a good left hand,

845
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:06.070
but he didn't get knocked out.
He also wasn't around.
Yeah,

846
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.030
he won the second round.

847
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.760
But what I'm saying is he didn't take the kind of damage where it has to be out

848
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:13.580
for a year,
you know?
No,
hell no.
Hell No.
He get up.

849
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.200
He could fight March for sure.
So if they're going to do one in London,

850
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.610
Yoel Romero,

851
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.350
I think there was a fight in March and like bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom,

852
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.050
that'd be sick.
Yo,

853
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.050
y'all were marrow was everywhere with Jorge Mas doll when they were really,

854
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.930
they were running into each other and there was a video of Mazda doll going at

855
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:38.140
it with Michael Biz.
I saw that and they,
everybody gets separated,

856
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:42.270
but Yo Romero is right there in the mix.
He there.

857
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.670
Mike will be speaking today.
Have to make that happen,

858
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:58.090
dude.
Just off the fucking,
yeah,
look,
they're hanging out together.

859
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.830
Hi right here.
I'll tell you what,
if your Bisbing I,

860
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.350
I love busy and there's,
he's as tough as they come.

861
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.800
I don't want to be alone with total two motherfuckers.
Hell knows what's,

862
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:11.710
you have to burning the flag or whatever.
You Go.
What did he do?

863
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.680
Did he burn the flag?
Did he brought a Brazilian?
Ripped it.

864
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:17.370
He threw it at him during the fight.

865
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.940
That's already like Dave Chappelle stomped it.
Oh,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah,

866
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:23.050
definitely don't do that.

867
00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:27.450
How bad ass is fucking Robert Whitaker that he went five rounds that dude and

868
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:30.340
wanted decision.
I know.
And he did it with a fucked up knee.

869
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.410
He got his neat generally army to fight.
What are your scary,

870
00:49:34.411 --> 00:49:38.000
no one's trying to fight Whitaker.
Hemet.
Him versus GSP is Yikes,

871
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:41.090
but that ain't happening.
You don't need to be scared.
That ain't happening.

872
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:48.840
You don't kick shock array like,
Yo,
this DC.

873
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:52.390
He's just be like,
Nah,
I'm good on that,
bro.
I don't know about that.

874
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.500
I'm telling you old former welterweight,
it's not happening,
son.

875
00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.250
[inaudible] a beast,
man.
He's so fascinating.
Explosive,
and he's young as fuck.

876
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.500
I think Robert's only 26 or 27

877
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.720
if you guessed,
take yes,
I say 27

878
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.850
26 that's youngest files as the
primer.

879
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.300
20th he's not even in his prime yet.
Dude.

880
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:19.720
This is what if you had a gun to my head right now,
like get what's next?

881
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.700
What's next?
I'd say Whitaker.
Rockhold in Australia.

882
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:27.130
That's what you're getting

883
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.670
<v 1>and then you get GSP Woodley.
I'd love that.
Dana White,</v>

884
00:50:30.671 --> 00:50:35.150
George Saint Pierre staying 185 pounds facing Robert Whitaker next.
Holy Shit,

885
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.800
Leah.
My face.
You don't believe it.
I don't think you know shit.

886
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:45.360
How about that?
Down to call Dana white right now.
Tell him Dan I,

887
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.130
but it says you're alive.

888
00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:55.890
Totally little kid shit.
[inaudible] I was saying

889
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.430
I'll believe it when I see it.
That's all I said.
I believe I just said,

890
00:51:02.431 --> 00:51:04.640
you said a lot of shit.
Nah,

891
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.940
like the like it's the UFC his best year ever.
Maybe know some shit.

892
00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:11.190
We don't know.
Yeah,
that's crazy talk.

893
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.520
But I don't have to be the UFC accountant to just run through some numbers in my

894
00:51:14.521 --> 00:51:17.930
old brain brain here that might have some brain trauma and go,
ah,

895
00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:21.120
I don't think so.
There's some awesome things that happened.

896
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:25.770
Some awesome fights for sure.
There's one awesome manaca fight.
Yeah.

897
00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:27.390
But I'm saying there's been,
well,

898
00:51:27.391 --> 00:51:30.390
if you would just want to look at the business overall.
Yes,
no.

899
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.460
For pay per view sales,
yes.
But for people like you and I that are just fans.
Oh,

900
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:39.150
it's been,
it's been one of the best years ever.
God,
really?
Yeah.

901
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:40.500
That's mighty mouse.

902
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.930
Mighty mouse beating the title and then doing it the way he did slam the school

903
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.650
and get a flying arm bar.
Cool.

904
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:51.700
Establishing dominance like that Amanda Nunez and Rhonda rousing was that way.

905
00:51:51.701 --> 00:51:54.090
She wasn't all,
that was last year.
That was last December,

906
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.720
I believe it was in January.
This here,
Bro,
it was last year.

907
00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.780
Am I going crazy?
I'm pretty sure it was last December.

908
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.810
You might be right this year.
They haven't had Connor,
Rhonda Brock.

909
00:52:03.811 --> 00:52:08.370
They haven't had their heavyweights.
Uh,
December 29th,

910
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.210
Bal clubbed.
Very,
very cool.
Yeah,

911
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.100
I guess that's not this year does it?
Uh,
yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

912
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:21.090
Like it's been a down year as far as there's been some fun matchups if you're

913
00:52:21.091 --> 00:52:25.170
balls deep into MMA like we are,
but as far as just like a great year,
no,
no.

914
00:52:25.171 --> 00:52:27.510
There were some,
some of those paper views.
I was like,
God damn.

915
00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.280
What are the fight nights like?
Come on man.

916
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.820
I think there's just a transitional period.
And again,
it's not the UFC his fault,

917
00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:35.520
it's with the talent to,
it just wasn't timing up.
Right.

918
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.600
But then you get certain cards like this where they hit it out the fucking park.

919
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.340
Yeah.
This one was so epic.

920
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:46.860
[inaudible] was told Cody and Dominick Cruz's here,
or last year,
Cody,

921
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.720
uh,
Dominick Cruz was this year.
Yeah.
So there's that.
Cody.

922
00:52:51.721 --> 00:52:54.270
Dominick Cruz was a big fight,
especially for fans.

923
00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.200
What about 55 now it's all stalled out because with Habib on the sidelines,

924
00:53:00.271 --> 00:53:04.530
Tony Ferguson being the interim interim champion had to wait forever.
I mean,

925
00:53:04.531 --> 00:53:08.160
do we even know if he was going to fight against fight Barboza December 30th

926
00:53:08.161 --> 00:53:08.994
that is definitely happened.

927
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.800
<v 2>Oh,</v>

928
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:14.340
<v 1>they said no more Tiramisu,
sir.
You're fine.
December 30th yeah.</v>

929
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.550
Daniel Cormay said he has a real nutritionist now.

930
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:18.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

931
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.350
<v 1>What the fuck does that happen?
Oh,
do you?</v>

932
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.910
You rank number one in the world.

933
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:29.120
Did you get a new tradition on demand smashing and you almost died from making

934
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:31.380
weight and someone was like,
Oh man,

935
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.590
you know what we should do and twice almost died twice.
You keep missing weight,

936
00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:37.380
Bro.
No,
you could be the best in the world.
We should hire a nutritionist.

937
00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:42.620
It's not a bad idea
if you're listening.

938
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.800
He's a devout Muslim,
so like anytime it's anywhere near Ramadan,
can't fight.

939
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:50.490
Well,
some guys pulled it out below.
Muhammad did.
He did.

940
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:53.880
He did it by organizing his camp.
He organized all of his training.

941
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:57.060
So all of his training was done after dark because that fast all during the day.

942
00:53:57.061 --> 00:53:59.820
Right.
And you can get once who?
Sundown.
Yeah.
I think,

943
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.510
I don't know even know if you're allowed to drink water.
No,
I don't think so.

944
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.550
But you just go crazy once the sun goes down,
Sun's down,
sunrise to sunset,

945
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:09.384
you go nuts.

946
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:13.710
So I think what he did was just alters training and train at night.

947
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.640
I guess it could be how bad you want it.
Well,
it's just such a crazy rule.

948
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:20.210
Like if God was around,
would he really decided like when,

949
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:24.630
I guess the idea is that you're by recognizing that you're doing something

950
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:28.920
difficult that you don't want to do.
You're like,
uh,
in this religious tradition,

951
00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:33.110
you're honoring him.
Fuck about your internal fight in UFC might.

952
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.090
But either way it could be get your shit together,
something and let you fight.

953
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:39.090
Yes.
You broke my heart when he pulled out of the Tony Ferguson fight.

954
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.380
That broke my heart too.
So mad day of the weigh ins.
I was so mad.
There's no way.

955
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:43.770
I know.

956
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:48.450
I'm never did before the weigh ins or was it the day of or day before?

957
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.090
Very close.
Within a day or two,
very close,

958
00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:54.840
whatever the day of it was so frustrated.
He can't say anything now.

959
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.250
He's got to just be completely quiet and you just go wins.
Yeah.

960
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:59.940
And Barboza is that,
you know,
it's not,

961
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.630
it's a tough fight for him because Barboza is the nastiest stand up in the game,

962
00:55:03.631 --> 00:55:06.470
especially at division.
But yeah,
it's a winnable fight for QB.

963
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.540
He gets a hold of you.
You're going for a ride.
Yeah.
If he gets a hold of you,

964
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:13.500
he can wrestle.
Fuck you.
Look,
no one else could be Tony.
That's the fight,

965
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.850
isn't it?
But you,
I mean obviously you got Tony.
Conor I think happens in March,

966
00:55:17.851 --> 00:55:21.630
but when he was holding Michael Johnson down helpless and just beating the shit

967
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:23.740
out of him that he was helpless.
When,

968
00:55:23.741 --> 00:55:25.680
when have you ever seen anybody be able to do that?

969
00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:29.160
She was talking to him and goes,
just give up.
I need this.
I need this.

970
00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.650
Just stop now.
I don't want to do this.

971
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.880
Woman does out beating the shit out of him.
I mean complete total control of him.

972
00:55:35.881 --> 00:55:37.320
How he's beating the shit out of shit.

973
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.140
What's crazy about it is like there is at that level,

974
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:44.100
it's very rare that that can happen at that level where someone is so much

975
00:55:44.101 --> 00:55:47.400
better that the other person just completely tied up there.

976
00:55:47.401 --> 00:55:51.010
You go there on a car and to look at that card,
man.
Um,

977
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.530
the Eagle hold up.

978
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:56.250
They don't have a main of Carlos condit returning against Neil Magni come on

979
00:55:56.251 --> 00:56:01.130
kids.
Oh Shit.
Magnet cat.
They're throwing magnet just to the the killers.

980
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.800
I like how they say to be determined for the main event because they're banking

981
00:56:04.801 --> 00:56:09.000
on Conner.
Well,
who knows?
Who knows?
I'm gonna cruise versus Rivera's.
Interesting.

982
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.490
Hell yeah.
V Little versus Carlos boss.

983
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:14.190
I was very interested in via your next star in the women's division.

984
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:19.920
You're going over last.
You got fucking round tree verse Saki.
Goca

985
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:24.030

988
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:36.210
I was like,

989
00:56:36.211 --> 00:56:40.110

man.
Do Better.

991
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:47.410
And how about Camaro Ooze Mon versus meek loose month.
The guy,
everyone's scared.

992
00:56:47.411 --> 00:56:49.810
So Uzma and wanted to fight to ooze months.

993
00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:53.510
Another one at one 70 that's terrifying.
Yes.
We could be a world champ.

994
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.950
Nigerian nightmare.
He's a nightmare.
Christian.

995
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:59.140
[inaudible] shout out fucking dude a meal.
Meek is a beast.

996
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.730
It looks like he's just scary.
Fuck too,
man.
It's all very interesting.

997
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.050
No one wants to buy deuce mine.

998
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.690
They tried off around the fights and meek was the only guy a ticket.

999
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:11.800
I'll fight him.
Let's meet that now is make us straight fucking viking.

1000
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.730
What's going on this fall?
I'm Vikki genes.

1001
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.870
Tell you what would that bodies challenging our boy zillion time.

1002
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.520
He smashed Tokyo.

1003
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.150
He fought who somehow apar Harris and just knocked him unconscious.
That's right.

1004
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.230
That's how he got into the UFC.
He's a beast,
man.
That's a real good fight.

1005
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.300
But I just don't know.
You know,

1006
00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:31.880
I don't know if a meal meek is going to be fast enough to keep it smile.
Oh,

1007
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.680
no one's if I do smile.
Oh No.
He said you're lying.

1008
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.970
He's The scariest number 12 rank guy in the world.

1009
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.560
How about Huseman versus Darren tail?
Jay's I,

1010
00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:46.240
he was on Colby Colby tills.
What?
I'd like,

1011
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.600
I like [inaudible] versus anybody.
I would,
I like to see,
oh,

1012
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:51.970
spawn fight for the title.
I like to see him hurt anybody.

1013
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.660
I really think right now.
Yep.
I think he's the most underrated guy in,

1014
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:59.910
in maybe in every division.
That's what I think.
Know How people fear.

1015
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.560
I don't know if I'd want to see him fight for the title.
Right.

1016
00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.580
Who was his last fight?
Click on that.
There's just destroying dudes.
Yeah.

1017
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:08.290
Destroying dudes.
Was his last fight.

1018
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:14.230
Surgery or Mris?
Oh yeah.
Sergio Mars does Jujitsu Guy.
Yo,

1019
00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:17.950
he'd put the smash on him.
Morris is a Badass Jujitsu player.

1020
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:21.190
He's the first guy that a tap,
chron and chron got his black belt.

1021
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:26.140
Fucking gave Neil Magni that horrible triangle and present.
That's right.

1022
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:29.650
I need you to do not go together.
Especially that guy's Jujitsu.

1023
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.910
When he fought in the finals,

1024
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:35.490
when Sergio Front in the finals of the ultimate fighter,
it was in Brazil.
Uh,
he,

1025
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.071
he goes,

1026
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:38.860
my opponent has just as much of a chance of getting me pregnant as he does

1027
00:58:38.861 --> 00:58:43.780
submitting me.
Jesus Christ.
It's a great line.

1028
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.190
He was fighting,
saves her for her hair.
She's Oh,
well who's a monster?
Yeah,

1029
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:51.160
Nate's fight.
Nate.
Yeah,
I was going to say that.
Yeah.

1030
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:56.100
Brian was at Aka jacking off the boys at Ak and guys did jack off.
Uh,

1031
00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.610
I know Luke Rockhold get him a facial for the most part.
So Luke's too.
Yeah.

1032
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:05.330
Luke's there.
And uh,
Cowen was saying,
um,
we're,
we're,

1033
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.030
we're talking about listen,
train of thought,
talking about,

1034
00:59:07.031 --> 00:59:11.290
thinking about killing Jack and how many guys he jacked off at Aka no.
Oh,

1035
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:14.980
he saw Nate Nate strain at AK now.
Mark Waters.
Yes.
No Shit.
Yeah,

1036
00:59:14.981 --> 00:59:17.230
he's doing a lot of his camp there.
That's interesting.

1037
00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:21.020
I'm motherfuckers been fighting since he was 12.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
Right.

1038
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.260
Think about how many wars archives,

1039
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.340
but then remember his fight with Woodley and strike force.

1040
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:29.720
We knocked him out with a mortal Kombat combination.
Ab Ab left right CV,

1041
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.260
find a Nate Marquardt Kaos Tyron Woodley.

1042
00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.750
They became world champion.
Yeah.
People forget is multi bankers champion.

1043
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:41.960
But that was like his first real,
no,
not that Pinker's wasn't real,

1044
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:45.350
but that was his first huge bellman.
Strikeforce.
Yeah.
Super talented.

1045
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.420
Super Young Elbow.
Boom.
I mean,
come on man.
It was crazy about that.

1046
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:52.960
That camp is working on this weird like taekwondo gun.

1047
00:59:52.961 --> 00:59:54.800
They're just doing elbows and we'd make fun of him.

1048
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:58.400
He'd be in the corner just in like these weird fucking motions.
Right.
Okay.

1049
00:59:58.401 --> 01:00:03.020
Naked luck with that.
I mean,
well that's what he uses as well,
dude.
Elbows.

1050
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.350
I mean you gotta think how about Bisbee on the ground on the bottom.

1051
01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:10.700
Those Evelyn [inaudible] lit his face up,
tore it up,
caught him up bad.

1052
01:00:10.701 --> 01:00:11.780
He was bleeding badly.

1053
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:14.290
Like he was having a hard time seeing it and you could see it on his forehead.

1054
01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:17.660
He was Kinda on his bridgers knows it's good.

1055
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.070
Elbows are like some of the most under utilized weapons.
You got to think of the,

1056
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.910
the,
the surface area.

1057
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:27.050
You can get a hard striking in a very close quarters with elbows.

1058
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:31.100
Like when someone's very good with it.
You remember when Cro cop fought Gonzaga?

1059
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.440
Oh my God.
Top of him and just opened him up like,
like he hit him with an ax.

1060
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:36.150
I have word

1061
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.250
<v 3>woo woo</v>

1062
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.940
<v 0>lamb,
like watching good movie tie to watching people that are good at elbows and</v>

1063
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:48.080
smash.
Slash.
Elbows.
Elbows are tough because you can't really train elbows.
Oh,

1064
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:50.660
that was the other fight.
Did you see the fight and the fight pass?

1065
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:55.340
Undercard which ween watch rapists for us to hobbies,
brother.
No,

1066
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.190
I heard for us rob,
he's a brother.

1067
01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:02.350
Just got dealt due to bad by two.

1068
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.290
I didn't see it,
dude.
He,

1069
01:01:04.291 --> 01:01:07.190
it was bad and I saw it coming cause he was giving up the spin.

1070
01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:11.480
I saw him like he's going to spin and he spun and hit him with a spinning elbow

1071
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:15.230
on the jaw.
Snow snapped his head around like,

1072
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:20.270
like you've never seen West for us,
like unconscious,
fully unconscious for five,

1073
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:23.510
10 minutes.
Fully unconscious damn than I [inaudible].

1074
01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.470
She has still traveling yet a huge main event.
You had to get ready for my man.

1075
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:29.060
Let's get back in this brother.

1076
01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.510
It's going to shake that off and it was a really good fight and his brother was

1077
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:35.750
put in a tremendous amount of pressure on the other guy.
God Damn it.

1078
01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:37.530
I forget his name.
Do you not have the highlight?

1079
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.890
Jamie can be tough with the fight path.
Huh?
It's out there.

1080
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.650
What is a homeboy's name?

1081
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.590

See it.

1087
01:02:04.991 --> 01:02:05.824
Show that again.

1088
01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.310
It's a Hamas is high set.
Oh,
so he lands at once behind the air.

1089
01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:19.590
But watch this one.
Show that again from the very beginning.

1090
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.190
<v 1>[inaudible] keep the volume up.
Go to the very beginning.</v>

1091
01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.590
That must be so hard if you're for us.
Yeah.
Man.

1092
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.400
Lands here behind you right there.

1093
01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:37.700
I said how I'm also thinking about spinning and that's when he did it.

1094
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:40.783
Two in a row.

1095
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.920
I think he's stunned them with the first one and then I think the second one

1096
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:48.510
just look at his face,
dude.
His jaws jaws sorted.
Blocked.
Yeah.
Just got smashed.

1097
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.440
Nothing worse.
As a perfect example though of like how good elbows are,

1098
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:56.670
like if someone gets really good at spinning LLC or c gas,
Don Bolano is fine.
No,

1099
01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.130
you're also not going to break your elbow.
Right?

1100
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.240
He can smash people in the face sometimes guys have chunks of shit though.

1101
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:05.940
Floating around their elbow.
Yeah,
like splinters.

1102
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.230
Like Anderson had some stuff for move from his elbow and Shaka Ray did.

1103
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:11.310
Zachary had some stuff.

1104
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.280
He had so much stuff removed from his elbow that I like fill a cup.

1105
01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.820
Like he pulled pictures out on the line like chips.
I've,

1106
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:20.790
I've actually had drained my elbow like a motherfucker I just put to put a

1107
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:24.870
needle in there.
Just keep sucking pops if you watch my share flight.
Right.

1108
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.880
Literally,
I'm in the back of the stage,

1109
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:29.350
like draining it cause it kept Franklin for the fight.
Yeah.

1110
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:32.370
Cause I was worried that because he was arrested,
I was like,
if it takes it down,

1111
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:36.300
let's throw some elbows and mom,
like I got this fucking baseball pad here.

1112
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:40.210
I got a drain it.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Was it painful or was it just swelling?
No,

1113
01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:42.060
I was just swelling.
It was just,
it was just stupid.

1114
01:03:42.061 --> 01:03:43.950
Felt like it's like at a big titty on my arm.

1115
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:47.040
He had a tit on my arm and we just kept painting it.

1116
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.400
Do you find the pictures of Jocko raise,
uh,
uh,

1117
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.880
debris that was in his elbow because one,
uh,

1118
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.720
I think I showed it to you before.
When we looked at it,
we were like,

1119
01:03:57.721 --> 01:04:00.240
what the fuck?
Like that was in his elbow.

1120
01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:05.170
Like it's like a cup of it on the operating table.
Like there it is.
Oh my gosh.

1121
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah.
That's all the years Jitsu,
Huh?
Just grinding on people's face.

1122
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:13.260
I think it's probably not tapping and then it's probably sparring.
You know,

1123
01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:16.080
you've got to think he's doing a lot of kickboxing,
sparring.
What's right.

1124
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:20.310
Click on that other one.
Is that a cup size comparison?
Talk somewhere else.

1125
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.790
Go back to his again so we could stare at what was inside his fucking elbow.

1126
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:28.560
That's crazy.
Look Chunks.
It looks like,
looks like teeth worn and yeah.
Yeah.

1127
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.420
Well some of it is probably cartilage.
Some of it's probably bone.
Um,

1128
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:34.980
a lot of people are saying,
you know,

1129
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:38.790
Anderson Silva has its fight against the Kelvin,
but they're like Anderson,
GSP,

1130
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.350
Woo.
I feel like that ship sailed though.
Well,
I'll tell you what,

1131
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.340
if Anderson Lights Up Kelvin gas,
it's,
it's not saying highlight,
knockout.
Yeah.

1132
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:51.030
Flying knee,
k o at 85,
like he hit best bang.

1133
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:53.430
Remember what the,
when he hit best pant,

1134
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.700
that flying knee and then Bisbing came back and won.
Yeah.
Anderson is,

1135
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.400
that was crazy.
Right?
Like Anderson thought it was over,

1136
01:04:59.401 --> 01:05:02.500
walked away with his arms up in the air.
So weird fight.
And he,
he,

1137
01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.490
he hit him when Bisping was calling for his mouthpiece.
Bisping was like,
no,

1138
01:05:05.491 --> 01:05:09.780
I need my mouth.
Boom.
Flying knee to visit and get to know.
Yep.

1139
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:12.840
That's on Bisbing.
How about he comes back and wins the next round now.

1140
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:17.500
Tough as shit.
They're British Zombie.
See Anderson.

1141
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:18.220
If Anderson

1142
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.390
<v 0>wins in a big way,</v>

1143
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:23.830
look at that crack and Michael Bisbing crack and Anderson Silva.

1144
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:27.580
That was crazy too.
And he knocked Anderson down.
Hell yeah.
What it was like,
oh,

1145
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.890
that's one of the greatest sites on them in a weight history.
Don't sleep on it.

1146
01:05:30.891 --> 01:05:34.450
Slept.
Made the Biz being kind of legend there.
Yeah,
it was a big fight,
man.

1147
01:05:34.451 --> 01:05:39.070
Huge fight.
That was a big deal.
You know.
I mean,
look at that.

1148
01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:41.980
Boom if dude and but also Anderson.

1149
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:46.600
So much taller than Kelvin is issue at 80 85 is size.
Yeah.

1150
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:47.440
But I'll tell you what,

1151
01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:52.420
Calvin has stupid hand speed man and beautiful combinations where he fucked up v

1152
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:55.000
tour.
Like dude,
who's fucked up [inaudible] like that.

1153
01:05:55.001 --> 01:06:00.001
Standing before told his father old been through wars,

1154
01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:03.160
been beat up,
but that looks golden.
Snitch.

1155
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.080
Golden snitch was like Beto you're golden.

1156
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:08.020
Snitch changed going to drain the future.
Vito Belfort,

1157
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.380
change the future of everybody.
But even before the Golden Snitch,

1158
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:14.310
just the whole getting rid of the testosterone replacement therapy for sheriffs

1159
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.760
before.
But think about,
you know when he,
when,
when Kelvin,
again,
I love Kelvin.

1160
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:21.670
I think he's actually a natural one 70 I think he's going to be better at 70

1161
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.240
because look when he went to get sky like Weidman who's an upper echelon or the

1162
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:28.230
fiber,
it's just a different level man.
And when I bigger brown,

1163
01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.660
just as fast and technical,
you're just,
it doesn't work like that and widen.

1164
01:06:32.661 --> 01:06:36.490
It has a crushing top game.
Phenomenal grappling game.

1165
01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.530
Especially as top game.
His,

1166
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:42.310
his ground game from the bottom got exposed a little bit in the Rockhold fight

1167
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.880
also shows you how good rock holds top game is.

1168
01:06:45.881 --> 01:06:48.940
Cause Rockhold is up fucking monster when he gets on top of that rock holds a

1169
01:06:48.941 --> 01:06:52.540
black belt.
Rock holds a black lid on the grid.
Shot super legit.
Right?

1170
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.560
But so is Weidman.
Carmen's a black belt in the ground as well.
I just think his,

1171
01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.280
his bottom game is not like this top game is insane.

1172
01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.670
He gets on top of you like exactly the way he did.
Uh,
Calvin,

1173
01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:07.120
he gets that choke down on you,
that head and arm choke and you're fucked.

1174
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:11.350
But he just doesn't have the ability to get up or to be very good defensively

1175
01:07:11.351 --> 01:07:14.980
off of his back the way some other guys do.
No bottoms.
Tough man being really,

1176
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:16.870
really good.
Yes.
Because such a high level,

1177
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.560
such a high low to be effective and like be a threat down there.
Yep.
Yeah.

1178
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.630
And Rockhold is also used to sparring with Cain and used to spawn with DC all

1179
01:07:25.631 --> 01:07:29.410
the time.
He's used to constantly grappling guys way,
way bigger,
way heavier,

1180
01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:33.920
way stronger.
So he smoked in 400 strong is Tom came so strong,

1181
01:07:33.921 --> 01:07:37.130
it's a monster.
When he got David Branch down and he's on top of them,

1182
01:07:37.131 --> 01:07:40.150
I don't clamps those legs together.
You're like,
oh,
he's fucked.

1183
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:43.640
He's not getting up.
Right.
And she's hands off.
John Donne her black belt to hate.

1184
01:07:43.641 --> 01:07:46.420
I'm like,
you know,
kinda silly.
And he smashed him to the ground,

1185
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:51.130
just smashed them.
So like him versus GSP would be crazy.

1186
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.040
Block a Rockwell.
Just be known.
Yeah.
Luke Rockhold,
GSP Kimber's,

1187
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.950
JSP.
Fucking Craig Anderson.
Silva,
GSP.
No,

1188
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.770
I'm saying Anderson Silva.
GSP would be interesting.

1189
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.300
Lock Rockhold versus how you know to crazy,
crazy,
crazy.

1190
01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:11.480
If you're a Rockhold fan,
you think rock.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1191
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.250
Tell him call smash and Hulk Smash.
Yeah,
whatever you want.

1192
01:08:14.251 --> 01:08:17.150
He's GSP is too small for them,
especially if it's cardio issues.

1193
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:19.160
Rockwell can go to and watch his fights.

1194
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:23.450
You know his strike force day flights with jock gray and Tim Kennedy like he can

1195
01:08:23.451 --> 01:08:27.170
go,
that boy can move.
Yeah.
That's a bad idea for GSB.
I know,

1196
01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:30.500
but it's still pretty see it.
Hell yeah.
I want to see,

1197
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:35.420
I'm interested in seeing GSP against a real dop level middleweight other than

1198
01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:39.560
Michael Bisping.
I'd rather see my 70 I do too.

1199
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:42.030
I want to see him at 72 but I'd also like to see,
I mean,

1200
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.480
I would like to see if we're right about him carrying that extra weight.

1201
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.910
I'd like to see if we're right.
I mean if I was in his corner,

1202
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:49.580
I wouldn't say that if I was in the,
no one is saying,
hey look,

1203
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:53.300
we're going to go to one 70 and uh,
we're going to spike terminal these punch

1204
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.270
for Ross,
Freddie Roach.
Like,
no middleweights really not where we should be at.

1205
01:08:59.330 --> 01:08:59.601
Yeah,

1206
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:03.710
I would tell him at a one seven if you go down to one 70 and you find the title

1207
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:05.810
eliminator fight against Colby Covington or someone,

1208
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:09.950
someone who's like an up and coming guy once and not fight Woodley right away.

1209
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.130
I don't think Woodley's going to fight right away.
I think we'll,

1210
01:09:12.131 --> 01:09:15.350
there's going to be out for awhile.
If I had a gas then you do an interim belt.

1211
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:18.780
I don't,
I mean,
I don't know what the real extent of his shoulder is,
but uh,

1212
01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.700
it's not good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1213
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.770
And he's starting to do some kind of outside the ring stuff.

1214
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:28.730
He has a show on TMZ as a podcast.
He's a movies.

1215
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.800
All that stuff is great,
but I would like to see it.
Not really.
I mean,
not if not,

1216
01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.600
if you're trying to be the best in the world,
I don't believe,

1217
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:38.660
I don't believe in this day and age of mixed martial arts.

1218
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:41.660
You can do that and still be the best of the best.

1219
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:45.340
Is he able to train it all right now?
Do you know?
I don't know.
He looks in shape,

1220
01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.200
you know Woodley.
So he takes care of business,
right?
So He's probably something.

1221
01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.860
Yeah,
I'm sure.
I'm sure if your shoulder's fucked up,

1222
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:55.590
he's probably not doing any real intense grappling or anything where he's got a

1223
01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:59.150
really swing his arms around your boy d seats right in a owes Mer.
Right.

1224
01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:05.110
That's the big crunch for that fight.
Hosting them.
Scary.
Yeah,

1225
01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.570
it's scary.
Can Do.
It's nonstop.
He fucks you up.
He gets you in a clenching lands,

1226
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:13.640
bonds,
giant hands,
dude.
Shake his hands.
Like shaking his table.

1227
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:15.620
Yeah.
How long?

1228
01:10:15.621 --> 01:10:19.610
How long do you think that fight in the halls on its feet for 30 seconds over

1229
01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:20.720
under three seconds.

1230
01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:25.010
10 of Columbia DC come out in a single it or it helps this work.

1231
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:25.571
You know what I'm saying?

1232
01:10:25.571 --> 01:10:28.970
It's going to give him his fucking mile high privileges.
Yeah,
man.

1233
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:30.880
He's going to get that under horn.
Yeah,

1234
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:35.000
he's going airborne and he sees a monster.
Yeah.
I mean people forget,

1235
01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:38.930
but watch what he did to rumble,
you know,
demand students.

1236
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.810
DC's a tremendous,
tremendous wrestler.

1237
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:45.690
Did DC same thing to you about Kane Kane starting to train.
Yeah.

1238
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:50.380
Cain wants to get back in it,
you know,
but he is that back surgery and to,

1239
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.930
it's a pretty significant injuries.
Knee surgery,
back surgery,
shoulder surgery,

1240
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.010
so that a lot of shit wrong.

1241
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:58.280
So He's trying to make sure that everything goes to right way.

1242
01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:03.310
Meanwhile Francis and Francis keynote in Vegas at the fucking UFC lab just

1243
01:11:03.951 --> 01:11:07.220
getting failed with whatever the fuck they're giving them.

1244
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.670
The all right king come back to that.

1245
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.050
What do you think they're testing them with?

1246
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.410
Like what kind of shit they do to them with the UFC lab year,

1247
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.230
if the UFC is smart,
they'd be like,

1248
01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:20.280
this is our guy like Indiana said this Dana and said he might be the future
wolf.

1249
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.500
I mean what man,
look,
he's got to fight Allister motherfucking Overeem.

1250
01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:29.850
And you can never sleep on Alistair Overeem,
the most decorated,

1251
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:32.610
striking fighter in the UFC.
If they start,

1252
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:35.820
if they start standing in front of each other and in Ghana starts moving forward

1253
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.710
and he doesn't protect that left leg,

1254
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.090
Allister starts slamming meat into that left leg.
No,
you're gone.
Yeah.

1255
01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.490
Ousters way more technical.
Way More tactical.

1256
01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:47.970
But the thing about Alster is Allister's fucking leg kicks are some of the most

1257
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.800
underrated aspect of his game.
So as his grappling though,

1258
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.610
forget how good is crap.
It's just he can't,

1259
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:55.880
he can't take his shot the way some of these guys here,

1260
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.230
they take a picture of Uber Room.
Yeah,
that's right.

1261
01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:01.440
The Overeem now like runs backwards and shit when you throw.
Right.

1262
01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:06.630
That's working.
But that's the Brock Lesnar days.
Yeah,

1263
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:10.230
that's Uber.
Yeah.
Be Real.
Yeah.

1264
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:14.340
That ain't the guy he's fighting as we'll show a picture of wolverine up there

1265
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:18.660
that it's not,
you know.
Nah Man,
I don't think so.

1266
01:12:18.661 --> 01:12:21.870
That's a photo shoot.
Okay.
Go to his last fight.

1267
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:26.700
Who did Allister fight a JDS,
right?
Knocked him out.

1268
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:31.560
No,
he had one more fights instead,
at least jds.
I think he knocked down.

1269
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.410
Is that when he Morocco?
Yes.
That's who it was.

1270
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.330
He knocked out GDS before he fought for the title.
That's right.
Yeah.

1271
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:42.810
So him versus Mark Hunt weigh ins.
Is that the wins?
Yeah.

1272
01:12:42.811 --> 01:12:46.560
See that's real that that's,
that's Maria Flook.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's still,

1273
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.890
he's still jacked.
Still great athlete,

1274
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:52.590
but he's not steamrolling people the way you used to steamroll people.
Well,

1275
01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:56.130
he's D flatline.
Mark Hunt though.
Dude.
He did flat line with that knee.

1276
01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:00.240
But like remember when he fought Todd Duffy in Japan?
Like that was,

1277
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.650
that was full burrim right?
Uber Room was also,
Oh my God.

1278
01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.620
Lou Brock Lesnar fights the best.
I look at that knee.
That's insane.

1279
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:09.890
That is a perfect placement.

1280
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:12.620
And he's got some of the best needs in the fucking business,
man.

1281
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:15.230
He's so talented,
man.
Now that you thought in the golden snitches,

1282
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:18.000
like now you gotta fight for reals.
Now he's using his technique.

1283
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.630
He's been a lot more smarter.
Look at that again.
Watch this.
Oh,

1284
01:13:22.050 --> 01:13:26.850
how dare you flatlined Marco.
You son of a bitch.
That is a full flat line too.

1285
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.520
I'm a market fan.
Yeah,
me too man.
Uh,

1286
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.720
I think he's done though since they pulled them off that card.

1287
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:37.500
You don't even if he flies out to and does the test and allow them to do well

1288
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:38.490
he's gotta do it now.

1289
01:13:38.491 --> 01:13:40.920
But they offered it to him before and apparently he said no,

1290
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.020
I don't know what the story is though.
I mean I,

1291
01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.160
I know he has one store and he has a story that he thinks involves the lawsuit

1292
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:51.300
that he put on the UFC after the Brock Lesnar fight.

1293
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:55.080
Cause he says that they knew that Brock Lesnar was on steroids and that they

1294
01:13:55.081 --> 01:13:59.390
made him find his lawsuit.
But the only,
the only defense that has,
you know,

1295
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.200
Dana said this in his statement,
he was hold up,

1296
01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:06.260
we had them headline two cards and we paid him 1.6 $7 million since then for one

1297
01:14:07.801 --> 01:14:11.200
flight.
And he goes,
if the lawsuit was an issue,
why the fuck would we do all,

1298
01:14:11.201 --> 01:14:12.034
it's also

1299
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.750
<v 1>yanking Omar for card,</v>

1300
01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:17.520
this gray zone defendant Dana here for a fighter but also yanking on my foot

1301
01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:21.990
card for a paper view in Australia hurts the you fcs business model?
Yes.

1302
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.380
So they would,

1303
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.620
they're also protecting their ass because it's on record that he says he's

1304
01:14:26.621 --> 01:14:30.370
having brain issues and then they put them in a main event and this even bigger

1305
01:14:30.371 --> 01:14:33.520
deal.
Then you're really going to sue the fuck out.
And he said it's only one.

1306
01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:36.580
He has a couple of drinks.
That's when he starts slurring his words or each bro.

1307
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:40.660
He didn't say it the right way,
you know?
No.
If,
if you look at that interview,

1308
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.840
it really wasn't based off that.
It kinda got a context.

1309
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:46.720
But you know Mark Hunt does have to own it.
He did say that,

1310
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:48.430
say it and he said it in an interview,

1311
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.250
but he thinks they pulled him off the car because of the lawsuit thing.

1312
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:53.700
Doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make sense to use.
He's like,
ah,

1313
01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.890
cause Vodoun verse,
I forget the ice fighting.
It isn't a,

1314
01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.890
that's not a big paper you for Australia,
it's not a big card.
Right?

1315
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.880
Mark Hunt is a fuge fucking drawn Australia.

1316
01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:06.640
It was designed to have him fight on that card.
He's fine.
Yeah,
he's fine.

1317
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:09.070
Marcin to Bora.
Who's a striker.
Yes.

1318
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.010
So for dooms going to most likely take dot Chi to the ground.

1319
01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:16.360
And you know your Boy Walt Harris finally fought again after getting fucking,

1320
01:15:16.361 --> 01:15:20.130
but did you see the fight?
Yeah,
I did,
man.
And you guys were like,
yeah,

1321
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.230
I don't think he's a bad dude.
He blatantly meant to kick that.
Do delay face.

1322
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.110
We're on the same page once we watched it again,

1323
01:15:26.111 --> 01:15:29.050
we listened to the part where the referee says,
stop,
stop.

1324
01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:32.660
And he's right in front of him and he's still a kid and they throw this giant

1325
01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:37.630
lake.
He got caught up in the whole thing and it's a fight and I believe him.
Nah,

1326
01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:40.660
come on.
But,
but look,
that means you got caught up.

1327
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.570
He decided to kick that guy anyway.
Like you couldn't pull it back in time.

1328
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.720
Whether you're caught up or not.
It's a cheap shot when I call it back in time.

1329
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:47.381
No.

1330
01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:50.290
You kicked the door in the face while the ref was between you or you wanted to

1331
01:15:50.291 --> 01:15:53.470
hit him.
Yeah.
That's a cheap shot and put yup.
It's not 100%.
No,

1332
01:15:53.471 --> 01:15:56.110
it's just a cheap shot.
I don't think Walt Harris is a bad dude,

1333
01:15:56.111 --> 01:15:59.110
but he did something bad.
He did something bad.
You fucked up,
whatever.

1334
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.160
That's not crucify the Gab.
Yeah,
it was super dirty.
And at the end of the fight,

1335
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.340
like when that dude got uh,
illegally kicked in the ear,

1336
01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:07.720
that was literally nothing.

1337
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.800
<v 5>Yes.
You know,</v>

1338
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:12.620
<v 1>but you have to think about what happened before that.</v>

1339
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.980
<v 5>[inaudible] yeah.</v>

1340
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:18.150
<v 1>Like what happened?
He got poked in the eye.
Oh No,
you get hit in the nuts.</v>

1341
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.300
He thought he had hit in the nuts.
He moved away and walk,

1342
01:16:21.301 --> 01:16:23.250
came after him to a punch.

1343
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.130
The referee said stopped and then he threw the head kick and caught him with a

1344
01:16:26.131 --> 01:16:30.460
head kick.
Pretty clean,
pretty clean.
I don't,
was it enough to stop the funnel?

1345
01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.200
It was like a slap to the face more than it was still like it's still a

1346
01:16:34.201 --> 01:16:38.500
heavyweight thrown that whatever 17 size shoe he wears at your face.
No boy,

1347
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:43.470
you know he's enormous.
Yeah it was,
but it was a hard shot.
And then you know,

1348
01:16:43.471 --> 01:16:46.950
he had some time to recover and then he'd beat the shit out of him again and

1349
01:16:46.951 --> 01:16:49.440
then hit him with the illegal shot.
Then they asked him,

1350
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.800
the doctor talked to him and what's her name?

1351
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.880
Oh God.
Beer.
God.
Yeah.
And God beer said he couldn't go on.
But yeah,

1352
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.860
I mean that's fair.
Me and kicked in the face.
Like I said,
I don't think Walt,

1353
01:17:01.861 --> 01:17:04.800
here's the bad dude,
but I'm conflating the two fights.

1354
01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:09.000
I'm conflating that with the um,
um,
Curtis blades fight.

1355
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.420
I didn't see the Curtis Blade fight.
Okay.

1356
01:17:11.421 --> 01:17:15.800
That's where I fucked up cause the Curtis blades fight was a cleaner results,

1357
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.970
but also in illegal shot,
Curtis is beaten the shit out of this dude.

1358
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.980
This was a Olynyk I was,
I was thinking you had won Harrison.
God Beer.

1359
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:26.510
I got confused.
The God bearer,

1360
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:30.500
Walt Harris thing did not look like it was enough to stop the fight.
No,

1361
01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:33.800
but it was a cheap show as a cheap shot.
God is like,
yeah,
I'm fucked up.

1362
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:36.800
I can't go.
Then he'd won the fight.
I agree.
The correct decision,

1363
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:41.090
the other fights where I fucked up was blades and Olynyk blades is beating the

1364
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:44.750
shit out of Oli neck.
And then um,
he went to throw a shot.

1365
01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:47.810
That would have been an illegal shot,
but it didn't really hit him.

1366
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.550
He just told his ear,
he hit his ear with his toe and they have the baby,

1367
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.860
but the referee saw that there was contact.
So he said,
look,

1368
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:57.890
I have to stop it because it was an illegal shot and it was contact and he

1369
01:17:57.891 --> 01:17:59.930
brought the doctor in and only nick was done.

1370
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:03.920
But he was done from the beating that he took for that.
So blades one.
Oh good.

1371
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.590
Yeah,
it was good.
But it was like super confusing for Curtis.

1372
01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:08.990
He thought he was getting disqualified.

1373
01:18:08.991 --> 01:18:11.960
We have to calm down and he had beat the shit out the dude before that.

1374
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.480
And you could really tell that the toe just barely touched inflicted there.

1375
01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:19.790
That Curtis blades,
he trains with all my guys back in dem.
Right.
Everyone's,

1376
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:23.690
I mean,
they're saying these are the next big thing.
If he keeps going,

1377
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:25.070
he keeps going and keeps getting better.

1378
01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:27.770
You see him better and every fight his striking as a ways to go,

1379
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:30.080
but they're like,
he had bad shit.
None.
Yeah.

1380
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:32.150
And this year it's getting better and better and better.
Yeah.

1381
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.480
He got leg kicked quite a bit by that big Russian dude that Russia who does the

1382
01:18:35.481 --> 01:18:38.730
same Russian who knocked Travis out that his strangled Travis.
Yeah.

1383
01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.790
The only neck mother fucker does not go away.
Did he strangled Travis?
Yeah.

1384
01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:45.710
Did he not come out on like a sideways where naked choke.
Remember?
Oh,

1385
01:18:45.711 --> 01:18:48.430
that's right.
He's just a fucking Netcracker.

1386
01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.770
He's the guy that won from Ezekiel from while he was mounted,

1387
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.910
let the dude mountain and something is equally and um,
I guess that's a shit.

1388
01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:00.110
Yeah,
he's done it to multiple people.
He lives so God damn strong.

1389
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:02.750
I'll tell you that man.
Scary when he gets a hold of people.

1390
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:06.980
It's like his walkout music.
It's like rare last.
Do you hate fans?

1391
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:10.280
Russian,
Russian religious music,
blues,
Bro.

1392
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.830
Lose Fudge did fade or select your walkout music.
It's not working.

1393
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.660
Have you seen that documentary yet?
ICARUS?
We talked about this,
right?

1394
01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:25.040
Did you see it?
No,
dude,
you got to watch it.
We can't keep talking.

1395
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:28.720
You'll go crazy.
You know what the problem is?
How I see you.
You have to watch it.

1396
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.060
Watch it.
You know what the problem is?
Give me an assignment to to make it fair.

1397
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:32.953
All right.

1398
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:37.580
The problem is is like I listened to the homeboy who came on and talked about it

1399
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.540
and then we've talked about so much.
I feel like I'm good.
Yeah,

1400
01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.473
but when you see it,

1401
01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.930
like if you gave me a breakdown of the first season of narcos and we talked

1402
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:48.500
about all the time,
I'm not going to,
I got it.
Spoiler.
You're definitely right,

1403
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.800
but when you see it,
the visual,
the way it's done,

1404
01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.830
he did an amazing job putting the movie together.
It's the way it's done.

1405
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:59.150
It's like shows you where the building was,
where they hid the urine.

1406
01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:01.790
How they got the urine pass through the wall.

1407
01:20:01.791 --> 01:20:04.700
They had a fucking hole in the wall.
How they opened up the jars.

1408
01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:07.800
They show the scratches on the jars and it's like,
Dude,

1409
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:10.700
they rob the Olympics.
It's crazy.

1410
01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:14.730
The Olympics in Russia and they robbed it.
They had a record number,

1411
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:19.140
13 goals and they were just all on steroids.
Here's my question for that.

1412
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:22.320
So when I see that stuff obviously is not hampered happening just in the

1413
01:20:22.321 --> 01:20:27.120
Olympics.
How,
what's going on right now in big professional sports?

1414
01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:31.290
Just think how much money's in the NFL,
NBA,
UFC boxing,

1415
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.160
like who's in the know?
I would love to just be a golden snitch.
It's,

1416
01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:36.900
you'd have to get the kind of,

1417
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:39.540
and this is where the UFC should be credited because you'd have to get the kind

1418
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:44.541
of access to the UFC has and they'd given to Novitsky in the UFC and Usada like

1419
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:48.540
what they do is unprecedented in sports.

1420
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:51.140
What they do isn't like any other sport where they just you,

1421
01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.000
you're treated as if you're in an Olympic program,

1422
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:56.040
like where they could just show up at your house at any moment,

1423
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.950
your entire career,
your entire career.
You have to give your whereabouts.

1424
01:20:58.951 --> 01:21:03.030
Everywhere you are all day,
wherever you're going to be exhausting.
Oh my God.

1425
01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:05.850
It's expensive too.
Oh my God.
Like even a,
what's the name?

1426
01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:07.920
Of course he doesn't have to do this.
No,
they don't.

1427
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:11.280
No one's asked him to do this.
I don't know if this is the best choice,

1428
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:15.300
but I don't think it is.
Yeah.
In today's climate and environment,

1429
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:18.070
I'm not advocating cheating.
God,

1430
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.390
I don't think you should cheat a little fun though.

1431
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:24.450
<v 6>No,
come on.
Come on.
Come on.
What are we doing here?</v>

1432
01:21:25.610 --> 01:21:27.760
Let Jon Jones fight.
How?
Shake free.
John,

1433
01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.930
<v 1>I don't know about all that.</v>

1434
01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.380
You want to know the craziest fucking rumor that I heard about Jon Jones Stein.

1435
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:39.820
Please,
sir.
Car and I can't tell you who told me this.
This is the craziest one.

1436
01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.440
Yeah.
The,

1437
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.680
the stuff that he tested positive for and what the does,

1438
01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:46.960
this doesn't make any sense.

1439
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:49.240
And people were saying that there's so many months out.

1440
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.540
The stuff that he'd take tasted positive when he was 10 when he's tested here

1441
01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:53.350
and tested there.

1442
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:56.650
The stuff that he tested positive takes a long time to get out of your system,

1443
01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.710
right?
Yeah.
That he was tested positive.

1444
01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.850
You know where else that stuff you find it,

1445
01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:05.410
you find it in Korea team when they get creatine sometimes from China.

1446
01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:09.190
It is a,
it's tainted with steroids.

1447
01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:12.130
They use that creatine to cut cocaine.

1448
01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:17.210
So he's doing the coca.

1449
01:22:17.211 --> 01:22:21.440
Here's one of the things that they cut some cocaine with is creating cause it

1450
01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:24.450
looks like cocaine.
God.
So he might've got one big stuff,

1451
01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:29.260
got bad batch if he was party a monohydrate,
cocaine up,

1452
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:33.010
up pop up party.
John want to do a Bob?
But truly good stuff.
Amen.

1453
01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:34.890
I can't test positive for anyway.
It's just cold

1454
01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:38.550
<v 6>be out of your system.
The moral bro.
Woo Damn.</v>

1455
01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:43.380
Actually feel pretty swollen to full song comes on the radio,
start dancing.

1456
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.090
Pitbulls forget about all your worries.

1457
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:50.670
Have for you the biggest [inaudible] let it go.
He would make the same

1458
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.200
<v 1>birthday 10 days out before the UFC fight.</v>

1459
01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.680
<v 6>Oh,
what are we doing?
It's like the world wants them to be a fuck up.</v>

1460
01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.070
A birthday cake.
Of course.
You knew a couple of bumps on your birthday.

1461
01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:03.160
My birthday,
the world.
John,

1462
01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:05.980
last time you fucked him up three weeks out when he did.
Come on man,
Bro,

1463
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.450
<v 1>you barely trained.
Um Oh my God.
That's the case.</v>

1464
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.100
Just stop and think about it for a moment.
If it was that stuff.

1465
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.150
That's best case scenario.
Oh yeah.
That's the best case.

1466
01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:21.700
It's code and we can track and we can,
oh,
you can't drive.

1467
01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.650
You deals go y'all homes.

1468
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:27.260
Let me come in and talk to you about where I get my shit in Columbia home.

1469
01:23:27.261 --> 01:23:30.820
Do you guys want to go down there?
You're welcome.
No stitches down there.

1470
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:35.110
We'll take you in the propeller plane,
Bro.
You travel across the border.

1471
01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.450
We don't have to go do that in a bit ski.

1472
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:41.740
Look how bad you want to catch this guy.
Well,
they don't want to,

1473
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.790
they're not in the business of drug enforcement,
right.

1474
01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.700
They don't want to catch that guy at all and no,

1475
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:47.770
the guy's not going to admit he's not going to give you a bag.

1476
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.040
Is the plot of Narcos for John?
Just write narcos for it for Don.

1477
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:57.520
John didn't tell me this,
so somebody told me,
somebody told me this as a rumor,

1478
01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.540
which sounds crazy,

1479
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:01.360
but then red band was the one who called the Dick Pills last time.

1480
01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.900
Red Band said that if he's taken dick pills,
like if the guy does coke,

1481
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:07.030
he tested positive for coke and red band was like,

1482
01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:10.030
if he does dick pills or if he does coke,
he's probably doing dick pills.

1483
01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.180
And I was like,
what?
And so red band brought a bunch of them in.
He's like,

1484
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.860
do you think there's any,
anyone knows what's in these things?
He's like,

1485
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.000
they have steroids and all because I've taken Cialis.
He goes,

1486
01:24:19.001 --> 01:24:22.930
and I've taken this stuff.
He goes,
is this stuff's way crazier than yes.

1487
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:27.250
He says it's madness.
Fuck like a wild animal.
He said,

1488
01:24:27.251 --> 01:24:31.120
your Dick is hard as a rock.
That's Promo for Dick Pills ever,
it seems like,

1489
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:32.050
but their gas station,

1490
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:34.600
Dick Pills that you're getting from some fucking third world country.

1491
01:24:34.601 --> 01:24:38.700
If your world class athletes probably shouldn't be doing that show up in a

1492
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.990
bucket that they used to have pain in.
Yes.

1493
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:45.140
100% I mean rhinos,

1494
01:24:45.170 --> 01:24:48.130
7,000 yes,
red band too.

1495
01:24:48.131 --> 01:24:51.360
I'd be so scared to table Chit.
Brian won't take them anymore.

1496
01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:53.630
I'm prying takes everything and he won't take Rhino.

1497
01:24:53.631 --> 01:24:57.190
7,000 remember when they used to have that life cereal commercial Mike,

1498
01:24:57.191 --> 01:25:00.130
you won't eat it.
He hates everything.
Brian's the opposite of that.

1499
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:04.570
Brian will take whatever you give a Guinea phase,
like let's go fuck it.

1500
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:09.340
Let's see what the Rhino pills do.
My only it he does,
right?
He did,

1501
01:25:09.341 --> 01:25:12.070
but my skeptical Hipaa allies there is,
because again,

1502
01:25:12.071 --> 01:25:14.360
we're constantly looking for,
and they're smart people around John.

1503
01:25:14.361 --> 01:25:18.490
So would this stuff,
yeah,
there's Clomid in there,
but Clomid is a masking agent.

1504
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:21.190
There's a lot of masking.
It wasn't Clomid,
John.

1505
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:25.120
I thought they found Clomid in this show.
Oh,
the old one.
The new one.

1506
01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.100
The new one was what?
What was it called up?

1507
01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:31.030
Some Russians [inaudible] tour in a bowl or something.

1508
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:36.580
Yeah,
Toronto Ball.
Trying to paint that up.
Bitch doe.
If you're John,

1509
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:40.540
you're doing a couple of devils,
Dan Drift and just whatever.
It's your birthday.

1510
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:42.910
That's the case.
But they have found the Clomid.

1511
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.720
They did find it in those Dick Pills.
I mean it was in there.
There,
there it is.

1512
01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:48.790
But also makes sense though,
wouldn't it?
Like it's a,

1513
01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:53.710
it's does estrogen inhibitor 100% but,
but it's also for something else.

1514
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:58.910
If you've been running,
you know,
gear in it,
you take Clomid to recruit things.

1515
01:25:58.911 --> 01:26:00.380
So it's in there.
Like I said,

1516
01:26:00.381 --> 01:26:03.950
do you have a lot of smart people around you where when the public hears Dick

1517
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:08.450
Pills like us,
not bad.
Right?
Come on.
Right.
It's all good baby.

1518
01:26:08.451 --> 01:26:13.210
Right here to go fight again.
Right.
So then now if it's cocaine,
he should be our,

1519
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.040
we're,
we're,
we're not looking at it for years.
Well,

1520
01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:18.260
you got to prove that it's cocaine.
First of all,

1521
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:22.490
this is pure speculation on my powder.
Cocaine was a journalist.

1522
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.910
If I was like working for ESPN three source,

1523
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.130
you would have already had me pulled out of here.
Oh you and I both be fired.

1524
01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.480
Fuck at ESPN.
One for our social media too.
Because when I go my sources,

1525
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:37.340
the one guy is in the business whose balls deep usually in this stuff.

1526
01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.000
No I'm not.
I'm not hearing a whole lot.
It'll give a fuck.
Yeah,
I'm wrong.

1527
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:45.950
90% of the time I was like fuck shit man.
My sources say my sources.

1528
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:49.400
Hm.
I don't have to come up with three people.
But your guy,

1529
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:53.690
the who knows who it is.
Maybe it's the cocaine dealer,
but he should track him.

1530
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.640
If I'm John,
I'm hiring some private investigator to track some shit down.

1531
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.090
It's too late though.
My God,
I cannot tell you who my guy is.

1532
01:27:02.091 --> 01:27:05.030
But he does not have a vested interest in anybody being correct.

1533
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:10.780
He just has what data?
What?
No,
no,
no,
no.
Um,

1534
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:15.910
he has what he has is a possibility and he also was saying,

1535
01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:19.520
and even if it's true,
good luck proven that now you're,
you're screwed.

1536
01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:21.080
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.

1537
01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.590
Oh cause I'll all the commission knows is [inaudible] where the fuck it is.

1538
01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:28.670
I would like to find out from people who actually know whether or not this is

1539
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:31.550
possible.
Christine and cocaine.
No,
no,
no,

1540
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:35.420
not that I've heard is true.
I don't think I looked it up though.

1541
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:36.710
I think I heard it from other people.

1542
01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:38.270
I just googled it and saw it a bunch of places.

1543
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:43.270
So they used creating Pittsboro size.
See that's what we're doing.
Yeah.

1544
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.210
That's what I,
I have my master's in bro Silence.
So see if,

1545
01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:51.440
see if it's proven that creating test positive for that stuff

1546
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:55.370
because that would be very,
very unique.

1547
01:27:55.371 --> 01:28:00.290
Taranto ball ain't damnation and creating specifically creatine apparently.

1548
01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.000
Um,
and a lot of the stuff that you get,
if you're buying vitamins,

1549
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.750
you're getting in bulk and you're getting a mixed places.
And we had,
uh,

1550
01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:12.530
issues that early on batches of Alpha brain that they didn't contain all the

1551
01:28:12.531 --> 01:28:14.750
stuff that it was supposed to and that it was a,

1552
01:28:14.751 --> 01:28:16.500
it had some stuff that we didn't even put in there,

1553
01:28:16.501 --> 01:28:18.350
had traces a set of change labs.

1554
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.850
<v 8>Do you want to buy some right now?
Sure.
We can buy some.
It's a dollar one,
two,</v>

1555
01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:26.110
five US dollars per gram coalesced.
The ball Acetate,

1556
01:28:26.111 --> 01:28:30.840
raw steroids.
They're animal Malaysia sourced or anabolic creatine cycle.
Tam,

1557
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:34.840
how much is this the very first thing that popped up,
how much is it?
Five bucks.

1558
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.220
Oh Shit.

1559
01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:40.750
<v 1>So imagine if like sea wolf is the thing.
There's so much that they sell online.</v>

1560
01:28:40.751 --> 01:28:44.920
That's bullshit.
But I bet a lot of this stuff is real.
Steroids.
I agree.

1561
01:28:44.921 --> 01:28:47.710
What does this bet ventalin industry limited.

1562
01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:51.220
I think if you've got some shit that's like sort of legal,

1563
01:28:51.250 --> 01:28:53.500
I bet you could sell it.
You would test positive for it,

1564
01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:54.730
but you could probably sell it.

1565
01:28:54.731 --> 01:28:58.120
I've done a lot of fucking supplements in my day and I never flagged.

1566
01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:02.730
I mean I've taken the GNC stuff that's like extenders,
testosterone,

1567
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.740
<v 0>nothing ever.
Hm.
And if you're a John,
what the fuck did you do?
And see if,</v>

1568
01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:11.220
um,
is that,
what does that say?
That just showing you the supplement itself.

1569
01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:15.990
Thanks.
So see if you can find creatine contaminated with tyrannical.

1570
01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.790
So you see that that's what a lot the baseball players get busted by it that
way.

1571
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:24.300
Yeah.
But don't write Chinese creatine Taranto Ball just right.

1572
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:29.330
Creatine contaminated with Taranto ball cause apparently more than one person

1573
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:34.440
has tested positive,
uh,
in various sports from creatine,

1574
01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:38.640
specifically baseball shitload.
Yeah.
We'll create team works.
I mean hell yeah.

1575
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:41.370
It gives you a fat face though.
I made you swell up a little.

1576
01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.250
Hydrate doesn't [inaudible] there's three of them.

1577
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:49.110
The monohydrates like holds water it yes.
He retain a shitload of water.
Fat Face.

1578
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
Get thick though.

1579
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:54.930
She gets strong real weight on this forum.

1580
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:58.380
But it says there's 42 supplements that are sold at Gnc that can trigger a

1581
01:29:58.381 --> 01:30:02.520
positive test for trainable.
And at this point,
this was in 2014 you saw it.

1582
01:30:02.521 --> 01:30:06.450
I had only found seven of them.
Were any of them create,
um,

1583
01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:09.140
just see,
did,
did,

1584
01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.570
did anything come up when you googled creatine contaminated with Toronto Ball?

1585
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.860
That was,
that was their first thing.
So one of any of those things are creating.

1586
01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.370
So that totally makes sense,
man.
I mean if you wanted to sell the creativity,

1587
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:23.700
that's the bomb.
Yo.
My creating make you gain mad.
Wait son.
I'll buy it.
Yeah.

1588
01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:26.850
For the regular dude just goes to the gym.
Oh look good on Tinder.
I just want,

1589
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:28.680
I just want to look.
Swole son.

1590
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:34.080
Trying to slam them dms trying to swipe lies and tries that Polo Kosta body.

1591
01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.410
You'll take some of that creatine monohydrate.

1592
01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.490
Creatine does work though,
like as a legit supplement.
That shit really,

1593
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.620
if you want to get like big and strong and creating son,
it's something.
Yeah.

1594
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.760
Yeah.
I mean we'll pull your hand.
Me,
but whatever.

1595
01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:51.970
It won't do what steroids can do,
but oh no,
you won't be Vituro Uber Anymore,

1596
01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.590
Jon Jones and definitely get stronger.
It definitely had a real strong,
strong,

1597
01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:57.810
yeah,
it's legit.
But also if you eat a lot of red meat,

1598
01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.330
preteens and red meat so you could,
yeah.

1599
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:04.290
I've got this guy coming on his doctors a fucking,
all he eats is red meat.
Sean.

1600
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:07.710
Sean Baker.
Yeah.
He's done a corner.
Shit.
No,

1601
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:12.270
he's fifties jacked his.
He does fucking sets a dead lifts.
Box Jumps.

1602
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:14.880
Is this purple though?
It looks like a tank.
Yeah.

1603
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.980
It doesn't look like he's doing drugs at all.
I'll look a muscle.

1604
01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:20.670
There's a bunch of videos and pictures of him and shit.
I'm very curious to see.

1605
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:24.750
Like I,
I've never heard of anybody,
just even just advocating,

1606
01:31:24.751 --> 01:31:26.790
eating only meat.
I've always heard the opposite.

1607
01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:30.000
I heard if you just read me like your cholesterol,
your blood pressure,

1608
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:32.880
it's hard to break,
break down in your body.
Like it's not the way to go.

1609
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.340
I heard little less red meat is the way to go.
Hmm.

1610
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.400
That's not totally right because most of what you get when you get high

1611
01:31:40.921 --> 01:31:45.600
cholesterol,
there's a giant,
there's a lot of debates,
high cholesterol,

1612
01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:50.000
but uh,
but dietary cholesterol is apparently not a big factor.
Really.

1613
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:53.370
Genetics are a big factor.
Sedentary lifestyle is a big factor.

1614
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:57.000
What about just digestion?
All that red meat?
Yeah,
that'd be hard.
I would wonder.

1615
01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:59.650
I would wonder,
but I wonder if like,
maybe it's not that hard.
Maybe it's

1616
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.030
<v 1>the illusion.
I think this,
there was a study that was done on red meat.
Um,</v>

1617
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.140
there was talking about,
uh,

1618
01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:09.100
what percentage of people got red meat or that ate a lot of red meat.

1619
01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.390
We're likely to get cancer.

1620
01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.140
And the criticism of that study that I read that was really interesting said,

1621
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:17.830
this study is not differentiating between what kind of meat you're eating.

1622
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:21.840
It's not talking about eating steaks,
it's talking about just renting.

1623
01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:23.380
So what are you eating with that red meat?

1624
01:32:23.410 --> 01:32:26.650
If you're eating red meat five times a week and you have a higher likelihood of

1625
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:30.220
cancer,
it's entirely possible that you're talking about cheeseburgers.

1626
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:31.480
It's entirely possible.

1627
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:35.440
You're talking about fast food and bullshit and sandwiches and stuff with a lot

1628
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:39.100
of simple refined carbohydrates.
A lot of trans fats.

1629
01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:41.590
Who knows what the fuck sugar,
you're not saying,
oh,

1630
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:46.030
did you eat grass fed beef or bison five days a week?

1631
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.750
Or did you eat bullshit five days a week?
Did you eat a fucking sausage?

1632
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.840
Mcgriddle you know,
who knows what the hell is in that thing,
right?
You know,

1633
01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:56.890
like what are you eating with?
It is inbred.
Are you eating it with pasta?

1634
01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.680
Like what do you,
how often are you eating?
Refined carbohydrates,

1635
01:32:59.681 --> 01:33:03.640
like all these other factors could also be contributing to your heart attack and

1636
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:04.930
May.
They might be the difference,

1637
01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:09.210
<v 0>but it's like one of those things get put out there and then it just stuck with</v>

1638
01:33:09.211 --> 01:33:13.240
me like,
fuck,
I can't eat too much red meat man.
He carved to digest well that's,

1639
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.700
I don't want to look like Hulk Hogan.

1640
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:17.240
<v 1>I think balance is probably good for everything.
You know?</v>

1641
01:33:17.241 --> 01:33:19.130
I think it's probably good to eat a lot of fiber.

1642
01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.830
Let me just seems to be who you shit a lot.
That seems good.

1643
01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.060
Like when I did a giant salad,

1644
01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:26.300
I take massive dumps and it comes out like a water slide.

1645
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:30.320
<v 0>Woo.
Yeah.
Let me just plug,</v>

1646
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.420
or if I want to hear what homeboy has state,

1647
01:33:34.421 --> 01:33:38.530
maybe you can just eat red meat like a damn cave man and be great.
Well,

1648
01:33:38.531 --> 01:33:39.364
he's doing it.

1649
01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:42.320
<v 1>He's,
he gets all his vitamins from that too,
which is insane.</v>

1650
01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:45.650
Apparently he's taken supplements.
I would like to ask him.

1651
01:33:45.651 --> 01:33:48.840
I can't wait to talk to him.
I don't know if it's the right move.
I know,

1652
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.671
but here's the thing.

1653
01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:52.370
It's like the right move for you is not the right move for him.

1654
01:33:52.371 --> 01:33:54.110
It's not the right route for that dude out there.

1655
01:33:54.111 --> 01:33:56.120
It's like everybody's got a different there.

1656
01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:59.420
Everybody's body's different when it comes to that and some people just react

1657
01:33:59.630 --> 01:34:00.560
really well.

1658
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:04.640
<v 0>All fish,
like you were doing that for awhile on pescetarian.
How'd that go?</v>

1659
01:34:04.641 --> 01:34:09.410
Two weeks just to cool.
Well,
yeah.
Well,
it,
yeah.
It's like,
all right.
You know,

1660
01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:12.140
you get bored of fucking fish.
I like to mix things up.

1661
01:34:12.141 --> 01:34:14.350
I like to challenge myself with diets,
but then sometimes,

1662
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:16.940
sometimes it's like I don't feel great.
I'm not doing anymore.

1663
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:19.790
I don't feel great doing that.
I gave it,
to be honest,

1664
01:34:19.791 --> 01:34:23.480
I gave it over four weeks pescetarian I was like,
I don't feel great.
I'm,

1665
01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:24.950
I'm sluggish in the morning.

1666
01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.850
I feel like I don't have a lot of energy from my workouts I'm not doing anymore.

1667
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:29.780
To him I had red meat and I feel better.

1668
01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.540
That's some carbs meet back in the system.
Yeah.
Doug,

1669
01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:38.440
did he never even eat and elk yet?
No.
Next time you like fucking,

1670
01:34:38.441 --> 01:34:40.770
I'll give you something.
All right.
The next time you're here man.

1671
01:34:40.771 --> 01:34:43.580
I'm going to grill.
I've got a grill in the back.
When you go and grill the grill?

1672
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:48.560
No.
Are you guys doing companion Saturday?
Huh?
Can't make it.
I can't make it.

1673
01:34:48.561 --> 01:34:51.960
You can't make it?
Yes.
It makes me happy when you can't do it.
When I can't do,

1674
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:57.080
I hate being a hater.
Can text me.
Are you texting your companion Saturday?

1675
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.860
Go Fuck.
I'm in Nashville.
I was like,
maybe I should cancel and Hash.

1676
01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:03.860
We already had something that I promised I was going to do.
Yes.

1677
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:07.870
I to pull out of it.
Family stuff.
Yup.
Huh?

1678
01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:11.750
Yeah.
Take that.
Indeed.
Yes.
Did.
I can't wait till the day.

1679
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:15.420
We do only fight companions.
That's going to be fun.
I'll do like one event,

1680
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.000
one live event a year.
That's going to be my next contract.

1681
01:35:18.001 --> 01:35:21.110
You just work at Madison Square Garden for the biggest card of the year.

1682
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:24.890
That's exactly what you should do.
Exactly what you should do.

1683
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.020
Can I say this like in a lot of hate,
I'm sure that we get hate from everybody,

1684
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.250
but,
and you performed at mass square garden.

1685
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:35.870
I don't get the big like Hoo Rah with mass square garden.
Like it's old.

1686
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:38.210
It's fuck.
It doesn't look that cool.

1687
01:35:39.010 --> 01:35:43.850
I know it's the man I know and everyone's sports and like Nick Shit and forever.

1688
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.420
Have you ever been at all?
He hasn't fought there in forever.
No.
I get it.

1689
01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.640
I kind of Rome,
I've never been to Rome.
Well,

1690
01:35:49.641 --> 01:35:52.700
when you're in Rome and you just walk in the coliseum,
you're like,

1691
01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:56.360
Holy Shit,
this is the history of college.

1692
01:35:56.420 --> 01:36:00.110
And obviously the coliseum has way more history.
That's what I want to see.

1693
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:02.540
I want to see a fucking fight in the Colosseum,

1694
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:07.160
but that's what they should do with Connor versus GSP in Italy.
In the coliseum.

1695
01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:08.023
You're on the Sutton,

1696
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:13.400
you fuck that bitch out the pure MMA fighters.

1697
01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:15.230
Let's right now,
because I fucking hate these two.

1698
01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:20.490
These is to sell a thousand tickets and they only sell million dollar ticket.

1699
01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:23.120
Yes.
Just Dubai's up in that.

1700
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:28.050
But it's all the ballers there.
Everyone's just covered in gold.

1701
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:32.230
Yes.
Mr t distract kids tours lined up to Ferrari's.

1702
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:36.560
Pull up Ferrari.
Lamborghini.
That's it.
Lamborghini,
the limousines.

1703
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.790
Caviar going through the aisles and shit.
Tuxedos.
Champagne.

1704
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.820
P diddy changed his name for a fourth time here.
JP,

1705
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.110
did he change his name and go?
He did as he did to what?

1706
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.110
Love rather latte brother love.
Hey Man.
Has,

1707
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:52.760
he just wants to be called coffee to me.

1708
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.830
He said he's not gonna respond to Puffy or diddy or p diddy or any of those

1709
01:36:57.831 --> 01:36:59.990
monikers before those previous monikers.
He goes,

1710
01:36:59.991 --> 01:37:03.190
I don't feel like I'm the same person.
I'm not that guy anymore.
You know what?

1711
01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.250
And I hear you all the time,

1712
01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.420
but I'm stuck with my same fucking late to change my name for that.

1713
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:11.900
Being known as the fight or like changed my fucking name.
Yeah.
Um,

1714
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.930
what would you like to be?
I don't know.

1715
01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.530
She'd come up with something fresh or wraparound.
Cool.

1716
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:22.460
If you're like a wrap or something cool.
Like be smooth.
Yeah.

1717
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.200
Be Smooth.

1720
01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:40.670

Wait a minute.
Well,
if you can do that,
can you do that?

1721
01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.970
You did it.
Well that seems,

1722
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:47.870
that seems I'm going to call myself the superfly do you can't call myself super

1723
01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:52.010

Snugger hey,

Super Fly Dude.

1724
01:37:52.011 --> 01:37:56.470
I'm not mad at that.
And you only answer superfly none of my previous monikers.

1725
01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.930
That's Sean Combs.

1726
01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.360
Homespun I'll respond to all the ones that puffy won't respond to and fly.

1727
01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.790
Dude.
He doesn't call me Puffy P diddy.

1728
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:09.630
That's when you know you just don't have the right people around you.

1729
01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:13.290
We can just change your name and we'll answer anything else.
That is hilarious.

1730
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:17.520
Oh Hell No.
Do you think he was just high as fuck as he seems so high.

1731
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.230
He seemed scared to talk to the camera.

1732
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.850
Pull up the video here to talk to the county.

1733
01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.620
Cause I know when I get so high that I'm scared.
I love brother loves skin tone.

1734
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.930
Amazing cow with this little red powerful red.

1735
01:38:27.931 --> 01:38:31.950
He's on the beach and he's got like a white hat on like a,
like a,
uh,

1736
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:36.060
like a straw hat and it's him announcing he's changing his dad and he's like,

1737
01:38:36.061 --> 01:38:40.500
I just want it.
That's it.
That's it.
Keep me some volume.
Hashtag take that,

1738
01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:44.280

It's played for the beginning.
Cvs.
Yeah.

1739
01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.253
<v 7>Lose.</v>

1740
01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:49.300
<v 9>I didn't plan on this and I decided,</v>

1741
01:38:49.450 --> 01:38:53.530
well you pray those risks because I knew it could come off as Corny to some

1742
01:38:53.531 --> 01:38:54.364
people.
Like,
Yo,

1743
01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.320
I decided to change my name again.
Huh?

1744
01:39:03.010 --> 01:39:06.120
I'm just not who he is.
So serious.
I am.

1745
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:10.440
Before I get it in different,

1746
01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:15.090
I get it for so my new name is Love,
Aka rather low.

1747
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:18.090
I will not be answering the coffee,
diddy,

1748
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.080
puff daddy or any of my other monitors,
but love of brother law.

1749
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:28.050
Okay.
It's my birthday.
I feel good.
God is the greatest.

1750
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:30.960
I give all glory and I thank my mom and Daddy.
Yeah.

1751
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:35.760
<v 0>What the fuck does he play it again?
Play it.
That was kind of a great,</v>

1752
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.940
play it forever.
He's so high.
He's barely alive.

1753
01:39:40.810 --> 01:39:41.643
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1754
01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:46.650
<v 9>It's serious news and he's been praying about it.
I know it was risky.</v>

1755
01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:49.850
I knew it could from Gucci.
I did my coffee.

1756
01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:54.340
Do you think he comes off as Corny?
Nah.
It feels right.
They're here.

1757
01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.020
Change my name and do

1758
01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:03.760
on dog.
I decided to change my name dead serious though.
What's going on,
man?

1759
01:40:03.761 --> 01:40:07.810
I got some of serious things in my life.
My girls a side breaking up with me.

1760
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:09.640
Did he walk back in there and once I,

1761
01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.930
<v 0>Oh,
you changed your name?
No,
you changed your name again.
Like he's like,</v>

1762
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:18.890
he's on vacation somewhere playing golf.
It's like this edible kicked in.

1763
01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.150
I'm gonna go back here and change my name.

1764
01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:23.600
I bet he thought about it for a long fucking wild.
I was like,

1765
01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:26.990
I'm going to let you see his hand holding up the phone.
That's hilarious.

1766
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:29.200
And he zoomed,
man.
Dude.

1767
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:31.380
See his hand holding up his phone and talking to his phone.

1768
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:34.760
I think sometimes you just smash life in every fat,

1769
01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:39.290
every lane that you just become a little crazy.
Hashtag take that Hashtag.

1770
01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:43.310
Take that here.
That take that,
take that,
take that too.
Yeah.

1771
01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:48.770
I don't know.
Hmm.
Seems like an odd choice,
but hey,
why not?
Fuck it.

1772
01:40:48.771 --> 01:40:51.690
He did it twice.
I did.
Again,
I was in a gym.
I was editing.

1773
01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.070
I was in a gym in Hollywood.

1774
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.710
He came in one workout mid day and you want everyone to leave.
Oh,

1775
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:59.020
that's adorable.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It could look,
get me out of that.

1776
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.290
However he let me stay for whatever reason.
I don't know.

1777
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.880
Maybe because I looked like I was gonna put up a fight,

1778
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:07.360
but he came in there with a truck load of bitches.
Did he go?

1779
01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.670
I was working out with all these girls dancing around him.

1780
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.080
I was nervous too around him.

1781
01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.660
He's about to do some Kevin Spacey Shit to me or something.
I don't know.

1782
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:19.960
I was nervous.
I was a little nervous.
Hell yeah.
He had his,

1783
01:41:19.961 --> 01:41:24.340
his tea whole team around.
They did shut down the gym on the bike.
Cute.

1784
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:29.020
They kicked everybody out.
A lot of people had to bounce.
That bitch told people,

1785
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:32.980
Hey,
I know you paid for your dues and you're a member here,

1786
01:41:32.981 --> 01:41:35.170
but that doesn't matter cause this guy means more to us than you.

1787
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.670
Basically private gym,
private jet.
It was private,
private gym and they're like,

1788
01:41:39.671 --> 01:41:42.130
Yo,
we need you to get up to speed duties here.
Private Gym.

1789
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.500
I said I got 10 minutes probably going nowhere bitch.

1790
01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.840
I kind of private gym is that there's probably a gym for a high level athletes

1791
01:41:50.711 --> 01:41:51.544
and celebrities.
Yeah.

1792
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:54.140
I don't want to give the gym cause I don't want to shit on them for this gross.

1793
01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:58.750
I know.
I just can't believe their kid.
Like why you can't work out with people.

1794
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:00.280
He didn't want people,
I don't know,

1795
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:04.180
maybe super weak on the bench or some shit like 20 fives on that.
He's like,

1796
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:07.400
oh that's it.
That's it.

1797
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.340
Try New calf raises just to some bullets.

1798
01:42:11.341 --> 01:42:14.090
Shit work to happen.

1799
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:18.160
He's fucking jazzercise.
You only want to see it.

1800
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:21.490
All he does is that uh,
that abductor adductor machine

1801
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.430
just in spreading your legs straight.
Nonsense all day.
That shit.

1802
01:42:27.431 --> 01:42:31.840
It's phenomenal for your guard.
Alien abductor the Susan's random shit.

1803
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:36.200
Yeah.
Susan Cerasis this random,
forgot her name.

1804
01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.080
She went summers.
Yes,
dude.
I used to jack after videos when I was a kid.

1805
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:43.620
She was bad as fuck.
Yeah,
but she,

1806
01:42:43.621 --> 01:42:48.160
she had the spring that you push with your pussy shit.
The thighmaster.
Yes.

1807
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:52.010
Was it real?
Does it really work?
If tie master,

1808
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:53.980
you should have to show your thighs likely.
See,
wait,

1809
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.090
let's see what we're working on.
That too.
She was hot.
Fuck back then.

1810
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.360
Yeah,
there it is.
Yeah.
She was pretty hot.
Too Long.

1811
01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:06.361
Like she was one of the classic stories in Hollywood of negotiations gone

1812
01:43:06.461 --> 01:43:07.810
sideways.
How so?

1813
01:43:07.811 --> 01:43:12.460
She was one of the big stars of Three's company and there was some sort of a

1814
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:17.461
negotiation that didn't go well and they removed her from the show.

1815
01:43:19.210 --> 01:43:22.480
They want,
I don't know if she wound up quitting or she wrote out the contract,

1816
01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:25.750
but at one time company.
Yeah.
At one point in time the,

1817
01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:30.100
the thing had gotten so bad that she was only appearing on the show,

1818
01:43:30.101 --> 01:43:35.020
on the phone.
She'd be like on the phone calling in wanting,
talking to hell.

1819
01:43:35.050 --> 01:43:38.020
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was weird.
And then they were placed here.

1820
01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.870
They replaced it with a new girl.
Damn.
She tried pulling the ball and move in.

1821
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:45.460
Hollywood was like what?
Yeah.
I don't remember this.
The full details.

1822
01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:48.640
I want to say that it was like a manager decided they were going to play

1823
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:51.100
hardball with the network because it was a big hit.

1824
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:53.210
Shots on Roger worked a shit of holiday.

1825
01:43:53.211 --> 01:43:57.170
It is the crazy story of how Suzanne Somers was fired for asking for equal pay

1826
01:43:57.530 --> 01:44:02.530
on three's company at the peak of her fame in 1980 so I guess John Ritter was

1827
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:08.020
probably raking in all the cheese with some all the teeth.

1828
01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:11.510
Can you imagine if they made three's company in today's society?
I did.

1829
01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.330
The way it gets green lit did an episode of News Radio with John Ritter,

1830
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.430
who was he also Super Nice Guy,

1831
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.590
like weirdly nice and people always say that about him.
Yeah,
great thing.
Genuine,

1832
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.460
nice guy.
Good.
How about your boy on your show?
House of cards,
Kevin Spacey.

1833
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:29.210
They say he's super screwed.
Screw.
Well you hear what they were saying about the,

1834
01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:31.700
the actual set and he'd just be grabbing guys,

1835
01:44:31.701 --> 01:44:34.340
Dixon the sat and cornering him and God dog.

1836
01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:37.550
Just the ultimate take die but just relax.
Well,

1837
01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:39.500
here's a little insight into that.

1838
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:44.900
His brother did an interview where his brother was talking about,
um,

1839
01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.430
I think his dad raping his brother,
like really heavy duty Shit.

1840
01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:53.750
And his brother is dressed like rod Stewart in the 1970s with crazy hair and

1841
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:58.160
some yellow leather jacket with rings on and Shit and or something like you're

1842
01:44:58.161 --> 01:45:02.390
just crazy.
Fashion loves this shit.
Like why is going on?
You realize,
oh,

1843
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:07.670
these two probably come from an extremely sexually abusive household.

1844
01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:10.160
And he was talking about how he thinks that,

1845
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:14.090
and I don't know if this is pre or post allegation because I literally only

1846
01:45:14.091 --> 01:45:15.290
watched like two minutes of it.

1847
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.510
I read a little bit of it and I'll watch two minutes of it.

1848
01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:21.140
And then my little fucking chipmunk brain was like,
next thing,
please see ya.

1849
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:25.670
And uh,
but he was talking about how he thinks it.

1850
01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:30.671
Kevin Spacey became an actor because he hated his life and hated like what he

1851
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:34.520
experienced growing up.
So when I saw on else you wanted to be someone else,

1852
01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.250
but Dan,
was he good at it?
He was amazing actor.

1853
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.870
But I don't think his brother was,
I don't,

1854
01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:43.730
I don't know if they even addressed his sexual abuse allegation.
They,
um,
like,

1855
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.140
cause I didn't really get into it at some heavy shit.
Dude.

1856
01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:52.590
Scary shit that went on for so long.
This Harvey Weinstein Shade.

1857
01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.850
Is it scary to just,
you know,
when I found you want to see something crazy here,

1858
01:45:55.851 --> 01:46:00.410
I'll send it to Jamie.
See something crazy.
I found some shit from 1947.

1859
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:03.940
Hold on one second.
I don't know dude.

1860
01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:08.660
How ugly are all these sexual predators to they're hideous.

1861
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.830
Like Yancey,
my boy coast again,
the Co cues of sexual,
yeah,

1862
01:46:12.831 --> 01:46:17.000
like assault me too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's um,
it is,

1863
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.930
they are hideous,

1864
01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:23.110
but it seems like this was what they did in Hollywood and this is the culture,

1865
01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:24.800
right?

1866
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.490
Like these guys are products of the environment because there's a lot right now.

1867
01:46:28.491 --> 01:46:33.470
Jamie if would you be able to put this up?
Email?
Yeah.
Text message.

1868
01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:37.430
Sure.
Okay.
Here,
I'm going to send it to you because this is a,
this is crazy.

1869
01:46:37.431 --> 01:46:42.260
This is from this woman in 1947 and she was talking about this very thing,

1870
01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:46.380
Kevin Spacey thing.
What does it on?
His brother says,

1871
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:48.380
the price of betrayal and deviancy.

1872
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:52.320
How an abusive childhood at the hands of a vile Nazi father turn Kevin Spacey

1873
01:46:52.321 --> 01:46:56.030
and to a quote monster who's life was a lie.
Wow.

1874
01:46:57.810 --> 01:46:59.060
Damn.
Kevin Spacey was

1875
01:46:59.090 --> 01:47:03.270
<v 1>born.
Kevin Fowler grew up in a Nazi support with a Nazi supporting father.
Uh,</v>

1876
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:08.150
older brother Randy recalls being sexually abused by Father Thomas aged 14.

1877
01:47:08.570 --> 01:47:11.090
While mother Kathleen turned a blind eye.

1878
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:15.910
<v 0>Oof.
Hey listen,
I'd love to see what he did is horrible and he's a monster,</v>

1879
01:47:15.911 --> 01:47:18.340
but God,
man,
you feel bad for it.
You feel bad.

1880
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.430
<v 1>Jamie,
look at that text that I sent you.
Um,
there's,
this was a,</v>

1881
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:25.251
again,

1882
01:47:25.251 --> 01:47:30.251
this is from 1947 and it was Maureen or o' Hara and she charged Hollywood

1883
01:47:31.941 --> 01:47:35.900
producers and directors with calling her a cold potato without sex appeal.

1884
01:47:36.110 --> 01:47:38.300
Because she refuses to let them make love to her.

1885
01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:42.500
Says the mirror in New York correspondent,
she says in quotes,

1886
01:47:42.501 --> 01:47:47.410
I'm so upset with it that I am ready to quit Hollywood.
Maureen says,
uh,

1887
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:51.050
it's got,
it's got so bad.
I hate to come to work in the morning.

1888
01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:56.530
I'm a helpless victim of Hollywood's whispering campaign because I don't let let

1889
01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:02.950
the producer and the director kissed me every morning or let them pour me.
They,

1890
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:08.290
they have spread word around town that I something not a woman,

1891
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:13.220
am,
am not a woman,
then I'm a cold piece of marble,
a statuary.

1892
01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:14.293
Hmm.

1893
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:18.730
<v 0>Wow.
Jesus Christ.
So that's that.</v>

1894
01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:22.210
That just shows you how long it's been going on.

1895
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:24.400
That this is probably what they always did.

1896
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:26.530
These funds are so many more monsters.

1897
01:48:26.531 --> 01:48:28.900
Like these guys are the product of the machine.

1898
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:30.021
<v 1>Well,
yeah,</v>

1899
01:48:30.021 --> 01:48:33.440
I mean if you're an intern and you grow up seeing that and then you become some

1900
01:48:33.441 --> 01:48:35.120
sort of a studio head and then you see,

1901
01:48:35.121 --> 01:48:37.670
you see that everywhere around you and then you're doing it.

1902
01:48:38.370 --> 01:48:40.260
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.
Their product didn't invite me.</v>

1903
01:48:40.261 --> 01:48:42.030
It's like that's the nature of the business,

1904
01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:45.480
which is horrible to say and now it's finally out there.
Yeah.

1905
01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:48.660
The Kevin Spacey thing is crazy.
Sucrase ones.

1906
01:48:48.661 --> 01:48:53.190
It's all like a lot of 14 year olds that he was grabbing the day,

1907
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:57.540
fuck man.
And then what do you see?
Harvard fucking,

1908
01:48:57.541 --> 01:49:00.210
Harvey Weinstein just looks like pure shit.

1909
01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:03.720
He tried like going in a disguise that like a sports bar or some shit.

1910
01:49:03.721 --> 01:49:08.490
You see the,
no,
he didn't.
He did sir.
Your six,
five,
300 pounds out of shape,

1911
01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.900
your faces everywhere.
He tried to go into a sports bar with the sky.

1912
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:14.580
There's like a picture of him at a bar and people are like,

1913
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:17.250
are you shitting me and what are you doing?

1914
01:49:17.251 --> 01:49:20.040
He really thought he was going to sneak in that that's like the mountain from

1915
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:22.080
game of Thrones sitting at a bar and we're like,
no,
well no.

1916
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.430
Everyone knows what the fuck you look like.

1917
01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:26.580
Look at this wigs out and let me see it.

1918
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:30.270
Phoenix restaurant hardly see that.
It's hard to see

1919
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:34.850
you.
Sure.
That's him.
Yeah,
that's him.
That picture.
Yeah,

1920
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:38.980
but that picture looks terrible.
That's horrible picture,
but that's hard to tell.

1921
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:43.430
He's been in the Phoenix area where he's completed a one week outpatient rehab

1922
01:49:43.431 --> 01:49:48.060
program.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,
so great.

1923
01:49:48.061 --> 01:49:52.120
You can put a hat on in a wig and thing.
We won't notice who

1924
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.410
dark shit and right above it,
it's a giant Johnny Depp to sell homes.

1925
01:50:00.190 --> 01:50:05.140
Paid debt.
It's still love that guy.
He just goes off.
Yeah,
he's this.

1926
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:07.560
He's that guy made,
he's still just spend,

1927
01:50:07.561 --> 01:50:11.500
it could lose homes to repay $5 million loan.
Wow.

1928
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:14.230
Someone home son,
but that's not good.

1929
01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.640
That means he doesn't have $5 million to pay a loan and he has like 14 houses.

1930
01:50:18.641 --> 01:50:21.760
He owns better.
Hey Disney better strike up another pipe.

1931
01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.080
Can you imagine if you went on,

1932
01:50:23.081 --> 01:50:27.760
I just thought hurricane and ride of cocaine for like 17 years and all of a

1933
01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:32.340
sudden you woke up and you're like,
Oh
I,
oh,
what?

1934
01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.630
What is,
how many houses?
Who fucking let me buy all these houses?
18 ounces.

1935
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:40.360
Are you shitting me and wonder why he's suing his business managers?

1936
01:50:40.361 --> 01:50:45.020
Like you knew what I was on call by 14 houses when I was on coke.

1937
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:49.510
God dammit.
Poor bastard.

1938
01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:51.083
Hey Man.

1939
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:57.790
How many years after retiring from boxing is Floyd Mayweather broke?
Uh,
the,

1940
01:50:57.791 --> 01:51:02.050
I mean,
the Conor fight alarms me a five.
Five,
probably five.
Five.

1941
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:06.910
Does he know the company fight at like 46?
No.
None of that ship sail.

1942
01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:11.680
You don't think so?
[inaudible] comeback fight at 46.
Nah.
It's just too sad.

1943
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:14.800
His Ego's too big than the market's not there anymore.

1944
01:51:15.010 --> 01:51:19.480
I think he tries to talk Conor McGregor into a rematch.
I'm not kidding.

1945
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:21.130
You see color statements about that?

1946
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:24.310
Nobody's saying he said I'd beat him in a rematch.
Adorable.

1947
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:27.700
And I take that dammit.
Yeah,
come on.
Well,

1948
01:51:27.701 --> 01:51:32.440
he would have to do something extremely different.
And his training,
no,
no,
no.

1949
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:37.330
There's,
it's just not,
it's,
he's never beating me may whether in a boxing match,

1950
01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:40.890
it's just not the,
he was punching him hard.
Right.
It looked like a,

1951
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.700
he clipped him with that one hard upper cut,

1952
01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:47.110
but it looks like he was pacing himself in savings energy.

1953
01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:49.780
It's just that it's just not the way to go.
I get what he's doing,

1954
01:51:49.781 --> 01:51:54.460
but it's just not the way to go.
Yeah.
But if you're making $100 million,

1955
01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:55.360
it's $100 million.

1956
01:51:55.361 --> 01:51:58.090
If he could sucker people into doing it again for $100 million.

1957
01:51:58.870 --> 01:52:00.360
Well what do you think the UFC is good.

1958
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:04.340
What do you think the UFC is going to have to do her back?
Cause kind of getting,

1959
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:07.000
you know,
cutterhead his movie premiere,

1960
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:10.090
which I guess destroyed the box offices in Ireland.

1961
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:12.400
I don't know how many perimeters they have out there,
but it's the biggest,

1962
01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:16.930
most successful Irish movie of all time.
That's so crazy.
Yeah.
Which is crazy.

1963
01:52:17.410 --> 01:52:21.160
Um,
but,
so they asked him,
what do you have to do?
He goes,
oh,
we're not,

1964
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:25.450
I don't have bosses anymore.
We have to be partners,
which has a legit point.

1965
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:28.630
Yeah.
It's a legit point.
He's a different business entity.

1966
01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:32.080
But I think part of the points going to be that he can't talk about it.

1967
01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:35.050
That's probably the,
I agree.
I think the deal is going to happen.

1968
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:37.960
And then you just,
I'm like,
no,
I'm fine.
Normal contract cause UFC he's like,
Yep,

1969
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:39.580
we get a bit,
we're going to give you some money.

1970
01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:43.840
There's also the issue if you're negotiating that you go public with this

1971
01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:46.520
negotiation like that.
You want to talk about that?
No,

1972
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:49.550
I mean I guess he does for his brand because it makes them look like a super

1973
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:51.590
ball.
They've got to pay corner now.

1974
01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.040
They can't just fucking keep on the same deal they had before or not to say

1975
01:52:57.261 --> 01:52:58.040
anything.

1976
01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:02.810
Well for Connor parts thing is disclosing it.

1977
01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:04.220
It's part of his,

1978
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:08.500
his swagger is how much money's what makes him Conor Mcgregor.

1979
01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:13.100
He's beating the game,
which is why she likes the game.
Let's go to be parity now.

1980
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:17.090
That's gotta be,
it can't be.
The older deal can be the old deal.

1981
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:19.520
So you think they give them a apart?

1982
01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.880
I think if I was the UFC I would do what it takes to be in the condom or Greg of

1983
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:25.760
business.

1984
01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.430
Now I don't know what that means because I don't know shit about business.

1985
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:32.060
That means you're given a percentage of your company.

1986
01:53:32.061 --> 01:53:35.240
You got to give up a percentage if you want a percentage.
Okay.
Okay.

1987
01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:39.170
94% like this movie.
Fucking fucking amazing.

1988
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:42.500
It's fucking amazing.
94%.

1989
01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:46.160
It's outside of all the movie theaters here.
I don't know about all,
but yeah,

1990
01:53:46.161 --> 01:53:50.330
I think a lot of them probably find those fucking 6% piece of Shite.

1991
01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.860
Jason through the streets of doable in just 6% of Nate Diaz fans.
Yeah.

1992
01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:59.330
What is that about?
Who are these 6% fucking haters?
Super Haters,
right?

1993
01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:02.720
Pure haters.
Particulars.

1994
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:06.710
So you're not getting the Nate fight then if Tony in a kind of fight,

1995
01:54:07.730 --> 01:54:08.563
say that again.

1996
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:11.860
You're probably not getting the Nate fight any time soon if no co,

1997
01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:14.720
cause Conner's team says to that Tony's the next fight,

1998
01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.530
which is management says that,
and Dana says that.
So what do you do if your name,

1999
01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.560
I think they don't want to do an eight fight.
Who Does?
Oh,

2000
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:24.370
you think Conor does it?
Ah,
I think,
ah,
I think they take,

2001
01:54:24.371 --> 01:54:28.160
Nate is a big fucking guy.
He's long.
He's a rough fight.

2002
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:31.850
They had a rough for them.
Tony Ferg.
I think they're both rough fights bolt.

2003
01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:34.280
Neither one of those up.
I want to walk in the park.

2004
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:37.700
But after coming off of that real hard fight with Nate,

2005
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:41.720
maybe he thinks Tony's easier to hit.
No,
although,

2006
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:45.350
well he hit made a lot too though.
Yeah,
he did hit Nate a lot,
but,

2007
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:48.440
and it's at 55 but plot plus,
which is going to get more,

2008
01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.660
what's going to get more hype Ne.
I agree.
I agree.

2009
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:56.120
But,
and he was here.
He'd argued going to be going crazy.

2010
01:54:56.570 --> 01:55:01.250
Tony just star Super Star.
I went to Eddie.
Got To relax.
Yeah,
but you know,

2011
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:03.560
Eddie trains him.
Totally understand.

2012
01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:08.780
I honestly want to see each fight equally.
I really do.

2013
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:13.280
I don't have a favorite.
I would love to see Nate and Connor go at it again.

2014
01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:16.760
I would love to see Conor go out with Tony.
I literally do not have a favorite.

2015
01:55:16.761 --> 01:55:18.860
I love both of those fights.
What happens if you only get,

2016
01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:21.950
you get one five that have kind of come,
he goes,
I'm only fighting once.
Tony,

2017
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:26.810
I'm gonna let Joe Rogan be.
The Guy Decides yet.
Tony Nader,
GSP,
Tony,

2018
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:30.080
Tony,
because we haven't seen him fight Tony before.

2019
01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:33.530
We've seen him fight Nate twice.
GSP is such a long shot.

2020
01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:37.430
It's a different weight class.
It's one 70 I mean that's all that they mean.

2021
01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:40.720
GSP had talked about going to 55 at one point in time.
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

2022
01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:43.670
Yeah,
that would,
that would take a long fucking time from,

2023
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:48.890
from the people who I know who are super close with George,

2024
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:53.220
what they want is worldly and then a super fight with Conor.

2025
01:55:53.221 --> 01:55:55.770
That's their game plan.
Why are they want Woodley

2026
01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:01.770
70 champ?
You're not going to vacate 85 [inaudible] 85 that makes sense.

2027
01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:05.580
Dangerous fight.
Hell yeah,
but they're all dangerous.
All dangerous.

2028
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.780
Oliver's 85 it's just unrealistic.
That ain't happening.

2029
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:13.620
70 makes more sense.
But look at what Dana said.
Don't call him a liar.

2030
01:56:13.710 --> 01:56:16.440
I'll call him right now.
Did you say he's a liar?
He already hates it.

2031
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.710
Robert Whittaker here,
he hates me anyways,
so he can't get any worse,

2032
01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.150
so I don't give a fuck.

2033
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:25.180
But I think he has to say that there's a lot of things where,

2034
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.110
you know he's a PR list.
I know he's your friend.
He's also a promoter.

2035
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:31.710
He's the best person in the game.
Right.
So he has to say certain stuff.

2036
01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.710
So there's just not a wild west.
Maybe George really wants a fight.

2037
01:56:34.711 --> 01:56:38.640
Robert Whittaker.
It's entirely possible.
George really likes it at one 85.

2038
01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:44.450
Who knows?
I don't know.
Not Happening.
Yeah,
I don't know.
I don't know.

2039
01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.630
I don't know.
It's not like take it.
It's not like,
yeah,
I'll take it.

2040
01:56:47.650 --> 01:56:50.550
[inaudible] sound like Dana's word is bond here where you know,

2041
01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:53.640
he hasn't set outlandish shit before to hyper thing.
Let me ask you this.

2042
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:54.780
What do you rather see?

2043
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:58.980
You rather see him versus GSP versus Robert Whitaker or gs free versus Woodley?

2044
01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:05.090
Um,
God,
that's a great question.
I got my answer.
Yeah.
Winokur right.

2045
01:57:05.091 --> 01:57:08.820
It's so fucking exciting cause we can knock his ass out,
knock anybody out.

2046
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.610
And he's aggressive and he's,
he's very technical.

2047
01:57:11.850 --> 01:57:15.930
He's striking his fucking wicked.
He's wicked.
What would I rather see ya?

2048
01:57:15.931 --> 01:57:19.740
I'd rather see Whitaker.
GSP.
Oh,
okay,
fine.
If I'm on GSPS team,

2049
01:57:19.741 --> 01:57:22.590
he's fighting Woodley.
Really?
Whitaker ain't a fun fight for him.

2050
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.590
I don't think either fights or fun fight for anybody.
Neither is fun,

2051
01:57:25.591 --> 01:57:29.420
but at 85 there's a lot of his,
his stamina.
There's a lot though.

2052
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.970
It's just not fun for him.
Well,
it's interesting because Robert Whitaker,

2053
01:57:32.971 --> 01:57:36.840
the 185 pound interim champ used to be 170 pound fighter as well.

2054
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:39.660
And he was stopped by Wonderboy.
Yeah,
that's true.

2055
01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:45.150
But he was draining himself to make one 70.
And Britta digger again,

2056
01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:50.160
we're talking about a 26 year old guy who when he changed weight classes was

2057
01:57:50.161 --> 01:57:54.810
probably only 23.
Yeah,
right.
It was about three years ago.
Yeah.
This last loss,

2058
01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:58.950
right?
Yup.
Yeah.
He just couldn't make the weight training himself.

2059
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:00.330
And it's hard when you're,

2060
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:04.950
when you're older and he's pretty fucking stout at a,

2061
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.790
at 185 pounds.
I mean,
he's not,
it's not small one 85.

2062
01:58:08.791 --> 01:58:12.190
He's the fastest 85 in the world.
Were you shocked by um,

2063
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:15.750
Musashi Musashi fight?
Uh,

2064
01:58:15.790 --> 01:58:19.800
I think that shows you like how good the bell tour guys are.
Yes and no.
I,
I do,

2065
01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:22.170
I think bell tours at a level,
certain guys that are level,

2066
01:58:22.171 --> 01:58:26.640
but I think Musashi if here's the interview and he was actually pretty funny in

2067
01:58:26.641 --> 01:58:28.890
it,
but he was like,
I had one fucking,
I'm it.

2068
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:32.550
I literally had one night he closed my eye up so I was just going off instincts

2069
01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:37.410
and she'll Mancos very tough Mary.
So I've one eye,
he stuff,
that's what you get.

2070
01:58:37.590 --> 01:58:42.110
Yeah.
He caught him with one big clanger but he was,
he was the brand and Vera,

2071
01:58:42.170 --> 01:58:43.780
he was like before even guys and was like,

2072
01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:48.370
I'm going to be champ at middle weight,
lightweight heavyweight and like,
whoa.

2073
01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.940
I think everyone's going to go fuck rose now.
I just want to be a good person.

2074
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:55.420
God wants you to do first.
I want to be myself.
You can't do that.

2075
01:58:55.421 --> 01:58:58.150
Can kick your ass.
And she's like,
our father in heaven help you.

2076
01:58:58.151 --> 01:59:02.410
That's some scary shit.
Really got room for one road.
She did it though.
I know,

2077
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:05.740
man.
Very happy.
Me Too.
That left Hook was the fallacy.

2078
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:08.620
One of the most intriguing fights on the car to me,

2079
01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:11.200
I gotta be on again,

2080
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:14.470
I've known rose and we have a history in Denver and we had the same coaches and

2081
01:59:14.471 --> 01:59:17.200
I love rose.
I bet on or just cause you're such a big underdog.

2082
01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.970
I S and I predicted,

2083
01:59:18.971 --> 01:59:21.610
I thought she was going to get choosing to be a lot of trouble because your

2084
01:59:21.611 --> 01:59:23.900
hands just so goddamn technical.
Yeah.

2085
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:26.740
But I think Yolanda didn't respect her,

2086
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:31.340
didn't she kinda overlooked her that that championship,
you know,
those,

2087
01:59:31.341 --> 01:59:33.190
those obligations you have as a champion.

2088
01:59:33.191 --> 01:59:35.560
I don't think people realize what comes with that.
You know,

2089
01:59:35.561 --> 01:59:38.500
a lot of people go over.
Yeah.
I think it was Dana said this or was run like,

2090
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:41.050
he really wants to be a champ too.
You have to do championships shit,

2091
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.790
which you gotta sell the fight.

2092
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:45.070
You're the reason why the paper view is selling the,

2093
01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:49.300
there's a lot that comes with that.
So,
and it's George retired because he's like,

2094
01:59:49.301 --> 01:59:52.960
dude,
I can't relax man.
Yeah.
We don't get to see it very often too.
You know,

2095
01:59:52.961 --> 01:59:56.140
like we don't get to see it.
We see little clips here and there,

2096
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:57.700
but we don't know what their schedule's like.

2097
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:00.250
All the phone calls they have to make all the interviews they have common or

2098
02:00:00.251 --> 02:00:02.770
talked about it a lot.
I remember that he backed out of the,

2099
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:04.720
when they wanted to do that fight,
he was like,
no,
fuck man,

2100
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:07.390
I'm not doing all that media.
That's right.
Remember they're killing me.

2101
02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.850
They were going to be pulled them from the car.
Yeah.
He was like,
cool,

2102
02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:11.650
I don't give a fuck.
I need to train.

2103
02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:14.380
Like you guys are having me do all this media circus stuff.

2104
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:16.030
I've got to focus on the fight man.

2105
02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.540
And he and they put him through more interviews and then anyone ever of course.

2106
02:00:19.541 --> 02:00:24.240
Cause he's never met a camera.
He doesn't like and think that.
He was like,
no,
no,

2107
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:28.660
I'm going crazy.
I remember when him and although they did that world tour.
Yeah,

2108
02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:32.100
that was ridiculous,
man.
Over over,
over easy.

2109
02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:35.510
How about the F and then the the Floyd Mayweather tour that,

2110
02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:38.290
that schedule is nuts.
And I was just a commentator on that bitch.

2111
02:00:38.291 --> 02:00:40.380
I was exhausted.
How crazy was that?

2112
02:00:40.530 --> 02:00:43.960
That tour where they would stand in front of everybody and talk shit.

2113
02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.680
I told [inaudible] talking to cities,

2114
02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:50.780
it'd be tough for the best comics in the world.
Cup of new material,

2115
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:54.160
six nights in a row,
little loan.
These two fighters,

2116
02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.880
like the first two cities you saw,
they have their shit together.
It was fun.

2117
02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.310
Then after that third one is like,
what are we doing?

2118
02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.100
What do you think would they sell tickets to that of they're giving it away for

2119
02:01:03.101 --> 02:01:06.390
free?
I think they giving them away,
but it was packed.

2120
02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:10.640
I've never seen some shit like that.
Ev.
Right.

2121
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:12.280
How many different ones that you go to live?

2122
02:01:12.310 --> 02:01:16.150
I went to all of them except for London.
How many have,
whether I went to,
uh,

2123
02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:19.000
let's see,
I went to the Los Angeles,
um,

2124
02:01:19.630 --> 02:01:23.710
New York and Toronto and they did London.
So I went on and the biggest,
what?

2125
02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:26.860
Toronto.
I've never seen anything like it,
man.
Never.
Wow.

2126
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:31.300
People hanging off the rafters to get a piece of his nuts.
Scary shifts.

2127
02:01:31.301 --> 02:01:35.020
No one like him.
It's weird.
You know,
there's a lot of great fighters right now,

2128
02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:40.021
but there's no one that has the same animatic persona,

2129
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.360
this fucking quality that makes everybody want to be around them.

2130
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:47.570
No one on the planet.
I,
there's no one even a close second.

2131
02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:51.260
There's never been a close second has there?
Nah,
Nah.

2132
02:01:51.261 --> 02:01:53.000
Like as far as like popularity,

2133
02:01:53.001 --> 02:01:56.990
he's like the biggest by combat sports athlete ever because who else could go

2134
02:01:56.991 --> 02:02:00.680
from one sport to the next the way he did?
No,
it was just perfect timing.

2135
02:02:00.681 --> 02:02:05.600
Perfect style,
but the,
the talent right now at 55 and 78 it again,

2136
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:07.850
I was looking at 70 I'm like,
oh my God,

2137
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:11.670
the UFC is operating at such a high level.
Talent wise,
it's nuts,
insane visions.

2138
02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.880
Other divisions.
It's Jesus guys.
We need some life.

2139
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:17.720
Do you think you could ever talk George and to fight and Connor hundred percent

2140
02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.060
I'm,
I'm telling you it happened at one 70 why?

2141
02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:23.120
I'm telling you when I tell you my guys who are super close to George at their

2142
02:02:23.121 --> 02:02:27.830
plan is Woodley Conner.
Now a lot has to happen and these guys,

2143
02:02:27.831 --> 02:02:31.930
are you me,
brother?
I'm done.
Yeah,
man.
Worldly kind.
Chi.

2144
02:02:32.110 --> 02:02:35.750
If George comes back and beats Tyron Woodley,
first of all,

2145
02:02:35.751 --> 02:02:39.350
that would cement him as the goat.
He's the goat already.
Let's be honest.

2146
02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:43.370
Who you coming back at 36 and winning the middleweight title,
moving up,

2147
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:46.370
finishing him,
finishing pound,
playing him sleep.

2148
02:02:47.090 --> 02:02:50.630
But it's still like that's accomplishment goat versus like technique.

2149
02:02:50.631 --> 02:02:53.880
Goat technique.
Goad is mighty mouse.
Who's planning last fight?

2150
02:02:54.210 --> 02:02:55.940
He always go through that.
Nobody liked that.

2151
02:02:55.970 --> 02:03:00.790
Look at George's resume and you're talking about non Usada days.

2152
02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:04.460
True.
When it was the wild fucking west,
which that's that creatine lot.

2153
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.990
That's a question.
He still worries.

2154
02:03:06.010 --> 02:03:09.920
That's a question too about creatine in the bag.
I gotta wrap this up.

2155
02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.870
Tell everybody where you're going to be this week.
Let's see.
Thursday,

2156
02:03:14.871 --> 02:03:19.620
I'm in Charlotte.
Friday,
Saturday.
Xannies in Nashville on the road.
Yes.

2157
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:24.110
Sun Sunday night,
Sunday night.
Columbus,
Charlotte,

2158
02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.040
Nashville,
Columbus.
Let's do this.
Deepak.
gay.com.
Yeah.
Uh,

2159
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:31.790
I'm at the Ice House Friday night,
Pasadena,
