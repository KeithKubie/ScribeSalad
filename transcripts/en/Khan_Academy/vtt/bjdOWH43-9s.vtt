00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.509
- [Voiceover] So we're told
that F of two is equal to 12,

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.037
F prime of X is equal to
24 over X to the third

00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:13.030
and what we want to figure out
is what is F of negative one.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.791
Alright, so they give us the
derivative in terms of X.

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:18.927
So maybe we could take the anti-derivative

00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:21.899
of the derivative to find
our original function.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.100
So let's do that.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.848
So we could say that F of X,

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:29.907
F of X is going to be equal
to the anti-derivative

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:34.233
or we could say the indefinite
integral of F prime of X,

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.945
which is equal to 24 over X to the third.

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.283
I could write it over like
this, 24 over X to the third.

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:44.300
But to help me process
it a little bit more,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.439
I'm gonna write this as
24 X to the negative three

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:51.563
'cause then it'll become how
to take that anti-derivative.

00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:52.396
D, DX.

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:55.809
And so what is the anti-derivative

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.226
of 24X to the negative three?

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.767
Well we're just going to do
the power rule in reverse.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:05.262
So what we're going to do

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:08.814
is we're going to increase the exponent.

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:09.908
So let me just rewrite it.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.445
It's going to be 24X to the,

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:14.844
we're going to increase
the exponent by one,

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.809
so it's gonna be X to the
negative three plus one

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:20.372
and then we're going to divide
by that increased exponent.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:23.149
So negative three plus one

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.606
and so that is going to be

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:29.317
negative three plus one
is X to the negative two

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.148
and then we divide by negative two

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.658
and if you're in doubt
about what we just did

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:37.168
where we're kind of doing
the power rule in reverse,

00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:40.079
now take the derivative of
this using the power rule.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.417
Negative two times 24 over negative two

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.274
is just gonna be 24 and then
you decrement that exponent,

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:47.849
you go to negative three.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.760
So are we done here, is this F of X?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.098
Well F of X might involve a constant.

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:57.302
So let's put a constant out here

00:01:57.302 --> 00:01:58.366
because notice if you were to take

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.289
the derivative of this thing here,

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.013
the derivative of 24X to the
negative two over negative two

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:06.217
we already established is
24X to the negative three.

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:07.735
But then if you take the
derivative of a constant,

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:08.777
well that just disappears.

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:10.966
So you don't see it when
you look at the derivative.

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.423
So we have to make sure that
there might be a constant

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:15.079
and I have a feeling based
on the information that

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.989
they've given us, we're going
to make use of that constant.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.152
So let me rewrite F of X.

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:23.917
So we know that F of X can be expressed as

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.493
24 divided by negative two.

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:29.660
It's negative 12X to the
negative two plus some constant.

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:34.002
So how do we figure out that constant?

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:36.592
Well they have told us what F of two is.

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:38.728
F of two is equal to 12.

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.117
So let's write this down.

00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:42.367
So F of two is equal to 12,

00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:49.543
which is equal to well we
just have to put two in

00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:51.092
everywhere we see an X.

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:52.788
That's going to be negative two

00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:56.288
times two to the negative two power plus C

00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:01.609
and so 12 is equal to, what is this,

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.038
two to the negative two.

00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:07.017
Two to the negative two is
equal to one over two squared,

00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:09.206
which is equal to 1/4.

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:13.212
So this is negative 12 times 1/4.

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:15.855
Negative 12 times 1/4 is negative three.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:18.739
So it's negative three plus C.

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.436
Now we can add three to
both sides to solve or C.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.436
We get 15 is equal to C.

00:03:27.364 --> 00:03:29.281
So or C is equal to 15.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:32.892
That is equal to 15.

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:35.081
And so now we can write our F of X

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:38.414
as we get F of X is equal to negative 12

00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:43.765
and I could even write that as

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.747
negative 12 over X squared if we like.

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:49.580
Negative 12 over X squared plus 15

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:56.066
and now using that we can
evaluate F of negative one.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.374
F of negative one.

00:03:57.374 --> 00:04:00.098
Everywhere we see an X we
put a negative one there.

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:03.383
So this is going to be
negative one squared.

00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:07.300
So F of negative one is
equal to 12 divided by,

00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:10.673
negative 12 divided by
negative one squared.

00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:11.955
Well negative one squared is just one.

00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:15.627
So it's gonna be negative 12 plus 15,

00:04:15.627 --> 00:04:18.877
which is equal to three and we're done.

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:22.263
This thing is equal to three.
