00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.490
Remember when we saw those really cool images
of Pluto?

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.120
How did a dwarf planet send those us all the
way from space?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.120
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.880
The first spy satellites had actual film cameras
onboard, with canisters equipped with parachutes

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.539
to get the photos back to the ground, but
as we advanced, satellites began using digital

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.720
cameras, on-board computers and radio waves
to send data long distances.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.879
Today, the MSL Curiosity rover is on Mars,
Juno is almost to Jupiter and Cassini is visiting

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:35.879
Saturn…

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.120
All of these missions are constantly sending
data to scientists back on Earth, but how?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.820
It’s all thanks to the Deep Space Network.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.190
It became clear really early on in the space
program, that scientists needed a way to constantly

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.820
be able to communicate with their satellites.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.469
Unfortunately for them, the Earth rotates,
and as it does, satellites appear and disappear

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.530
So, 50 years ago, NASA’s JPL began the Deep
Space Network.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.080
Three sites were selected to receive data
from Space, one in California, one in Spain

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.560
and another in Australia -- 120 degrees apart
so together they could see the whole sky 24

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.909
hours a day.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.130
On each site an array of massive satellite
dishes ranging from 24 to 70 meters in diameter

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.390
were constructed.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.680
This is the most powerful and sensitive communication
system in the world.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.329
The 70-meter antenna is able to hear quote
"a whisper from a billion kilometers" away.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.060
Now, because of launch weight restrictions
and power limits, broadcast equipment on spacecrafts

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.030
has to be light, so engineers are forced to
use relatively low-powered transmitters -- like,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.240
20 watts (that’s way less than the average
incandescent light bulb).

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.610
And it gets weaker as it travels through space.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.280
By the time the signal reaches the dish, it
can be "20-billion times less than the power

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.770
needed to power a digital watch."

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.270
When a signal wave hits the dish, it's reflected
to a highly sensitive receiver at the center

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.680
-- and put through a crazy powerful amplifier.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.869
The amplifiers are cooled to near absolute
zero, to minimize electrical interference

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.439
from the equipment itself.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.560
So, because of their position on the globe,
no matter where the satellites are, at least

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.170
one DSN dish will be able to hear the broadcast.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.069
Signals from near-Earth missions are strong,
and can be picked up relatively easily.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.770
For deep-space missions, it’s a bit harder.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.750
To strengthen the signal, probes in space
use both low and high-gain antennas.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.540
Low-gain antennas are like ones used at local
radio stations -- they spread their power

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.420
in every direction at once.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.640
The tiny microwaves of a high-gain antenna
are focused, like a laser, so the signal strength

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.720
is stronger when it reaches Earth.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.209
If the spacecraft points it's high-gain antenna
at Earth, the DSN can pick it up.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.690
The Earth-based antennas also have to move
here on the ground.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.700
High-gain antennas are extremely directional,
because you don't want to lose at data stream!

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.730
So, the ability to point directly at what
we’re trying to communicate with is super

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
important.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.040
But even if the spacecraft is not pointed
at Earth, the DSN can still “see” the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
low gain signal.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.200
According to NASA, this is what makes low-gain
antennas useful for things like emergencies.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.040
This Earth-sized marvel of engineering is
not only practical for space exploration,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.420
but necessary!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.190
Without each of these three sites, there would
be a time when spacecraft would be on their

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.970
own, in the dark, in the vastness of space.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.370
The Deep Space Network lets them phone home
whenever they need to.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:51.040
And you can see this communication happening
right now!
