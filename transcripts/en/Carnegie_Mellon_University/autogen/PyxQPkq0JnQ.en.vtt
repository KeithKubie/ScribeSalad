one of the problems the teachers told me

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
one of the problems the teachers told me
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.169
one of the problems the teachers told me
about was that some of their students

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179
about was that some of their students
 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.819
about was that some of their students
were too weak to write and some of the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
were too weak to write and some of the
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.139
were too weak to write and some of the
younger ones didn't understand the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
younger ones didn't understand the
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880
younger ones didn't understand the
concept of rails so I asked them to send

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
concept of rails so I asked them to send
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.309
concept of rails so I asked them to send
me a video of their students writing and

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319
me a video of their students writing and
 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.380
me a video of their students writing and
they did and immediately it was clear to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
they did and immediately it was clear to
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690
they did and immediately it was clear to
me how complex this problem was but I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
me how complex this problem was but I
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940
me how complex this problem was but I
was also able to identify right away

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

and researchers at CMU until we had a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640
and researchers at CMU until we had a
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.729
and researchers at CMU until we had a
device that we felt pretty confident

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
device that we felt pretty confident
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.160
device that we felt pretty confident
that we could take to India and so in

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
that we could take to India and so in
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.199
that we could take to India and so in
the summer of two thousand six I boarded

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209
the summer of two thousand six I boarded
 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.449
the summer of two thousand six I boarded
a plane and headed off to Bangalore our

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
a plane and headed off to Bangalore our
 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.000
a plane and headed off to Bangalore our
first field test was very successful and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
first field test was very successful and
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.309
first field test was very successful and
we learned that we could improve this

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
we learned that we could improve this
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.680
we learned that we could improve this
tool in many different ways so our

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
tool in many different ways so our
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.629
tool in many different ways so our
students worked on improving the design

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639
students worked on improving the design
 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.940
students worked on improving the design
of the tutor they built a new curriculum

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950
of the tutor they built a new curriculum
 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.370
of the tutor they built a new curriculum
and added several new things like

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
and added several new things like
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.530
and added several new things like
mathematics and new languages in Braille

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
mathematics and new languages in Braille
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780
mathematics and new languages in Braille
and then we were ready to feel test this

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
and then we were ready to feel test this
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210
and then we were ready to feel test this
again so we built a new partnership with

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
again so we built a new partnership with
 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.039
again so we built a new partnership with
the syphilis cool for the visually

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
the syphilis cool for the visually
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.590
the syphilis cool for the visually
impaired in Zambia and we also sent our

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
impaired in Zambia and we also sent our
 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.449
impaired in Zambia and we also sent our
students back to the mattress school in

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
students back to the mattress school in
 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.300
students back to the mattress school in
India we decided to develop a couple of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
India we decided to develop a couple of
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.180
India we decided to develop a couple of
games the first one was an animal game

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190
games the first one was an animal game
 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.840
games the first one was an animal game
the Braille tutor would throw out an

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850
the Braille tutor would throw out an
 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.199
the Braille tutor would throw out an
animal sound to the computer speakers

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209
animal sound to the computer speakers
 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.120
animal sound to the computer speakers
and the students would have to write

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130
and the students would have to write
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.789
and the students would have to write
down using the Braille tutor what animal

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799
down using the Braille tutor what animal
 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.069
down using the Braille tutor what animal
that was so we saw that the Braille

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079
that was so we saw that the Braille
 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.680
that was so we saw that the Braille
tutor could also be used to teach other

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
tutor could also be used to teach other
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.620
tutor could also be used to teach other
subjects such as general sciences in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
subjects such as general sciences in
 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.920
subjects such as general sciences in
general knowledge in a fun and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
general knowledge in a fun and
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.140
general knowledge in a fun and
interactive way we've seen how the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
interactive way we've seen how the
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
interactive way we've seen how the
Braille writing tutor transforms the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
Braille writing tutor transforms the
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.159
Braille writing tutor transforms the
lives of these children and because of

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169
lives of these children and because of
 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.770
lives of these children and because of
its low cost our goal is that every

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
its low cost our goal is that every
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.410
its low cost our goal is that every
blind child in the developing world will

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420
blind child in the developing world will
 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.590
blind child in the developing world will
have access to these

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600
have access to these
 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.940
