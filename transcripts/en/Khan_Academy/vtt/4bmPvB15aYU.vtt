00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.891
World War I shaped our world
in many, many, many ways.

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:06.140
And it's important to realize
it wasn't that long ago.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.740
It was not even 100 years ago.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.970
But it was really the end of
the more traditional empires.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.760
It was the end of kingdoms.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.620
It really reshaped much
of the globe much more

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.130
around states defined by nations
rather than states defined

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.310
by monarchies or states
defined by empires.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
And it was also the first war
where technology, or I would

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.224
say modern technology--
technology has always

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:30.390
played a major role in wars.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.202
In fact, wars have been a
catalyst for technology often.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.660
But it was the
first time that much

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.451
of what we consider to
be modern technology

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:39.852
played a huge role in the
actual carrying out of the war.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:41.310
And to a large
degree, this is what

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.460
made the war so much
bloodier, and one

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.660
could argue, even
more protracted.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270
So here I have a
bunch of pictures

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.090
of the various technologies
used in World War I.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.140
Here in this picture you have
a machine gun, which obviously

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.450
allows you to indiscriminately
mow down folks.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.200
These guys, it looks
like they might

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.662
be in some type of a trench.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.370
And so you could
imagine that combination

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.440
if viewed from above.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.386
So let's say that
this is a trench.

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:08.760
This is a trench
right over here.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760
We're looking from above.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.660
So there's some people
sitting in the trench.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.630
A couple of these folks
have machine guns.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.820
The rest of the guys just
have rifles over here.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.400
If you wanted to
storm this trench,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.604
you'd be in a bad situation.

00:01:19.604 --> 00:01:21.270
The guy with the
machine gun essentially

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.800
could just mow people down.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.700
They also tended
to use barbed wire.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.390
Barbed wire wasn't
invented in World War

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.107
I. It was invented many
decades before in the 1800s.

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:32.940
But that would make it
very hard for someone

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.100
to cross this period.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.659
They would get stuck in it.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.200
At which point these guys in
the trench could shoot him down.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.490
And it would be very hard to
shoot the guys in the trench.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.400
So it also, other than
making it very deadly,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.771
it gave all the
advantages to the defense.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.520
So any time someone
wanted to gain ground,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.103
especially in one of the fronts
where trench warfare was being

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:53.370
used, it was a hugely,
hugely, hugely bloody affair.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.620
The other technology
that came into mainstream

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.710
use in World War I
was the use of gas,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.355
and in particular poison gas.

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:08.479
And as you see these
gentleman right over here,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.770
they're wearing gas
masks because they're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.070
afraid that their opponent
is going to use poison gas.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.959
And the benefit of
gas in particular

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.250
is let's say you have an
artillery shell that you throw

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.940
over and it doesn't hit anybody.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.210
But then it starts
releasing a canister

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.930
of-- let me do that
in a different color--

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380
it starts releasing
a canister of gas.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.710
So the gas I've drawn
in this purplish color.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.490
And so it doesn't have
to be a direct hit.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.070
It can just linger there
and infect that trench.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.390
And it'll affect everyone there.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.990
And gas warfare was--
actually, the Germans

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.550
weren't first to use
just gas warfare.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.060
But they were the first
to use very lethal, what

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.340
we would call poison, gas.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.260
And in particular in 1915,
they used chlorine gas.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.680
So let me write that down.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.910
Chlorine gas, which immediately
attacks the respiratory system

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.280
of the person who inhales it.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.330
And they essentially
choke to death

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.440
within seconds or minutes.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.250
They also used phosgene
gas because this did not

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490
stimulate that choking.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.990
And in some ways
it could infiltrate

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.364
the respiratory
system even more.

00:03:13.364 --> 00:03:14.770
It had a delayed effect.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.310
So it would linger around.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.240
And you have the
use of mustard gas.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.570
Mustard gas was very
hard to protect against.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.000
It wouldn't immediately
have you choke to death

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.830
like chlorine gas.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.080
It would be severe blistering.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.300
It would essentially take
you out of the battle.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.210
It was very hard
to protect against.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.280
And it would also linger
around in the trench.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.790
So it made the trench a very
toxic environment to work in.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.780
So these are very,
very, very ugly weapons.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.170
I mean, war itself is ugly.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.530
Weapons themselves are ugly.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.290
I mean, the machine gun
is not a pleasant weapon.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.770
It can mow people down.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.420
But even folks
who view something

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.850
like a machine gun as
an acceptable thing

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.920
tend to view these things
as particularly ugly things

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.940
to use.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.960
Other weapons that
showed up in World War I,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.790
we talked about this
in other videos,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.562
but the tank started
to become a factor.

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:06.270
This right over here
is an American tank.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.690
Obviously, with these treads
it can go in tough terrain.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.834
It's heavily, heavily armored.

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.750
When you talk about this
trench type of thing,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.416
well, if you've got
a big hulking beast,

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.779
maybe that could roll
through the barbed wire

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.310
and take some beating
and maybe eventually--

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.992
so you could imagine a tank
over here, it could eventually--

00:04:25.992 --> 00:04:27.450
and actually the
tanks at this time

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.742
did not have these big turrets.

00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:30.866
So they might have looked
something more like that.

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:32.520
But this might be
able to actually

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.640
be part of an offensive
against a trench like this.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.030
We've talked extensively
about submarine warfare

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.680
in World War I. The Germans
especially used it, essentially

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.050
to have a chance against
the dominant British Navy.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.110
Unrestricted U-boat warfare
was one of the primary reasons

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.110
given by the Americans
as to why they entered

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.880
the war on the side
of the entente.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.670
These are World War
I era US submarines,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.680
just to give an idea of
how they actually looked.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.610
And in some ways the best
foreshadowing of what

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.990
would play a major, major,
major role in future wars

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.870
it was the bringing of heavier
than air craft into the war.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.200
So in particular, we're
talking about airplanes.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.240
So before this, you had stuff
like balloons and zeppelins

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.760
used for reconnaissance, used
to see where we should aim

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.670
the artillery, things like that.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.740
But now you had the Wright
brothers only, frankly,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.200
several years before inventing
the engine powered heavier

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.022
than air craft.

00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:37.480
And at first the airplane, in
the beginning stages the war,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.680
was used for reconnaissance.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.360
But as the technology improved,
as the engines improved,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.675
it started to be
used for bombing.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:47.040
It started to actually
used for air to air combat.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.420
And out of all of the folks
involved in air to air combat,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.510
this gentleman right over here
is probably the most famous.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.700
Although you might not
recognize his name.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.000
He's been turned into a bit of a
caricature in the modern world.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.200
But this is Manfred
von Richthofen.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.410
And he was a pilot
for the Germans.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.229
And he's more famously
known as the Red Baron.

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.520
And he was called the Red
Baron because he was actually

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.020
a Baron.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.860
It is a title of nobility
in imperial Germany.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.267
And he painted his plane red.

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:23.350
So this is a picture of
his plane right over here.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.870
So if I were to color it in--
I guess this isn't quite red.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.850
I should actually probably try
to get a more reddish color.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.810
So maybe this is more of a red.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.020
So this is obviously a
black and white photograph,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.577
but maybe if I
color it in for you,

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:36.160
you'll get more of
the feeling of what

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.534
his plane might
have looked like.

00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:38.620
And it was a triplane.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.670
It had these three
wings right over here,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.450
or three levels of wings.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.040
So whatever, his plane was red.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.100
That's why he was
called the Red Baron.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.020
And he was famous for being
the most lethal pilot in all

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.230
of the war.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.350
He has 80 confirmed kills.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.840
He was able to down
80 enemy aircraft.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.260
So 80 confirmed
wins, I guess you

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.050
can say in combat, which is more
than any other folks in World

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.251
War I. So very,
very famous pilot.

00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:09.750
He himself-- when you're talking
about any of the combatants

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.390
in World War I did not have
a long life expectancy.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.340
The pilots especially
this was a dangerous game.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.860
And he also, despite
being the top pilot,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.720
the top ace, amongst all
the pilots in World War I,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.950
he also ended up getting
shot in the air in 1918.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.200
He literally got shot through
the lungs and the heart.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.330
He somehow managed
to land his plane.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.580
And when the people ran up
to him, the accounts say,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.700
that his famous last
words as he died,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.500
right when they ran up
to him, was "kaput".

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.330
So interesting.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.854
And on top of
that, he's now been

00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:41.270
turned into a bit
of a caricature.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.300
I mean, us in the
West, in the US,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.250
we recognize the
brand Red Baron pizza.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.880
It is named for the Red Baron,
for Manfred von Richthofen.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.830
Kind of a strange name, I
think, for a pizza company.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.350
I mean, he's not even Italian.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.100
But that's, I guess,
what we know him for.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.990
But you see, this
guy right over here

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.620
looks a lot more like
Tom Selleck than look

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.010
like the real Manfred
von Richthofen.
