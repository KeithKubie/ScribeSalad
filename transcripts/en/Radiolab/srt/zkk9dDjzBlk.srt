1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,470
S? Yup.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,403
Okay.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,950
Hey man, how are ya? So Aaron, set
this up. Who are we about to meet?

5
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,950
So this is skip Sherry. He
lives in Brooklyn and that is,

6
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:22,160
we should say Aaron Scott, he's a
reporter who turned us on to skip.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,540
And Aaron met up with skip because he had
this experience that's common to a lot

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,620
of people who moved in New York City.
Just tell us where you, where you grew up.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,530
I grew up in the country
outside of Athens,

10
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,260
Ohio on 54 acres of woodland.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,850
And I would work all day as a kid in the
heat hoeing and picking strawberries,

12
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:45,500
hauling water, planting trees. He had
planned the woods. I loved the woods.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,640
But as he got older he knew he
couldn't stay in Athens. Why not? Well,

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,130
he's a musician. He wanted
to make a living at it.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,970
So he bounced around for a bit.

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,730
I finally find them finally at age 30
there was no place to go except for New

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,400
York's. It wasn't a matter that
you wanted to live in New York,

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,110
New York was your last, my last option.
And he hated it because it was ugly

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,200
to me. You know, like, like
which too many humans. Too many.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,150
Too much concrete. Yeah. No.

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,200
One theory about autism is that the things
that come into an autistic kids brain

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,350
all have equal value. They don't
know how to sort through it.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,050
And when I first came to New
Yorker was, it was really

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,870
overwhelming. I had
decided to leave for sure,

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,850
but then take us to the roof. I
was lucky when I first moved here.

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,780
So he's staying with a friend who lives
in this big building in Brooklyn Heights

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,460
right across from the twin towers.

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,710
It is 36 stories high and he decides
one lonely night to go up onto the roof.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,170
And there's this intense fog

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,630
in the twin towers. The bottom of them
was covering the fog but not the top.

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,800
So it was like they were floating.

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,870
There's little like a cuticle sliver
of moon in the sky and the foghorns are

33
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,920
going in. The boats are slowly moving.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,730
[inaudible]

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,240
and there's this Rees and I had this,

36
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:18,850
this brass penny listed
that my father had given me,

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,410
and I was standing there and I was
playing it and that I was really suddenly

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,130
something clicked. I
was like, oh, that must,

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,320
those are all the bridges.
That's Williamsburg Bridge.

40
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:34,490
That's the Manhattan bridge. There's
the Brooklyn Bridge, that's New York.

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,690
It's small now.

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,070
[inaudible]

43
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,120
and I'm looking at the Statue of Liberty
and my grandmother, Anastasia Pantie,

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,420
came from Albania and
they went to Ellis island.

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,960
I could see my history there too,
and I was suddenly hit me like,

46
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,760
oh my goodness, this is like a coral
reef. You can't see the people,

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,350
but look at this beautiful strip

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,890
fog in the air. It was just
the whole city was breathing,

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,160
the whole nature was beating.
Everything was [inaudible] breathing.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,570
I felt connected on a spiritual
level to the city for the first time.

51
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,450
[inaudible]

52
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,030
and so skip decided to stay for awhile,

53
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,700
for awhile. All over the world.
People are now moving. Of course,

54
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,550
we know this from the country
to the city at this point.

55
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,551
We'll two years ago across
this extraordinary benchmark
that's physicist Jeff

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,220
West,

57
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,110
where more than half of the planet is
now urbanized 51% yet not made us wonder

58
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,630
how do cities work?

59
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,690
Is there some deep organic logic that
holds all these people together or is

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,340
writer gentle era puts it.

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,580
Our city's just these tumors
that people on the landscape

62
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,780
[inaudible]

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm Janet. Boom. Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich.

64
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,490
This is radio lab and our topic today,

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,910
cities, cities. I loved
it, but I don't know why

66
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,693
[inaudible].

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,950
All right, so in talking
about cities, New York City,

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,400
it's kind of hard to know where to start
because every city has its own DNA,

69
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,370
kind of its own unique feel.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,313
Yeah.

71
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,570
Like for instance, Oh, let me just
give you my own stupid example here.

72
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,900
So every time I go to St Louis to visit
my mom, yeah, I'm gay, I'm on the plane,

73
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm in my own kind of groove and I step
off the plane into the airport and it's

74
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,230
just like with the first step,

75
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,700
you just hit this wall of
something is different.

76
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:57,330
Like you feel the difference in your
bone because let's the question I,

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,560
is he there? Right. I'm here.
What gives the city its feel?

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,350
Oh is this Mr Bob Levine?
This is Mr Rob Levin.

79
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,520
Mr Bob Levine is a professor of
psychology, California State University.

80
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,980
And he thinks the answer
to that question is time.

81
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,220
Time did each city warps
time in its own unique way.

82
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,540
My cities are my subjects now.

83
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,140
He studied this idea for the past 30
years in all kinds of different ways.

84
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,560
We looked at things like a
percentage of people wearing watches.

85
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,880
How long does it take bank tellers in
each city to change a $20 bill? Really?

86
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,370
Yeah. And then we, we, we looked
at talking speed offerings. Yeah.

87
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,600
We'd get on the phone and uh,

88
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,500
call post offices since that seemed like
something that would be available every

89
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,960
place and make a standard request.

90
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,210
What'd you tell me the difference
between regular mail certified mail and

91
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:46,990
insured mail. Okay. Certified as when
you just need someone to sign for it.

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,220
Then he says they'd calculate the
number of syllables per second

93
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,250
regular mail. Just close your
mail. You know if it's out of Utah,

94
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,380
Salt Lake City, Utah,

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,610
2.73 syllables per second to put group
number three car to come back to your

96
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,170
house. Springfield, mass

97
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,090
[inaudible] 3.4 or five
syllables per second and

98
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,620
certified is when you want a

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,460
not really sure where it's from
because the tape lost the ID,

100
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,540
but it could be Nashville

101
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,220
the daily. They want to know
who he wanted return receipt

102
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,090
and if it is national
2.65 syllables per second.

103
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,390
Well Springfield is like fuel,

104
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,960
but the whole talking thing was
just really a prelude for Bob.

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,040
It got him into what he,

106
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,920
I think he's most known for and
what we find most fascinating.

107
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,760
We actually looked at
at walking speed lots.

108
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,630
Yeah. Well what I would do is I would
get into a new city and I'm in Mumbai,

109
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,170
India, Jerusalem, CD Chiang Mai, Thailand.

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,550
We actually put out a call to radio
lab listeners everywhere in beginner in

111
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,370
Liberia to help us repeat the
study. Hey, good morning Radiolab.

112
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,410
I'm recording from Dublin, Ireland,
downtown Oslo, Copenhagen to a new city.

113
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,350
And step one, I would scope out
main business and shopping books,

114
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,580
top and street step to get out some
street or roll of spring red strings,

115
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,440
two feet long. 20 meters means over
here. We wouldn't say feed really.

116
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:14,400
Step three, use that string to measure
out the distance. Just have to roll out.

117
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,960
You taped the one end to the sidewalk and
I would just make a more step four and

118
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:22,170
go undercover. Get into Carter
and uh, it'd be cool, you know,

119
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,710
act like you're in the paper
or waiting for somebody.

120
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,980
I found myself a discreet place.
Found a pretty nice spot here.

121
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,250
You use a stopwatch. I
Richard's a stopwatch. Stopwatch

122
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,410
trusty beef watchers
working. Ready? I'm ready.

123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,800
Doug. Welcome.

124
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,060
And it know, goes quiet for a minute.
I want to start brilliance. Brilliant.

125
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,050
Still done. This experiment was
actually harder than you would think.

126
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,970
Much harder. I love people.
This is not very easy to do.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,430
Timing was an issue. People
trying to sell you stuff.

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,990
I don't need this to show Betty goose
shine. Look in my corner. They just don't,

129
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,730
can't no pitches. Okay,
ready, boom. All together now,

130
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,180
Dodd walk, step, step, step, step, step,

131
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,400
step, step,

132
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,660
Chile. It didn't sound like that
at all. They weren't in sync.

133
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:22,550
As you can imagine, every
city had its own guard. Step,

134
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,430
step, step, step, step, step, step, step.

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,650
We knew but still change
was pretty amazing.

136
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,360
Stop toppling to Oslo.
14.4 seconds. 27 seconds.

137
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,920
You can live area. So
team 0.8 Dwayne is arrows.

138
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,360
12.13 Mexico City, 10.1
seconds. Copenhagen,

139
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,030
21.5 seconds. Yeah,

140
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,060
nine 11.57 Portland and
a half second Jerusalem.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,860
Just to break it down on the high end,
you've got steps, steps on it's step,

142
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,250
step,

143
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,500
step, step, that Dubliner steps. Okay.

144
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,590
She was 9.5 and that's 10.4 who take on
average 10.76 seconds to cover 60 feet.

145
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,200
Compare that to Buchanan. Liberia

146
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,430
step, step, step, step, step.

147
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,120
Let's get around something
that actually owned the head.

148
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,260
She got a teen pink blouse whose Walker's
covered the same distance in about 21

149
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:21,460
seconds. 21 seconds. So if you want
to think about it in football terms,

150
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,440
by the time the Dubliner has scored a
touchdown, the gripe from you, Kevin,

151
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,520
Liberia is somewhere, I
guess around midfield.

152
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,000
And the spooky thing according to Bob
Levine is if you do these under the same

153
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:36,820
conditions, same place,
you will get the same time.

154
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,640
These times don't change.

155
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,120
Dublin is always about this steps
you're on. It's steps, steps, steps,

156
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,650
and Buchanan. Liberia is
always around this. Yeah.

157
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,970
Step step.

158
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,770
Yeah. Manhattan is, we
found is right about here.

159
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,240
Usually step with thunder's step,
step, step in pink. No, Dublin,

160
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,590
but not bad. But why the
consistency? What is it?

161
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,380
What is it that makes that walking speed?

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,570
Yeah. Where does it come from? You know,
I mean, is anybody beating the drum?

163
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,790
How well can you change the walking speed?

164
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,300
Say a bunch of us got together and decided
that we were just going to up it by

165
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:14,800
5% on a given day.

166
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,550
Will we get everybody to do it and
will they even notice the difference?

167
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,750
Do we make the city

168
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,730
or just the city make us

169
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,520
thank you to our lockers.

170
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,680
[inaudible] Liberia,
Jerusalem, here are killer man.

171
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,570
And Copenhagen went to Oslo in the
Scott's, Portland, Oregon. Nacho,

172
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,140
Thailand, grand fuller game. [inaudible]
go city [inaudible] in one bay. Mark

173
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,950
from Nolan.

174
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,980
I've Dublin in Ireland perhaps also
to Daniel Estrin and an assessment.

175
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,350
Well done because they didn't,

176
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,580
they didn't say their name so
we put them in there. Okay.

177
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,690
So getting back to that
question I asked a second ago,

178
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,770
why is it that cities develop
particular beats? Yes.

179
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,910
I mean is it because the city does it
to the people or the people do it to the

180
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,810
city? Yeah, and we ran into a
couple of guys who may be released.

181
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:10,130
Have the start of an answer.
Yes. No, a couple of physicists,

182
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,870
oddly enough high named
Geoffrey West and leash.

183
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,260
This is Jeffery and there's Lewis on
the other side of the table. Cool.

184
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,450
Here at the Santa Fe Institute in New
Mexico and lots of bases and stuff.

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,650
Nothing like the cities we just visited.
It's almost biblical in its expanse.

186
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,650
Yeah.

187
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,700
But blue skies just sort of make your
brain potassium and all those good things.

188
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,740
Brave enough, in fact,

189
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:39,741
to claim from their high desert birch
that these beats the meter of every city

190
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:46,410
that we've just been to actually
has underneath it a kind of logic.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,260
If you tell me the average
speed of walking in some city x,

192
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,440
take a Rochester,

193
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:57,441
New York where people walk at about this
60 feet and 12.67 seconds different.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,540
Don't tell him Rochester, you
just tell him the number of beats.

195
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,780
I will tell you the population is
maybe one and a quarter billion people,

196
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,320
actual population,

197
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,410
1.0 3 million people and the
average weight about $16,000 a year.

198
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,410
Actual average wage, $15,588 wow.

199
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,740
But let me ask you a precise question.

200
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,560
Are you 100% correct? Are you

201
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,610
some things you will score close
to a hundred percent other things,

202
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:35,170
80% but if you start with just the
number of footfalls per unit of time,

203
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,800
they can tell you all kinds of
other things about the same place.

204
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,090
I can tell you how much crime
there is in the city. Income wages,

205
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:47,170
GDP number college's restaurants,
fancy restaurants, theaters,

206
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:51,730
police number of patents are being
produced, cultural events per capita,

207
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
number of theater that libraries,

208
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,600
the number of aids cases it's
going to have this year. Mainly.

209
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,820
All of these things are
correlated in a quantitative,

210
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,330
and I use the word
predictive fashion. Wait,

211
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,960
are you saying that just from the number
of footsteps per given time that you

212
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:11,020
can tell? Can you tell me how
many libraries there are? Yes.

213
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,990
Tell me how many hours should expect. Wow.

214
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,320
How many things can you count
when know? Infinite number,

215
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,350
but it's limited by the things
for which there are data.

216
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,760
They've got data from the u s
census, that's Jonah Lehrer.

217
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:28,000
He's written about Luis and Jeff and
he's the one who kind of got us thinking

218
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,900
about all this pain from Japan,

219
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,920
China data from sociological surveys on
cell phones and when they put all these

220
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:39,180
numbers together, they discovered a deep
pattern call comes from the footsteps,

221
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,083
not the footsteps.

222
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,580
The footsteps are a reflection of this
deep and fundamental pattern that governs

223
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:50,110
everything. Just one fact. What
is it you really want to know?

224
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,120
Yeah. What is it? Size, size,
how many people live there?

225
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,380
Size matters.

226
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,380
Size is the largest determinant
of all characteristics of a city,

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,480
right? They would say, tell
me the size of the city,

228
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:08,070
and I can explain the vast majority of
all of these different variables that we

229
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,380
can measure. Right? As a city scales up,

230
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:15,381
they say 100,000 to 200,000 the million
to 2 million from 5 million to 10

231
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,020
everything about it. All those
things that they'd been measuring,

232
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,041
they scale up too,

233
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:25,510
but they scale up according to a
very simple mathematical formula.

234
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,810
It does not matter that New York has big
skyscrapers and is on the ocean and the

235
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Boise is in the rocky mountains that
San Francisco is on San Francisco Bay.

236
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,980
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. That can't be. They can't be.

237
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,300
I was with you right up until
the last to that last point.

238
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:48,301
I mean you go to the Midwest and it's
landlocked and then you go to a port city

239
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,500
and it's on a part. I mean
that's got to matter. It matters,

240
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:56,501
but these actually are superficial effects
and account for only 10 20% of their

241
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,040
variation. What they're saying
is that those specificities, the,

242
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,000
the local history is in
large part insignificant,

243
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,240
but it is completely overwhelmed by
these generic laws of urban scaling.

244
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,590
That to me is a very interesting and
surprising idea simply because we don't

245
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,260
think of cities like that at
all. No, we certainly do not.

246
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,920
That's because you're not a physicist
and you don't think abstractly in that

247
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,310
regard. Well, why should
I? Because sometimes it can
be very useful to remember.

248
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,110
What these guys have done is they've
just created eight average profile for

249
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,250
every size city. So if you're a 1
million or 7 million or 12 million,

250
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,420
here's how many things you should
have and all you can all say, okay,

251
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,110
let's look specifically
that city and analysis.

252
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,470
Is it overperforming on the performance?

253
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,640
So what are some cities that are
overperforming for their size?

254
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,570
A of the largest cities? San
Francisco is quite an innovative city.

255
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,040
New York's about average,

256
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,610
about times of patents on terms New
York's below average produces roughly

257
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:02,010
speaking the number of patents that
should for size. You produce for example,

258
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,630
about uh, twice as many
patents as Boston. We do

259
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,830
[inaudible] you should have produced many
more given the size difference between

260
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:16,910
about counting patents. I mean who
may, who did, we don't have Ng.

261
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,100
This is one of the problems
with their larger theory,

262
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:23,120
which is that they're relying on your
data at the u s census collected.

263
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,870
So that's a real blind spot. Fabulous.
If we ever can figure out a way to count.

264
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:31,370
Fabulous a point you're not taking into
account what it actually the experience

265
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,200
of living in a place. Well, what this,

266
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,680
what a theory cannot do is tell
you about the essence of New York,

267
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,030
the new Yorkness of New York,

268
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,110
so to speak, the soul of the city.
And where does that come from?

269
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,660
I mean, I think that's such
a broad question. Well,

270
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,020
obviously it has something to do with
lots of people being jammed into a tight

271
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:58,470
space. Firemen bumping into each other,
the kind of people who move there.

272
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,200
What the physicists we
call human friction.

273
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,310
And that's a story you can't really
tell in math, but you can hear it.

274
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,893
Take skip.

275
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,400
He gave producer Aaron Scott a
tour of his block in Brooklyn,

276
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,880
listen to who he bumps into every
day. So he took us on this tour.

277
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,950
First place we went was this Jamaican
body shop. Body shop is in cars. Yeah.

278
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,970
Religion specialists. I mean
it's basically these, you know,

279
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,420
western, these Jamaican guys
listening to reggae Bhutan

280
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,640
and hip hop reggae, no one,

281
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,730
I like all kind of music like someplace
and across across the street from this

282
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,953
is kinder Spiel,

283
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,190
hidden orthodox Jewish cookie
bakery and under pointed from that,

284
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,980
it's a butcher that, um,

285
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,370
sells live goats and chickens
and here are the goats.

286
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,990
And on the corner of

287
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,880
the Spanish Pentecostal church,

288
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,700
every Sunday they give it up to God
with this exceedingly enthusiastic band.

289
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,170
And I huddle at the window

290
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,203
[inaudible]

291
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,920
and I think this is the best
music in the world, right?

292
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,350
Feel that deeply.

293
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,633
[inaudible]

294
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,230
and then across the street
from that one is a mosque.

295
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,393
No,

296
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,280
it was beautiful on the
inside, across the street.

297
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,430
There's this big building
in the proprietor of this
space is a gay foot fetish

298
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,280
film producer. Show me your
feet, show me your feet.

299
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,160
Two 82nd he's got Jamaicans,

300
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,650
Orthodox Jews are the cookies,
Hispanics, Jesus, Allah,

301
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,380
goats in gay porn. Me, your
feet all on the same block.

302
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,670
Absolutely. For me, that's the hammer,
the nails, that's the wrong gradients.

303
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,420
Now I'm gonna take that home and
I'm gonna Assemble it into a song.

304
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,120
And when you heard his music,
could you hear all that stuff?

305
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,310
Some of it is clear than others.

306
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,800
[inaudible]

307
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,420
the sounds of the neighborhood,

308
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,770
like the reg aton music of the
the West indies auto body shops.

309
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,870
He kind of takes them and then filters
it through some device that makes it

310
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,740
sound like,

311
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,111
oddly enough,

312
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:52,160
the day that Aaron spoke with skip was
the day skip decided he's leaving New

313
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,670
York City and he put in his notice,
which I guess makes his latest album,

314
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,570
sonic New York, kind of a
dear John Letter to the city.

315
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,370

317
