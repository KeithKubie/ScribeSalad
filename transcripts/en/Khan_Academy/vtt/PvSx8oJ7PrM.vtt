00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.400
I've written out two numbers
here, and they both contain 4.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.570
They each have 4
as a digit, and I

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.115
want to think about what
the values of these 4's are

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:11.529
and to actually compare them.

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.070
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.420
and try that out on your own.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.640
So let's look at
the two 4's here.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.490
So in 110,413, I have
a 4 right over here.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700
And what does that
actually represent?

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.230
Well, this is the ones place.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.010
You have three 1's.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.510
You have one 10's.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.060
And the 4 is in
the hundreds place.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.550
You have four 100's.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.930
So this 4 literally represents
4 times 100, or 400.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.330
Now, what about this 4?

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.660
Well, once again,
you have zero 1's.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.970
You have five 10's.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.720
You have three 100's.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.550
And you have four 1,000's.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.940
So this literally represents
4 times 1,000, which is 4,000.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.440
So we can now compare the two.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:22.960
The 4 in 110,413 is 1/10 the
value of the 4 in 54,350.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.790
And it makes complete sense.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.490
This 4 is one place to
the right of this 4.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.790
This 4 is in the thousands.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.690
The magenta-circled
4 is in the hundreds.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.680
So every time we move a
place value to the right,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.700
each increment
represents 1/10 as much,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.510
assuming we have the same digit.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.131
So a 4 in thousands is 4,000.

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.700
A 4 in hundreds would
be 1/10 as much.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.740
A 4 in the tens would
be 1/10 as much as that.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.140
So we could write a sentence.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.730
Let me write it this way.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:09.690
The value of the
4 in this number

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:26.014
is 1/10 the value of
the 4 in this number.

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:27.680
I know it's a little
bit weird sentence.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.790
The value of the 4 in 110,413
is 1/10 the value of the 4

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.460
in 54,350.
