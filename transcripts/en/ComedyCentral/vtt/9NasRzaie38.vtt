00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.280
♪ That's Vinny and the Colonel

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:10.043
♪ That's Vinny and the Colonel

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.277
- Sup Colonel

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.211
- Ah nothing Vinny

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:13.446
just avoiding my fucking mother.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.680
- Why's that?

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.015
- Make sure you go front to back

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.250
I have a date tonight.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.018
- Ugh I hate that
 you don't have arms.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.154
- (burps loudly) you got a
  weird fucking family dude.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.155
(glass shattering)

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.723
- Awe come on man don't litter,

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.191
Gary the Gardener hates that.

00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.259
(pinging)

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.693
- What the heck is this?

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:28.527
- What you got there Colonel?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.430
- I don't know, I
 think it's a thumb.

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.764
- Well is it yours?

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:32.732
- No.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.434
- Then put it back, it's
none of our business.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.803
- Dude we found a thumb
we should call the cops.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.404
- Absolutely not Colonel.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.906
- Why not?

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.808
- Colonel when I was nine
  someone stole my bike

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.509
and you know what I did?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.443
- [Colonel] What'd ya do Vinny?

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.811
- [Vinny] I called the cops

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.778
and you know what happened?

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:46.746
- You got your bike back?

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:47.747
- Nope they arrested my dad

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.183
turns out he'd actually
traded my bike for crack

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.218
but the point is we're
 not calling the cops.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.453
- Well then what should we do?

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.188
- We're gonna take
  matters into our own hands

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.057
a little something I like
  to call street justice.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.158
- Alright okay okay

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.394
how do we do the street justice?

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.562
- Let's go see the one person

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:05.031
that knows everything that
 happens in the neighborhood.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:06.732
- [Together] Cat lady Carol

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.900
(hip hop beat)

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.901
- And that's how I learned

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.403
to soft boil an egg in my pussy.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.571
- Uh that's great,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.239
cat lady Carol but we're here
 about the thumb, remember?

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.941
- Awe yes, yes of course

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:17.810
well I have been hearing
unsettling noises

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:19.912
coming from Dave's place
every Friday night.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:20.847
(pinging)

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.081
- Today is Friday.

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:24.884
- And that means tonight
will be Friday night.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.186
- Looks like we need to
check out Dave's place

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.121
(hip hop beat)

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.122
- Alright, that's Dave's place

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.289
let's check it out.

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.991
- This whole street
 justice thing

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.226
seems like a lot of work Vinny

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.128
plus this just feels dangerous.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.129
- What feels dangerous?

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.330
(suspenseful music)

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.831
- Oh nothing Dave,
 didn't see you there.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.833
- What are you guys
  going outside of my place

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.967
it's Friday,

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.936
I don't like people hanging
 outside my place on Friday.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:44.837
- Why's that Dave?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.772
What goes on on Fridays?

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.307
- Nothing you'd be
 interested in seeing,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.542
especially you Colonel.

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:50.476
- What, wait why me?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.513
- It's a matter of your
own flesh and blood.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.314
- What the fuck was that man,

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.983
did Dave just threaten
 my flesh and blood?

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.551
- I don't know but Dave's
  acting guilty as shit

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.785
and look.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:00.486
(suspenseful tone)

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.888
- Is that blood?

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:02.889
Oh my god, shit.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.123
Well that proves it Vinny,

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:06.125
Dave's a killer what
 are we gonna do?

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.860
- We gotta catch Dave in the act

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.162
we gotta go in there.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.496
- Oh fuck that dude,

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:11.597
I'm not going in
there, Dave's a killer.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.400
- Fine I'll go in, you stay
 out here an keep lookout

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.003
if anything shady goes
  down, give me the signal.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.038
- Alright well what's
 the signal Vinny Is it

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.175
(speaking gibberish)

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.848
- No, just call my phone.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:29.982
(hip hop music)

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.250
- Alright Dave,

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.888
where do you keep your
 dirty little secrets?

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.024
- Oh no oh no Vinny Vinny

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:40.560
(speaking gibberish)

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:41.594
(keys in lock rattling)

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:42.828
- Shit

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.564
- How did he not get the signal?

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.867
Oh that's right oh
  yeah I'm an idiot.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.101
(numbers beeping)

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.870
- I have mozzarella
 sticks for after,

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.405
but I accidentally dropped

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.839
the marinara sauce
  outside earlier.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.408
- That explains the stain.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.877
- So do you guys wanna kick
 it up a notch this week

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.546
(drill whirling)

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.015
- And that explains the noises.

00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:04.850
- A drill-do Dave really?

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.220
- Yeah I thought we were
gonna have weird sex

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.521
drill-dos aren't weird.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.223
- Alright, what did
 you all have in mind?

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.457
- I'm up for anything,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.858
as long as one of
  you calls my dad

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.360
on speaker in the middle of it

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.362
the only way I can
  cum is if I'm sure

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.064
I'm disappointing my father.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.500
- Oh I know that makes you
  gush like an unkinked hose

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:22.535
- What the fuck?

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:23.436
- Well alright then,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.471
let the Friday night
 fuck-fest commence.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:28.908
(animals growling)

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.444
- Awe shit don't worry
  Vinny help is on the way.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.278
(police siren)

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.446
- Hey you

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.647
- Oh thank god
 you're here officer

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.616
- What are you doing
staking out Dave's place

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.251
- There's something
 going on inside.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.519
- Yeah its Friday I
 was here last week.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:41.354
- You mean,

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.188
(pinging)

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.122
you're involved?

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.523
- Naw I wouldn't say involved,

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.659
it was more like a no strings
 attached type of deal.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.494
(phone ringing)

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:49.328
- [Man On Phone] Hello?

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.462
- Hi Dad

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.266
- [Man On Phone] God dammit
 is it Friday again already?

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.236
- Vinny was right the cops
can't be trusted, you're dirty.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.139
- Hey its 2017, sex is a canvas

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.541
that each person can
paint however they want

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:05.144
and there's nothing
 dirty about that,

00:04:05.177 --> 00:04:08.581
non consensual voyeurism
  however is another story.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:09.615
- What?

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.917
- Now put your hands
  behind your back scum bag.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.519
- Dave do you have any quilts

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:15.688
I don't think a towel
 is gonna soak this up.

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:17.023
- Yeah just check in the closet.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.192
- Ha ho man is
 this not my closet?

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:21.627
I thought this was my closet

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.030
my mistake guys
 I'll just be going.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.931
- Vinny? What the hell
 are you doing here?

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:26.966
- I, uh

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.034
- I invited him

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:28.934
- Mrs. Peppersnacks?

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:30.436
- Sorry I'm late guys,

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.039
just go along with it Vinny
 I'll get you out of this.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.641
I told Vinny he should
  come and surprise you all,

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.543
I figured it would be a
  nice treat for the group.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:40.079
- Well I think we all
agree that's really hot.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:42.481
- Well your timing
couldn't be more perfect

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:43.715
this is usually
 when we take a break

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.719
and watch two people have slow
 intimate sex with one another

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:49.455
- That won't be a
problem, will it Vinny?

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.556
- Why are you doing this?

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.158
- Just let this happen

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.694
(Jazz Melody)

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:57.963
- Hey man where have you been?

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:59.231
- I was in jail man,

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.067
you were right about
 the cops by the way

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.601
I'm all for street justice.

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.604
- No I, I'm done
 with street justice

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.707
I was, I was fucking wrong man.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.642
- Oh well if cops aren't good

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:11.477
and street justice isn't good

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.678
what did we learn?

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:14.447
- Ugh I don't know man,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.049
I guess stay away
 from Dave's on Fridays

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.585
and maybe don't kiss
 your mom for a while.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:20.453
- What?

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.021
- Hey yous guys

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.322
- Hey it's Gary the gardener

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:25.024
what's up Gary the gardener?

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:27.993
- Have you seen my thumb I
 cut my thumb with the shears

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:29.228
and now I can a
  no pick the weeds.

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.596
- Hey we found a thumb.

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.031
- Yeah it's up my ass.

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:33.666
- Dude why's it up your ass?

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.267
- I hid it from the cops

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.535
when they were processing me

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:38.104
I didn't want them
 to find the evidence.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.372
- Evidence of what?

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.173
- You know for the
  street justice.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.742
- You really don't
  understand street justice.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.543
- My thumb is up your butt?

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:46.178
- Yeah and I fucking love it

00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.012
- Like mother like son.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.047
- What?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.715
- Nothing.
