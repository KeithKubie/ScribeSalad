Are you bored and unmotivated
at your current job,

or unsure about what
you want to do in life?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.980
As we get older,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.520
people always ask us
the most dreaded question:

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.420
"What do you do for a living?"

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.580
We could either subtle
and work a safe job

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.980
that helps pay the bills,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.980
or we could be working actively
to achieve our dreams.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.080
Whichever path you decide to take,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.940
know that reality is rarely ever
that black and white.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.540
