00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.770
Crystal Williams “Double Helix”

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.306
After Jacob Lawrence’s
“The Migration Series”

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.976
and Isabel Wilkerson’s
“The Warmth of Other Suns”

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.811
One

00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:17.650
At night, my father played piano &amp; sang,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.020
his voice our raft on a quiet lake,

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.323
an island of gentleness

00:00:23.598 --> 00:00:25.848
&amp; because gentleness is a choice,

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.693
I know something—,

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.765
I have told you something
essential about my father

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.968
&amp; the history
of black people in America.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.436
&amp; because he looked at my mother &amp; me

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.841
as if we were divine,
brilliant, bright children of God

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.611
&amp; because if gesture &amp; spirit have weight,

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.915
my father’s equaled
two thousand blooming peonies,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.218
I have told you something about faith

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.790
&amp; the history
of black people in America.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.661
Scientists are full of news these days:

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:05.198
We are rotting fruit lain to ground.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:09.035
In each breath we inhale
thousands of humans

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:11.403
collected on the tongues of leaves,

00:01:11.536 --> 00:01:16.041
in the pink eyes of peonies,
on the powdery backs of pollen.

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:17.985
Exhaled.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.248
With each draw,
a millennia of history enters us

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:24.381
&amp; we cannot control,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.955
can only harness whom or what we host.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.725
Our traumas, the bright blue mysticisms

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.826
&amp; burnt orange murmurs,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.896
our joys &amp; muddled currencies

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.566
are archived in genetic code.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:46.805
I am not of my father’s blood

00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:49.553
but am of my father,

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:54.280
which is also the history
of black people in America.

00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:57.816
At my 6th birthday party,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.256
the parents drank martinis &amp; sangria

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.855
in white linen &amp; silk

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.955
as we played on the Slip-n-Slide

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.291
while the desolate beast next door

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.128
snarled &amp; snapped through the fence,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.631
our jubilation magnifying his rage.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:16.268
He leapt &amp; whipped
into an ever-reddening frenzy

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.171
&amp; because pain will out,

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.405
&amp; because hatred will out,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.045
&amp; because my father
sensed a shift in the air

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:28.615
because he deeply believed
my mother &amp; me divine

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.816
&amp; the faithful have second sight,

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:33.520
&amp; because some Alabama-born malice

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.856
had taught him a lesson
to do with mercilessness,

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.458
the way danger wets the wind,

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.860
my father tore into the house

00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:44.765
emerging with a finger
on a gun’s trigger.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.966
He stood sentinel the rest of the day,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.136
gun slack on his thigh,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.173
squinting at the feverishness
at the fence—

00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.743
as we leapt &amp; shrieked &amp; ate cake.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.748
This is what I was trying
to explain to Avi

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.516
when I sent him that book

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.686
about black migration
from the American south.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:11.891
I was trying to say:
we have cause to care for

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.726
&amp; track our wounds.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.131
To be anything
other than enraged or dead

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.801
is to be a success if black in America.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:25.171
To become a refuge, a safe harbor

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:29.308
is to be a miracle if black in America.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.346
His ailing father listened quietly

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480
as Avi read aloud passages

00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:37.816
about the vicious hand of the south

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:42.353
&amp; burnings &amp; bodies &amp; swinging,
cold chicken &amp; packed trains,

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.346
escapees casting
towards a northern brink

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480
they could not fully understand,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.396
away from an ending they did.

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:52.665
&amp; because hatred will out

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:56.870
&amp; because we cannot control
whom or what we host.

00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.006
&amp; because his father
is a Holocaust survivor,

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:03.306
in a moment of lucidity, he said sadly:

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:08.581
“Son, why do you insist
on reading me my story?”

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.185
So we, the Jewish son

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:17.390
the African daughter, mouths bursting
&amp; soured with flowers &amp; fauna,

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.656
rotting leaves &amp; peonies

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.595
&amp; men banging on the midnight door,

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.165
stood as an ecosystem

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.866
of gas &amp; fire,

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.845
double helixes &amp; light,

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.106
the story of, the choices of,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.610
our fathers knotted between us.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.381
&amp; because I wanted
to touch his face as my own,

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.716
&amp; because I felt his skin shudder

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.051
as my own,

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:49.723
understood his father’s stubble
as my own

00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:53.060
&amp; because what are we
if not our brothers?

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:57.430
&amp; because there has always been
binding &amp; burning &amp; escaping

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:00.166
&amp; enduring &amp; because
I know no better way

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.268
to understand the history
of human beings

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:06.840
than to tell you the story
of my father’s choice

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.241
to be a raft on a lake,

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:13.246
which, no matter what more
you might be told,

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.550
is the true story of black thought,

00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:21.655
black life, black people in America.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.090
Two

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.095
At night, my father sang,

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:32.298
his voice our raft on a quiet lake,

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.465
an island of gentleness

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.768
&amp; because gentleness is a choice,

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.805
&amp; because in each breath
we inhale thousands of humans

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:41.938
on the powdery backs of pollen,

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.543
I have told you something essential

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.415
&amp; because he looked at
my mother &amp; me as if we were divine

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:51.016
&amp; because we were really
only rotting fruit

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.585
lain to ground

00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.855
&amp; because if gesture
&amp; spirit have weight,

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:59.491
my father’s equaled
two thousand blooming peonies,

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:01.878
At my 6th birthday party,

00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:05.475
the beast next door
snarled &amp; snapped through the fence.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.651
&amp; because our mysticisms &amp; currencies

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:09.568
are archived genetic code

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.773
&amp; because pain will out,
&amp; because hatred outs

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:16.776
&amp; because some Alabama-born
malice had taught him

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.278
mercilessness,

00:06:18.413 --> 00:06:20.680
my father emerged from the house

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.748
a gun’s trigger

00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:27.286
and the rest of the day stood
as if a refuge, a harbor,

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.655
the feverishness at the fence

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.625
staring at it as we leapt &amp; shrieked

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.895
&amp; then Avi read passages from the book

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.398
&amp; because we cannot control
whom or what we host,

00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.401
&amp; because Avi’s father
is a Holocaust survivor,

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:45.171
he asked: “Son, why?”

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:49.208
&amp; because we stood
as an ecosystem of double helixes,

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:52.845
Alabama &amp; Holocaust knotted between us

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:56.081
&amp; because I wanted
to touch his face as my own,

00:06:56.215 --> 00:07:00.686
as if we were divine,
brilliant, bright children of God

00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:03.690
&amp; because I felt his skin
shudder as my own,

00:07:03.825 --> 00:07:07.460
as if we were divine,
brilliant, bright children of God,

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:10.863
understood his father’s stubble
as my own

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.566
&amp; because what are we?

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:18.971
&amp; because there has always been
binding &amp; escaping &amp; enduring

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:22.141
&amp; because I am not of my father’s blood

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.778
but am of Avi’s father,

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:27.645
I know no better way to explain

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.780
the history of humans

00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:34.688
than to tell you
my father played piano at night

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.088
&amp; sang,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.693
his voice our raft on a quiet lake,

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.858
an island of gentleness

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.165
&amp; gentleness is a choice,

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:48.168
is a miracle in America.
