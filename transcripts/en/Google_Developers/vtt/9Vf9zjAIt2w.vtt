DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.010
Welcome to the Root
Access show on

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.460
Google Developers Live.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm Don Dodge, your
host for today.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.450
The Root Access show is a show
for startups where we discuss

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.090
issues and problems that are
typical to any company that's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.960
trying to grow and become
a big business.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.710
Today we're going to talk about
how to get the attention

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.780
of influential bloggers
and tech press.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.900
And my guest today is Louis
Grey, one of the first

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
bloggers that I ever knew.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.860
LOUIS GRAY: Thanks for
having me on, Don.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.100
It's good to see you
here at Google.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.800
DON DODGE: Well, thank you.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.830
So Louis, I discovered
you back in 2006.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.300
You were one of the first
bloggers that I ever read.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.950
So tell us, how did you get
started and what kinds of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.090
things did you write about?

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.920
LOUIS GRAY: I appreciate that.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.410
I started writing--

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.250
I could have picked the name a
little better, but I started

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.350
writing at LouisGray.com.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.880
Back in 2006, it was just
a fun outlet for me.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.230
I was working at a network
storage company on the

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.870
enterprise space, but I really
had a lot of passion for web

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.360
2.0 and what was happening with
internet and social, and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.860
some of these tech companies
like Google

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.510
and Apple and LinkedIn.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.670
And so what I found was a
could kind of play that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570
enterprise role during the day,
and come home and write

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.280
about consumer software.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.250
And it was really exciting to
see that the opinions I had

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.570
had some kind of resonance with

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.710
those who hit the stories.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.410
I found that when I would write
about LinkedIn, I would

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.890
have a very good hit rate of
people coming in and saying,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.040
you know what, that
feature that you

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.760
wanted, we've added that.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.120
Or I wrote an article called
"10 Suggestions for Google

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.600
Reader," way back in 2007, and
the next day, one of the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.590
software engineers at Google
said, those are some great

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.160
suggestions.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.800
We came to the same conclusions
you did in our

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.140
team offsite.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.530
And so I started to
really feel like I

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.910
could have an impact.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.790
And then I branched off from
talking about companies that

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.600
had already been around and
well known to finding new

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.080
companies that no one had
ever heard about.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.630
And finding that role of being
the first user, or one of the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.590
first 10 users, and trying
to foresee what

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.590
would happen with that.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.720
I know often with your
background, you talk about VC

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.580
investing and angel investing,
but as a blogger, what I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.930
wasn't doing was putting
money into a company.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.990
I was putting my time and
my effort and my energy.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.070
And I felt like a
VC with no cash.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.660
And so you could see
I would pick my

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.060
winners and pick my favorites.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.020
And 3,000 posts later, we had
a lot of people paying

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.900
attention to what was happening,
got a lot of great

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.750
companies to start with me, and
take some of the feedback

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.370
that I was giving them
to enhance their

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.860
products and get better.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.650
DON DODGE: So you were one of
the first bloggers, you and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.710
Mike Arrington and Jason
Calacanis and Fred Wilson.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.640
There are maybe a dozen or so
bloggers who became very well

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.920
known and were early
in the space.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.680
What kinds of things
interest you now?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.480
You've been doing this for
six or seven years.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.760
What kinds of stories capture
your attention and do you like

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.900
to write about?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.610
LOUIS GRAY: Well, when you
mentioned those names, I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.740
almost feel like I could sneak
into the room and be the guy

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.930
in the background who
no one talks to.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.900
Those are some pretty good names
you threw out there.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.330
One of the things that I really
took to heart when I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.820
first started looking at
blogging was finding a way for

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.580
people to communicate more
quickly, to consume more

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520
information more rapidly.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.930
And not just more information,
but the right information at

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.180
the right time.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.720
I think, obviously,
Google is a great

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.310
place to see that happening.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.600
That was one of things
that got me excited

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.920
about coming here.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.650
You look at big trends and the
way that people are going to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.460
have the right information at
the right time on their mobile

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.970
phones or any other devices.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.340
You look at Project Glass and
the things that are happening

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.150
there in terms of having
that available.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.370
I really like the movement
to the cloud.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.550
I've come to this point with
Chrome OS, and I know it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.460
sounds like a Google fan boy,
but I really believe in what

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.290
they're doing.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.820
I really look at the cloud
operation of it, and being

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.100
able to get to any computer
to get to my data

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.650
at any time of day.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.910
It really doesn't matter which
device I have, just that I can

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.560
log in and get my content.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.050
And that makes sense to me.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.260
I think when you look from a
startup perspective, there are

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.540
a lot of people who are finding
it easier for people

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.680
to share no matter what type
of interests they have.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.045
One of the things that you and
I both kind of grew up with

00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:21.760
with the web is that you found
a kind of siloing around a

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.700
specific interest for a site.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.610
So if you like motorcycles, you
went to a motorcycle site.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.370
If you were into fly fishing,
you went to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.730
a fly fishing site.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.640
And what's happened is these
more broad networks, be they

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.610
Pinterest, or Google+ with
Communities, and Facebook

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.380
groups, they're having a
horizontal foundation for any

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.780
kind of a community to
prosper and flourish.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.940
And for commerce to take place
there, and for people to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.520
communicate globally.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.750
So that still gets me excited.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.570
I think you look at the types
of ways that people can

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.160
communicate instantly about
everything, where you can be

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.420
in a shared conversation, be
it through hash tags or

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.840
anything else, with anyone
around the world to find

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.590
common interests.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.560
It's really incredible.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.160
DON DODGE: So if I'm to startup
founder and I want you

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.870
to write about my company,
how do you suggest

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.830
that I approach you?

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.510
What kinds of things
should I say?

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.510
What preparation
should I have.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.310
LOUIS GRAY: As previously
mentioned, if I'm playing that

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.100
role of the seed capital guy
with no money, I want to be

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.590
part of that team that helps
get the story right.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.250
I want to make sure that when
I'm committing my time to

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.260
write a post--

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.650
and usually I write too long.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.160
So if I'm writing a lot of
content, I want to make sure

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.640
that I've picked a company
that I can stand behind.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.020
I think a lot of times when you
look at tech blogging, you

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.220
can get a view of having
negative opinion.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.720
Now, that guy, he always rips
on companies I made a

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.050
conscious decision back in
2007 to not be that guy.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.710
And if I was going to write
about something, that it was

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.420
going to be worth my time and
worth my readers' time, I

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.000
found that writing negatively
against the company wasted my

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.570
time, wasted the readers'
time, and wasted the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.990
entrepreneurs' time.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.120
And so, obviously, if I didn't
write about you, that might be

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.440
a soft signal I wasn't
a big fan.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.420
So what I want to do is be a
partner to the person who's

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.310
writing it.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.150
The way that I get to
find out about them

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.570
is a number of ways.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.480
I'm a geek, and so I like
to look at logs.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.690
I used to look at my referral
logs all the time to see who

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.360
was coming in to my website.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.160
And that was the way I found a
number of companies back in

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.600
2006 to 2008.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.900
With launches like small
companies like FeedBurner and

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.300
Link River and [? Tollou ?].

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.860
I looked at FriendFeed very
early on and saw what those

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.480
guys were doing.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.830
Was very excited about the
potential for that site, that

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.870
eventually got acquired
by Facebook.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.930
And you look at finding out this
new company that might or

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.520
might not even have launched
yet, being one of the first 5

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.870
to 10 users, and say, what can
I do to take you guys to the

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.800
next level?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.760
You might know Edwin
Khodabakchian, who came out of

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.470
Netscape and wrote the
application Feedly.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.870
I found out about Feedly from
someone in his network who I'd

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.260
written about before.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.710
And so you kind of get that
reputation were, hey, this guy

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.170
knows what he's talking about.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.370
So they referred me to Edwin,
and his product Feedly was in

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.300
incubation maybe five or six
months, where I sat on the

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.680
story, and didn't write
about it, and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.320
kept providing feedback.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.330
Almost like informal QA.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.750
And by the time he was ready to
launch, I think my post was

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.420
like 3,000 words.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.300
And so what I'm trying to say
is a small email that's even

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.000
personalized to me isn't
going to cut it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.600
It's going to be something
where it's a long term

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.540
relationship where they're
investing a piece of effort

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.250
with you, and you're willing
to give that back.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.800
Not only am I going to be an
evangelist for your company,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.220
not only am I going to want to
tell people why your product

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.730
is better, but I'll
be a user, too.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.570
If I look at this product, and
I say, yeah, I get it, it's

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.310
interesting, but I'm
not a user, I know

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.860
it's a throwaway post.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.910
And so, obviously, you flash
forward a few years,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.310
here I am at Google.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.930
The ability for companies to
pitch me and for me to blog

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.440
about it doesn't always make
sense anymore, simply because

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.490
people perceiving that as
being Google's words, or

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.190
people interpreting
Google as either a

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.720
competitor or a partner.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.140
And so I kind of
played it safe.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.640
I held back on a lot
of those things.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.580
But you can see from those
applications which I use, and

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.820
those people who I engage with
what it is I'm still a fan of

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.390
and really excited about.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.170
DON DODGE: So as a startup
founder, should I send emails

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.360
to every blogger, make
a list and send it to

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.640
every blogger I know?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.840
Or should I try to focus on
the ones who maybe have

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.670
written about companies
in my space before?

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.130
What's the strategy?

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.500
LOUIS GRAY: One of the buzz
words we used to hear a lot

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.920
about was microtargeting.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.360
And you look at some-- whether
it's your sales force, CRM

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.740
service, or what have you, but
the ability to find the right

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.060
message to the right
person is critical.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.880
You can easily know if I get a
message that's off topic that

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.000
comes into my inbox, I don't
want to be either a follower

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.809
of a post that happened two days
ago on a well known site,

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.700
which I know I saw and you
didn't trick me when

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.850
you sent it to me.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.240
And I certainly don't
want to be the 10th

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.800
person in a BCC line.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.540
Like, dear tech press.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.680
When you see that, you just know
like, hey, that's going

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.760
to go on somewhere else.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.880
And maybe tomorrow someone
else will write it.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.600
But it's critical to find out,
in your industry, who's

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.770
passionate about what it is
that you know you do well.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.230
And then you personalize
that note.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.740
You say, hey, I really see that
you like aggregation.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.500
Let's talk about that.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.650
I really see that you're a big
fan of electric vehicles.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.530
Whatever that is that's
your niche.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.580
And say, I want to give you
access to my product before

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.110
anybody else.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.000
I want to give you a unique code
that you can offer your

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.315
readers, so that if I have 500
invites, I can see how fast

00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:23.180
they get given away.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.300
It's really exciting to be part
of that ability to get

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.900
people to get their word out.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.410
I remember specifically there
was a story about a company

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.680
called Lazy Feed.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.140
And Lazy Feed was a fun way to
find your interests and follow

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.040
those along from RSS feeds that
you didn't even follow.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.450
But the entrepreneur gave me 500
invite codes, which I put

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.440
up in a Google spreadsheet, put
the link out on Twitter

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.170
and FriendFeed, and just watched
them get used up.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.340
And within a day, all the
invites were gone.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.170
And so for me that looked like
a spot where the guy knew,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.650
even if I wasn't the big name
like all those gentlemen that

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.970
you mentioned, be they Jason
or Fred or Michael--

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.110
I even have to use their
first names with you--

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.480
he knew that I could
make the impact.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.470
Because I was so focused on that
industry, and so spot on

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.060
with the information consumption
world, and being

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.180
able to distribute that
and have an impact.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.410
DON DODGE: As a startup, should
I be a blogger myself?

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.300
Should I try to get the
story out that way?

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:16.420
Is it helpful?

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.240
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.000
There's no question
in my mind.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.330
I even say this for anyone.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.480
When it comes to even hiring
an employee, I'll ask

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.220
somebody, do you have a blog?

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.980
And when they say no,
you go, uh-oh.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.470
Why not?

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.420
Why are you not so excited about
your industry that you

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.520
can't write about
it every day?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.860
What is it that shows to me
that you don't have the

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.310
intellectual curiosity to take
a stand and make an effort?

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.620
So what happens with a company,
be it their blog, or

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.240
their Facebook, G+ stream, their
Pinterest page these

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.160
days, whatever it is that gives
them an outlet to shape

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.020
their own story, to interact
with people.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.770
You look recently at Elon Musk
having a direct interaction

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.920
with a New York Times reporter
who came out with a report of

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.300
his car that he didn't
particularly like and didn't

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.480
think was accurate.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.140
If he didn't have a blog, and
didn't have a mouthpiece to be

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.120
able to respond and have a
kind of interchange with

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.230
people, starting it that day
would not have worked.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.190
And I've seen companies do that,
where they have some

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.910
kind of PR crisis, and then
that day they open their

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.750
Twitter account.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.250
It's too late.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.040
The day to start that is the
day that you're ready to be

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.430
public and have people be
aware of your ideas.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.410
And I think that goes for
anybody who wants to make an

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.730
impact, be you a new startup
or someone who has views on

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.615
the industry.

00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:36.240
A blog is an incredible
tool for that.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.490
DON DODGE: How about public
relations firms?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.670
There are PR agencies out there
who say that they will

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.120
get my startup story in front
of influential bloggers or

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.380
tech press.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.040
Does that work?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.140
Is that a good investment
for a startup to spend

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.450
money on a PR agency?

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.280
LOUIS GRAY: Well, I've got about
15 years in the valley

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.750
at this point.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.090
I've hired PR firms, I've played
the role of PR for

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.300
different companies.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.710
And so I can see a place where
if you lack the marketing and

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.680
public relations and
communications background

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.870
within your startup, you don't
have that ability to shape a

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.410
story, and to know where those
targets are, you absolutely

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.310
need someone who can
play that role.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.840
Whether they're the founder who
can do that, or the VP of

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.650
marketing can do that, or even
if you need an outside agency.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.270
Obviously, it would be very
simple to say, no, I don't

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.740
want to hear from the
PR firm, I'd rather

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.170
hear from the founder.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.190
But to be honest, I'd rather
have the founder writing code.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.430
And so while I like having
that one to one direct

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.390
conversation with the
startup founder,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.030
that's not always possible.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.900
And so you can have, going
back to what we mentioned

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.000
before in terms of a targeted
approach, you can have a good

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.750
relationship with a PR firm or
a PR individual if they,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.580
again, abide by the same rules,
which is hey, we know

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.580
you're really interested
in wireless speakers.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.280
And so we're going to keep you
updated about Sonos, right?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.550
Or we know that you're really
somebody who gets next

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.410
generation communication
platforms.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.513
I'm the person representing
TweetDeck, and I want to talk

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.020
to you about how that works.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.730
And so that's OK.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.700
It's kind of like
the B+ approach.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.530
You still need to do that, but
most the time, if I only have

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.970
a seed round of funding, I'm not
going to burn that money

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.120
on a PR firm.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.830
I'm going to find a way to have
a personal relationship

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.505
with the handful of bloggers
or social media influencers

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:20.310
who can have a real impact.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.410
DON DODGE: So you made
an excellent point.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.400
PR agencies are not only about
making introductions to

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.100
bloggers and tech press, they're
about helping you

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.510
shape the story, and tell the
story in an interesting way.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.970
So a lot of startup people
probably aren't

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.060
that good at that.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.000
Are there PR agencies that are
particularly good, or do you

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.050
look for agencies that have
experience in your domain, or

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.170
how would you select
a PR agency?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.330
LOUIS GRAY: That's
a great question.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.520
As I mentioned before, having
come from that enterprise

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.450
technology space, there's a
certain group that know

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.060
networking especially well.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.270
And so they'll have a great
relationship with publications

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.965
like "Computerworld" and
"InformationWeek" and

00:14:01.965 --> 00:14:04.880
"InfoWorld," and the online
equivalents, like "Search

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.550
Storage" or "Byte and Switch."

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.170
If you look over at a consumer
level, you'll have people

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.560
answering in a different way.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.240
I have a great relationship
with "TechCrunch" or

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.170
"Mashable" or "Engadget,"
or what have you.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.540
And you want to find out those
types of relationships.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.980
You want to have a proven track
record of having seen

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.120
them work with startups
like you.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.205
Not necessarily your
competitors, but startups who

00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:27.640
are at the same stage
that you are.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.600
People who have dealt with the
seed round, the A rounds, the

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.030
B rounds, et cetera.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.050
Those who have looked at
lifestyle startups or

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.010
startups for women.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.090
Whatever that is that you
believe is your niche.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.510
Have they gotten experience
in that way?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.120
Have they got a proven track
record of delivering positive,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.970
consumer and customer friendly
press in the place?

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.730
And so if you can do that, and
you can see that they do it,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.490
go ahead and pull those.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.370
It just takes them being
able to pitch you well.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.350
And if they can't pitch you
well, how the heck are they

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.510
going to pitch Mike Arrington?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.990
DON DODGE: So say a little bit
about how you should use

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.850
Twitter or Google+ or
blogs or video?

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.560
How does that mix work, and how
do you use each of them

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.380
differently?

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.270
LOUIS GRAY: As a human.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.340
That's my first answer.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.410
And the reason I say that is
because you can be wordsmithed

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.220
to death, to the point where
content that goes out on your

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.640
blog, or your Twitter account,
or your Facebook just doesn't

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.280
sound right.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.270
It doesn't sound like
a human said it.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.420
When you look at somebody like
Elon Musk, when he's tweeting,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.040
you know he's the guy writing
it because it's

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.490
got a lot of energy.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.510
When you want to do that, you
want to make each one of these

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.460
channels a representative
of you and the company.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.830
You have to put some
thought into it.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.510
You have to have a mental
filter of what

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.000
shouldn't be there.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.210
But it has to reflect
your company well.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.170
There's a big difference
between having a social

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.360
channel that reflects the
company and it being a

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.130
marketing wind tunnel.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:57.780
Right?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.120
And there's room for that.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.190
I think that if you look at a
output stream from a company,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.740
it's OK if like 20%
to 40% of it is

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.890
marketing or sales related.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.040
But the rest of it should be
engaging with the industry.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.040
And you can see there's humans
behind it who are thinking

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.360
about the industry, engaging
with reporters, engaging with

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.990
competition if it makes sense,
talking directly to customers,

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.760
using a support forum.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.670
There's so many things.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.810
I mean, it's funny you ask this
question, because I bet

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.270
in 5 and 10 years, we shouldn't

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.480
be asking this question.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.090
It's just going to be
so commonplace.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.450
It's like back in 2006, 2007,
you would have entire

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.590
conventions around being
a blogger, or

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.150
being a Twitter user.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.070
And that's so foreign
now, thank goodness.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.630
Because that becomes part of
the background, and part of

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.610
what everyone expects you to
do as an individual who has

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.000
employment, or has
a startup idea.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.460
That if you are on the web and
you have a presence, you

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.550
should have a social presence
in each of these places.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.390
DON DODGE: So to summarize then,
the things I should do

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.380
as a startup founder--

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.900
be a blogger, use Twitter,
use Google+.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.589
And I think you mentioned having
a PR agency to help you

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.180
shape the story if you haven't
already done it yourself.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.520
LOUIS GRAY: But obviously, your
startup should have a

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.680
story to begin with, or else
you're in trouble.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.940
Nobody's going to give you--

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.619
very few people are going
to give you a seed

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.339
round with no ideas.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.770
So if you have an idea, you have
to take it to the next

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.710
level of it being a story.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.990
Where does your story fit?

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.490
At what level is your product?

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.920
Is it ready to go out now?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.540
Is this something that you're
ready to launch in three

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.580
months, or in six months?

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.190
Is there a reason that
you're here?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.250
Why is it that you're better?

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.670
Why is it that I'm going to
switch my time using one

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.690
application to yours?

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.800
Because what you haven't yet
invented is the ability for

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.490
more hours in the day.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.170
Or everyone wishes we
had teleportation.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.540
You could reduce traffic and
all these great things.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.370
But because you have a limited
set of amount of time, and a

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.180
limited amount of time for
people to consume information

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.820
and use this, you need
to find that story.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.180
If you don't think you can
communicate that story, find

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.840
someone who can help you.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.950
And that could be your spouse,
it could be you PR firm, it

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.810
could be your VP of marketing.

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.860
Someone who can really make that
difference to get that

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.280
story across.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.560
One of the greatest things I
can say as someone who has

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.280
broken the story on those
companies like TweetDeck, as I

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.260
mentioned, is I had a one to one
relationship with somebody

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.870
like Iain Dodsworth.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.360
Iain was the founder
of TweetDeck.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.900
And what he would do is
when he would have

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.050
an iterative update--

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.770
if he's going from
1.2 to 1.3--

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.570
he would email the day before
and say, hey, Louis, I've got

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.820
this update at TweetDeck
coming.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.810
These are the features
it's going to have.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.480
You can go ahead and write the
post today, and everyone else

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.340
can cover it tomorrow.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.410
Now, that was fun.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.710
I would have an exclusive
story for a little bit.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.600
I would have the extra time to
really get the story right.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.870
And one thing--

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.670
and not to derail your
conversation, but one thing

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.020
that I got to have as an
independent blogger for a long

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.120
time, was to have the face to
face relationships at big

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.790
companies like Google.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.090
And once you've established some
level of credibility with

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.030
one team, they'll introduce
you to others.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.440
And a lot of the success I had
with breaking news stories and

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.290
getting relationships
came through

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.910
people at larger firms.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.610
And so I would first meet with
the blogger team at Google,

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.140
and then I'd go across campus
and meet with the Google

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.420
Reader team, and then talk
with the FeedBurner team.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.340
And they'd have friends who
had recently left, and I'd

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.690
talk to the Zooglers.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.710
And that's where
it all starts.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.720
Once you've cultivated a good
relationship where they can

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.040
rely on you for interesting
insight, and the ability to

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.500
write well and get them to the
next level on their product,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.820
you've really made something.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.830
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.460
Well, Louis, thank
you very much for

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.740
joining us on Root Access.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.990
And watch the Google Developers
Live schedule for

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.310
the next instance
of Root Access.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.140
Until next time, thank
you very much.
