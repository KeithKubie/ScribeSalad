00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's do a final quiz here using again distance from triviality

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so that you have a chance to understand this concept a bit better.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's consider 3-SAT this time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You already know that 3-SAT is NP-complete,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and you 2-SAT is contained in P,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so 2-SAT is polynomial time solvable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's consider 2 Boolean formulas here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the first one here, x1 or not x2 or not x3

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and x1 or not x5 or x6

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and x2 or x5 or x7

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and x3 or not x6 or not x7.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now it's not really difficult to see if either of these 2 formulas

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
has a satisfying assignment or not,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and that's not really the point.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What I would like you to think about is the following:

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Considering x1, x2, and x3,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which of these Boolean formulas is closer to triviality,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and by triviality I mean

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which one of these is closer to a 2-SAT formula.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So look at x1, x2, and x3

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and consider what would happen if you were to assign them true or false values.

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And then you just check the appropriate box.
