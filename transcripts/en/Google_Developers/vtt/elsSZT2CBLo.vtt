KORY JEFFREY: Hello everybody.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.416
We are in San Francisco
at Founder World.

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:05.860
Joining me in the
studio today is

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.291
Chenoa, the managing
director for Blue Startups.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:08.790
Welcome.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.080
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Thank you.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.829
KORY JEFFREY: So let's
start with the fact

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.859
that you are managing
director of a VC in Hawaii.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.150
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Yes, I know.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.870
It's tough.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.995
KORY JEFFREY: It's awesome.

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:20.223
It actually sounds
like a dream job.

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.115
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
It kind of is, yeah.

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.300
We call it startup
paradise in Hawaii.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
And we're lucky to
live there and we're

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.562
lucky to be able to do this work
with exciting tech companies

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.062
there.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.800
KORY JEFFREY: So can
you talk a little bit

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.439
about the Hawaii tech scene?

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.439
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Yeah.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.740
So I would describe
it as burgeoning.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.910
It is a smaller scene, but
it's very vibrant and growing.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.780
So it's an exciting time for us.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.780
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.902
And so what's the investment
thesis of your guys' fund?

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.360
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
So Blue Startups

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.900
does a couple different things.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.800
Obviously, we invest
in local companies

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.030
that we think have
strong technology

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630
and a good foundation
for success.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.560
And then we also
invest in companies

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.340
in a few different areas that we
focus on outside of Hawaii, so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.260
connections to Asia.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.760
We do have strong
connections there.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.710
We look at companies
from the US that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.560
are trying to get
into Asia or companies

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.132
from Asia that are trying
to enter the US market.

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:12.340
That's one sweet spot for us.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.480
The other is really
in travel technology.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.390
Since we have a huge
travel industry,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.687
we can access very
high level executives

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:20.770
there in the travel space.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.853
KORY JEFFREY: So playing
on your natural strengths

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.552
in location and economy.

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:25.510
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Yep.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.093
KORY JEFFREY: And so do you guys
have a certain stage that you

00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:28.900
like to invest in?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.316
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
It's very early

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:33.680
stage, although we do take in
companies at multiple stages.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.476
Our Hawaii-based companies
tend to be earlier.

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:37.850
Most of the
companies we bring in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.333
tend to be a little later stage,
post-revenue, early traction,

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.137
that sort of thing.

00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:44.720
KORY JEFFREY: What
does the life cycle

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.900
funding look like in Hawaii?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.483
Do they then have
to go somewhere else

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:49.270
to get the later stage?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.620
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: So we have
a very robust accelerator,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.670
pre-seed, and seed market there.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.120
So we can get a company all
the way from idea, essentially,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.130
through almost to
Series A. But once they

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.580
get to the Series B,
generally speaking,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.437
they have to look
outside for funding.

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:06.520
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.395
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: But
we're working on that.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.740
Hopefully, eventually, we'll
be able to fund companies

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.000
all the way through
their life cycle.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.083
KORY JEFFREY: That's cool.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.830
And so do you find
that helps keep people,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.080
that you have this investment
arm in Hawaii that helps

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.540
keep people on the island?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.400
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.290
And I think that we can
give our entrepreneurs

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530
the best possible start in
life right now in Hawaii.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.940
We can surround them
with amazing mentors.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.350
We can give them funding.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.150
We can give them
everything that they

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.350
need for success right now.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.280
It's a very robust
ecosystem at that stage.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.859
It's the later
stages that things

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:40.900
get a little bit tougher.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.080
But, you know, that's
where Silicon Valley

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.550
is a specialist at that.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.255
So it's hard to
compete with that

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:47.970
and we shouldn't really try.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.870
KORY JEFFREY: That makes sense.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.620
So we're at Founder World.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.480
There's thousands of
people walking around.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.544
What attracted
you to this event?

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.960
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
Well, I thought

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.850
it was really interesting
that it was going to be free.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.560
Wow, that's amazing.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.050
Who's going to show up for that?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.300
How many people are
going to be here?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.508
There's a lot of people here.

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:10.290
So I've had a chance to
interact with a lot of folks.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.820
I like the focus on founders.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.830
That's really cool.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.030
I think they did a poll of
the audience earlier today.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.440
Who has a startup out there?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.740
It was like everybody.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.770
So that's really
neat that that's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.230
the majority of the folks here.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.730
They're actually
starting a company.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.188
They're really
eager to talk to you

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.770
about what they're working on.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.730
A lot of good ideas.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.380
A lot of really
interesting companies.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.880
KORY JEFFREY: Have you had a
chance to walk around the floor

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.272
and see any of the demos?

00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:34.736
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: I have.

00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:35.402
I walked around.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.800
I talked to a lot of these guys.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.370
Some really great things
going on out there.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.786
KORY JEFFREY: Is there anything
in particular that kind of

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:41.495
stuck out to you?

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.160
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
That stuck out to me.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.010
That's interesting.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.540
I just actually was talking
to a company in the mentorship

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.060
session called GrowX, I
believe it was called.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.470
They have an indoor growing
facility for tomatoes.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.483
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:56.149
KORY JEFFREY: That's
not where I thought

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.254
you were going with that.

00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.673
I thought we were going
to go to Colorado.

00:03:58.673 --> 00:03:59.673
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Yeah.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:02.010
Obviously, there's other
applications for it.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.550
They're showing
me their pictures

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.660
and I'm like, tomatoes?

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.261
Interesting.

00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:08.010
Is there anything else
that could possibly

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.920
be grown in there?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.081
KORY JEFFREY: You
know, beans, tomatoes.

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:12.080
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Yeah.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.010
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.843
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: But
very energy efficient

00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:16.200
and that sort of thing.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200
So that's interesting.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.110
KORY JEFFREY: That's cool.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.709
And you were on
stage today speaking?

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.750
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: I was.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.630
KORY JEFFREY: And so
what was the message

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.670
you were getting across?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.260
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
So we were talking

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.815
about trends in early
stage seed investing,

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:29.064
kind of where we see
the market headed.

00:04:29.064 --> 00:04:31.230
I think a couple trends
came out of that discussion.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.360
One, the internationalization
of the market.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.900
And obviously, with our
east west orientation,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.070
we think about that a lot.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.280
We are interacting
a lot with folks

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.760
that are from other
countries, either as investors

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880
or entrepreneurs, primarily
the Asian countries.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.930
So I think that's a trend
that's very interesting.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.110
You have a few
seed stage funders,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.450
like 500 Startups and
them that are really

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.170
looking at a very
international kind of play.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.660
And I think we'll see
more and more of that.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.260
I read a great
quote this morning,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.180
which was that Silicon Valley
is no longer a geography.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.470
It's an attitude.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.420
And that can be exported.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.720
And that attitude
and that ecosystem

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.900
that's being developed here
that this is the home of

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.720
is now being exported
around the world.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.600
And you see different
startup communities really

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.745
take hold of that and
make it their own.

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:28.640
You see that in Honolulu, too.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.620
So if you had to give some
advice to the inspiring

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.744
founders, what would it be?

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:37.115
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Work on
your monetization strategy.

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:39.055
KORY JEFFREY: It's
a very VC answer.

00:05:39.055 --> 00:05:40.096
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Sorry.

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:41.277
KORY JEFFREY: That's good.

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:43.860
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: We're still
really-- we struggle with that,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.339
I think as the culture
here in the startup world.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.130
Everyone wants to talk
about their product.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.100
That's what I heard
today a lot over and over

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.100
and over, the product,
the product, the product.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.700
How are you going to make money?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.890
That age old question.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.295
It never really goes away.

00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:57.760
KORY JEFFREY: It never does.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.670
Probably never will.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.878
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: I hope so.

00:05:59.878 --> 00:06:01.242
We're in trouble if it does.

00:06:01.242 --> 00:06:01.640
KORY JEFFREY: That's right.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.223
And I guess my last
question would be,

00:06:03.223 --> 00:06:05.380
do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.004
CHENOA FARNSWORTH:
A Google technology?

00:06:07.004 --> 00:06:07.763
KORY JEFFREY: Yes.

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:08.888
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: Oh gosh.

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:11.480
I use everything
Google all the time,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.940
so how do I narrow it down?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.940
I don't want to be
boring, but I guess Gmail.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.440
KORY JEFFREY: You
would be surprised

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.590
how many Gmail answers.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.400
It's been Gmail,
Sheets, and Maps

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.490
have been probably the
most popular answer I've

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.640
been getting at this event.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.940
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: I mean, Gmail
kind of does it all for me.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.350
KORY JEFFREY: This is it.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.905
It kind of comes to the whole
ubiquity of running your life.

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:32.030
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: It does.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.500
And now that I have
all these apps playing

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.110
on top of that Gmail layer that
do every little thing that I

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.670
need done, like Schedule Once.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.594
That's my favorite.

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:45.300
That runs on top of my Gmail.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.860
Scheduling probably saves
me 10 hours a week easily.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.655
It's genius.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:51.199
I love it.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.240
KORY JEFFREY: It's kind
of like the unsexy ideas.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.886
They kind of really get that.

00:06:54.886 --> 00:06:55.324
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: I know.

00:06:55.324 --> 00:06:56.200
It's all about efficiency.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.640
KORY JEFFREY: That's right.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.060
Awesome.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.190
Well, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.590
CHENOA FARNSWORTH: All right.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.590
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining me.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.150
We are at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.900
