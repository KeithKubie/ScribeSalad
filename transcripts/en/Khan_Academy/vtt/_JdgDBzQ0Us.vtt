00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:01.991
- [Voiceover] The picture has an

00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:04.772
area of 80 square centimeters.

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:07.234
What is the width of the picture?

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.329
So here's our picture, this super

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.884
fun giraffe listening to music

00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:14.666
and our picture's shape is a rectangle

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:19.507
and we're asked to find the
width of that rectangle.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.107
Well, maybe we don't
know a special formula

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:25.063
or a special equation to find width,

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:29.390
but we do know one to
find area of a rectangle,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.346
so let's use that formula
and see how it can help us.

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:37.074
We know that area of a
rectangle can be found

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.559
by multiplying the
length of the rectangle,

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.809
over here, the length, times the width.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.160
So if we multiply the two side lengths

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.126
of a rectangle, we get its area.

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:54.713
And on this picture, in this rectangle,

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:58.173
we are told that our area
is 80 square centimeters,

00:00:58.173 --> 00:01:01.132
so we already know the area,

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:02.960
and we can use that to help us.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.754
We also know the length.

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:07.053
We're told that this
distance from here to here,

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:11.987
this length is 10 centimeters,
so the length is 10.

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:14.645
Times the width, we don't know the width.

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:16.815
That's what we're looking for.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:20.393
So what we do know though,
is that we need our width

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.785
to be a number that when
it's multiplied times 10,

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.050
we get 80 for an answer.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.633
So what number times
10 equals 80 is eight.

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.374
Eight time 10 equals 80.

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:36.187
So that means the width of our picture

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:37.937
is eight centimeters.

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:43.476
Let's try one more.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:47.143
A rectangle has an area
of 24 square meters.

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:50.436
The width of the rectangle is four meters.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:53.096
What is the length of the rectangle?

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:55.855
So this time we don't even
have a picture to look at,

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:59.011
but we have enough information
up here to solve this.

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.837
Again, we can use our
formula that tells us

00:02:01.837 --> 00:02:06.004
area of a rectangle is the
length times the width.

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.411
Now we could draw this rectangle.

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.014
It might be helpful to visualize it,

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.111
but I'm gonna show you here,
we can actually solve it

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:19.674
without ever even seeing the rectangle,

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:23.424
because we know the area
is 24 square meters,

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:28.289
so the space the rectangle
covers is 24 square meters,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.617
and the length, we don't know the length.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.759
We're asked what is the length.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.846
But we do know that the
width is four meters.

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:40.967
So our length has to be some number

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.935
that when it's multiplied times four,

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:46.018
we get 24 for the answer.

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:49.355
And that number must be six,

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:53.506
because six times four equals 24.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.720
So the length of our rectangle is six,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.887
and in this case we're
talking about meters, meters.
