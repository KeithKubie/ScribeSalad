00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.980
If you built this rocket launcher from a previous
project, then you're going to need some rockets.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.800
In this video, you'll learn how to make these
durable, high pressure rockets, for about

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.820
5 cents each.

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.120
It's a beautiful day, so I'm taking this project
outside on my patio. I'll get started by placing

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.210
my rocket launcher with the barrel overhanging
this ledge. I'm going to start making this

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.050
fairly quickly, so I'll plug in a hot glue
gun to get it warming, and start cutting this

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.570
piece of paper right down the center. One
half will act as a spacer and the other half

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.890
will form rocket body. Let's roll the first
half tight around the barrel and tape it to

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.920
itself, then take the other piece and wrap
it the same way. Now we have 2 layers to this

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.690
roll, and we'll need to position them so that
the top layer is overhanging just enough to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.690
press the sides inward from 4 directions.
All the paper on the tip is overlapping so

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.390
it's time to add some electrical tape. Start
at the base of the top layer, and wind it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
in a circular fashion until it's wrapped all
the way up the body. This tape is very durable

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.140
and perfect for holding these rocket bodies
together under pressure. When we get to the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.659
tip, let's wrap several layers of tape over
the top and around the sides because this

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.060
is the part that's going to take the most
abuse. When that's rounded and smoothed out,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.340
we can wrap one more layer down the rocket
body, ending right back where we started.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.030
This rocket will need some fins, so I've ripped
a piece of cardboard off a box, and when I've

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.049
squared up the edges a bit, I'll make a mark
a third of the way up the body, and another

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.950
mark as wide as the barrel. Using a straight
edge, we can connect the dots, and cut the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.130
fin out. Now we have a template to make more
fins, and we'll need 4, so let's trace those

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.530
out and begin cutting. This way we've managed
to keep the fins all about the same size.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.329
They're not perfect, but hey, it's not like
this is real rocket science. Ok, hot glue

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.950
goes on this end, and then presses into place
flush with the base of the electrical tape.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.260
When it's hardened, rotate the fin down, and
place another one on top. I'm trying to make

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.680
all the fins relatively symmetrical, and this
seems like a good way to get the job done.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.530
Ok, we're done with the hot glue, so we can
unplug that, and this rocket is nearly finished.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.790
I'm adding 2 wraps of tape just over the tips,
and when I smooth it all out, it's finished.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.880
There's just one thing left to do, and that's
remove the inner layer of tubing. This will

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.600
create a slight gap making it easier to load
the rocket. I'm also adding extra tape to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.290
the bottoms of the fins to ensure this little
rocket is super durable. I think it's ready

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.250
to test out. I'll use my air compressor to
charge the system to 135 PSI, and once we've

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.260
closed the ball valve we can disconnect the
air hose, and now we're completely portable.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.540
Ok, I've got my rocket set, and the neighborhood
is clear. Winds are calm, so it's time to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.900
fire. That's a good shot, and landed all the
way down at the end of the street. This is

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.600
an insane amount of pressure for a paper rocket
to withstand, and would blow most little rockets

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.590
to bits! But this design seems to get the
results, because even with all the pressure,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.630
they shoot amazingly straight. And they can
be used again and again! I still can't get

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.130
over the distance these cheap little things
can cover. This one just went 300ft and flew

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.010
over my house. I'm really happy with how this
project worked out, and at a cost of about

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.169
5Â¢ each I feel like I've got my money's worth.
That's it for now. If you liked this project,

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.909
perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check
