00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.699
Treat a virus with another virus like herpes?

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.600
Crazy as that sounds, it’s happening right
now!

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.950
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.680
Cancer is no one’s favourite topic; the
prospect of abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.050
in your body and destroying healthy tissue
is completely terrifying.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.630
But a new drug might be able to help by harnessing
one virus to attack another.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.520
Viruses are tiny, the largest are smaller
than the smallest bacteria.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.300
And because they are nothing but genetic material
wrapped in a protein coat, they can’t live

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.689
without a host.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.960
Viruses can only reproduce by attaching themselves
to other cells, cells they reprogram to make

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.390
new viruses until the host cell dies.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.490
Sometimes, viruses turn normal cells into
cancerous ones.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.860
But it’s viruses’ ability to infect and
kill cells that actually make them an ally

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.620
in the fight against cancer, because we can
alter the way viruses behave.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.490
Using viruses to attack another virus is otherwise
known as virotherapy.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.120
This potential first became clear more than
a century ago when doctors noted that cancer

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.930
patients who caught measles, hepatitis or
glandular fever seemed to temporarily recover.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.520
In 1949, patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma
were injected with viral hepatitis.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.869
One-Third of the 21 patients injected experienced
temporary remission.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.200
Fast forward to the present and we now have
scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.700
in London conducting successful trials with
a skin cancer drug called T-VEC.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.759
T-VEC is a version of the common herpes simplex
virus genetically modified to only replicate

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.060
in unhealthy cancer cells, destroying tumors
while leaving healthy tissues intact.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.419
T-VEC is injected right into the tumor, even
in advanced stages.

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:33.240
Once the cancerous cells burst, this triggers
a secondary auto-immune response.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.280
T-VEC also includes a gene that encodes a
type of protein called granulocyte-macrophage

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.270
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that recruits
immune-boosting cells to the tumor.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.270
Together, killing the cancerous cells and
bringing in more tumor-fighting cells speed

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.299
up the drug’s cancer-fighting effect while
also stimulating the immune system, waking

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.560
up the body to attack the cancerous cells.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.539
And it’s this two-pronged attack that is
really exciting scientists.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.979
According to their findings, the drug has
even been shown to kill cancerous cells that

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.609
have migrated away from the treated tumor,
stopping the spread of cancer.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.319
And this last trial is the first to show that
the drug actually increase survival rates

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.649
among cancer patients.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.819
For this latest trial, T-VEC was given to
436 patients from 64 centres in the US, the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.019
UK, Canada and South Africa all of whom had
inoperable malignant melanoma.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.130
And though the drug is still not licensed,
it could become a great asset in the fight

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.569
against skin cancer, even at an advanced stage.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.980
Ways of harnessing viruses to attack cancer
have certainly come a long way in the last

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.640
half century, and with any luck drugs like
T-VEC will be able to fight other forms of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.840
cancer in the not too distant future.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.290
And here’s some other good news on the cancer
front - your cellphone is not gonna give you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.659
a brain tumor after all.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.530
