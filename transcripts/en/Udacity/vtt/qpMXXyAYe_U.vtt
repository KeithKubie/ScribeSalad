00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.880
Now that you're familiar with Direct,
it's time for you to get involved.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.080
Later on we'll learn about
personal health records.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.979
For now,
I want you to go to HealthVault.com,

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:16.870
the free public personal health record
from Microsoft and create an account.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.930
Later on, I'll ask you to use that
account in some other activities, but

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.410
for now create it by putting in
your demographic information and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.500
you'll be given a direct email address.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.160
Click on the question mark next
to it and produce a letter for

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.550
your doctor explaining
how they can use it.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.530
The letter will refer to the CCDA, CCD,
and CCR, three alternate formats for

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.600
an electronic patients summary an EMR
can produce is part of meaningful use.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.440
You'll learn about
them in lesson five B.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.030
Submit that letter for
credit for this activity.
