00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.960
I'm Pellom McDaniels, and I'm curator of African America collections

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.180
in the Stuart A. Rose manuscript archives and rare book library at Emory University.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.300
Did you know that?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.280
So the African American collections here contain materials related to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.180
African American history and life

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.729
in terms of the social and political histories, art histories

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.560
We collect the papers of different organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
which was started by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.520
We also have collections of black fraternities and sororities

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.440
including The BoulÃ© Sigma Pi Phi which is an African American men's professional fraternity.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.020
Generally what we try to do is collect materials that are not only relevant to our

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.420
students and our faculty's research,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.160
but fill in the gaps related to the lives of African Americans

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.180
from the beginning of the country's founding to today.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.350
Our most recent acquisition, of course, was the Barack Obama letters from him to his girlfriend.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.760
And so we have the first edition of Phillis Wheatley's book of poetry to the first black president's, you know,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.080
letters before he was president. Really kind of showing us his

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.440
breadth and depth and his intelligence before he took office.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
Some of the material that I'm interested in specifically has to do with

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960
African American manhood and masculinity.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.540
Historically speaking, when we think about African-American masculinity, we include slavery in that equation.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.660
It was very difficult for black men to achieve a sense of manhood

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.380
being oppressed and being kind of identified as not only second-class citizens, but as beasts of burden,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.600
as human chattels. And so by looking and tracing this history from slavery to freedom

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.100
we're able to see how these men were able to

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.759
accomplish the sense of their not only

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.160
manhood but achieved their humanity. And so in looking at,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.660
reading the literature David Walker's Appeal, Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.820
examining the the visual kind of representations of black masculinity as relates to early photography

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.040
we're able to understand how these men were defining themselves in this time period

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.720
where they were reduced to being less than human.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.360
And so by looking at the different evidence we have available to us, we can really synthesize a

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.809
history, that is not only

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.159
significant for them in those moments where they experience life

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.629
but it allows for us to be rooted in something that brings us into the present.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.099
It's like a big jigsaw puzzle

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.480
and, you know, my...

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.260
the beauty of my work is that I get a chance to go find the pieces to fill in the gaps and try to make it

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.119
as whole as I can in the space

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.660
provided in the archives.
