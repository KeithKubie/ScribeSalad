A lot of people don't
realize that we're

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.440
about more than just Android
development here at Google.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.970
For starters, we're a big iOS
developer ourselves, right?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.780
We've got the Google Search
App, and Inbox, and YouTube,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.164
and Maps, and a whole lot more.

00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:13.830
I mean, come to think
of it, we probably

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.371
have just as many
libraries available

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:17.300
for outside developers to use.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.680
But it's funny.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.240
When a lot of folks
think about where

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.930
to go to look for
solutions to help them

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.180
with their iOS development,
they don't come to Google.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.840
It just doesn't
appear on their mind.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.176
I guess that's something
I'm looking to change.

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:29.550
And to be fair,
we haven't always

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.020
made that information
easy to find.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.370
I mean, the first time I
did a series of screencasts

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.300
on how to add Google
services to your iOS app,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.340
I ended up publishing it in
the Android Developers channel.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.210
And the comments
were pretty much what

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.780
you might expect-- fanboys.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.520
But that made me realize
that we really needed a place

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.260
to put some of these developer
videos for iOS folks,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.420
and that's kind of how
Route 85 came about.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.670
So where'd the name come from?

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.128
Well, you're going to have to
figure that out for yourself.

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.268
You might want to
try Googling it.

00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:00.660
Hm.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.070
Some of our shows, they're
fairly Google specific,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.750
but a lot of our
stuff just is kind

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.510
of general purpose information.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.010
So even if you're not at all
interested in learning anything

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.540
about Google on iOS,
you should still

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.415
watch because you just
might learn something.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.660
So come join us, right
here on Route 85.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.030
One tip is to use Bezier paths
to define your shadow's shape.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480
Let's review that giant
URL one more time, here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.980
Woah!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.430
[CRASH]
