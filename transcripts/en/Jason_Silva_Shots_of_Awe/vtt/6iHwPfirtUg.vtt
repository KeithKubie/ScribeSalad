00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.050
So I think a lot about the
idea of the creative process.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.810
What happens to
human consciousness

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.360
when he is in a state
of cognitive genesis,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.940
when a new idea
is being birthed.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.750
And we hear a lot of people
use the term "no mind,"

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.746
or "Get out of your own way,"
or "The only thing getting

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:37.360
in your way is you."

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.610
People talk about getting
into these flow states that

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.875
silence the inner critic-- the
lateral prefrontal cortex that

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:47.160
is responsible for self
editing goes dim when you enter

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.182
these liminal trance states
of heightened creativity

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.328
and manic geometries of
association of thought,

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:58.442
where you decondition
your thinking.

00:00:58.442 --> 00:01:00.400
There is a kind of "no
mind" when this happens.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.566
I tell people that making
art as a kind of exorcism.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.355
You have to die and be reborn.

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:09.050
And then, when you are
resurrected, then you're like,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.300
wow, look what I brought back.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.310
Look at my canvas.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.260
This is where I went.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.600
Our painting, our
songs, our stories--

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.970
they are maps for where we went.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.560
It's the equivalent of us
dropping little pebbles

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
behind us as we trail towards
new modalities of thought.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.850
The art is evidence.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.475
The art is what
we brought back--

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:31.673
what we transmuted from
the other dimension

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:33.060
to share with everyone else.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.453
To share with ourselves.

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.746
To integrate, right?

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:38.170
To upgrade ourselves.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:48.500
To expand the parameters of
what is, as far as we can tell.
