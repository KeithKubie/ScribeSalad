always comes in handy I've used it for

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040
always comes in handy I've used it for
 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.300

all kinds of projects okay so the first

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310
all kinds of projects okay so the first
 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.860
all kinds of projects okay so the first
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna
 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.980
thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna
kind of plot out on the mask where we

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990
kind of plot out on the mask where we
 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.080
kind of plot out on the mask where we
want to make our cuts as I said I'm just

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090
want to make our cuts as I said I'm just
 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.760
want to make our cuts as I said I'm just
gonna do a half mass so I'm probably

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770
gonna do a half mass so I'm probably
 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.270
gonna do a half mass so I'm probably
just going to use the bottom section I'm

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280
just going to use the bottom section I'm
 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.550
just going to use the bottom section I'm
not sure exactly how this mask is gonna

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560
not sure exactly how this mask is gonna
 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.710
not sure exactly how this mask is gonna
look right now I'm just gonna start kind

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
look right now I'm just gonna start kind
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.420
look right now I'm just gonna start kind
of playing around with different parts

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430
of playing around with different parts
 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:13.100
of playing around with different parts
and see what looks good

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.270
all right so here's the piece that I cut

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280
all right so here's the piece that I cut
 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.089
all right so here's the piece that I cut
off I made some extra lines here using a

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099
off I made some extra lines here using a
 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.120
off I made some extra lines here using a
mask that I went around the shop to

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130
mask that I went around the shop to
 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.570
mask that I went around the shop to
cover it and give me a basic idea of

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580
cover it and give me a basic idea of
 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.460
cover it and give me a basic idea of
where my face is actually gonna be in

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470
where my face is actually gonna be in
 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.040
where my face is actually gonna be in
the mask because the way that this piece

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050
the mask because the way that this piece
 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.200
the mask because the way that this piece
right now is the little too wide and

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210
right now is the little too wide and
 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.300
right now is the little too wide and
I'll show you what I mean okay so the

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310
I'll show you what I mean okay so the
 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.700
I'll show you what I mean okay so the
mask is basically gonna go over the face

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710
mask is basically gonna go over the face
 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.939
mask is basically gonna go over the face
like this but these pieces kind of flare

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949
like this but these pieces kind of flare
 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.520
like this but these pieces kind of flare
out a little too much what you could do

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530
out a little too much what you could do
 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.439
out a little too much what you could do
is use a heat gun and heat up the edges

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449
is use a heat gun and heat up the edges
 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.300
is use a heat gun and heat up the edges
where I've made the lines and kind of

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310
where I've made the lines and kind of
 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.839
where I've made the lines and kind of
bend it back so it actually forms around

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849
bend it back so it actually forms around
 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.080
bend it back so it actually forms around
the face a little bit better

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090
the face a little bit better
 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.450
the face a little bit better
but to kind of save on time I thought

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
but to kind of save on time I thought
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.800
but to kind of save on time I thought
maybe I would just cut these pieces off

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810
maybe I would just cut these pieces off
 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.839
maybe I would just cut these pieces off
and use the scrap leather to make the

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849
and use the scrap leather to make the
 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:11.550
and use the scrap leather to make the
sides of the mask and that will tie

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560
sides of the mask and that will tie
 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.820
sides of the mask and that will tie
right into the strap and the buckle for

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830
right into the strap and the buckle for
 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.469
right into the strap and the buckle for
the back but if you wanted to you could

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479
the back but if you wanted to you could
 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.460
the back but if you wanted to you could
actually cut that piece off and add a

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470
actually cut that piece off and add a
 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.610
actually cut that piece off and add a
hinge which actually sounds like a

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620
hinge which actually sounds like a
 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.439
hinge which actually sounds like a
pretty good idea and maybe I might do

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449
pretty good idea and maybe I might do
 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.300
pretty good idea and maybe I might do
that if I have time maybe I'll make more

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310
that if I have time maybe I'll make more
 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.969
that if I have time maybe I'll make more
than one mask we'll cut these corner

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979
than one mask we'll cut these corner
 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.180
than one mask we'll cut these corner
pieces off put leather behind it and add

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190
pieces off put leather behind it and add
 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.580
pieces off put leather behind it and add
a hinge there so that it folds around

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590
a hinge there so that it folds around
 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.999
a hinge there so that it folds around
the face a little bit snugger and we

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:42.009
the face a little bit snugger and we
 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:43.170
the face a little bit snugger and we
could put like a decorative hinge on it

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180
could put like a decorative hinge on it
 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.580
could put like a decorative hinge on it
will actually add some texture and some

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590
will actually add some texture and some
 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.700
will actually add some texture and some
character to the mask cool I think we're

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.710
character to the mask cool I think we're
 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.390
character to the mask cool I think we're
gonna do that also kind of neat is the

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400
gonna do that also kind of neat is the
 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.659
gonna do that also kind of neat is the
top of the mask that you used to cut it

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:54.669
top of the mask that you used to cut it
 

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:56.850
top of the mask that you used to cut it
off actually can become another pretty

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:56.860
off actually can become another pretty
 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.670
off actually can become another pretty
cool mask a little bit more like sci-fi

00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680
cool mask a little bit more like sci-fi
 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.450
cool mask a little bit more like sci-fi
kind of looking but yeah that's kind of

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.460
kind of looking but yeah that's kind of
 

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.060
kind of looking but yeah that's kind of
a so you had two masks out of one

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.070
a so you had two masks out of one
 

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.510
a so you had two masks out of one
basically for a future project or

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520
basically for a future project or
 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.950
basically for a future project or
something alright so after I've cut out

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960
something alright so after I've cut out
 

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.040
something alright so after I've cut out
the corn pieces as is over left with so

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.050
the corn pieces as is over left with so
 

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.570
the corn pieces as is over left with so
this would be the part that covers the

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:18.580
this would be the part that covers the
 

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.590
this would be the part that covers the
face and

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.600
face and
 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.950
face and
these end pieces that I cut off we're

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960
these end pieces that I cut off we're
 

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.200
these end pieces that I cut off we're
going to actually hinge and then I'll

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.210
going to actually hinge and then I'll
 

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.640
going to actually hinge and then I'll
put some leather behind it and we'll

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:26.650
put some leather behind it and we'll
 

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.400
put some leather behind it and we'll
attach the straps to that leather for

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:29.410
attach the straps to that leather for
 

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.330
attach the straps to that leather for
hinges I've got these cheap well

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.340
hinges I've got these cheap well
 

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.240
hinges I've got these cheap well
relatively cheap I think there's not

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.250
relatively cheap I think there's not
 

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:42.000
relatively cheap I think there's not
four but I don't know they were three or

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.010
four but I don't know they were three or
 

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.420
four but I don't know they were three or
four bucks at a happy store they're kind

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.430
four bucks at a happy store they're kind
 

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.910
four bucks at a happy store they're kind
of these cool decorative hinges so

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920
of these cool decorative hinges so
 

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.420
of these cool decorative hinges so
that'll be what I use to add the two

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430
that'll be what I use to add the two
 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.990
that'll be what I use to add the two
pieces and I think they'll give it kind

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000
pieces and I think they'll give it kind
 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.510
pieces and I think they'll give it kind
of a cool look okay so I drilled holes

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:00.520
of a cool look okay so I drilled holes
 

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.410
of a cool look okay so I drilled holes
and temporarily put the hinges on using

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.420
and temporarily put the hinges on using
 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.120
and temporarily put the hinges on using
these little fasteners that it came with

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.130
these little fasteners that it came with
 

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.370
these little fasteners that it came with
just to kind of give an idea of how

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380
just to kind of give an idea of how
 

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.990
just to kind of give an idea of how
last-minute how like it's gonna look and

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000
last-minute how like it's gonna look and
 

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.490
last-minute how like it's gonna look and
if that's the look that I want to go

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:14.500
if that's the look that I want to go
 

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.470
if that's the look that I want to go
with I think actually it's gonna look

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480
with I think actually it's gonna look
 

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.620
with I think actually it's gonna look
pretty cool and so now I'm gonna measure

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:19.630
pretty cool and so now I'm gonna measure
 

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.170
pretty cool and so now I'm gonna measure
and cut the leather for the back of it

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.180
and cut the leather for the back of it
 

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.210
and cut the leather for the back of it
for the back of this piece and then

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.220
for the back of this piece and then
 

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.290
for the back of this piece and then
we'll kind of figure out what we're

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.300
we'll kind of figure out what we're
 

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.330
we'll kind of figure out what we're
gonna do with the mouthpiece again I

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.340
gonna do with the mouthpiece again I
 

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.770
gonna do with the mouthpiece again I
don't want it to look like a hockey mask

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:31.780
don't want it to look like a hockey mask
 

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.900
don't want it to look like a hockey mask
so we're gonna find some elements to

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:33.910
so we're gonna find some elements to
 

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.090
so we're gonna find some elements to
kind of decorate this but so that we can

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:36.100
kind of decorate this but so that we can
 

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.130
kind of decorate this but so that we can
still breathe okay so I drilled out my

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.140
still breathe okay so I drilled out my
 

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.310
still breathe okay so I drilled out my
whole pattern for where I'm gonna put my

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320
whole pattern for where I'm gonna put my
 

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.300
whole pattern for where I'm gonna put my
ribs my ribs or fasteners and I'm gonna

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.310
ribs my ribs or fasteners and I'm gonna
 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.140
ribs my ribs or fasteners and I'm gonna
attach the hinges and some other

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.150
attach the hinges and some other
 

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.990
attach the hinges and some other
decorative pieces here and then what I'm

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000
decorative pieces here and then what I'm
 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.430
decorative pieces here and then what I'm
going to do is take these tiny gemstones

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440
going to do is take these tiny gemstones
 

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.810
going to do is take these tiny gemstones
they have that self adhesive on them but

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:57.820
they have that self adhesive on them but
 

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.860
they have that self adhesive on them but
they really don't stick very well but

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:01.870
they really don't stick very well but
 

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.330
they really don't stick very well but
you can kind of put them in place where

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:03.340
you can kind of put them in place where
 

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.970
you can kind of put them in place where
you want them to see how it looks first

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:05.980
you want them to see how it looks first
 

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.260
you want them to see how it looks first
and then yeah because it does look the

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.270
and then yeah because it does look the
 

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.240
and then yeah because it does look the
year going forward you can take them off

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.250
year going forward you can take them off
 

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.090
year going forward you can take them off
or mark where they are and then glue

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.100
or mark where they are and then glue
 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.970
or mark where they are and then glue
them with superglue before we go ahead

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:17.980
them with superglue before we go ahead
 

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.950
them with superglue before we go ahead
and paint so I'm going to do that now

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:19.960
and paint so I'm going to do that now
 

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.560
and paint so I'm going to do that now

all right now that it's painted I went
 

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.340
all right now that it's painted I went
ahead and added the hinges I used these

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.350
ahead and added the hinges I used these
 

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.440
ahead and added the hinges I used these
little press opinions that it came with

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:25.450
little press opinions that it came with
 

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:31.100
little press opinions that it came with
that kind of opened up and and I just

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.110
that kind of opened up and and I just
 

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.600
that kind of opened up and and I just
once they were open and pretty tighten

once they were open and pretty tighten
where I thought I wanted them I just had

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.380
where I thought I wanted them I just had
 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.200
where I thought I wanted them I just had
glue them on the other side cuz we're

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.210
glue them on the other side cuz we're
 

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.850

gonna cover this with some cheap leather

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:38.860
gonna cover this with some cheap leather
 

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.769

and stuff anyway all right so what's the

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:43.779
and stuff anyway all right so what's the
 

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:46.710
and stuff anyway all right so what's the
scrap leather I just cut some strips for

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720
scrap leather I just cut some strips for
 

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.210
scrap leather I just cut some strips for
the sides that are gonna go along the

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.220
the sides that are gonna go along the
 

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.250
the sides that are gonna go along the
side of your face equal lengths for

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
side of your face equal lengths for
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.030
side of your face equal lengths for
either side and then as we saw before I

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040
either side and then as we saw before I
 

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.740
either side and then as we saw before I
cut out the outline of the shape that

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:58.750
cut out the outline of the shape that
 

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.829
cut out the outline of the shape that
piece is a little bit extra and then I

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839
piece is a little bit extra and then I
 

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:08.460
piece is a little bit extra and then I
ran these fasteners here through the

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:08.470
ran these fasteners here through the
 

00:13:08.470 --> 00:14:18.190
ran these fasteners here through the
other side

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:18.200
 

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.950
that's it this is what you're left with

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.110
that's it this is what you're left with
now keep in mind that you don't have to

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120
now keep in mind that you don't have to
 

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.790
now keep in mind that you don't have to
do this exact bill this is just to give

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800
do this exact bill this is just to give
 

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.440
do this exact bill this is just to give
you an idea of something you can do

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:30.450
you an idea of something you can do
 

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.450
you an idea of something you can do
using some off-the-shelf items at the

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:32.460

simple elements you can pull off the
 

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.150
simple elements you can pull off the
shelves repurpose them and with some

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160
shelves repurpose them and with some
 

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.670
shelves repurpose them and with some
creative paintwork I'm gonna put it in

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680
creative paintwork I'm gonna put it in
 

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.710
creative paintwork I'm gonna put it in
you know really what sells it is the

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720
you know really what sells it is the
 

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.010

paint Jeff several layers of paint I
 

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.950
paint Jeff several layers of paint I
just keep going start dark and go

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:51.960
just keep going start dark and go
 

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.300
just keep going start dark and go
lighter and lighter and lighter using

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:53.310
lighter and lighter and lighter using
 

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.540
lighter and lighter and lighter using
metallic paints start off with a flat

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:56.550
metallic paints start off with a flat
 

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.300
metallic paints start off with a flat
black and or our bronze or era or like a

deep brown and just keep doing dry

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:03.450
deep brown and just keep doing dry
 

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.140
deep brown and just keep doing dry
brushing over it or you could do some

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.150
brushing over it or you could do some
 

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.910
brushing over it or you could do some
light passes with some for spray paint

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920
light passes with some for spray paint
 

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.880
light passes with some for spray paint
but the idea is you can start dark and

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:10.890
but the idea is you can start dark and
 

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.210
but the idea is you can start dark and
then go lighter and lighter so that the

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.220
then go lighter and lighter so that the
 

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.560
then go lighter and lighter so that the
the highlighted pieces the pieces that

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.570
the highlighted pieces the pieces that
 

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.420
the highlighted pieces the pieces that
stick out the furthest are highlighted

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.430
stick out the furthest are highlighted
 

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.519
stick out the furthest are highlighted
and the brightest I will say that a lot

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:19.529
and the brightest I will say that a lot
 

00:15:19.529 --> 00:15:20.870
