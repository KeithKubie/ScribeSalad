00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.040
Okay, welcome back to MoMa.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.410
My name Corey D'Augustine.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.610
This is part two of In the Studio Willem de
Kooning.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.190
In fact, we're here because of some of the
comments that you left for us.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.190
Thanks for them.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.269
And as I drew your attention to last time,
de Kooning is an artist who is very process-oriented.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.789
He's labor-intensive.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.120
So the idea of doing a de Kooning-esque painting
in a day is kind of a joke.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.550
The idea of doing a de Kooning-esque painting
in two days is also still kind of a joke,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
but I think you're going to see, you know,
by the time we get to the end of this session,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.079
that the painting is going to be a lot closer
to a de Kooning than where we are right now,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.749
which is quite frankly quite far.

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:47.370
He’s someone who reinvented himself again
and again and again and again.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.299
So there certainly isn’t one way, there
certainly aren’t a hundred ways to make

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.769
a deKooning, since he was relentlessly inventive.

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.709
So, again, a really complicated artist that
we’re talking abou.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:02.359
What I'm doing here today and in the first
video is picking out some motifs, some material,

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.100
some application techniques here.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.350
And I'm putting everything together in a way
that hopefully is going to get us close to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.900
a de Kooning-ish painting, but really the
point here is to embrace and engage with some

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.800
of his working methods and materials.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.710
So if we turn our attention to the painting
itself here, kind of a monstrosity.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.730
Some really wild, nice, wet in wet, scuffing
going on, some scrape marks, some drips cascading

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.060
down the canvas quite interestingly.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.540
The charcoal from last time, embedded in the
paint film, which is now dry to the touch.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.440
But you'll see this in many de Kooning works.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.630
That being said, this painting has some issues,
no doubt about it.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.820
One of them up here, just a very kind of unresolved
and rather ugly to my eye and a combination

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.410
of colors and textures.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.720
Spatially it's looking a little like spaghetti.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.630
There's not a real density of the painting.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.300
Now, there are certain areas that are very
rock solid like here, parallel with the edge

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.890
of the canvas, and this nice yellow plane
back here.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.860
The best de Kooning paintings are tight, and
I'm talking about the space, the painting

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.860
is very dense.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.489
This is something I'll continue to talk about
as we start painting.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.310
At any rate,I kind of have a plan for where
we're going to go next.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.530
Now in the studio, it's not great to have
too rigid of a plan.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.540
It's nice to have an idea of where you're
going, but stay open, stay flexible.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.530
So we've made some paint in weeks past, but
I'm just going to amplify some of that yellow.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.760
It's a cadmium yellow, working with a rather
fleshy consistency here.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
So that's cadmium yellow.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.019
I'm working with a little bit of buff titanium
here.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.690
Buff titanium is nice because it makes the
color a little bit more neutral, rather than

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.060
these screaming and pure high chroma colors.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.150
A little bit of medium here, this is linseed
oil, and about the same volume of solvent.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.580
This one is Gamsol, that's basically just
odorless mineral spirits.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.269
Also I'm going to be working with some black,
a color that...or a non-color that we don't

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.639
have on the canvas yet.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.829
De Kooning and many, many other artists prefer
not to use just a plain black straight out

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.930
of the tube, but let's say a chromatic black.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.790
So black plus a little bit of color.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.900
Black itself can be very flat and dead, kind
of boring a tone.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.499
So what we're going to do here, in fact I've
already added a lot of black, I'm going to

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:24.180
add a little bit of red to that, a little
bit of blue to that, ultramarine blue with

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.180
cadmium red.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.219
And again, a little bit of buff titanium.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.060
Lighten it up a little bit.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.109
Make it a little bit more neutral.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.439
I've already added some medium and some solvent
in here.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.499
And essentially what I'm going to do is make
a really dark purple, rather than a black,

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.889
just to have a little bit of purple character
in there, to have a little bit of variety

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.669
because I will be working with a black-black
and then kind of a purplish-black as well.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.670
Okay, so one of the things that we're going
to be doing today is wet over dry technique.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.230
One of the problems with the first phase of
painting is that everything is wet.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.680
And if you've tried to paint like this as
a novice oil painter, it's very often a very

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.499
common mistake that these paints just continue
to combine and combine and combine wet in

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:07.320
wet, which can be very interesting and giving
these very fluid gestural marks here, but

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.309
also can tend toward brown and everything
mixing in kind of a dead heavy way.

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.569
So we're going to be working wet over dry.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.380
But another interesting that you can do with
a dry paint surface is scrape it off in a

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.730
very different way than I scraped previously.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.900
You remember that this area was scraped, wet
paint came off there and what we see is a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.480
little bit of a white ground, the texture
of the canvas and some of these charcoal marks

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.130
that I began the work with.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.020
Now, if I start to scratch now or scrape now,
a very different kind of thing, this is really

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.020
chiseling.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.230
It's a very sculptural technique here.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.030
I've kind of flayed back into the surface.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.420
Flattened out that impasto there, and also
revealed a very matte surface rather than

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.600
a glossy one, and actually a slightly different
color because the surface of a paint film

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.820
often dries slightly different than the interior
of it.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.320
Now, you certainly don't have to start scarping
all this stuff off, but if there are areas

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.260
that you don't like or textures that you don't
like, this is certainly a nice time that you

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.260
can start to remove them.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.780
Now, one of the things I'd like to do to begin
here, since I'm trying to bring this painting

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.950
forward in space to really allow these forms,
to co-mingle a little bit is to start working

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.970
with some white in the upper and lower registers
of the painting.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.880
Now, if I added white to this painting while
wet, well, it might be interesting, but we're

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.670
going to pick up a lot of those colors and
that white is not going to stay white for

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.040
very long at all.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.540
Working white wet over dry allows us to really
bring some more opacity to the equation, not

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:40.610
pick up those under layers and really knock
out some of those areas.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.720
Okay.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.010
What I'd like to do next is really to start
opening up that yellow.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:57.950
So let's see where that takes us.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.030
And you can see that the yellow I mixed today
is a little darker, it's a little bit more

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.900
richly chromatic, a little bit more intense
than that previous yellow.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.910
And I like this.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.710
It's nice to have, you know, some cousins
of colors rather than really repeating the

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:18.520
same color again and again.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.800
De Kooning would sometimes place newsprint
directly onto the surface of his painting.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.611
Now, I don't think that he meant originally
to transfer images or text onto the paint

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.611
film.

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.970
I think that originally when he did that,
he wanted to keep the surface from drying.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.970
Why?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.250
Because sometimes he wanted to keep working
wet in wet, the next week, the next month

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.810
perhaps, and have it not dry as my canvas
has here.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.450
In fact the text of old newsprint would dissolve
in that solvent, and it would be actually

00:06:45.450 --> 00:07:05.020
transfer onto the face of 
the painting.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.110
As I take this off, you'll say, "Well, that's
kind of interesting, an interesting texture

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.930
there, but I don't see any newsprint."

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.180
The reason why is that newspaper technology
has, well, I guess improved since the '50s,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.740
but not in the context of making a de Kooning
type painting.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.021
But imagine I transferred some of that text
onto the surface here, strange, an abstract

00:07:25.021 --> 00:07:27.231
painting that starts to have newspaper effects
in it.

00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.092
Maybe it's the news, maybe it's a photo, maybe
it's, you know, some sports box score or something

00:07:31.092 --> 00:07:32.100
like that.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.830
Well, it's important to think about de Kooning
as often going the other way, often playing

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.340
a kind of contrarian card.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.240
Again, remember that in 1950, when almost
all the New York School painters were painting

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.760
abstractly, de Kooning painted the figure.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.300
Well, how about the figure?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.450
One of the things that de Kooning would do
to incorporate the figure, even in sometimes

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.580
abstract paintings, is to start working with
drawings.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.730
And I've made a, you know, not a de Kooning
drawing obviously, but a de Kooning type drawing.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.280
But before I start to add that to the painting,
I'm going to do something that might seem

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280
a little weird.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.760
I'm going to turn the painting on its side.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.670
In fact when de Kooning had the means to do
so, he built himself an amazing studio out

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.500
in the east end of Long Island, getting himself
out of the chaos of Manhattan.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.139
And in that studio that he really designed
himself quite aggressively, he sort of invented,

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:23.110
I don't know if that's really the right word,
but he designed a custom-made easel, which

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.480
actually is mechanically rotatable.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.650
So in fact, there's a kind of a trap door
in the floor so that a huge canvas could rotate

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.419
down, so that really 360 degree rotation would
be possible without, you know, having the

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.419
canvas fall off the easel.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.419
The reason for this is that de Kooning, again,
loved to make everything difficult, and it's

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.419
one of the really wonderful things about his
paintings.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.529
By rotating the canvas, we're accessing different
angles and different geometries of the human

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:45.500
body because there are some motions that our
bodies just don't naturally tend to go in.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.150
So what I'm going to do here is take this
de Kooning-ish drawing.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.290
This is a fragment of a drawing of a woman's
face.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.290
Okay.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.240
And I'm going to put it where it doesn't belong.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.360
In other words, on the surface of a painting
and also on an abstract painting.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:09.690
Something quite different from what's happening
here.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:17.020
Now, what's happening here?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.580
Well, something strange and weird is happening
right here.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.030
Again, there is this friction, this collage
idea where we jump from one logic to another.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.430
Now, de Kooning wouldn't simply do this and
just leave it there, although occasionally

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.310
you do find little fragments of paper on his
finished paintings.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.830
He would do this to start incorporating the
logic of one space into another.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.920
And what do I mean by that?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.770
Is that oftentimes he would continue some
of these lines of the drawing onto the space

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.400
where it doesn't belong.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:59.950
So I'm just going to continue some of these
lines.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:09.120
Okay.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:15.490
So in addition to drawing, extending drawing
lines off of a previous drawing onto the painting,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.190
sometimes he in fact paints off of the drawing
onto the painting.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.700
Thinking about this shape here, right?

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700
This kind of...

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.790
I don't know what that is.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.450
A pepper grinder or something like that, or
a part of it.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.240
I'm going to reinforce that on the drawing
now, but with paint.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:55.340
So through here, around that corner and then
down.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.130
So first of all, I now have a strange painted
drawing, which I'm going to keep around because

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.690
perhaps in the next canvas, the third canvas,
the fifth canvas from now, this might come

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.690
in handy.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.610
In fact maybe this color is going to be interesting.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.660
Or maybe I'll turn this into a work on paper,
and eventually this has a life of its own.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.670
So I'm getting to have an understanding of
what de Kooning studio practice is like.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.110
This is strange, right?

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.840
All of these drawn lines just stop on an edge,
as if it were scraped off.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840
But of course, you know it wasn't.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.740
It was actually on a different surface.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:30.610
And then here, really nice and interesting,
this beautiful thick brush stroke here stops

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.270
off in a very non-handmade way, right?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.040
I could never have painted that mark despite,
you know, however much effort I put into it

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.400
because there's something very linear about
that and that crisp lip of paint there is

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.290
something that maybe I'm going to keep around,
this kind of remembrance or a relic of this

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.060
very complicated process.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:56.720
Speaking of complicated process, let's keep
on complicating it.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.440
We're now in an inverted position from where
we started, and things are beginning to tighten

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.630
up here.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.779
We're starting to get more blocky planes of
color.

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:12.660
We start having some interesting moments where
under layers are visible here.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.850
Certainly some of the gestures and the shapes
from the original composition are staying

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.850
here.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.250
I'm also quieting this painting down, there's
kind of this raucous cacophony of all of these

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.340
battling hues, and it's starting to chill
out a little bit, if you will, it's starting

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.410
to quiet down here.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.029
Now, I'm going to amplify that yellow a little
bit, to keep on going.

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:53.670
So this is really one of the structural components
that I'm going to be working with here.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.780
Also what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start to use those marks that came off of

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.100
that painting as a kind of guideline for where
I may work next.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.850
For example, I have this interesting black
line here.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.910
So I'm going to follow that.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.470
And I have another interesting black line
coming down here, which happens to coincide

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.470
actually with that corner.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:23.050
So I'm going to start using that as well.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.839
To my eye, what's happening here is we're
starting to get some interesting planes of

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:26.839
color.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:29.430
We're starting to get some interesting relationships
between marks.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.830
Here is an awkward one though.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.230
Here is something that off to a nice start
here, but strangely continues in wide and

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.370
has this unconvincing bend here.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.440
So we need to do some heavy editing there.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:46.010
Also, the relationship between this U shape,
or whatever, yellow mark that I've made, and

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.130
the white is very nebulous, so I'm going to
start to interweave them a little bit.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.550
And to do that, I'm going to start working
with black.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.330
Or again, what I mentioned before, this kind
of chromatic black.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:03.640
It's actually a very dark violet that I'm
going to be working with here.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.161
These drips, quite interesting and a symbol
of the speed of the paint, the fluidity of

00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:09.161
the paint.

00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.140
And you know, any time you start to see drips
like that, you start to realize that they're

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.279
going to look really interesting.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:16.470
If we just keep on rotating here.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.360
Now, how often did de Kooning rotate his canvases?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.510
Well, we'd have to ask him to know that answer
for sure.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.230
Now, some interesting things are happening.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:31.480
Those black brush strokes, sorry, paint drips
here, they're going really horizontally.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.840
So in a way, you might be tricked into thinking
that there was a kind of, you know, this kind

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.620
of elbow gesture explosion of paint across
the canvas, but then when you realize how

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.510
linear these are and how parallel they are,
actually you realize that pretty soon we're

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.910
going to have drips going in all of these
different directions.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.560
So this time I'm just going to use a straight
black, which hopefully is going to look a

00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:01.610
little bit different than that black, a kind
of squarish shape that I just applied.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:10.420
Now, one thing, you know, you can probably
already realize here, it's almost silly to

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.029
say, is that this painting has changed a lot
really quickly.

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:16.720
De Kooning's paintings often, not always,
did this.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.820
And in general, this is a nice idea in the
studio not to fall in love too much with what

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.360
you've already done, but to always be willing
to risk that, to gamble that on a better painting

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.899
and a more interesting composition.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:32.600
But another approach that de Kooning did occasionally
use in his works is to work with enamel paint.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.690
Now enamel, different from the oils that we're
working with here, enamel is a household paint.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:43.380
In other words, it's coming out of a can like
this rather than a tube.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.830
And in the can, as you know from painting
your bedroom or your picket fence, you're

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.950
talking about some very fluid and usually
very opaque, very pigment-rich paint.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.980
It's also very fast paint.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.589
So it's the kind of thing that, again, like
some of the paints I've prepared here, really

00:15:57.589 --> 00:16:01.510
is great for action painting, Harold Rosenberg's
term here, brush strokes that really recall

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.160
the speed of the gesture with which they were
applied.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.779
Now, famously in Woman I here in the Moderns
Collection of 1950, in fact I worked on that

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:15.940
painting for 18 months, so I'm not exaggerating
here, that painting has a band of aluminum

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.300
enamel paint down the right-hand side.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.630
De Kooning often worked with black and white
and sometimes aluminum paint.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.529
I'm going to do something similar to that
here.

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:28.810
When working with enamels, make sure you give
them a good stir first because the pigment

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.720
tends to settle out towards the bottom in
kind of a sludge.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.700
And I'm going to reinforce the left margin
of the painting here with this aluminum and

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:51.930
we'll see what happens.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.920
So what this serves to do is to really push
the composition forward.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.490
This is a flattening device, and this is the
type of painting that I chose to pursue today,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.069
a more flat, spatially tight painting, and
that's a really nice device to do that.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.620
As we did last time, removing paint again
is a really important aspect of a de Kooning

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.660
process, and usually a de Kooning process
at any rate.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.679
However, when we remove paint today, it's
going to be quite different from how we did

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.199
that in the first part of this video.

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:23.500
Since before, I'm removing paint from, well,
nothing except a white priming with some charcoal

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500
on it.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.260
Here I'm going to be removing it from paint.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:37.790
So as I start to flay into this surface a
little bit, some interesting things are happening

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.180
here.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.299
First of all, I'm revealing some of the colors
from that under layer.

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:46.360
I'm also, as you saw, getting tripped up by
some of that impasto and I'm making these

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.250
unforeseen little skips in the paint film,
etc.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.250
And I like this.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.250
It's quite interesting.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.150
It is something that, again, I'm embracing
here as a painter.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.330
But it's a little bit unpredictable because
I've obliterated them.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:10.220
I don't know exactly where those bits of impasto
are.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:29.330
Now, again, de Kooning is often celebrated
for this very explosive moments of painting.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.830
And this really does look an explosion of
pink paint.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.290
To my eye, very beautiful, the way that this
paint is almost electrically cascading across

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.040
the surface here, these little zigzags, these
microscopic little blips of paint here and

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040
there.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.570
De Kooning is often celebrated for this kind
of work.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:49.179
But it's really important to understand that
far more than he's actually at the surface,

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:53.870
you know, hacking and slashing, if you will,
he's actually at a great distance and really

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.170
looking and really thinking about his paintings.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:01.230
So we could see that the paintings, the compositions
from a global perspective, from a great distance,

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.090
to really understand how the composition works.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.570
Rather than getting lost here in the trees,
so to speak, he's back looking at the forest.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.950
Well, I don't quite have the space to do that
here in Manhattan.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:13.950
Go figure.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.310
But already I can start to see there are some
interesting things.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.980
Some more cubist inflected things are happening
here.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.410
It's gotten a little bit...it's lost a little
bit of the dynamism or the action of the composition.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.570
And what do I mean by that?

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.720
Well, these shapes are very blocky and rectangular.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.470
Now, part of that is good because I'm really
tightening up the composition.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.600
Part of the point here is to understand what
the painting wants to do, not really what

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.830
you wanna do, what the hand wants to do, but
how can the composition grow?

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.830
What does it want?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:46.370
For me anyway, what it wants is to follow
this upward, break up that horizontal black

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.120
line, which is a little bit too graphic, a
little bit too flattening.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:56.290
And let's see what happens.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:05.450
Now, already what you can see because I'm
working with a light color over a dark color,

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:10.110
wet in wet, it does not have the legs at all
that that black did when I was working over

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.110
a light color.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.810
One trick here, if you wanna keep the yellowness,
don't push down so much.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.940
I was kind of scrubbing there.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.840
This next stroke, I'm going to apply the yellow
more lightly.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.880
So we're not really forcing those colors to
mix.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.880
So I'm going to keep a little bit more of
the yellow on the surface here.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.770
Now, it worked but what you can see there
is there's a lot more paint.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:37.010
So when in doubt, when there's too much color,
start scraping.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:47.900
I'm starting to realize that these two lines,
if you will, these two areas are roughly parallel

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.100
to each other, and I might wanna make that
a little bit more dynamic.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.500
I also might wanna start making more of a
relationship between this black square-ish,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.950
rectangle-ish kind of guy in this yellow zone
or space underneath.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.120
I'm going to choose to make a very fluid paint
here, and I'm going to use a really loud gesture

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.680
as I did in the pink there in a more horizontal
character.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.200
I have this nice kind of teal, aqua-ey, kind
of turquoise-y paint made up here.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.630
I'm going to add a little bit more oil to
it because this one I really wanna pop.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.910
I'm going to be using my elbow and wrist and
I really wanna make sure that the velocity

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.720
or the speed of that gesture is really translated
is really captured, if you will, kinetically

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.830
on the surface of painting.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.690
Okay.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:40.270
So there is a kind of Jackson Pollock type
gesture actually, a very loud, a very dynamic.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.350
It might be a little too much.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.090
It might be a little tacky, it might be a
little bit cheesy.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.090
In fact, the brush didn't even hit the canvas.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.260
I missed slightly.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.320
I like parts of this, but in here maybe it's
a little bit too much so, again, I can start

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:58.100
doing some editing.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.299
Nah.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:04.299
Sometimes this happens.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:08.360
I think that was a mistake because what happened,
I wanted to quiet down that part of that bluish

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.780
green color, but in fact what I did, I wasn't
thinking, I probably should have taken more

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:22.770
time, is I reinforced that edge of the black,
which is actually what I was trying to undo.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:28.419
Now that stroke was short and sweet, but it
actually changed a lot because suddenly this

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:33.710
background, which a minute ago we argued was
the farthest away from our eye, the one that's

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:38.860
really receding its space, suddenly I tangled
that background in with the foreground.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.350
Since this is physically on top of a lot of
those other really forward-thrusting kind

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.350
of planes.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.390
But I'm going to go back and, again, not take
it easy.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.400
I always choose the more challenging route.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.720
A very de Kooning kind of an idea here.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.040
So let's start working with another drawing
on the surface.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:01.100
In fact before we do that, let's make another
turn.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.530
So obviously I've torn the drawing here, making
a nice edge there.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.799
I've also pushed the painting or the drawing
up against the painting, vertically a little

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:16.790
bit to stretch or smear that paint, and I'm
roughly reinforcing again that band of silver

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.240
that I laid in there a few minutes ago.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:32.679
So let's do a little more drawing.

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:34.660
So I kept on, you know, breaking the surface
here.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.380
The reason to do that, breaking the surface
of the charcoal, this is soft vine charcoal

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.650
that I'm working with, to expose fresh charcoal.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.280
So I'm not taking the previous wet paint because
clearly the paint is still extremely wet,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:24:12.200
and I am pushing that paint around as much
as I am smearing the graphite around.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:32.590
Okay.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:52.990
Okay.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:57.350
So what you were just seeing there was me
fighting and fussing a little bit with the

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.881
upper portion of the composition trying to
get these, you know, enmeshed a little bit

00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:04.549
more and fussing about edges, a little bit
of that.

00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:06.990
Now, it's sort of working and it's sort of
not.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.210
I have some of these marks, which are still
a little bit hard.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.630
I do like some of this stuff though, some
evidence of where I was working over here,

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.800
but it's extended all the way over here.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.049
And again, this is because the paint is wet.

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:21.870
It's very fluid and this paint is really made
for a recording the traces of your own hand

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.490
as well as your own body.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:29.140
But again, for me, I'm still fussing up here,
and some of these effects, I don't really

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.140
like here.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:26:10.750
So again, removing paint is a great way to
start fixing things.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:47.690
Okay.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:54.130
So I think a good time to call it quits for
today, the painting has changed a ton, obviously.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.050
I think it's really grown forward.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.340
You might be thinking, "Well, what was the
point of all of that under painting if this

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.340
is where we're going?"

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.340
Two points.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.020
First of all, I didn't know that this was
where we're going.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.420
And then second of all, that under painting
is actually quite visible still in this work.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.299
You might be thinking, "What are you talking
about?"

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:14.610
Certain colors are really visible, but really
it's these scrape marks.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:21.090
It's these very uncontrolled, but really accepted
and not preconceived, but invited in other

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.980
words, marks to happen, which has everything
to do with not only the color, but the texture

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.559
of that under painting.

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:30.460
Now, the more you want that texture to play
up, the more scraping you're going to be doing,

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.059
or the more really fast painting that you're
going to be doing.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:35.950
Now, is this a finished painting?

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.789
Well, if I put on my de Kooning hat, definitely
no.

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:41.990
However, I think it could be a finished-ish
painting.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.110
Me personally, I would like this to dry.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.460
I'd like to have one more session, working
wet over dry.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.280
I was really fussing and laboring down here
and I'm still not really happy with it.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.799
I lost some of the geometry in the yellow
with the more muddy yellow I put in.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.420
This is still pretty murky and unresolved
down here.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.460
However, when it's really wet like this, it
becomes harder to clean it up and it becomes

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.480
harder to add space to it.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.919
One way you saw me try at the end there, Jackson
Pollock's way for adding space to a painting

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:10.220
is to add white to it.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.840
You can do that, or a light pink to it, with
a little explosion like that.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.419
However, if I really start trying to put in
a zone of white paint here, as you saw me

00:28:17.419 --> 00:28:19.361
try to do a couple of times, I'm going to
lose it.

00:28:19.361 --> 00:28:21.260
It's going to become quite murky.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.220
So I would probably plan to have at least
one more painting session here, tightening

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:31.039
up things with a little bit wet over dry technique,
but I think we are far more than halfway home

00:28:31.039 --> 00:28:32.860
here, or at least we could be.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.480
So at any rate, here we are with a de Kooning
type painting, de Kooning style painting,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.970
mixing and matching from a lot of different
periods of his career, working with a variety

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:48.690
of materials, methods, and getting us somewhere
reasonably close to the aesthetics of a Willem

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.250
de Kooning painting.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.400
For more of this kind of thing, definitely
check out the Coursera course that called

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.549
In the Studio: Postwar Abstract Painting.

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:59.680
And by the way, you know, there has been a
lot of interest here, we're going to continue

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.680
this series.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.680
A couple of things.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.909
So first of all, if there is another artist
or movement you'd like to see explored, drop

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:07.140
us that information down below in the comment.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.700
And the next one that we have scheduled for
sometime pretty soon is to attack Cubism.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.990
Cubism came up in today's conversation on
de Kooning, de Kooning absolutely thinking

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.400
about cubism in the 1940s and '50s.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.870
We're going to explore the work of Georges
Braque and Pablo Picasso and artists like

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:21.870
that.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.070
We are going to explore how to make a cubist
painting, but really how to look at a cubist

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.909
painting, how to think about it, and making
one I think is going to be a really interesting

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:30.270
way to help you do that.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.100
A pretty difficult movement from the early
20th century, but also absolutely one of the

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.940
20th century's most important movements.
