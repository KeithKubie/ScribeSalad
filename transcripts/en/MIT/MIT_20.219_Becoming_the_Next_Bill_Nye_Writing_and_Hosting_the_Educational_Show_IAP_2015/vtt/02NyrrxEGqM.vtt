00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:22.500
PROFESSOR: So for
today we're just

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.770
going to break you
guys up into groups.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.090
So Kenneth and Andrea, you
guys can work together today

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.730
for the rest of class.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.729
Paul, Ulea, and David.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.270
Since we have an
odd numbers, there's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.478
going to be a group of three.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:41.780
And then Nathan and Joshua,
you guys can film each other.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.100
And I know that you're
going to be a little bit

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.810
limited with locations today.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.780
So if you wanted to
film on location,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.730
you might not be able
to do that for today.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.744
But just get
comfortable with, like,

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:55.910
the movements of the camera,
incorporating the stuff

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.490
Chris talked about earlier.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.610
That's what we want
you guys to do today.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.760
And break!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.258
Go team!

00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:28.082
