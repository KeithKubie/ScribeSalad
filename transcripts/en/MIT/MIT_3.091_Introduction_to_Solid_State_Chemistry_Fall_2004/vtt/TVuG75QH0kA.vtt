00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.570
Just a few last remarks.
Last day we were intensively

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.140
looking at the structure and
properties of oxide glasses,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.710
and I just have a few remarks left
to make about that and then we will

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.280
move onto kinetics today.
Just a reminder, we saw that oxide

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.850
glasses typically consist of three
types of components,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.420
primarily network formers.
These are covalent oxides that form

00:00:47.420 --> 00:01:05.506
oxygen bridges between
the metal species.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:56.140
And we can tailor the nature of the
network by adding so-called

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
modifiers which are ionic oxides,
and they donate oxide ions. The

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.420
oxide ions go into the network and
they break the oxygen bonds in a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.560
process we call scission.
And then lastly in certain glasses

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.710
we add a compound of a type called
an intermediate.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
And these are actually network
formers, but they form a different

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:35.300
number of bonds than
the parent network.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Typically a larger number of bonds.
And, in doing so, they create some

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
free volume which enhances certain
properties, sometimes the mechanical

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
properties, sometimes the thermal
properties. Specifically,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
thermal shock resistance is enhanced
by the addition of network formers.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And, at the end of the lecture, we
had started talking about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
strengthening mechanisms.
And the way to strengthen oxide

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:48.880
glasses --
Remember, oxide glasses are not too

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
bad in compression but are very weak
in tension. And the way to

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.440
strengthen them is to pre-stress
compressively so that the effective

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.220
yield stress becomes then the sum of
the natural yield stress of the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.990
material, plus the compressive
stress that you have added to the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.770
material. And you don't have to
necessarily do this through the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.550
entire material.
Typically, we simply pre-stress the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
surface. Because,
let's face it, if something is going

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.110
to fail, it is going to fail through
the application of force causing the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:38.886
crack at the free surface.
If we can prevent the crack from

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:27.600
forming at the free surface this can,
in many instances,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.990
preserve the integrity of the object.
We saw the first way of improving

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.390
the strength of an oxide glass
called tempering.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.790
And that exploits differential
cooling so that if you look on this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.190
trace here, volume versus
temperature, we know that if we have

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.590
surface cooling at a high rate,
we will have a higher excess volume

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:09.446
than if we have cooling in the bulk
of the glass at a lower rate.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.200
And that leads to a differential in
volume which ultimately has a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.400
compressive stress on the surface.
There is another way to achieve the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.600
same goal, that is compressive
stress on the surface,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.800
and that involves a chemical
treatment. And,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.000
in particular, what we can do is
take the glass --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:19.370
And I am going to give a
representative composition here.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.740
Let's say we have a glass that
consists of, we will have a network

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.120
former, silica,
and a network modifier will be soda,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.490
sodium oxide, and we will throw in
an intermediate,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.870
alumina. This is a sodium
aluminosilicate glass.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.240
Former. Modifier. Intermediate.
And we know that the sodium ions

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.620
are present. The oxide ions have
gone into the network and have

00:03:45.620 --> 00:04:04.573
resulted in the formation of
terminal oxygens here.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:54.610
The sodiums are still free as sodium
ions. Let's take a look at the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.220
sodium ions at the surface of the
glass. Some of the surface sites

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.840
are going to be occupied by sodium
ions. What we can do is immerse

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.460
this glass into a molten salt at
elevated temperature.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.070
Typically, let's look at something
like potassium chloride.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.690
This melts at 775 centigrade,
so this might be sitting at 800

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.880
degrees C.
And, as a molten salt,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.640
it consists of potassium cations and
chloride anions.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.410
Take a look at this interface here.
On the left I have a high

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.170
concentration of sodium but no
sodium in the molten salt.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.930
In the molten salt, I have a high
concentration of potassium but no

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.700
potassium in the glass.
By virtue of the concentration

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.460
gradient, potassium will want to
enter the lattice and displace some

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.230
of the sodium and some of the sodium
will want to leave to enter the salt.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:05:06.793
Ions are soluble in
an ionic medium.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:57.450
What happens if a potassium ion
enters the glass and occupies a site

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.900
previously held by sodium?
Well, we know that the radius of

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.360
the potassium ion is substantially
larger than the radius of the sodium

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.810
ion. If potassium enters the glass,
it is going to be a force fit. This

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.270
means force fit.
And it is going to lead to the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:33.740
generation of compressive stress.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.200
And this is not too different from
what happens when you put carbon

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.400
into iron. The carbon is larger
than the interstitial site in iron.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.600
This treatment is called ion
exchange. By ion exchange,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.800
which is a chemical treatment,
we can also strengthen the glass and

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.000
thereby make it a little
more robust for use.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:57.300
I think that is a good place to stop
the treatment of glasses,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.610
and we may return a little bit later
in the semester.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.920
What I want to do now is start a
new unit. And the unit I want to

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.230
talk about today is a unit that
would be called,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.530
from the domain of physical
chemistry, I want to talk about

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.840
chemical kinetics.
And chemical kinetics is the study

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:31.880
of reaction rates and mechanisms.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.800
And this is very important for a
number of reasons.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.600
For that we discuss it in 3.
91. Let's talk about three reasons

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.400
that come to mind.
First of all, productivity.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.200
If we go into an industrial setting
and we want to improve throughput or

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.000
yield, we need to understand the
rates and mechanisms of reactions.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:55.460
This is linked to competitiveness,
it is linked to resource utilization,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.930
efficient use of materials and
energy if we know how to process

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.390
things effectively.
The second thing is environment.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.860
A number of you have come to me
after class and,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.330
on different occasions,
spoken of your interests in

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.790
environmental matters.
Well, one of the simplest things

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.260
one can do to minimize adverse
environmental impact of chemical

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.190
processes is to be efficient.
Understanding how reactions proceed

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:27.590
is critical in minimizing the
adverse environmental impact.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:33.990
Productivity issues. Secondly,
environmental issues. And, thirdly,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.390
societal issues ultimately. You are
here at MIT. You want to get an

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:46.790
analytical education and you want to
go out and do something

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.820
in the world.
And one of the things that can

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.460
happen, if you understand your
chemistry and understand the

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.110
kinetics, is you can keep a plant
operative, you can keep people

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.760
working. There are societal
implications for failure to

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.400
understand kinetics.
When a process becomes obsolete,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.050
you go out of business and people go
out of work. For these,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.700
and many other reasons, we want to
study kinetics.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.350
And kinetics takes place over a
very wide range.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:36.366
That is why I played the song about
time.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:25.230
That is what this is about.
It is about time. We have at the

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.460
one extreme very slow chemical
processes, and at the other extreme

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.700
very fast chemical processes.
Slow, we have things that take

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.930
place along geological or even
cosmic time scales.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.170
A very, very slow processes.
And, on the other extreme, we have

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.410
such things as explosions.
And explosions are not necessarily

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.640
destructive. For example,
in the airbag that operates in an

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.880
automobile, it operates thanks to
the fast kinetics of a

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:14.060
glass solid reaction.
There is no pump that can inflate an

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.500
airbag at an acceptably high rate to
do you any good in an automobile

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.500
crash. What happens here is the
kinetics of a reaction between two

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.500
solids. What we have is basically
solid plus solid goes to gas.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.500
And, as you know, the volume of a
gas is thousands of times

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:24.060
the volume of a solid.
And, in particular,

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.190
it is the reaction of sodium azide
with potassium nitrate.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.330
And one of the products is nitrogen
gas in huge quantities.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.460
You have your accelerometer which
decides that you are decelerating at

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.590
a rate that is alarmingly high.
It probably not a healthy occasion.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.730
A tiny electric current flows
through a wire which acts as the

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.860
trigger for this reaction.
Once the reaction goes, you can

00:09:48.860 --> 00:10:07.786
inflate the airbag in a
matter of milliseconds.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:57.710
What we want to do is understand
some of the basics of chemical

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:02.420
kinetics. We are going to look at a
general reaction and understand how,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.140
first of all, to characterize
chemical reactions.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.850
Let's characterize the rate of a
chemical reaction.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.570
I am going to write a.
Little a is stoichiometry and big A

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.280
is some chemical identity.
A moles of A plus b moles of B

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:40.426
react to form little c moles of C
plus little d moles of C.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That is sort of a prototypical
reaction. And kinetics accounts for

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000
the rate of conversion.
That is what we want to know.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000
How quickly are we consuming our
reactants?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:55.450
How quickly are we generating our
products? That is what we are

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.900
interested in understanding.
We have, first of all, a simple

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.360
thing. We have conservation of mass
operating, which we have seen from

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.810
the early part of 3.
91, that the rate of consumption of

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:17.270
all of the reactants must equal the
rate of production of

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:22.140
all of the products.
There are no sources or sinks.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.420
We have no wormholes here.
Everything that goes into the plant

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.710
has to come out of the plant in some
other way. And specifically we can

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.990
even get into looking at the rate of
disappearance of a single reactant.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.280
For example, the stoichiometry
would dictate that the rate at which

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.570
I consume a, this is one over a,
this is the pre-multiplier, times

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.850
the change in the concentration.
I apologize for the multiple fonts

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.300
here.
In this case, little c represents

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.920
the stoichiometry.
In this case, this represents

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.530
concentration of A.
The rate of change of concentration

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.150
of A, the rate of its disappearance.
When it is normalized for mole

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.760
number would be the same as the rate
of appearance of D,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.380
so d by dt of the concentration of D.
We have these individual

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:34.093
relationships.
This is simply conservation of mass.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We have that. And now comes the
interesting point of kinetic theory.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
What kinetic theory says is that
there is a relationship between the

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000
instant rate of consumption of a
product and its concentration.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In other words, we essentially say
that concentration of a reactant is

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.600
the driving force for reaction.
Let's say in terms of a word

00:12:38.600 --> 00:13:03.800
equation, the rate of change of
concentration of any species,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:23.000
this is the concentration of some
species i, is proportional to the

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.200
instant concentration.
And that makes sense. If you have

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.400
a lot of a substance,
it is going to have a high chemical

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.000
potential to react.
If you have a dilute concentration

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
of a substance,
it will have a weak propensity to

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
react. But it is not a linear
relationship. It is some

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
power-based relationship.
We have to say raised to some power.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Conceptually,
that is what is going on.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Now we can write this in
mathematical formulation.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Let's say we are looking at the
rate of consumption,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
so that is d by dt of some
concentration of species i.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:56.830
I am going to say it is proportional
to the concentration of species i,

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.660
it is raised to some power, and this
n is now the order of reaction.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.490
You have seen n used so many times
in 3.091. It was a quantum number

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.330
in the Bohr model.
It was an index of refraction.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.160
It was in the Born repulsion.
Today it is functioning as the order

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:34.186
of reactions. N is a very
talented variable.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:25.220
It is not typecast in a simple role
is what I am saying.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.440
Now, how do I take a
proportionality and turn it into an

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.660
equality? I put in a constant of
proportionality.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.880
And that constant of
proportionality is called the

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:49.893
specific chemical rate constant.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:53.330
And these have to be determined by
experiment. You cannot look at the

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.660
stoichiometry of a reaction and
infer what the order of reaction is.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:15.853
These must be determined by
experiment.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:15:13.070
Let's look at that first equation

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:19.230
and write it in its most general
form. What you could say is that

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:25.380
the rate of change of concentration
of species A goes as some constant

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.530
times the concentration of species A
to some arbitrary power alpha,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:37.690
but it may be influenced by some
other concentration.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:43.840
To be most general, we say
concentration of species B raised to

00:15:43.840 --> 00:16:02.213
some power times the concentration
of species C raised to some power.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:54.280
You might say,
well, how can the concentration of

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.570
species C have any influence on the
rate of consumption of species A?

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.850
Well, what if species C acts in
some way as an inhibitor to the

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.140
reaction? As the concentration of
the product goes up,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.420
it could actually choke off the
reaction. To be general,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.710
we will put all four in here.
And we will call these alpha,

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:34.886
beta, gamma and delta all partial
orders of reaction.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:24.280
To be determined experimentally.
And, by the way, they do not have

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.570
to be integers.
They are not necessarily integer.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.850
You can have something that is
half-order or one third-order

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:37.140
reaction, not necessarily integer
values. Let's look at one.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.420
Here is a simple reaction.
Unfortunately,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.710
it is a little bit toxic.
This is carbon monoxide plus

00:16:45.710 --> 00:17:04.486
chloride which will react
to generate phosgene.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:54.280
COCl2 is phosgene.
I have worked with this stuff in my

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.570
research. Actually,
it has a fantastic ability to

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.850
desiccate material.
If you have a solid that has a

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.140
parts per million residual water,
if you expose it to phosgene,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.420
phosgene will attack the water,
generating carbon dioxide and HCl.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.710
It is very good. Unfortunately, it
was also used in gas warfare during

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:34.953
World War I. It is now banned by
international treaty.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:26.400
On the basis of experimental
evidence, we know that the rate of

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:44.266
consumption of carbon monoxide in
this reaction is related to the

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:19.200
concentration of carbon monoxide
linearly and the concentration of

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:45.600
chlorine to the power of
three-halves based on experiment.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:18:03.533
We would say that this reaction is
first-order in carbon monoxide.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:57.280
Because there is a linear
relationship between the rate of

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.560
consumption of carbon monoxide and
the concentration.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.850
This is C to the power one,
but we don't write the one. It is

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:13.140
of order 1.5 in chlorine.
Or, we could say wholly or entirely

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.420
of order 2.5. That gives you a
sense of how the rate of

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.710
disappearance of one constituent can
depend on not just its own

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:40.953
concentration but other
concentrations.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:32.660
Clearly, if we are trying to build a
plant to make phosgene,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.330
we now have a quantitative measure
of how to improve the rate of

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:39.990
throughput. Suppose somebody says
we would like to build a plant that

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.660
produces so many tons per year,
well, you know what your limitations

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.330
are in terms of concentration so you
can figure out what you would have

00:18:47.330 --> 00:19:06.393
to do in a quantitative
predictive manner.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:54.410
Well, there is another way we can
improve the yield.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.820
What is another way to improve
yield in a reaction?

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.230
Instead of increasing concentration,
we can increase temperature.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.640
We know that materials tend to
react more quickly with one another

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.050
at elevated temperature.
Where is the elevated temperature

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.460
going to fit into this equation?
I don't see any temperature term.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.880
Temperature must be buried in the
rate constant.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.290
And that is where we are going to
go. We are going to look inside the

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.330
rate constant.
We will increase yield by increasing

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.990
temperature. And that was known for
many, many years,

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.660
but it was finally the Swedish
chemist Arrhenius who in 1889

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.330
announced the relationship that
bears his name.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.990
What he found was that the
relationship between the specific

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.660
rate constant and temperature was
exponential through an

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.300
equation of this form.
Exponential of the ratio of some

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.920
energy, which he termed the
activation energy,

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.530
divided by the product of the
Boltzmann constant and temperature

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:04.150
and a pre-exponential factor which
we write as A in honor of Arrhenius.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.760
Or, another way you can write it in
this manner, A e to the minus Ea

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.380
over k Boltzmann T.
So there is the relationship.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:32.826
And another way of showing it is to
put it on a semi log plot.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:22.460
If you plot the natural logarithm of
the rate constant as a function of

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.920
the reciprocal of the absolute
temperature, you will find that,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.380
according to this equation, you
should get a straight line.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.840
One over T is increasing from left
to right so high temperature is on

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.300
the left side,
and this should be linear with a

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.760
slope of minus Ea,
which is the activation energy,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.920
divided by the Boltzmann constant.
And just to give you a sense of

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.780
order of magnitude,
the activation energy for typical

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:01.640
chemical reactions is on the order
of about one electron volt,

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.490
which is on the order of about 100
kilojoules per mole.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:13.350
If you take this and choose an
arbitrary rate for room temperature,

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:19.210
plug in the value of 100 kilojoules
per mole, what you can show yourself

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:25.070
is that with this activation energy
you double the rate for every ten

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.690
degrees rise above room temperature.
Obviously this breaks down for large

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.070
excursions in temperature.
But in the vicinity of room

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.460
temperature, if you have an
activation energy,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.840
you typically have about a one
electron volt,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.220
you can expect to double for every
ten degrees. What is the physical

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.610
meaning of activation energy?
Well, I thought I would try to show

00:21:46.610 --> 00:22:05.953
it to you in terms of
a mechanical analog.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:54.300
What I am going to do here is show
you what we can say is going to be,

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.610
say, a loudspeaker. What I have
done by putting the x on the

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.920
loudspeaker at the intersection of
the x is we will say that that is

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.230
the center of mass of the
loudspeaker. The loudspeaker is now

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.530
in a gravitational field.
And we can argue that I could

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.840
represent this as a point of zero
dimension at this height

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.130
off the table.
Now, clearly, if I lay this on its

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.390
side, the point has fallen.
It is now at a lower gravitational

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.660
potential. Really,
if the box had its way,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.930
the box would prefer to lie on its
side. How come the box doesn't just

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.190
fall on its side?
Why doesn't the box just lie on its

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.460
side? See, it is a decrease in
energy when I do that.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.730
Did you see the photon?
It is absorbed. Now look at it go.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:23:03.860
Why doesn't the box fall on its
side?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:53.880
Well, this is a box at zero Kelvin.
Now let's put the box at room

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.760
temperature. What is happening at
room temperature?

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.640
Well, the box is doing this at room
temperature. Even so,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.520
the box won't fall on its side.
Why? Because, in order for the box

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.410
in three space to go from the
vertical upright locked position to

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.290
the supine position,
what must the box do?

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.170
The box must first rise up on one
corner. And only when it rises up

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:21.050
on one corner and gets to this cusp
does it have the ability

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.070
to fall freely.
What we are looking at,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.210
in terms of gravitational potential,
is activation. I can now give you

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.350
the same thing.
I could plot this as extent of

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.490
reaction on the abscissa and some
energy relative to gravitational

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.630
potential on the ordinate,
and I have three positions here.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.780
I have the box in the vertical
position, I have the box in the

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.920
horizontal position and,
clearly, there is a decrease in

00:23:49.920 --> 00:24:07.706
energy.
This change is the delta E of the

00:23:34.800 --> 00:24:00.390
reaction, but the box cannot get to
the right position from the left

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.990
position without first rising up on
its side. It must,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:11.590
at some point, rise up on its side.
And when it rises up on its side

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:17.190
its center of mass has risen,
and this energy is the activation

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:34.346
energy.
That is the mechanical analog.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.500
The delta E reaction, this is the
driving force for the reaction in

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.500
the first place.
And Ea, in fact,

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.500
is the gatekeeper.
It determines the rate of reaction

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.500
because, on the basis of Ea,
Ea mediates the rate constant.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.500
So, all other things being equal,
temperature gives you the rate

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:51.810
constant through Ea.
And now we will recall the other

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.430
temperature effect.
You say, gee, how does any of this

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.060
stuff happen? You know that room
temperature energy is typically on

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.680
the order of about one-fortieth of
an electron volt,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.300
and I just told you that chemical
reactions have activation energies

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.930
on the order of one electron volt.
According to that, we would have to

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.560
be up at thousands of degrees
centigrade in order to promote any

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.180
chemical reactions.
How do we get chemical reactions at

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.410
200, 300 degrees centigrade?
What we have going on is the

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:26.240
distribution of energies.
And I will go back to that plot we

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.080
saw earlier. Here is T1.
Here is the average energy at T1.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.910
And out here is one electron volt,
or whatever it happens to be, the

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.740
activation energy.
And so only the fraction of the

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.580
population that has greater than the
activation energy is able to

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.450
participate in the reaction.
And we have seen before the measure

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.360
of the area under this curve from Ea
out to infinity is given by the

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.270
relationship Ea,
k Boltzmann T, exponential of which.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:05.170
And so it was Boltzmann who first
gave us this understanding,

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:10.080
then Maxwell gave us the
distribution and away we go.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:28.960
What happens by changing
temperature, we have seen before.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
When we change temperature,
the curve moves ever so slightly so

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
that the average energy at T2,
where T2 is greater than T1, moves a

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
little bit. But what happens up
here is the area under the curve

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
between Ea and infinity goes up by
large leaps and bounds.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And that is how, by modest
increases in temperature,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
we are able to get substantial
increases in the rate of reaction.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Now let's look at some specific
reactions of various common orders.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:55.830
I am going to look at first-order
which is the most common,

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:01.660
and then I am going to look at
second-order. Let's look at

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.490
first-order reactions.
Here is an example. The example is

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:13.330
N2O5 decomposes to give us NO2 plus
O2. There is the stoichiometry of

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:19.160
the reaction, but on the basis of
measurements in the laboratory we

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:36.520
can write that the rate of
consumption of N2O5 --

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:29.140
The square brackets denote
concentration.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.280
It is found to be linear in
concentration of N2O5,

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.420
or N2O5 raised to the first power.
This we say is a first-order

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.560
reaction. And I am getting tired of
writing N2O5 bracket,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.710
bracket, so I am just going to write
c. C represents all of this.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.850
I am compressing the font. I am
going to rewrite this equation as

00:27:49.850 --> 00:28:08.366
minus dc by dt equals
kc. **-dc/dt = kc**

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:58.300
That is a first-order reaction.
Why? Because this is a one. That

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.610
is why it is first-order.
It is linearly dependent.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.920
The rate of change you see is
linearly dependent on concentration.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.230
I do a little bit of calculus here.
I can invert this,

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:15.530
and I can then write minus dc over c
equals k dt. And what we are going

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.840
to is integrate this thing out so
that we can get the

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.150
timeline on this.
And so I can put an integration sign

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.460
here. K is independent.
We can do that. And I am going to

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.760
start at time zero where I have some
initial concentration and go to some

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.070
arbitrary concentration c and
arbitrary time t.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.380
What I am going to look at is this.
This is some initial concentration

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.690
versus time. We know all of these
things are going to attenuate.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:29:05.113
I want to know what this curve
really, really looks like.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:53.410
And I know some of you are sitting
there wincing saying that because

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.820
your math professors have told you
that you cannot make the limits of

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.230
an integral the same as the value of
the integrand.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.640
I don't want to go to math jail,
so we will put little tildes over

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.050
this so that all the math weenies
are happy here.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.460
But what I could do to really make
it pedantic is - let's not do that.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.880
Let's use a carrier variable. I
will make this s,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.290
which now you don't know what I am
talking about, and I

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:21.330
will make this c.
And that is mathematically beautiful.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.990
It does not explain what we are
talking about so I am going to go

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.660
back and put the c with a little
tilde over it so everybody now is

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.330
happy. This is t with a little
tilde. And if we integrate this

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.990
thing out what do we get?
We get that the natural log of c

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.660
goes as the natural log of the
initial concentration c naught minus

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:49.330
kt. What I am talking about is the
way that I can determine what the

00:29:49.330 --> 00:30:08.860
order of reaction is is to look at
the functional shape of this.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:58.330
In other words,
whether it is first-order,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.660
second-order or 2.5-order, they all
look like this,

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.990
the curves. What I really need to
do is, what the I is capable of

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:11.330
doing is detecting something simple
like straight line.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.660
If I am cleaver about it,
if I take instead of c versus t,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:33.786
if instead I map this into
functional.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:23.870
I map c into some function of c and
I map t into some function of t,

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.740
that is embedded in the physical
chemistry of the process so that f

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.620
of c should be a linear function of
g of t, whether it is this or

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.490
whether it this.
Then I can inspect and say that

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.370
looks linear. Therefore,
the assumptions that underlie those

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.240
functions must be what is going on.
And that is the way we determine

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.120
order of reaction.
One other reaction I want to give

00:30:47.120 --> 00:31:05.640
you, even though it
is not chemistry.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:57.800
I still want you to understand,
this falls under the rubric of

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:04.600
general culture,
that radioactive decay obeys

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:11.400
first-order kinetics.
Let's just take note of that.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:28.933
Radioactive decay is first-order.
For example, here is a reaction.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:05.000
U-238 can decompose to give
thorium-234 plus helium.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:31.250
And if we plot concentration of
uranium as a function of time,

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:49.266
starting with some initial value c
naught, we will just have this

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:43.750
attenuation. But if we map it into
the natural log of c versus time,

00:31:43.750 --> 00:32:02.033
we will get a straight line, and the
slope here will give us minus k.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:53.750
And we know that this is n equals
one because, if you see a plot of

00:31:53.750 --> 00:32:13.800
natural log of concentration as a
function of temperature,

00:31:37.500 --> 00:32:01.250
if it is a straight line,
bingo, that tells you that this must

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:20.966
be first-order and the slope of that
line is minus k.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:32:08.750
Now, it turns out that people that
work in radioactive decay do not

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:29.400
like to express the rate of reaction
in terms of the rate constant.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:32:16.250
They prefer to use a different
quantity called the half-life.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:35.166
The half-life is a little more
practical.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
It is more directly obvious what it
is related to.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
The half-life is basically what you
get if you take this equation here

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
and plug in c naught over two.
It is the time it takes to consume

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
half of the reagent that is present.
If I start with c naught and I plug

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
in c naught over two and solve for
time that is going to give me the

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
half-life. And if you do that you
will end up with t to the one-half

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
is equal to the natural log of two,
which is 0.693 over k.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:59.540
The half-life is inversely
proportional to the rate constant

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.080
and mediated by the natural log of
two. And it turns out for this

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.630
reaction, the half-life,
t one half for this reaction is 4.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:13.180
billion years. If you spill this
into the sandbox at the neighborhood

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.720
park, it is going to be a while
before you can go back

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.610
there and play.
It will take you 4.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.830
billion years just to get the
concentration down to half of what

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.050
it is, and then 9 billion years will
get it down to a quarter,

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.270
etc. And the nice thing about
half-life, and the only time I would

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:34.490
ever ask you to calculate half-life
is in connection with first-order

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.720
reactions. Because only for
first-order reactions is half-life

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.940
independent of concentration.
For every other order of reaction

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.160
the half-life is a function of
concentration in which case it is a

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.380
useless quantity,
except to perhaps professors of

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.460
chemistry.
We will not ask you for this except

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.380
in the case of first-order.
T one-half independent of

00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:01.300
concentration for n equals one.
You can prove to yourself, for

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.220
higher order, how the half-life
varies with concentration.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.150
I said that would look at the other,
which is second-order reactions,

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:16.070
and here is an example. It is
dimerization of aluminum trichloride.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:34.206
Aluminum trichloride can
form the dimer Al2Cl6.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:25.460
This is gas phase.
And right off the bat I am going to

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.920
let c be the concentration of
aluminum trichloride.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.380
And it is second-order because the
rate of disappearance of aluminum

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.840
trichloride goes as the square.
Now, this is one of those instances

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.300
where it is really tempting because
this reaction has a two in front of

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.760
it. And it turns out that the rate
of disappearance of aluminum

00:34:47.760 --> 00:35:06.853
trichloride goes as kc squared.
But do not, do not,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I am going to say it three times,
do not assume that this is the rule

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
that because you saw it once that
this is always the case that the

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
stoichiometry gives you the order of
reaction. This is not the general

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
case. It happens in this reaction
for reasons that we will go into

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
later, but generally you have to
measure the order of reaction.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And so if we go through the same
analysis we will have minus dc over

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
c squared equals k dt.
We will do the integration.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:25.630
Eventually, we end up with this
relationship. The reciprocal of

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:31.270
concentration is a linear function
of time. That means the functional

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:36.900
that we need is given here.
The way to determine if something

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:42.540
is second-order or not is to take
this ordinary time line,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:48.180
concentration versus time,
which is always going to look like

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:52.930
this.
To the naked eye you are going to

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.790
say I don't know if that is
first-order or second-order,

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.660
but I can detect a straight line.
Instead, if I map this into one

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.530
over c versus time,
I should end up with a straight line

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.390
starting at one over c naught.
And the slope of that line should

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:12.260
be k. When I see that this is a
straight line,

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.130
I go n equals two.
And the slope is the rate constant.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:36.393
If this were not second-order, I
would not get a straight line.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:25.450
This allows me to proceed and get
the order of reaction.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:30.900
And, in fact, what I am showing you
is one of the ways people determine

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.360
order of reaction.
They use the integrated form of the

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.810
rate equation.
And so this is called the integral

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:47.270
method to determine order of
reaction. Determination

00:36:47.270 --> 00:37:04.640
of order of reaction.
The first way is integral method.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:40.500
And it is essentially a comparison
with the integrated form

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:50.000
of the rate law.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:13.660
Integrated rate law equation.
This is really inspection. This is

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.330
trial and error,
but we don't say trial and error

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:36.793
because we are from MIT so
we use fancier words.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:24.370
We say by inspection.
That is how you tell a boss you

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.740
don't know what you are doing.
We really have to do this by

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.120
inspection, sir.
What I do is I try n equals one.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.490
If I get an arbitrary data set, I
try n equals one,

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.870
I try n equals two,
and after that I say forget it and I

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.240
am going to go to the other method.
Let me show you a couple of slides

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.620
that indicate this.
Here is a data set.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:38:05.506
I pulled this out of some book.
This is a reaction. This is time.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:52.140
This is the concentration of some
species. And don't worry about that.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.280
We will get to that in a second.
Here is your data set. This is all

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.420
you have. And if you plot these,
here is what they look like. This

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.560
is concentration in moles per unit
volume as a function of time.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.710
And there is c naught normalized to
one unit, and it is attenuating.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.850
It is over 500 seconds, we are down
to about 20% of the initial value.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:32.433
I say what is the order of reaction?
Well, I cannot tell.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
What I am going to do is say now
let's take natural log of c versus

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
time. Bingo, straight line.
On this basis, I conclude that it

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
is a straight line.
And the slope of this line is the

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
rate constant.
But just to show you that it

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
doesn't always work,
I said just for grins and chuckles,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
plot that same data set as one over
c. And look what happens.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
When I plot it as one over c,
I don't get a straight line, so it

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:49.260
really does discriminate.
It does not give me what I was going

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.790
to expect in terms of a straight
line, except when I have the proper

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:58.330
order of reaction.
Now let's see another way that we

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.860
can get at this,
and this is called the differential

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.390
method. We are not going to use the
integrated form of the rate equation.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.930
We will use the differential form.
And, to compress the notation, I am

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.460
going to let lower case r be the
rate. The rate is lower case r

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:35.120
which I am going to let stand
for minus dc by dt.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:25.660
See how I get my fonts more and more
compressed? I start with the big

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.330
square brackets,
then I get to this and now I get to

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.990
this. It is getting tighter and
tighter. Now I can write the rate

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:39.660
equation as the rate goes as kc to
the n. There is the arbitrary rate

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:44.330
equation. And now what I am going
to do is take the logarithm of the

00:39:44.330 --> 00:40:03.326
equation. I can map that into the
logarithm of the rate.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:54.070
The log of a product is the sum of
the log, so that will be the

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:59.150
logarithm of the rate constant plus
n times the logarithm of

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:04.220
concentration.
Now what I can do is start with

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:09.300
concentration as a function of time.
We know it starts at some value c

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.380
naught and attenuates.
Now I am going to plot the slope,

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.460
the rate of consumption, not as a
function of time but as a function

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.800
of concentration.
Here is the initial concentration.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.400
This is going to represent the
slope r naught,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:49.266
which is equal to minus dc by dt at
time t naught when concentration

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:41.600
equals c naught.
I am going to end up with a data

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.190
pair r naught and c naught.
And, ultimately, here is what I

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:52.900
want to do.
I might want to make this plot of

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:58.700
log of the rate versus log of the
concentration.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.490
I have my first data pair,
r naught, c naught, and go over here.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:10.290
And then some arbitrary time later,
here is t naught, here is t1. At t1,

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:16.090
I take the slope,
so this is now slope r1 which is

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:21.140
minus dc by dt at t1.
And now the concentration is equal

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.420
to some new value c1.
This was c naught. This is c1.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.710
Now I am taking the data pairs r1,
c1. I take that and they go over

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:33.990
here. Let's do one more because I
am having so much fun.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:38.280
This is t2 and here is c2.
The concentration has dropped to c2.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.570
I take the slope r2,
blah, blah, blah, c2. And so I take

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:46.850
that and will put it over here.
I am going to end up with a

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:52.090
straight line.
If you don't get a straight line in

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:58.290
a log-log plot you are an idiot.
You are working with chemical

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:04.490
systems. I mean log-log linearizes
everything. What do I have here?

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:10.690
I have a straight line, log r
versus log c. The slope is n,

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:16.890
the order of reaction. And what is
this intercept?

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:22.180
The value of the intercept is log k.
Superb. I did that with the same

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.560
data set. What I did is I went back.
Here is the rate.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.930
I took the rates by taking the
delta c over delta t.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:35.300
I went down the curve,
differentiated. Those are my rates.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.680
And now here is log r versus r c.
Straight line.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.050
And it has a slope of one.
So? In fact, the least squares

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:48.430
gives me 1.018.
It allows for a little bit of

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:52.810
variation in experimental
measurement, and it gives

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:57.540
me a straight line.
This is the differential method for

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.630
determining the rate of reaction.
Well, I said we can increase

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:07.720
productivity by increasing
concentration.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.810
We are going to increase
productivity by increasing

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.900
temperature. But there is another
way we can increase productivity.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:36.600
And the way we can do that is by
modifying the value of k.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:28.800
I am showing you how to do it by
playing with temperature.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.590
There is another way to modify the
value of k, modify the value of

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:40.390
activation energy.
And we do that by the use of a

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:46.190
catalyst. Increase rate via
catalyst. And what the catalyst

00:43:46.190 --> 00:44:03.846
does is decreases the activation
energy for reaction.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:58.220
And, by decreasing the activation
energy, all other things being equal,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:04.440
same concentration,
same temperature, therefore,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:10.660
that means it increases k at given
temperature. The way we can view

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:16.880
the catalyst as working is the
following. If I plot this energy

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.050
versus extent of reaction.
This is the reactants at some energy

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.170
arbitrarily denoted as shown.
And the products have to be at a

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:30.290
lower energy. If the products are
not at a lower energy than the

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.410
reactants, there is no driving force
for the reaction in the first place,

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.520
but we know we have to go up to some
activated state in order to get up

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:42.640
to the corner of the box,
so to speak. Here we are.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.760
This is the energy state of the
reactants, this is the energy state

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.880
of the products,
but we have to invest this amount of

00:44:50.880 --> 00:45:09.626
energy in order to allow
for the throughput.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
This is activation energy.
What a catalyst does is it reduces

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
the level of activation needed by
assisting with some kind of a

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
physical process such as adsorbing
gas molecules so that they can find

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
each other more readily and react.
This is catalyzed. This is Ea.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And now this one here
is Ea catalyzed.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:25.800
The catalyst reduces the activation
energy. And the result is,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:31.590
if we go over to this curve,
n(E) versus E, we still have the

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:37.390
same temperature distribution.
We have not changed that. If this

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:43.190
is the activation energy as stated
for the reaction in the presence of

00:45:43.190 --> 00:46:02.046
the catalyst, the catalyst reduces
the activation energy, Ea catalyzed.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:53.420
Therefore, the area under the curve
is much, much greater under the

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:57.850
influence of catalysis.
And, while we are in the

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.280
neighborhood, there are other actors
that can increase the activation

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.710
energy. That is up here.
This is Ea under the influence of

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:11.140
an inhibitor. And sometimes we want
inhibitors. What is an inhibitor?

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.570
An inhibitor is going to raise the
activation energy.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:34.806
Now the area under the curve is
even smaller. Inhibited.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:24.370
For example, a catalyst we want in
order to improve productivity such

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:28.740
as conversion of pollutants in
automotive exhaust.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.120
We want to increase the
productivity. But an inhibitor,

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.490
we want to put in to slow down an
undesirable reaction such as to

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:41.870
reduce the rate of corrosion in your
coolant. It flows through the

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:46.240
radiator and engine block.
There are chemicals that are added

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.620
to inhibit the corrosion processes
that are undesirable for the

00:46:50.620 --> 00:47:08.840
long-term maintenance
of the automobile.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:59.660
We see how there is a relationship
between the catalysis,

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.330
inhibition and the energy available
to drive a reaction.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:08.990
Let's see what we have up here for
five minutes today.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:13.660
Radiocarbon dating.
This is from Willard Libby who got

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.330
the Nobel Prize in 1960.
In the upper atmosphere,

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:37.526
under the influence of cosmic rays,
neutrons are generated.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:26.850
And the neutrons react with nitrogen
to form carbon 14.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.710
And we know that carbon 14 is
present in about one part per

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:34.560
trillion. This is now part of the
carbon cycle down here,

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.420
all the carbon atoms in all living
things. Because we are constantly

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.280
exchanging carbon with our
surroundings, take any carbon atom

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.140
out of any one of us and we will
have dominantly carbon 12,

00:47:46.140 --> 00:48:05.880
about 1% carbon 13 and one part per
trillion carbon 14.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:54.280
But when we die,
we stop exchanging with the

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.570
surroundings. In fact,
if you were looking for a new

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:02.850
euphemism for death,
instead of saying "he passed away",

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.140
you could say "he exited the carbon
cycle." He is no longer playing.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.420
So, upon death, we stop exchanging.
We start at one part per trillion

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.710
when we die, and then this reaction
takes place. The carbon 14 decays

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:35.086
radioactivity to nitrogen plus beta.
It is a beta decay.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:23.620
And so if we measure the ratio of
carbon 14 to carbon 12,

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.240
knowing the half-life is 5730 years,
we can figure out how long it has

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.870
been since we checked out of the
carbon cycle. These are some things

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.490
that have been carbon dated.
There are some things that have

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.120
been looked at over time.
One of the assumptions is that the

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.740
rate of neutron generation and
carbon 14 generation has not changed

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.370
over, let's say,
the last 10,000 to 15,

00:48:45.370 --> 00:49:06.140
00 years, which is really a blink of
an eye by cosmic measurements.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:53.760
Here are some things that have been
dated. The Dead Sea scrolls came in

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.530
at about 1,917 years back from today,
but with uncertainty,

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:03.300
plus or minus 200. This is Mount
Mazama that erupted in Oregon and

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:08.070
made Crater Lake.
It quenched some trees.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:12.840
The charcoal from those trees comes
in at 6453 from today.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.610
The charcoal from the cave painting
in Lascaux in France dates

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:21.720
back 15,516 years.
That is the kind of stuff that you

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.160
see. Here is one that is quite
controversial,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.610
and we are not strangers to
controversy. This is the Shroud of

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:32.050
Turin. This is a painting showing
what is to be the burial shroud of

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:35.490
Christ. It shows the two images
that it is supposed to have.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:38.940
This is how the shroud would have
been. It is a linen piece about 14

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.380
feet long. This is from a National
Geographic Article of about six,

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.830
seven years ago showing various
features on the shroud.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.270
This is the shroud and this is the
painting, just to give you a sense

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:53.070
of what is supposed to be there.
And so in the mid ‘80s fragments of

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:57.210
that shroud were sent to three
different laboratories in three

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:01.350
different countries,
and the fabric was dated to come

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.490
from this interval of about 1260 to
1390. This shows the cartoon of

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:09.640
cosmic rays generating carbon 14
which goes into flax.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.780
Once we pick the flax and make
linen, it is out of the carbon cycle.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.920
And these are going out like twink
lights. Then you can calculate the

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:36.773
various things.
This is very hotly contested.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Some people are ardent believers.
They believe that the data that

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
were gathered were false because
there was a fire in 1532.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Here is a painting showing people
repairing the shroud using candles.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
And there are arguments that there
is paraffin from the candles that is

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
coating the outer surface of the
filaments. In fact,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
you are analyzing the carbon from
the paraffin that was observed on

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
the filament. It is all about
sampling. Very interesting.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.500
If you get on the Internet,
you will find all kinds of stuff on

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.000
there about it.
There is a question,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.500
how do you do the test?
You know the way to do it properly

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.000
is to take the whole thing,
put it in a giant blender so you are

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.500
not looking at surface effects.
This is the problem, how to do

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.900
nondestructive evaluation of an
artifact. I will see you on Friday.
