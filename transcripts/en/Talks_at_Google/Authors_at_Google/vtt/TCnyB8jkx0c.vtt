[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.142 --> 00:00:07.350
SPEAKER: So welcome everyone.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.516
Thank you so much for coming
to The Teaching Kitchen

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:10.820
today for "Food Talks."

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.820
So today we have a
very special guest.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.250
Michelle McKenzie's here to
talk about her brand new book,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.324
"Dandelion &amp; Quince,"
her first one.

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:21.740
Do you want to speak a little
bit about yourself before we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.921
get started with the demo?

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:24.920
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Sure.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.340
So I am working on my
second cookbook now.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.310
This one actually came
out almost a year ago now.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.846
I'm in the process of working
on my second cookbook.

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:36.470
But before I got into
food and cooking,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.550
I was actually a nutrition
and biochemistry major

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.080
at UNC Chapel Hill
studying fat enzymes,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.240
and was really fascinated
with food and healing

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.390
and how food really
affects the body.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.820
And so I went to culinary
school in New York City,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.025
and went to a
school that actually

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:53.900
specialized a little
bit in food and healing.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.275
They taught you
French technique,

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:59.000
but they also taught about
Chinese medicine and Ayurveda

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.120
and the Eastern
view of nutrition--

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.705
after I got the Western view.

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:07.030
And I still thought I was
going back to school to do--

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.000
I had taken MCATs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.880
I thought I was going
to go do either research

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.080
or go to med school.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.600
And then I worked at this
amazing restaurant in New York

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.860
and just never looked back.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.110
And worked in restaurants
for many years,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.264
became a private chef.

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:21.680
And then I started
teaching people

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.470
at a place called the Cancer
Wellness Center in Atlanta

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.830
and fell in love with teaching.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.320
And I've been teaching in
some capacity ever since.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.429
And I just left my full-time
job recently as the Director

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:34.970
of a culinary school
in San Francisco

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.470
to work full time
on my second book.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.950
I wrote this book while running
a cooking school and teaching.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.075
SPEAKER: That's impressive.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.283
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: And I
don't want to do that again.

00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:45.020
I did it, and I felt
like Superwoman,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.060
and then I fell apart and put
myself back together again.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.920
And now I'm going to keep
it a little bit more sane

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.570
this time around.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.240
But yeah, I'm excited to
talk to you about this book.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.260
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.140
Well, what are you
cooking for us today?

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.030
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: So we're
making two seasonal recipes,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.190
two things that happen to be--

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.840
these are recipes
that are really

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.580
great for the
transition from summer

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.210
to fall, which
we're in right now.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.570
And we also picked two
that are vegetarian--

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.690
actually, vegan.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.220
Well, except for some Feta.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.390
And you can leave that off
if you don't want cheese.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.740
So the first one we're doing
is a watermelon and cucumber

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.280
salad.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.290
And I'm going to show
you the photo in the book

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.010
because the original recipe
is in the sprouts chapter.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.810
And it's on page 241, if
you guys want to look.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.790
And so we're not
using sprouts today,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.249
because there is a little bit
of concern about sprouts--

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.790
that they're not
handled really well.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.873
If you buy sprouts from a
farmer's market, freshly

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:47.350
sprouted, or you sprout them at
home, they're perfectly safe.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.950
But today we're
using watercress,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.140
which I mention in the
recipe as a good substitute.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.360
And watercress is also a
bit of an unsung vegetable.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.420
It has kind of a peppery bite
that some people don't like.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.510
But if you find ways
to balance that peppery

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.330
bite to complement it--

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.520
for instance, with something
sweet like watermelon--

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.670
it's really palatable.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.050
And watercress is a
powerhouse of a green,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.117
just full of a lot of nutrients
that are really good for us.

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.450
So I just wanted you guys to
see the beautiful buckwheat

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.040
sprouts, because
they're so pretty.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.960
And buckwheat sprouts
are also incredibly

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.004
high in calcium and lots of
other good things for you.

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.670
So if you can find
those, seek them out.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.378
And they have these
beautiful, pink stems

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:29.337
that look really lovely
next to the watermelon.

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:31.170
So that's the first
thing we're going to do.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.140
And I'll talk a little
bit more about that.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.420
And then the second
recipe we're going to do

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.300
is basically a vegan taco.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.370
So it has beans and
has collard greens,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.922
and the collard greens give
it an additional meatiness.

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:46.880
And they cooked some
collard greens in advance.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.740
They taste amazing.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.960
And collard greens-- again,
I grew up in the South,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.907
and I ate collard greens and
corn bread for breakfast.

00:03:53.907 --> 00:03:55.490
That cornbread was
fried in bacon fat.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.730
It was not vegan.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.230
But I love the combination
of corn and collard greens

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.440
together.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.970
I think they just
go really well.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.330
So I thought about the
collard green taco.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.550
And we're going to make
the unsung vegetable--

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.080
in addition to collard greens--

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.020
that we're using
in that recipe, is

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.182
the tomatillo, which has
its own chapter in the book.

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:17.640
So I'll talk a little bit about
that when I get over there.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.515
So yeah, that's what
we're going to do today.

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:20.880
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.420
So as she's cooking,
you guys are more than

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.470
welcome to ask questions.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.908
It's a little funky, so--

00:04:25.908 --> 00:04:26.390
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
I love questions.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.160
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.785
That's a great.

00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:30.410
So I'm just going to repeat
them back into the mic

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.614
so that those on the
livestream can hear us.

00:04:32.614 --> 00:04:33.530
Should we get started?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.260
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Yeah, let's get started.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.980
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.790
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: So I'm going
to start with the watermelon

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.720
and cucumber salad.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.470
And a lot of people
don't know this,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.766
but melons and cucumber
are in the same family,

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:45.140
and they go really
well together.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.044
And if you actually get
some heirloom melons

00:04:47.044 --> 00:04:48.710
and some heirloom
cucumbers, you can see

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.040
the resemblance between them.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.670
Has anyone ever seen those
little lemon cucumbers?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.309
They're round.

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55.100
They look a little bit
like a little melon.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.350
So they're in the same family.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.970
They go really,
really well together.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.067
So for the taste that you're
getting today, you're getting--

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:03.650
we cut up the
watermelon really small.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.940
But I'm going to show
you how I'd plate this

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.850
if it was for an
elegant dinner and this

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.220
was a family-style platter.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.620
So I take half a watermelon,
and I peel it with a knife--

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.300
sort of like you
would peel an orange

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.250
that you were going to supreme.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.730
And I just run my
knife along the rind.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.130
This is just an easy
way to get in there.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.340
And because we're going to
cut this into almost shards--

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.680
1/4 inch shards-- you don't
have to cut in a round way.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.490
You can just get this
peel straight off.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.740
And this is great, because
it's a seedless watermelon.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.990
It should make it really easy.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.070
And then what we're
going to do is

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.960
cut the watermelon
and the cucumber

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.660
into similar-sized pieces.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.610
And like I said,
the watermelon--

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.890
a lot of people--

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.741
raise your hand if you've had
watermelon in a savory dish.

00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:55.240
Savory.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.530
Oh, lots of people, great.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.644
It goes really well with cheese.

00:05:58.644 --> 00:05:59.560
SPEAKER: What doesn't?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.430
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
And people grill it.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.560
What do you guys--
how have you had it?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.040
What doesn't go with cheese?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.610
It's true.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.430
I know.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.930
So I'm going to take this guy.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.560
So I start out 1/4--

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
maybe somewhere between
1/4 and 1/2 inch slices.

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.190
It also goes really
well with vinegar.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.600
And again, that's about balance.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.940
You have sweet watermelon,
so something peppery or spicy

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.100
and then something acidic.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.420
Acid balances sweet.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.240
And when you want a full--

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.530
especially for a savory dish,
you want that acid in there.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.040
I like acid even in my desserts.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.880
But I'm a huge fan of acid, so
I'm a weird one in that way.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.760
I don't like things
to look too perfect.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.430
I like them to look a
little bit haphazard.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.660
So I'm going to cut
those into triangles--

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.860
this.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.130
And then the cucumber
we're using today--

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.180
this is just a regular cucumber.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.870
If you can get those
cucumbers that have--

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.550
they almost look like snakes.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.180
I don't know, they're showing
up at farmer's markets.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.138
I think more and more
farmers are growing them.

00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:12.620
I've even seen them at Whole
Foods and some grocery stores.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.614
Those are a Middle
Eastern style.

00:07:15.614 --> 00:07:17.030
They're called
Armenian cucumbers.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.320
You'll see them called
Persian cucumbers.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.400
There's several different
varieties in there.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.179
And they have practically
no bitterness.

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:23.470
So you don't have to peel them.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.810
You don't have to seed them.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.400
They're amazing.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.002
If you can find those,
they're incredibly good.

00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:31.335
So same thing with the cucumber.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.225
Maybe we'll just do some slices.

00:07:39.587 --> 00:07:41.920
And if you're going to cook
a lot of vegetables at home,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.150
something I say in the
beginning of the book--

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.400
and this is true,
really, across the board,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.941
but especially if you want to
do a lot of vegetable cooking--

00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:49.990
your best friend is
a big cutting board

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.190
and a sharp knife.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.040
You will hate cooking vegetables
if you have a small cutting

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.240
board and a dull knife.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.600
It's like if you had a
desk here that was crammed

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.661
and your computer was
slow and you had paper

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:01.910
stacked up all over the place.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.243
You would hate your job, no
matter how much you actually

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:06.340
loved the content of your job.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.320
And vegetables are the same way.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.256
You can't do a lot of
chopping if the cutting

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.130
board's really small.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.505
It's just incredibly
frustrating.

00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:16.360
I'd have to keep moving stuff
off the board as I went.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.110
And this is a good one-- a
nice, big, wooden cutting board.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.580
So I'm going to do one
more little cucumber here.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.810
All right, so this is an
incredibly fast salad.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.049
Fall produce is my favorite.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.370
I feel bad saying that.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.530
I shouldn't.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.650
I wrote a book on
vegetables for year round,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.620
but it's my favorite.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.850
But summer is great,
because it's easy.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.246
You barely have to do
anything to it or cook it.

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:44.620
So right before
I plate this, I'm

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.161
want to talk about
these little guys.

00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:49.980
So I have a recipe in the
book for pickled shallots.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.620
So shallots are typically
used-- this is a peeled shallot.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.050
It's the allium family, so
they're related to onions.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.160
But they have a much more mild
flavor, a little bit sweeter.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.480
And they're typically used
in sauces and vinaigrettes.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.590
That's how most people see them.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.030
But in other parts of the world,
they use them very differently.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.620
They're pickled
often, and they're

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.644
fried until they get crispy.

00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:13.060
And I also have a recipe--
shallots have their own chapter

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.559
in the book.

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.470
That's how much I
love these things.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.610
And I think even though people
know what a shallot is, they

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.560
do one or two things
with it, and then

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.226
they don't know what
else to do with it.

00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:24.880
So to give shallot
more of a chance,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.417
to show off what it can do.

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:28.500
And when you fry shallots--
even though that's not

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.208
what we're doing, I
have to put in a plug

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:32.890
for the fried shallots-- and you
do them, it's a weird method.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.940
It's a slow fry.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.150
And when you do a
slow fry on them,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.840
it takes about 20 minutes.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.280
They stay crispy for a few days.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.980
You can just put
them in a little pint

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.676
container like this, cap
it at room temperature,

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:45.550
and they stay crispy.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.519
And you can just top
salads, grains, eggs,

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:49.310
whatever with them.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.740
They're addictive.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.330
But these are the
pickled shallots,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.830
and they've been
sitting in red wine

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.302
vinegar and a little bit of
salt for some period of time.

00:09:57.302 --> 00:09:59.260
I mean, even if you just
do this for 5 minutes,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.950
it makes a difference.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.366
It takes the bite
off the shallot,

00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.310
and the shallot
infuses the vinegar.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.940
So then you have your garnish,
which is the sliced shallot,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.860
and you also have
shallot vinegar.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.620
So next time you go to make a--
and when I do this, I usually

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.720
make 1/2 cup portion.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.810
So next time you go to
make a salad dressing,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.760
you don't need to
dice a shallot.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.435
You have shallot
vinegar already made.

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:22.810
In this case, we're going to
use both the pickled shallot

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.360
and the shallot vinegar
in this dressing.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.140
So just wanted to
talk about that.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.430
The other components of
the salad-- so cucumber,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.710
watermelon, pickled shallot.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.650
We have some cilantro.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.900
We're using a lot of cilantro.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.220
Do I have any
cilantro haters today?

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.386
We can leave some cilantro--

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:42.080
I know-- OK, 1, 2, 3.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.280
So we need three tacos and
salads without any cilantro.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.190
I encourage the
cilantro haters, though,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.320
to try these cilantro
flowers, though, I picked up

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.600
this morning, because--

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.780
so cilantro is in
the coriander family.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.450
And has anyone had
coriander seed, the spice?

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.720
It tastes different than the
green part of the plant, right?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.135
And when cilantro bolts--

00:11:03.135 --> 00:11:04.010
that's what happened.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.150
So this used to look like this.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.672
And then cut late
in the season when

00:11:08.672 --> 00:11:10.630
the plant's been in the
ground for a long time,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.494
it bolts and it forms
seeds and flowers.

00:11:14.494 --> 00:11:15.160
It's all edible.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.610
That whole thing is edible.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.730
I use the stems like a bayleaf
when I'm braising something.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.732
And I use the flowers
and the seeds as garnish,

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.440
and they have a totally
different flavor.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.010
So maybe when you go--

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.660
no pressure, but maybe try it.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.790
And farmers are
now selling these.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:36.040
So again, another chapter in
the book is flowering herbs--

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.240
bolted herbs.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.530
And I see people go by these
things of dill blossoms

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.572
and cilantro blossoms and
they just keep walking.

00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:45.655
They're like, those are
beautiful, what are those?

00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:47.544
And the guy's like,
they're dill flowers.

00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:48.460
And they're like, wow.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.600
And then they don't
buy them, or don't

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.927
know what to do with them.

00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:53.260
So I was like, they're getting
their whole chapter, too.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.480
And then some sumac.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.180
Sumac is a berry.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.860
And because this has some Feta--

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.050
and we've got the watermelon
and the cucumber--

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.690
sumac is a wonderful,
another bright element.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.125
It tastes a little
bit like lemon,

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:09.250
and it's really beautiful
on top of the watermelon.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.340
And this is used a lot in
Middle Eastern cooking,

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.900
and I encourage you
to seek this out.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.950
My next book is on the modern
larder, so something like sumac

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.620
will get featured extensively.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.470
It's the unsung pantry
ingredients, really.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.880
I had my unsung
vegetable heroes,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.687
and now I'm doing the pantry.

00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:28.270
And then some toasted
pine nuts, which

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.519
aren't listed in the recipe,
but they're in the photo.

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:33.680
They're not necessary, but they
add a nice, crunchy element.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.051
So we have our acid, which
is a nice contrast in flavor

00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:38.050
to the sweet watermelon.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.910
And the pine nuts,
or you could use--

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.730
pistachios would be really
good-- are a nice contrast

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.800
and texture to the
rest of the salad.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:51.490
So when I talk about
plating salads,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.850
I find this to be a really--
maybe you guys are savvy cooks.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.840
But when I was teaching in
San Francisco, over and over

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.514
again people had never learned
how to compose a salad.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.680
Most people know how to
toss gently with your hands.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.290
They've seen that on TV.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.940
I rarely toss a salad.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.574
Almost never.

00:13:07.574 --> 00:13:08.740
There's a few salads I toss.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.200
If I just want a
simple green salad

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.270
to go with some sort
of braised meat dish,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.880
then I'll just toss that salad
in a simple lemon vinaigrette.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.550
But most of my salads I compose.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.090
And that is because I want
the flavor elements to stay

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.210
a little bit
separate, and I don't

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.451
want things to get mashed.

00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.450
For instance, something
like cheese or something

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.790
like avocado or
something like beet--

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.280
there's just so many things
that when you mix them,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.600
they get all over the place.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.770
And I don't want that.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.710
But mostly, I compose
because it's pretty

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.050
and because when you're
eating the salad,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.630
each bite is different.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.460
Sumac's not in every
single bite that you get.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.100
The pickled shallot isn't in
every single bite that you get.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.530
So what I would do
here is I would do--

00:13:53.530 --> 00:14:01.600
and like I said, I like to
do a haphazard, asymmetrical

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.450
layering thing.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.025
So a little bit of watermelon,
a little bit of cucumber.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:17.090
And then the pickled
shallot I like

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.120
to do right on top of the--

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.790
scattered on top of the
watermelon a little bit.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:26.440
And this is a good salad.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.606
It can sit for a little bit.

00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:31.000
It's going to sit
while I make the tacos.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.500
SPEAKER: I was going
to say, though,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.125
seems like a really
good salad that you

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.809
could pre-make and
bring to a house

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:37.600
party, dinner party or
something like that.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.420
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Yeah, I
would pre-make all the elements

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.280
and put them--

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.000
go to a restaurant supply
store and buy quart and pint

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.637
containers.

00:14:43.637 --> 00:14:45.970
I don't use Tupperware at
home, because these are great.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.470
They stack great in the fridge.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.240
I would put all the
elements in here,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.430
and then yeah, you could
just quickly compose it.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.485
This is the watercress
that I mentioned earlier.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.780
So let's see.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.220
Let's do some watercress.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.180
Who's had watercress?

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.275
Do you like it?

00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:06.650
Keep your hand up
if you like it.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.950
Great, you guys are good eaters.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.819
SPEAKER: Success.

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:10.902
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I know.

00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:13.000
Got the right audience today.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.880
A little bit of
cilantro-- and I'm

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.750
a huge fan of mint
in this salad.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.780
So if you like mint, or if
you don't think you like mint

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.560
but you want to try it, this is
a great salad to try that with.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.640
A little bit of cheese.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.500
Let's see if I can use a spoon.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.940
And this is crumbled Feta.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.897
I really like the Feta, too,
that you can buy in a block.

00:15:33.897 --> 00:15:35.980
So because this is crumbled,
instead of getting it

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.650
all over the place-- because
if you had it in the block,

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.720
I'd cut it like I
cut the watermelon.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.099
And so it would stay separate.

00:15:43.099 --> 00:15:44.890
And so instead of taking
this crumbled Feta

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.710
and putting it all over,
I'm going to just spoon it

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.540
into little portions
around, and as people

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.290
were serving themselves
off a big platter,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.331
they would get some Feta.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.370
But not everything is like
blanketed and white, salty

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.600
Feta.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.690
Feta's my favorite
cheese, by the way.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.330
Especially summer-- it goes
so well with summer stuff.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.630
OK, so some Feta.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.560
Some pine nuts.

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:16.871
AUDIENCE: Where do you
source your pine nuts?

00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.620
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
That's a good question.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.995
If you're going
to buy pine nuts,

00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:21.500
they go rancid really quickly.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.260
So just find a place near
you that has high turnover--

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.980
usually a co-op market type
thing that has a bulk section.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.160
The best pine nuts I have are
vacuum-packed in a freezer

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.600
somewhere, but I find very
few grocery stores do that.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.790
Maybe online-- if
anyone has a good source

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.772
for some good pine
nuts, let me know.

00:16:39.772 --> 00:16:41.230
I actually don't
think they're that

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.480
easy to find-- some good ones.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.640
All right, do I have everything?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.640
So I'm going to
basically just compose

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.380
a really quick vinaigrette.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.400
So quick.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.150
It's just a little bit
of shallot vinegar.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.487
And I'm going to put
salt in the vinegar.

00:16:56.487 --> 00:16:58.820
I hope I don't have any people
who are offended by this.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.620
And I'm also going to
salt the watermelon

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.302
with some coarse salt.
So I put fine salt

00:17:05.302 --> 00:17:06.760
in the vinegar,
which is dissolving

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.740
right now as it sits here.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.639
And then some coarse salt on top
of the watermelon and cucumber.

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:16.430
And then I'm going to
take some olive oil--

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.929
and when you're
making vinaigrettes,

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:19.200
it's just a ratio.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.990
So you don't really need to
think about it or measure it.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.490
It's 1 part acid to 3 parts oil.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.170
So you can just eye it.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.960
Sometimes it's 1 to 2,
but usually it's 1 to 3

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.240
is what tastes best
to most people.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.850
And then I'm just going to spoon
this around-- so no tossing.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.451
And then I'm going to
just quickly do one layer.

00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:44.450
And as I do that, does
anyone have any questions

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.491
about anything I've said?

00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:47.080
I'm going to do one
more layer on top.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.750
Not even a complete
layer, a half layer.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.690
Any questions?

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.439
No?

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:53.980
I'm just going to
keep talking, then.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.312
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
about these blossoms,

00:17:55.312 --> 00:17:57.480
because they have this
lovely, peppery aftertaste.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.950
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Uh-huh.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.325
AUDIENCE: Would you steep them
in something, maybe an oil

00:18:00.325 --> 00:18:02.920
or a vinegar, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.750
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Any herb or blossom

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.070
you can steep into vinegar.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.099
The cream's a great idea.

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:11.890
I assume you know this
since you're asking,

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.200
but if you just take something
and put it in cold cream

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.020
overnight, because of
cream's fat content,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.380
it will absorb the flavor.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.880
So let's say that you wanted
to make a lavender panna cotta,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.694
you could just take lavender and
put it in cold cream over night

00:18:23.694 --> 00:18:25.860
and use that cream to make
panna cotta the next day.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.630
You'd have lavender panna cotta
or creme brulee or whatever.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.430
So I imagine, yeah,
it would work.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.020
But I mean, they're so--

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.230
I buy a bunch and just keep
it on my chopping block.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.620
And I go through it so quickly.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.730
I've never had any leftover to
try anything unusual with it.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.791
But yeah, I imagine you could.

00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.790
I've been trying to eat
a lot of protein lately,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.850
and so one of my breakfasts
has been refried black beans

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.470
with two eggs and tortillas.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.960
And just tons of
cilantro flowers

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.780
to just lighten it
up a little bit--

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.884
to attempt to lighten
it up a little bit.

00:19:03.884 --> 00:19:04.800
All right, some more--

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.090
I'm going to go heavier
on the watercress here.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.740
Can you guys all see this?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.480
Can you see this where it is?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.050
And on the fancy TV situation?

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.346
SPEAKER: If we move it to the--

00:19:16.346 --> 00:19:18.262
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Yeah,
I want you guys to be

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:19.427
able to see what I'm doing.

00:19:19.427 --> 00:19:20.260
I should have asked.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.850
SPEAKER: Oh, this one
in front-- oh, no.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.766
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: No?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.420
We'll pass it around.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.200
SPEAKER: We can place it at
the front after it's complete.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.192
It's beautiful.

00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:37.650
Michelle and I were
talking before,

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.270
and we were saying
that no matter what

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.790
you do, as long as you have
edible flowers on the plate,

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.030
it's going to be pretty.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.321
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: That's true.

00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:45.930
SPEAKER: And people will eat it.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.970
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
And we put those out.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.130
You guys can just pick
them for your tacos

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.130
later, or for your
salads, as you want.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.170
All right, so some
beautiful sumac on top.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.730
And this I am going to
sprinkle all around the plate.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.750
And I just want to say--

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.210
this is more along the
lines of my second book,

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.920
but it's relevant here--

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.300
I believe that there is
an issue with the tyranny

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.830
of black pepper--

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.770
black pepper as the
ubiquitous seasoning.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.810
And I'm in my second
trimester right now.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.185
When I was in my
first trimester,

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:20.430
I found it vile and I was
also having trouble cooking.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.920
And I couldn't eat anywhere,
because black pepper

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.850
was in everything.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.600
I'd go somewhere and
it was in the hummus.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.990
I'm like, why does black
pepper need to be in hummus?

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.730
Just everywhere--
it was in my taco.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.010
It was out everything.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.860
And there are so many
beautiful spices out there.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.885
Watercress stands in
for black pepper here,

00:20:36.885 --> 00:20:38.940
and it has that element to it.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.230
And then something like sumac.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.271
You don't need to put
black pepper on everything.

00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:44.220
I've been saying this
for years, but now

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.380
I really feel strongly about it.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.190
I'm going to go on a crusade.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.590
I'm going to write
an article and just--

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.222
and then the black
pepper association's

00:20:53.222 --> 00:20:54.180
going to come after me.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.930
SPEAKER: It could be
your third cookbook--

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.770
"The Black
Pepper-less Cookbook."

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.750
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: The
pepper-less cookbook.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.030
All right, this guy's done.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.600
All right, even if
you couldn't see,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.925
I just want you-- yeah, so
if I had been able to-- oh,

00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:08.050
do you think it'll take it?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.350
SPEAKER: I think so.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.558
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Thank you.

00:21:09.558 --> 00:21:11.610
SPEAKER: So the screen can show.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.870
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Oh, that's it.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.700
OK, so here.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.762
I'll put it up here for now.

00:21:17.762 --> 00:21:19.470
And then I'm going to
get my board clean.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.718
Let's see.

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:25.967
SPEAKER: So I have a quick
question for you, Michelle.

00:21:25.967 --> 00:21:27.295
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Yes.

00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:30.460
SPEAKER: A lot of your
vegetables and fruits

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.380
come from the farmer's
market, obviously.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.450
And I know for myself, sometimes
when I go to farmer's market,

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.280
especially if it's
not in my hometown,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.430
it's hard to navigate
them because there's so

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.700
many different choices
and stalls and things

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.434
that I don't
understand what they

00:21:44.434 --> 00:21:46.850
are because they look like
foreign aliens to me sometimes.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.224
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Like kohlrabi.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.990
SPEAKER: Like kohlrabi,
yes, absolutely.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.880
That's definitely the alien.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.060
So do you have any
resources or suggestions

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.920
of how we navigate
that so that we

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.900
can get more comfortable
with shopping

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.160
within a farmer's market?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.324
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Yeah.

00:22:01.324 --> 00:22:02.615
Well, my cookbook's a resource.

00:22:02.615 --> 00:22:05.270
SPEAKER: Well, there you go.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.150
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Wow, I've
got good at saying that.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:12.460
I used to be super
uncomfortable saying that.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.440
So here's how I approach
the farmer's market--

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.850
because you can't
go with a list.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.000
That's the hard part for people.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.602
Can you pass me a paper towel
for this watermelon juice?

00:22:20.602 --> 00:22:22.060
So you can't go
with a list, right?

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.080
Because you have no
idea, really, what's

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.830
going to be there.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.390
There's a few dependable things.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.860
So I do a lap.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.710
Go get yourself a cup of
coffee if that's your thing,

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.320
and then just
leisurely walk around

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.150
and take in what's there.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.020
And then what I do
is I bring a sketch--

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.540
I have a little notebook, like
a Moleskine or something--

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:44.710
and I write down the
things that excited me.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.289
Just really quickly, just messy.

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:47.080
usually at the top.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.960
This is what a chef
would do, basically.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.370
And then you can
just say, oh, OK.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.130
The cilantro blossoms
looked really good,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.272
and so did the watermelon.

00:22:56.272 --> 00:22:57.730
And I saw those
Armenian cucumbers.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.560
I've been wanting
to try one of those.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.642
And like, OK, it kind
of could come together

00:23:01.642 --> 00:23:03.100
in a bit of a Middle
Eastern salad.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.450
I have some Feta at home.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.030
And you just sketch--

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.470
in your mind, even, or
you can do it on paper--

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.270
what you want.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.710
And you have a shopping list.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:12.860
It can happen that way.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.749
So I think the lap
is really important.

00:23:14.749 --> 00:23:16.540
And then the people
who work at farm stands

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.090
are generally pretty
knowledgeable.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.240
Even if they can only
give you one thing to do--

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.700
one thing to do with--

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.180
the one that I hear a lot
about is the fig leaves.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.030
Has anyone seen fig
leaves, or have a fig tree,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.400
or your neighbor has a fig tree?

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.026
So farmers usually--
at the farm stand,

00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:40.483
when I hear people ask about
the fig leaves because they're

00:23:40.483 --> 00:23:41.920
beautiful, they smell amazing.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.869
I brought some smoked fig
leaves from last year.

00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:45.910
We can pass these around.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.520
You can smell them.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.730
I smoked them.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.750
I bought them fresh.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.400
And I just noticed that people--

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.080
the farmer would
say, well, you can

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.210
wrap fish in them-- which
is a wonderful thing

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.430
to do with fig leaves.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.740
It's delicious.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.710
And the fig leaves impart
a coconut-like flavor

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.670
to your fish.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.945
You can wrap cheese
in them, as well.

00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:05.320
But that was the only thing
that everyone was being told.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.060
And I'm like, well, there's
obviously a lot more

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.940
that you can do with these.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.250
And I'm going to start playing.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.166
So I dried them, made
spiced ones out of them,

00:24:11.166 --> 00:24:14.470
I smoked them, I made
sugar, that sugar

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.090
went into a shortbread.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.420
So I would say, have one
thing to do with them.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.770
Ask one thing to do with them.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.530
Go home, and then play.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.570
Just play a little bit.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.900
But the lap-- the lap is really
important, that initial lap.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.010
AUDIENCE: What do
you smoke them in?

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.520
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: You can
build a little home smoker.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.590
I have a little ceramic
Japanese thing that's

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.785
meant to be a home smoker.

00:24:36.785 --> 00:24:38.410
But in the back of
the book, I tell you

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.910
how to build a home one.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.510
And they don't take very long to
get some smoke and get brittle.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.550
It happens pretty quickly.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.300
OK, any questions on this
recipe before I move on?

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.560
So the next thing we're going to
do is the collard green tacos.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.960
And this is going to
definitely be a TV scenario,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.150
because these greens take
about 30 minutes to cook.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.670
So I'm going to get
this pan going over

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.760
medium-high heat back here.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.170
All right, so I'm all
about using different fats

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.502
in the kitchen, and I love
pork fat and bacon fat,

00:25:14.502 --> 00:25:16.210
and you could definitely
use that to cook

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.130
these collard greens.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.560
For this dish, I wouldn't
necessarily love olive oil.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.840
I also recommend coconut oil.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.350
We have some
coconut butter here,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.640
which gives you the flavor
and nutritional properties

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.950
of coconut oil, but
it won't quite cook.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.530
So I'm going to
combine some canola

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.040
oil with the coconut oil.

00:25:38.442 --> 00:25:39.150
Get that melting.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.980
OK, it's hot.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.380
We have some serrano chilies.

00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:52.090
Those are going to be
for garnish, though.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.130
So when you cooked
your collard greens,

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.990
did you throw in
the chile de arbol?

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.480
Yeah, so I don't have
one up here to show you,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.837
but there's a chili that I use
in my kitchen every single day,

00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:04.420
and it is called
chile de arbol, which

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.079
just means chile of the tree.

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:07.495
I don't know why
it has that name,

00:26:07.495 --> 00:26:09.220
but it's the actual
name of the chili.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.010
And you always find them dry.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.912
And I use them--

00:26:12.912 --> 00:26:14.620
again, I like to tell
people because they

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.240
understand-- like a bayleaf.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.670
So I'll heat up my cooking oil--

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.320
or fat, whatever it is--

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.960
and I add my chile de arbol.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.351
And depending on how much heat
I want, I can remove it quickly.

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:27.850
It'll just add a
little bit of heat.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.500
Or I can leave it in
while I cook my greens

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.750
and then remove it at the end.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.960
And make sure you
remove it at the end.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.440
And what that does
is it just adds--

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.140
depending on your chiles and
how long you leave it in,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.980
it adds a kind of pervasive
heat, a gentle heat.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.500
Versus adding a bunch of
chili flakes, which can

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.360
be a little bit overpowering.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.470
Or if you added--

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.610
I don't like chili powder.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.620
Personally, I think it's
always tastes stale.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.550
So this is a really fresh,
fragrant chile to use.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.881
And they stay good in the
cupboard for a long time.

00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:01.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.642 --> 00:27:03.100
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
I keep it whole.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.600
You can break it in half, but
you're going to get more heat.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.650
So you can determine
how much heat you want.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.870
And when I need
chili flakes, I take

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.604
my whole chile de arbols and
I put them in a spice grinder

00:27:13.604 --> 00:27:16.270
and I grind them myself, because
so many of the chilies that you

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.220
buy--

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:17.839
they're stale.

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:19.630
They've been exposed
to the light too long,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.380
and they don't have a
lot of their flavor.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.990
Chilies have a really
complex flavor.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.510
They're not just
heat they're floral.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.070
Some are earthy.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.810
You get all these
flavors from them.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.010
But once they've been
powdered, you lose that.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.520
I'm going to turn this
up just a little bit.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.020
OK.

00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:40.030
So that's it.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.181
I would just cook this with
some oil, salt, and chile.

00:27:43.181 --> 00:27:44.680
Some I'm going to
just put these in.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.530
And these will
wilt down by half.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.840
And how long you have
to cook collard greens

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:58.647
depends on how thinly you cut
them and how young they are.

00:27:58.647 --> 00:28:00.230
If you buy little,
baby collard greens

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.487
they can cook pretty quickly.

00:28:01.487 --> 00:28:03.320
Some of the really--
if you get a big bunch,

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.610
they can take up to an hour.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:10.250
So with recipes, you have
to think about your produce

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.900
and go with that.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.500
Pay attention to that.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.890
So while those are cooking,
I'm going to throw together

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.850
a tomatillo salsa.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.010
I'm going to pass
around a tomatillo.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:24.531
So these three little guys come
into season about a month ago,

00:28:24.531 --> 00:28:25.530
maybe a little bit more.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.380
And they last all the
way through October.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.800
And you can look under that
little paper-like lantern

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.620
and you'll see the
green tomatillo.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.140
They're actually ripe
when they're yellow,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.890
but we use them primarily
when they're green.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.740
And you can roast them, and
that gives them great flavor;

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.390
grill them; or use them raw.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.570
When you use them raw-- this
is how easy this salsa is.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.840
Tomatillos just quartered--
so you remove the husk.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.770
You rinse them.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.430
They go in.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:29:01.500
Add some salt.
Some chopped chile.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.314
So those collard
greens are spicy.

00:29:04.314 --> 00:29:06.480
I'm going to add just a
little bit of chopped chile.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.520
If I have time, I'll show you
my favorite way to cut a chile,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.020
but only if we have
time, we'll see.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:15.600
And some garlic
and some cilantro.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.530
And when I'm using cilantro--

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.850
I use herbs all the time.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.522
And oftentimes, I pick them--

00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:22.230
like I did for the
salad-- where you just

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.106
get these little whole
leaves like this.

00:29:24.106 --> 00:29:25.980
Because I think they
should be an ingredient.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.440
I don't think they
should just be a garnish.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.890
But for something like
this, I just take my knife

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.810
and I just shear off
some leaves quickly.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.550
Yeah, see-- sharp
knife makes cooking

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.760
very efficient and safe.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.820
And then I form them
into a bit of a bundle

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.402
and then just slice
them like that,

00:29:51.402 --> 00:29:52.610
and then they go straight in.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.940
I'm going to do a little bit
of-- just a tiny bit of lime

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.470
in this.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:04.132
And we're just
going to puree this.

00:30:04.132 --> 00:30:05.590
I don't need a lot
of lime in this,

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.790
because lime is practically dry.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.086
All right.

00:30:10.086 --> 00:30:13.080
[FOOD PROCESSOR WHIRRING]

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.050
I like them better than
tomatoes and salsa.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.594
That's just me.

00:30:23.594 --> 00:30:26.510
AUDIENCE: For cilantro, you
[INAUDIBLE] cut it really fine

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.950
versus putting it in whole
in the food processor?

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.140
Oh, Oh, you need to
chop it up a little bit.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.210
You can't put it
in whole, because I

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.380
want this to remain coarse.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.450
And if I put my
cilantro in whole,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:41.040
by the time the
cilantro gets chopped,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.170
basically, it'll be pureed.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.150
And I want this to be
a little bit coarse.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.480
This is what we're going
for, where there's still

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.087
some texture to the tomatillos.

00:30:53.087 --> 00:30:53.670
Good question.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.640
[FOOD PROCESSOR WHIRRING]

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.940
And again, if you wanted
a deeper, smokier flavor,

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.340
you could chargrill these--
even just on a cast iron

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.740
pan on your stovetop.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.260
You could get some char on the
tomatillos and then do that.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.009
I think I just got
cilantro on my glasses.

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:11.410
It's OK.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.660
SPEAKER: How long are
tomatillos in season for?

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.425
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I think
around here, through October.

00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:17.520
SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.210
Make a lot and can it.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.585
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: One of my
favorite recipes in the book

00:31:21.585 --> 00:31:24.010
is a green fish stew
that uses tomatillos.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.380
Love it so much.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.735
All right, and
that is your salsa.

00:31:28.735 --> 00:31:30.280
The trick-- I'm
sure some of you,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.780
if you've taken classes here,
you've probably seen this.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.905
You just put your finger
in the bottom of the bowl,

00:31:33.905 --> 00:31:35.380
and then it doesn't fall out.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.930
And then I would let this
sit for about 20 minutes,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.629
and then taste and add more
salt before serving it.

00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:42.670
I'm sure it needs some
more salt. Let the flavors

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.290
meld a little bit
before you serve it.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.767
How are we on time?

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:49.850
SPEAKER: Good, 20 minutes.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.350
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Good.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.850
Great.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.840
I love going on tangents.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.159
And then I never know--

00:31:57.159 --> 00:31:57.950
SPEAKER: I do, too.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.895
This works well.

00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:04.730
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: All right,
let's get this board wiped off.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.380
So what I'm going
to show you now

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.954
is how I would compose one
of these collard green tacos.

00:32:11.954 --> 00:32:13.840
And I'm going to show
you-- you know what?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.256
Since we have a
little extra time,

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:17.560
I'm going to show
you just a very--

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.760
because I taught my
skills once a month

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.540
for four years at
least, and I've noticed

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.640
people don't know how
to get into a chile.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.210
So I'm just going to
show you real fast.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.860
So the seeds run
down the middle.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.730
This is a huge one.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.300
This will be easy.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.980
Sometimes when you get
the little serranos,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.910
they're really hard.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.326
But the seeds run
down the middle,

00:32:37.326 --> 00:32:39.120
and they contain
most of the heat.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.480
So I like to cut
around the seeds.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.920
So I hold my chile
lengthwise, and I just cut off

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.920
the flesh of the pepper around.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.160
So I just rotate the pepper
and go around the seeds

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.890
so the seeds are still
contained right there.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.750
Now, this you can--

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.510
in a blender, if you were
making a super-pureed salsa,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.760
you could just remove the
stem and put this in there

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.440
and get a spicy salsa.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.230
So this has a use if you
want to use it for that.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:13.800
Then if you wanted a fine dice,
I would take these, and I go--

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.550
so the shiny skin-side down.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.310
The knife will cut much more
easily through the dull side.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:27.690
And I cut little matchsticks
with my fingers tucked under.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:31.900
So then you get
these matchsticks.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.250
Then you can take those and
line up maybe four of them,

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.080
and then slice
those into a dice.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.604
And that's just a really
fast way to get into a chile.

00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:44.020
So I just wanted
to show you that,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.529
because I get lots of
people who look at a chile

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:48.570
and they just start slicing
it, and I don't know.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.861
A lot of people know how to
cut an onion because that's

00:33:50.861 --> 00:33:53.140
demo'd so often, but
something like a chile

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.590
just gets forgotten.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.578
OK, so to heat up
some tortillas--

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:13.480
I'm going to put a
skillet on medium-low--

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.310
or what I think is
medium-low on this.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.730
So I have a little stack--

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.392
these super tiny,
really cute tortillas.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.380
So if you're heating up
tortillas for a taco--

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.790
again, I love
teaching people how

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.620
to cook for more
than just one person.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.037
So let's say you're
cooking for six people,

00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:35.870
and you want to heat
up-- or even just three

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.033
people-- you want to heat up
a stack of little tortillas.

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:39.949
Can you guys see this?

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:40.615
Here, I'll even.

00:34:44.774 --> 00:34:45.940
Here's an easy way to do it.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.860
So you put one tortilla
down in the pan.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.090
This might take it a second.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.380
Maybe I'll cheat and
move the collard greens

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.380
and use this back guy,
because it's already hot.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.750
OK, so you put one down.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.940
And that side's
going to heat up, OK?

00:35:05.044 --> 00:35:07.750
I'm so used to using flame.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.980
With induction, like,
what's happening?

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.510
I can't see it.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.810
SPEAKER: It's like a spaceship.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.310
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: And so,
OK, so that side gets warm.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.570
And then you flip it over, and
you add your next cold tortilla

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.650
to the hot side.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.490
And then so then the other--

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.030
so OK.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:29.280
This guy's in the
pan-- for those of you

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:29.875
that can't see the skillet.

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:31.090
This guy's in the pan.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.900
He's hot.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.950
I flip him over.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:34.750
I add my cold tortilla.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.170
This side's heating up.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.120
I flip this over.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.209
I add another cold tortilla.

00:35:39.209 --> 00:35:40.000
This side gets hot.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.625
I flip it over.

00:35:40.625 --> 00:35:43.549
I add another cold
tortilla, right?

00:35:43.549 --> 00:35:45.340
And then if you're
taking them to the table

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.050
to serve them, wrap them in--

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.730
I do parchment and then foil,
because once you heat them up,

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.220
if you don't wrap them
or serve them right away,

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.530
they get rubbery.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.580
There we go.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.375
Flip them.

00:35:58.375 --> 00:35:59.290
Add that one.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:35:59.890
Let that go.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.530
So I'm going to heat
up a few, and I'm

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.560
going to compose a taco.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.060
Yes?

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.320
AUDIENCE: Does the parchment
[INAUDIBLE] let it steam?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.194
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I
just do that because I'm

00:36:07.194 --> 00:36:08.790
weird about my own foil.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.030
That's just one of my things.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.820
I don't like aluminum
foil on my food.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.500
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: You
see too many times--

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.590
when you cook a lot on
aluminum pans, aluminum racks--

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.390
you see it come
off on food a lot.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.890
It's not going to come off on
tortillas, because they have

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.030
nothing acidic in them, really.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.488
Well, they do, but it's not
going to come off on tortillas.

00:36:27.488 --> 00:36:30.170
But when you see it come off
on things like baked goods--

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.190
I had a chef cooking a private
dinner at my cooking school,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.880
and the best way-- well,
here's another little side tip.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.380
See, I love these tangents,
because you get little tips.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.700
If you want to get really
crispy skin on your chicken,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.570
you salt it the night before.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.380
But you don't wrap
it in Tupperware

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.820
or put it in a baggie.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.090
You put it on a cooling rack
set on top of a sheet pan

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:55.090
so that evaporation can happen.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.400
But he was just doing
chicken breasts,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.050
and he used an
aluminum drying rack.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.970
And when he got in
the next morning,

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.990
the chicken was gray
from the aluminum.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:12.310
Anything that's reactive,
I'm just super careful with.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.310
If that makes any sense.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.530
So there's just those little
stories where I'm just like,

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.946
OK, I'm just going to always
protect my food from anything

00:37:17.946 --> 00:37:19.290
that's going to react with it.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.240
All right, I'm going to get
my composition ingredients up

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.500
here.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.210
So Chef Dee Dee and her
team mashed some avocado.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.790
We have some sour
cream, or creme fraiche.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:37.300
We have cilantro blossoms, which
you can also put on that salad.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.435
Some thinly sliced green onion.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.984
Some-- I love radishes on tacos,
just thinly sliced radishes.

00:37:47.984 --> 00:37:50.400
They've got that peppery element
without the black pepper.

00:37:54.008 --> 00:37:55.680
Move this out of the way.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.555
Some lime and some cilantro.

00:37:57.555 --> 00:37:59.180
I'm going to use the
cilantro blossoms,

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.530
and I'm going to leave that off.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.010
All right, so does everyone
understand the taco things?

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.910
I'm going to turn this off.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.490
How to heat the tortillas.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.480
All right, I think that's good.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.340
I think you know
what you're doing.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.214
All right, so I'm going
to take two of these.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.930
And I like to do
avocado down first,

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:26.560
because it creates a bit of a
glue for the other ingredients.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.620
And I have some cooked
beans back here.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.960
You could use pinto,
black-- really any bean

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.680
that you'd like.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.840
SPEAKER: Do you recommend
cooking your own beans

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.460
if you have the time?

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.793
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I don't know.

00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:42.060
I'm relaxed on the bean thing.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.295
I mean, well, if you
really want to know--

00:38:46.295 --> 00:38:46.920
SPEAKER: We do.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.120
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I
have a Colombian bean

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.620
pot which is made of clay.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.880
I eat a lot of beans.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.880
And beans cooked
in clay do taste

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.552
different than any
bean you've ever had.

00:38:55.552 --> 00:38:56.760
And I'm not just saying that.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.390
Because honestly,
between this and canned--

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:04.390
you jazz it up with some chili
and some salt, you're OK.

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.640
It's going to taste delicious.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.540
And honestly, if
canned beans enable

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.520
you to cook at home
versus eat out,

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.010
buy canned beans by all means.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.980
But I had this
Colombian bean pot.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.160
It's huge, and I cook
a big batch of beans.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160
And you can freeze them.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.159
They freeze really well.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:24.570
But the clay imparts
this unbelievable flavor

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.170
to the beans.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:30.180
And I grew up-- like I said,
my family is from the South,

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.930
and they also cooked
beans in clay.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.580
And baked beans were
baked in a bean pot.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.350
It was a southern bean pot,
it's a different shape.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.140
And they baked them in clay.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.280
It's a thing-- beans and clay.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.890
AUDIENCE: It's totally different
than a [INAUDIBLE] or something

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:45.729
else with the glaze?

00:39:45.729 --> 00:39:46.770
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Right.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:47.269
No glaze.

00:39:47.269 --> 00:39:48.601
AUDIENCE: How do you clean it?

00:39:48.601 --> 00:39:50.350
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: You
clean it carefully.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.090
And you just don't want to use
an abrasive sponge or anything,

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.590
but you can still
use a little soap.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.298
You would never put
it in the dishwasher.

00:39:57.298 --> 00:39:59.580
It would crack in
the dishwasher.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.490
You just have to be careful
about temperature differences.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.110
It will crack.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.790
But I've been using
mine for years.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.831
I've never had a problem.

00:40:06.831 --> 00:40:08.626
AUDIENCE: So the
surface is porous?

00:40:08.626 --> 00:40:09.584
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Huh?

00:40:09.584 --> 00:40:11.445
AUDIENCE: The surface
of the clay is porous.

00:40:11.445 --> 00:40:13.320
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Sorry,
I can't understand.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:13.760
AUDIENCE: Porous.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.343
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Porous-- it's
porous Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's

00:40:16.343 --> 00:40:16.960
porous.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.350
But people have been cooking
in clay for a long time.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.270
I did a pilot for
the Cooking Channel.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.329
The whole episode was
about cooking with clay.

00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:24.870
I mean, I geek out
on the clay thing.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.410
I really love it.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.255
There's a great shop
in Sonoma called Bram--

00:40:28.255 --> 00:40:32.610
B-R-A-M. Bram is the name
of an Egyptian clay pot.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.440
That's also in the book.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.800
And that shop has clay
from all over the world.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.730
And it's just a cool shop, and
it's run by Ash and Shelley.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.884
And Ash is this guy who will
just fill you with information

00:40:44.884 --> 00:40:46.800
and maybe give you
vegetables from his garden.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.920
You guys should field
trip up to Bram in Sonoma,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.140
and then go shopping.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.510
And then go to El
Molino Central,

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:58.190
which is the best Mexican
food in the Bay Area--

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.850
in my opinion.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.710
Bay Area-- it's
Boyes Hot Springs.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.750
I don't know if
that's the Bay Area.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.460
It's within two hours.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.750
But it's a field trip.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.432
It's a fun day.

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:09.640
AUDIENCE: What was it called?

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.450
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
El Molino Central.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.840
Who's been to the Ferry
market on Saturday mornings--

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.000
the Ferry building?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
You guys know Primavera?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.036
El Molino's the
restaurant of Primavera.

00:41:20.036 --> 00:41:21.660
So if you've had a
Primavera fish taco,

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.700
you know what I'm talking about.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.450
They're delicious.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:28.349
OK, back to these poor tacos
that have been abandoned.

00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:30.015
Some collard greens
on top of the beans.

00:41:33.534 --> 00:41:35.506
And you don't want
to overstuff these,

00:41:35.506 --> 00:41:36.880
but you want them
to be generous.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.890
But overstuffed are
too hard to eat.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.270
And then whatever you want.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.070
If you want some extra chile,
you can do some of the chile.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:49.430
A little bit of creme
fraiche, a few radishes.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.160
So when you do
radishes for tacos,

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.020
though, they need
to be paper thin.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.516
So either a really sharp
knife or a mandoline--

00:41:56.516 --> 00:41:58.480
if you feel
comfortable using one.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.310
It's a great tool for
efficiency, as well.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.720
I don't care that much
about efficiency in general,

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.630
but I understand that people
who don't cook for a living--

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.140
they need it to be efficient.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:16.070
And so I love giving
those tips when I can,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.000
OK, and then some
cilantro flowers,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.060
which totally change the
game on how pretty a taco is.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.239
SPEAKER: Flowers make
everything beautiful.

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:30.780
Look at that!

00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:36.705
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Then
you crack open a beer.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.815
OK, so there's some
little vegetarian tacos.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.900
And that's it.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.820
SPEAKER: Lovely.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.550
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Oh, no!

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.270
That's not it.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.070
SPEAKER: The salsa.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.120
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I'm
talking about aluminum

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:01.300
and forgot all about
the tomatillo salsa.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.125
This salsa, by the way, I
love it with fried eggs.

00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:07.330
I eat a lot of eggs, too.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.950
So fried eggs, tomatillos.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:09.940
It's good on chicken.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.130
It's good on grilled corn.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.830
You can put it on sandwiches--

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.820
mayo and then a little
bit of tomatillo salsa.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.644
Some turkey, some
pickled jalapenos.

00:43:19.644 --> 00:43:20.560
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.570
Those both look amazing.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.880
So I think we're going to
open it up to some questions.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.260
I'm sure you guys have a couple.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:26.980
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Anything.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.790
SPEAKER: Anything.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:29.360
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Cooking-related.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.887
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
forage them?

00:43:30.887 --> 00:43:32.470
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
No, I don't forage.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.030
So purslane in San
Francisco, which

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.890
is primarily where I shop-- so
definitely farmer's markets.

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.120
But even a co-op market like
Rainbow Grocery sells purslane.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:49.000
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Oh, I don't know

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.900
if I've had that experience.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.930
I've seen the one in Rainbow.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:51.888
It's in little bundles.

00:43:51.888 --> 00:43:52.990
It's still small.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.880
I mean, it grows
long and spindly,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.670
and it also grows
short and squat.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.770
If you've seen a
flavor difference,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:03.620
it could be just where it is
in the season and the soil.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.120
But--

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.328
AUDIENCE: What about nettles?

00:44:05.328 --> 00:44:07.910
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Nettles
I see everywhere now.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.410
I've even seen those
at big grocery stores.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.700
God, I would not want
to forage for nettles.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.030
My first experience with
nettles was in Wales hiking,

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:20.560
and I had no idea
what they were.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.790
That was not a good experience.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.640
But yeah, I'm
seeing that around.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.185
Something like burdock
I would seek out.

00:44:27.185 --> 00:44:28.810
Although I have seen
it in Whole Foods,

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:31.690
I would seek it out
from a Japanese market

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.619
if you can find--

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:34.660
it's fun, too, if you want
to seek something out.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:40.257
It's an adventure to go
find this cool thing.

00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:42.090
I don't know if it's
still a good resource--

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:43.750
I haven't used it in years--

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.880
but Chowhound is
a site that used

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.930
to have forums where
people would say,

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.139
has anyone found burdock
in Mountain View?

00:44:52.139 --> 00:44:53.680
And then people
would respond and say

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.620
where they had found it.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.290
So that's one way you
could maybe seek it out.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.623
But definitely farmer's markets.

00:44:57.623 --> 00:45:00.900
And ask farmers if they grow.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:06.805
Sometimes, too, when a
farmer hears enough requests,

00:45:06.805 --> 00:45:07.930
they will start growing it.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:12.130
The reason we grow so much
Romaine in this country

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.360
is not because it's good for
the earth to grow mostly Romaine

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.610
or because it's good for
us or because Romaine

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.380
is the best-- although I
like it in a lot of things.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.220
It's because it's what
they think will sell.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.840
So if somebody thinks that
something else will sell,

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.100
they'll start growing it.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.100
Farmers right now are
sitting on cilantro blossoms.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.350
They don't know they
have a market for them

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.220
until people start
asking for them.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.790
So once people start saying,
hey, I have this cookbook,

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.730
or I saw on the Washington
Post about cilantro blossoms,

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.430
do you have any?

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:44.030
They're like, yeah.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.113
I'll bring some next week.

00:45:45.113 --> 00:45:47.320
And then they get to
make money off that, too.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.680
But as far as the weeds
in the back of the book--

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.980
things like lamb's quarter--

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.940
even though it grows
wild and it is found--

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.320
most people forage it--

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.920
you can grow it.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.980
There's a farmer at
the Ferry building

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.270
who grows lamb's quarter.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.870
I bought a 2 pound
bag of it last week

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:07.090
and made a lamb and
lamb's quarter filo

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:12.490
pie with a Turkish
spice blend mixed in.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.525
And baked it and put
some bee pollen on top.

00:46:16.525 --> 00:46:17.533
It was really good.

00:46:17.533 --> 00:46:19.074
AUDIENCE: You
should've brought some.

00:46:19.074 --> 00:46:19.550
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Huh?

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.980
AUDIENCE: Should
have brought some.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.550
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
I should have.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.050
I'm not going to be
able to eat all of it.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:23.800
That would have been weird.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.258
I think I would have gotten in
trouble if I just passed out

00:46:26.258 --> 00:46:29.080
a homemade filo pie,
already a piece missing.

00:46:31.195 --> 00:46:32.570
SPEAKER: It would
have been fine.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:35.622 --> 00:46:37.330
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Yeah, I think anywhere

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.950
that buys farm direct--

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:44.300
a grocery store that buys farm
direct-- and that's increasing.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.230
Do you guys have Good
Eggs delivery down here?

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.060
Good Eggs-- it's a
grocery delivery company

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.330
in San Francisco.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.010
They have things
like cilantro flowers

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.090
and shiso and some other things.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.590
I think you'll see
this more and more,

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:00.070
which is why I think
this book was timely.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.360
More and more people want a
greater diversity of food.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.530
They're eating it
in restaurants.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.560
They're eating nettles
on their pizza, right?

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.694
And they're like, I
want some nettles.

00:47:07.694 --> 00:47:10.360
And so those things are going to
start showing up more and more.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.400
Hopefully-- because it
is good for us and it is

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.174
good for the soil to not have
just one crop growing in it.

00:47:16.174 --> 00:47:17.590
SPEAKER: And if
you have something

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.050
that I've found that you
really, really want and you

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.990
go to a specialty store,
they can order it for you

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.400
as long as it's in season.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.610
They might not just
have a big ask for it.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.345
But you can find it,
usually, if you ask.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.470
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Totally.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.480
Bi-Rite Market in
San Francisco--

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.636
if you went in and you said,
I want some flowering dill,

00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:37.510
they'll say, OK, I'll
reach out to my farmers

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.280
and see if I can find something.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.010
For sure.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.670
Yeah.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.030
SPEAKER: Does anyone else
have any more questions?

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.570
It'll be that funky thing
where I ask it back.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:47.320
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
What did you guys think

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.820
about the-- did it make it
around, the smoked fig leaves?

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:50.820
What did you guys think?

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.780
SPEAKER: Where did that end up?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.070
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
It's intoxicating.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.090
And this is a year old.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.550
This is from last year.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.120
So good.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.321
So I make a sugar out of
this and make shortbread.

00:47:59.321 --> 00:47:59.820
Yeah?

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:02.860
SPEAKER: Do you--

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.040
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: I
think they're too thick.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.010
I've never tried that.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.360
Even if you steamed
them first, maybe.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.860
But they're better-- and
they're a strong flavor.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.420
Grape leaves aren't
a strong flavor,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:17.170
but fig leaves are a
really strong flavor.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.240
I like them more--

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.570
they infuse something or they're
powdered into a spice blend

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.140
or to sugar.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.690
But to eat them like a
dolma would be pretty--

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:27.180
when you wrap fish in
them, you unwrap the fish

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.020
and eat the fish.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.040
And it's imparted its
flavor to the fish.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.770
So I think somebody like
dolma, they'd be too strong.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.460
Well, 18 Reasons was
the cooking school.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.960
It's on 18th street
in the Mission.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.230
I left as the program
director in December.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.720
But I'm going to
be teaching there--

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.970
I'm blanking on the date--
maybe the 15th of September

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:46.455
I'm teaching there?

00:48:46.455 --> 00:48:47.700
So I'm still going to
keep teaching there.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.033
It's a wonderful cooking school.

00:48:49.033 --> 00:48:50.820
It's for home cooks only.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.234
It's actually a
nonprofit organization.

00:48:53.234 --> 00:48:55.650
So all the money that they
make in that little 18th street

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.670
event space funds
free cooking classes

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:02.740
all over the Bay Area in
low income communities.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.390
So if you live in the city
or if you want something

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.532
to do out one night,
it's a fun place to go.

00:49:09.532 --> 00:49:10.740
All sorts of cooking classes.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.670
Quirky stuff, too, like
breakfasts of Southeast Asia,

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.130
and I'm teaching
flavors of Azerbaijan.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.030
Yep.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.450
My best friend growing
up was from Baku,

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.390
and her family
got asylum outside

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:28.990
of Nashville, Tennessee.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.437
And she lived walking
distance from my house.

00:49:31.437 --> 00:49:32.520
And I grew up around food.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.250
I mean, again-- southern
family, lots of cooking.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.990
But I mean the food
that her-- so she

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.900
lived with her mother, her
father, her grandparents,

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.080
their crazy husky
named [? Kazbek ?] who

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.552
did not understand any
English, And her brother.

00:49:49.552 --> 00:49:51.260
And there was so much
food in that house.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.718
I mean, her
grandmother just cooked

00:49:52.718 --> 00:49:54.900
all day-- made fresh bread.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.020
Every dinner was just a feast.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.850
You come near the kitchen
and they're feeding you.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.860
And that's still the
food that I crave,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.010
and it's still how I cook.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:10.980
And it's a mix of-- because
all these places that have--

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.420
sort of like Sicilian food.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.580
When you have an area
that has been conquered

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.500
by so many different people,
the food becomes fascinating.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.430
So Azerbaijan has
been-- you have

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:24.000
Russian influence, Armenian
influence, Persian influence,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.230
Turkish influence.

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.440
The food is just
ridiculously good.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.867
So I'm teaching a class on that.

00:50:29.867 --> 00:50:31.575
SPEAKER: So thank you
so much for showing

00:50:31.575 --> 00:50:32.250
us these great recipes.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.480
MICHELLE MCKENZIE: Yeah,
thank you for having me.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.729
SPEAKER: I'm really excited
to hear back from you guys

00:50:35.729 --> 00:50:37.170
about all the great
stuff that you

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.330
do with all the amazing
recipes you have.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:40.240
MICHELLE MCKENZIE:
Yeah, thank you.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:40.823
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:50:40.823 --> 00:50:43.590
[APPLAUSE]
