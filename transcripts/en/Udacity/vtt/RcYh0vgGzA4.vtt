00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.300
So we can look at two
different policies or

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.390
models that make sense for
commercial environments.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.861
We're going to start with orders
called the Clark-Wilson policy.

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:15.670
So Clark-Wilson policy says
that users should be able to

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.580
access certain programs or applications.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.970
Objects are constrained and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.180
certain objects can only be
accessed by certain programs.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.820
So the way you think
about the policy is that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.340
somebody says this user should have
access to this application, and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.710
somebody says this application
should have access to these objects,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.990
so that's what the user can then
gain access to those objects.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.340
And only when they're
running those applications.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.970
So if I want separation-of-duty, for
example, where the same person should be

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.410
able to do things that could
potentially lead to fraud, then we

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.760
can just say that user Alice cannot
execute both of those applications.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.790
So, you can do one and
somebody else will need to

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.540
be able to run the other application and
that's how we separate the two duties

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.710
associated with the two
applications that we have here.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.910
So, Clark Wilson essentially was
developed for commercial settings.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.270
The second one is more about
the conflict of interest requirement,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.390
how we address that.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.390
And the name of the policy is
called Chinese Wall Policy,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.680
and we'll see why this is
an appropriate name for it.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.680
So the deals, as we said,
with conflict of interest and

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.690
what you can access or cannot access
depends on what you have seen so far.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.150
So what you've seen so far,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.360
if it has no conflict with the next
thing you're asking for then it's okay.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.910
If not, then we're going to deny access.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.920
So how do we decide when
do you have a conflict or

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
the absence of that
conflict of interest?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
To explain this conflict of interest and
the Chinese Wall Policy a little bit

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.000
more, let's say we have
a document on a system.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.445
Now some documents
are financial documents

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:03.755
that pretend to different banks.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.745
So Chase, Wells Fargo,
Bank of America, whatever it is.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:10.875
So this grouping here, these are all the
documents that are for Bank of America.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.380
These are all the documents for
Wells Fargo and so on.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.920
Okay, similarly we have other
documents that pertain to, let's say,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.770
oil companies.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.460
So some documents are Exxon,
others Shell, Chevron, and so on.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.660
The reason we have this outer box
around all the bank documents or

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.360
oil company documents is that
this is a conflict class.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.560
Chase has a conflict with Wells Fargo
because they're in the same

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.590
kind of business so
they compete with each other.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.220
So the conflict class is, you know,
these documents form the conflict.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.710
Similarly, Exxon would have
a conflict with Shell and Chevron.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.280
So these documents are in
this other conflict class.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.970
Okay.
So Chinese Wall Policy

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.780
basically says a user can access
any object as long as he or she

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.460
has not accessed an object from another
company In the same conflict class.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.060
So let's say user Alice accesses Exxon,
okay, a document pertaining to Exxon.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.510
She can because so
far she has accessed nothing, so

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.350
there's no conflict that we can see.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.560
As soon as she accesses a document
from this class, from Exxon.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.740
She cannot access anything in these
other classes that are in the same

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.530
conflict class.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.270
So she can't access something
that belongs to Shell or Chevron.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.150
Can she then go and access
a document that pertains to Chase?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.300
Yes, that's in a different
conflict class.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.540
There's no conflict between Chase and
Exxon.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.170
Alice can access this and this.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.710
But as soon as she does Chase
she can't access Wells Fargo, so

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.110
you can basically access
any oil company and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.790
any bank but not two oil companies and
not two banks at the same time.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.310
So we're basically creating these
walls around sets of documents, okay.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.330
That a conflict exists across those and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.390
that's why it's called
a Chinese Wall Policy.
