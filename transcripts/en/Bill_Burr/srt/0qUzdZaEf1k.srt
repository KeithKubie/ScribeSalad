1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,660
Hey, what's going on is bill burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,661 --> 00:00:07,150
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,560

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,270
yes. Checking in on you. Uh, March 29th.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,840
Oh my God. This month is almost, oh,

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,090
did you have a good month?
Well, that's good. Um,

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,350
I just have so much stuff to talk about.
I don't even know where to begin.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,131
First of all,

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,810
last night I watched the
first hour and a half of that,

10
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,550
the zen of Garry Shandling,

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,920
the Judd Apatow documentary on
the great genius Gary Shandling.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,180
And I'm, I got to tell you, judge,
did that Guy Proud? It's unbelievable.

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:51,080
You have to see it. A comedian buddy
of mine told me, he goes, dude,

14
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,580
have you seen this thing yet?
You got to see it.

15
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:56,840
Thank God he told me about it and I
went and I recorded this goddamn thing,

16
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,590
you know, and I'm telling you right
now, you got to see him. All right?

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,710
I told you last week
you have to watch Barry.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,850
If you sat down and you watched
Barry Storing Bill Hader, uh,

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,350
Henry Winkler and all those
guys, uh, you know, I was right.

20
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,060
Okay.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,950
When are you gonna learn to trust when
I tell you something on HBO is going to

22
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:22,240
be good. Um, anyways,

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,060
I was watching that documentary and I
guess Gary Shandling just kept diaries.

24
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:33,530
His whole life was basically his entire
life and he was writing all this stuff

25
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:37,580
and overcoming fear and trying to
get better as a comedian and a,

26
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,220
it was like Erie watching,

27
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:44,420
like how much I related to it because
I never kept a diary. I tried one time,

28
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:48,260
I was just too walled off emotionally.
I remember I wrote like one line,

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,750
my name's bill,
I'm 28.

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,930
I'm a stand up comedian
and that's as far as I got.

31
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,390
And then I think I threw that book out
so it's biodegrading somewhere cause it's

32
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:06,830
made out of paper. Um, but anyways,

33
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,750
I used to always, I would write
down on cocktail Napkins, dad,

34
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,650
right. Commit to everything, be positive.
I actually used that thing, you know,

35
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:16,910
in the Catholic Church,

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,570
I can't remember the part of the mass
where you do the sign of the cross on your

37
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:23,720
forehead, your mouth and then over
your heart, which means you know,

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,410
God in your mind, you and your mouth
and in your heart or something stuff.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,880
Like I used it as like a positive
side rather than, you know,

40
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:36,050
God's only son died on this thing that
I'm now fucking drawing on my face.

41
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,520
I actually, I use it as like a positive
side, like no negative thoughts.

42
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,420
Um, I don't know why I thought
I'd put a positive sign of,

43
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,770
of my mouth so much to the Shit I
say is fucking curmudgeony at best.

44
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,800
But it was just more just
committing to everything. And um,

45
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,930
cause when we first moved down to New
York, it was intimidating thing. And uh,

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,820
I get on my heels and
then I wouldn't have a,

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,090
and then I'd have to
wait like another five,

48
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,830
six days before get stage time again,

49
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,831
just fucking hating myself for going
up there and acted like a little guy.

50
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,430
Um, although you're not supposed to say
that now, right? That's not progressive.

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,550
You know why you saying that? You're
acting like a little girl. Okay. Okay.

52
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,150
I was acting like a,
somebody who's gender neutral.

53
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,830
Why can't you just say that she was
scared without insulting the opposite sex?

54
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,980
Well, I don't know, I guess, you
know, I guess I guess said something.

55
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,450
I need to work on there.
I happy. Yeah. Okay. Kay,

56
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,980
can you shave your legs?
Um,

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,440
AH, fuck. I have fun. Last night on
stage, man, I went up and I was just,

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm sick of a bunch of shit
in my act and I was just like,

59
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm not talking about any of that shit.
And I just meandered,

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,930
meandered is the key word there. But I
had a good time. I apologize to the crowd,

61
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,780
but I, you know what units? It was
a fucking Wednesday. All right.

62
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,660
Wednesday's a work day. Um, but anyways,

63
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,340
it's a wonderful week.
It's a wonderful week in Los Angeles.

64
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,990
Nothing's on fire.
No one got me to evidentaly.

65
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,150
They got all the crepes.
Um,

66
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,360
all right. Oh, I got to promote
here. Bar still rough and rowdy.

67
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,000
If you've missed the last few podcasts,
first of all,

68
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,940
it's one of the great paper
views you're ever going to watch.

69
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,850
It's just regular people
that enjoy fighting.

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,440
They want to get on TV and they are
willing to fight each other. Okay.

71
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,090
It's like, I don't know, I don't
even know how to describe it. It's a,

72
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,710
it's a juggernaut and it's like 15,
16 bucks and a,

73
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:55,711
I'm going to be at the next one and I
will be ringside announcing even though I,

74
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,000
I bet, I know the jab is, I know
what a hook is. Overhand, right.

75
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,660
I know what a straight writers too,
cause I watched the documentary, uh,

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,840
leap boom by, yeah, I watched that a
long time ago. But other than than that,

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,870
I'm just going to be making fun of Shit.
Like I always do.

78
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,630
And hopefully one of those regular people
won't try to beat the crap out of me

79
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,460
afterwards. Um, I dunno. I'm
so fucking excited for it.

80
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,320
And uh, that's going to
be on April 13th. Okay.

81
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,030
You guys, I'm telling you, I, I'm, I'm,
I'm telling you, you got to fucking see.

82
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,490
You got to see the shit. You
know, you don't have to, you know,

83
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:33,070
if you want to miss out and then not
know what anybody's talking about.

84
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,830
Come Monday when you standing
around the fucking water cooler.

85
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,120
Um, and, uh, this is the last
promo thing I have to do. Um,

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,490

00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,430
Dot Events for an updated list of shows.

90
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,930
I hate doing promos in the beginning
of the podcast because it just kills my

91
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,310
fucking flow, you know, now I
just feel like I don't, you know,

92
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,400
like I'm sitting in a fucking waiting
room. I don't feel funny anymore.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,140
I don't know who I am. Um,
oh, here's one for you.

94
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,020
The theme of this podcast,
this half hour is, is,

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,440
is late to the party. All right? And,

96
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,880
um, which is really a
theme to my life. Okay.

97
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,300
I was late for everything.
You know,

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,940
I stayed back in first
grade. Boom, right there.

99
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,380
I was just a year behind my
whole fucking life. All right.

100
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,500
I wasn't late getting my driver's license.
I got that thing immediately.

101
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,660
The day I was eligible.
I did the old right there.

102
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,750
Fred took it on a stick shift too.
It's one of the main,

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,090
that's probably the only manly
thing I've ever done in my life.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,680
I had no choice. That's all
we had in our, in our family.

105
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,570
We always had sticks shifts. Um,
cause they were fucking cheap.

106
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,820
Um,
also it's more fun.

107
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:07,940
You fell you'd drive in the fucking car
instead of just getting in some go cart

108
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,400
down there. I hate automatic
transmission. You know,

109
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:14,720
there's only a few left out there.
I think the, uh, the Volkswagen Gti,

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,670
there's one or two BMWs is probably a
Porsche. That's something interesting.

111
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,030
There is something that I could look up.
How many standards?

112
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Standard treads mission
cars left in pro duction.

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,870
All right.
The disappearing stick shift.

114
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:43,871
Less than 3% of cars sold in the
u s still have a stick shift.

115
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:44,541
All right.

116
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:49,310
2017 cars that still offer
a manual transmission.

117
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,680
Let's see what we got here.
Well, we have is slow Internet

118
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,180
by the way. My buddy called me
up and you know I have a deli,

119
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,650
missed this amazing Celtics road trip
where they went for no coming in there.

120
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,180
The walking wounded, everybody's out
and all the young kids is stepping up.

121
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:12,170
And last night they played
the Utah Jazz and I guess, uh,

122
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,540
was a Jaylen brown almost said Jalen
rose hit a three point and a winning.

123
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,800
I heard Jason Tatum stepped up. Uh, I'm
sure I'm missing it. I'm missing by,

124
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,400
I have to miss it. I got the
kid, I got the kids. So I, uh,

125
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:28,670
if you guys want to know what's going on
with the new episodes of muppet babies,

126
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,370
I'm on. I'm on that. All right.

127
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,850
Gonzo Baby Gonzo had some little chicks
and in the beginning of the episode,

128
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,560
Foz a little Fozzie bear
is doing is bad jokes.

129
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,160
And he went to open his mouth
and it sounded like a fart noise.

130
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,030
And somebody goes, hey, you should say,
excuse me. And I was like, Holy Shit.

131
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:54,230
Is this going to be about passing gas
and how you handle that in a public forum

132
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,900
like this really progress compared to
the shit that I saw as a kid. You know,

133
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,130
it was just the alphabet.
They didn't deal with bodily functions,

134
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:05,190
but that wasn't the point far as he goes.

135
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,710
I didn't make that noise and they looked
up and they saw that there was all

136
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:10,650
these geese were flying
south for the fucking winner.

137
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,810
So then God so got all
fucking afraid that chickens,

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,880
we're going to fly south in.
Selfishly,

139
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,640
even though chickens don't fly
south south for the winter,

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,140
they're doing it for survival.
But selfishly Gonzo is so fucking needy.

141
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,080
He tries to, you know, keep hiding the
chicken so that the mother, it's weird.

142
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,230
It's like they're all little
fucking puppet animals and
then there's like a real

143
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:37,620
person that kind of takes care of
them and bring some lunch and shit.

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,910
There's like this sort of like,
I don't know what's going on there.

145
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,930
Some sort of muppet beastiality that
this woman had all of these kids,

146
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,830
I have no idea.
You know,

147
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,250
and evidently fucked a frog and a bear
and all kinds of ship or it, I don't know.

148
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,510
One of them is hers a pig.
So anyways,

149
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,050
I'll fucking episode this.
Goddamn, I don't know what he is.

150
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,290
He's like a a vulture.
Maybe

151
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,160
I'm a two can,
I don't know what he is.

152
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,870
He's trying to hide these fucking
chickens. And in the end, uh, the mom,

153
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,860
you know, the, uh, the
puppet groupie there,

154
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,750
she comes out and she says like,
listen,

155
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,150
you're dumb little fuck chickens
do not fly south for the winter.

156
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,430
They're going to be in the coop.
They're going to be fine.

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,470
And then Gonzo is all happy in.

158
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:29,700
What upset me was that the
chickens didn't get mad at him.

159
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,180
In the end, they should have
been like, wait a minute,

160
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,440
she'll like for your own selfish needs,

161
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,070
we would have fucking starved to
death just because you're, you're,

162
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,600
you're so fucking codependent.

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,810
And then of course he would try to talk
his way out of it being like, well,

164
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,160
I mean it doesn't really make a difference
cause you don't fly south anyways.

165
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,940
He says, yeah, yeah, but you
didn't know that digit guides up.

166
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,300
You didn't know that
and you will fucking contend.

167
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,420
What the fuck are we going to stay
outside the fucking snow. You can't.

168
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,010
You're crooked. Bigged cunt.
And then God's, I'll be like,

169
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:07,710
I always knew that you thought I was
less than other people fight and then he

170
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,320
would make it about his fucking
nose. See, that's why you can't,

171
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,220
you got to stay on topic because I just
fucked up the argument for the chickens.

172
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,260
Don't make fun of his beak. You keep
it on, on, on topic. I should say.

173
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,580
He keep it on fucking topic about the
fact that you're a codependent cycle and

174
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:30,870
you had information that you knew that
as far as you knew was pertinent to my

175
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:35,360
own fucking survival. And you kept that
to yourself, didn't you? You little cunt.

176
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,730
So that's the shit that I've been
watching. Um, I know the Bruins it there,

177
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,500
they were doing well and what
are the, see, what have I done?

178
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,760
What have they been doing? They lost
in a shootout to Columbus five, four.

179
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,900
They lost in overtime to one to St
Louis. So there's two points. We go,

180
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:56,560
we beat Dallas. There's four points
for that week. Four of a possible six.

181
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,060
I'd say that's a good week.
And then this week we beat Minnesota.

182
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,870
And over time that's two points.

183
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,370
Then we lost in a shootout to win a pig.
Uh,

184
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,340
so we've got three out of
four points cruising along.

185
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,120
Yeah.

186
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,730
Now we've got a couple of home
games against the Florida teams,

187
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,320
the Tampa Bay lightning and
the new fucking a broad street,

188
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:23,321
the Southbridge speech bullies and the
Florida panthers with the most fighting

189
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:28,820
fucking mansion in the league.
I mean,

190
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:32,300
I think they, uh, I think they're almost
going to have 30 fights this year. I mean,

191
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:36,780
those people are out of control.
Oh, it's fucking assholes.

192
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:39,270
They all wrote,
they all ruined the Goddamn game.

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,630
That was fucking constant watch
Olympic hockey. Not even them.

194
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:43,470
I can't even blame them.

195
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,290
It's just people that aren't
content with being millionaires.

196
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,840
They want to be billionaires
and now they have to fucking,

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,710
let's just level it out.
Let's mainstream it up.

198
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,220
Let's alienate our core fucking fed base.

199
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah.

200
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,960
And try to get all these fucking
douchebags that watch the Kardashians to

201
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,350
fucking watch rivalry, rivalry
Wednesdays, which they're not going to do.

202
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,320
All right. And the theme,
this is good. Everyone.

203
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,590
Did you guys write in and tell me how,
you know,

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,510
let me hear your late to the
party stories. I got married
late. I had a kid late.

205
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:20,590
I started stand up leg. I stayed
back in school. I got laid lake.

206
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,920
Yeah. I fucking had go to summer school.
I was just always, everybody, every,

207
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,940
everybody was always like turning
the corner. I was always like,

208
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,310
why not?
Weird for me.

209
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,933
MMM.

210
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,510
I become progressive.
Like

211
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:37,890
yeah.

212
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,570
My ideas of, of, of, of of everything
else is like from fucking 20 years ago.

213
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,370
So here's another thing that I am,

214
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,390
I am 30 fucking years late.

215
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,110
I am so late to the party on this
band that they're actually doing their

216
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:59,421
farewell tour and half the people aren't
even in the band anymore to what are

217
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,530
the first two original members?
So,

218
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,343
mmm.

219
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,850
Doing the goddamn comedy jam and all of
that and like trying to do, you know,

220
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,150
pat terror and learn these,
these double bass drum songs.

221
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,670
Uh, now I, and then, uh, my Trump teacher,

222
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,740
Dave took me to go see miss sugar.

223
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,250
All of a sudden that whole
world opened up to me.

224
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,840
So now I'm backtracking to all of
this shit that I vaguely remember.

225
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:31,200
My younger brothers, they were into it
go going, you got to hear this shit.

226
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:35,340
And I was listening to a ribose has it.
So

227
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,380
it's like a that edits.

228
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,930
No,

229
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,530
just that a cow.
Oh,

230
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,690
you know, you're singing along. Six is
say, say that's a good fucking song.

231
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,990
I listening to that shit.
And uh,

232
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,060
when Metallica and all these other bands
came out, it was so fucking fast. I,

233
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,400
I just,
my ear couldn't catch up with it.

234
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,730
And now I'm going back
30 years fucking late. I,

235
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:10,250
so guess what album I fight
downloaded yesterday? Slayer,

236
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,480
south of heaven. I was
watching, I don't know how I,

237
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:19,340
I just was watching, like trying to learn,
you know, all this double Bass Shit.

238
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,780
I was just on this youtube thing.

239
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,880
And then eventually if
you're going to do that shit,

240
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,840
eventually you're gonna run into Dave
Lombardo and slayer. So it was like,

241
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:28,400
I got to fucking see that.
I go why?

242
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:32,540
I watched this mini documentary I guess
is a new documentary coming out on him.

243
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:36,440
So I watched this older
one from like 2004 and um,

244
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,910
I've always tried to get into
the band and it was just always,

245
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,940
it was just was beyond
what my ears understood.

246
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,370
So I heard that song south
to heaven and that's it.

247
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm done.
So I love that album.

248
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,010
And I guess that was an album they play,

249
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,610
made a conscious effort to play a little
slower than they did on the previous

250
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,670
album. That's the one that
has like angel of death.

251
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,420
And I listened to that one a little bit
now is like the south they have and I'm

252
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,330
going to fucking, I got to, I
can't go from like, you know,

253
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,410
listening to poison and Bon Jovi and
all this shit that I listened to to

254
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:17,270
immediately going into that level
of speed. You know, that's like,

255
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,030
that's like when he's sober person
after 20 years decides to start partying

256
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,750
again and they pick up
where they left off,

257
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,160
you're going to have a
fucking heart attack.

258
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,690
So I have to kind of ease my way into it
and this fucking album, which I guess,

259
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,524
you know,

260
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,590
Moron fans of musical fresh,
it's not fast enough,

261
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:39,110
like saying like, that doesn't
even make sense. It's like,

262
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,280
is it a good fucking song?

263
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,650
So I have just been listening to south
of Heaven and whatever the song is after

264
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:46,040
it,

265
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,360
because they do that thing where it just
sort of blends into it and it's fucking

266
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:51,110
hilarious.

267
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,620
I'm going to be 50 in June and I'm
finally listening to slayer and up driving

268
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,210
down the street,
pulling up to red lights.

269
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,420
I got it. I fucking love it. So, uh,

270
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,760
late to the party on
that one 30 years late.

271
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,090
And I know I'm going to listen to this
fucking album a million times and then

272
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm going to get a angel of death.
And I remember a long time ago I had that,

273
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,090
uh, I had the, uh, the,
the Iowa album. Oh,

274
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:23,660
what's the name of the band there?
Jesus Christ with Jody Jordan said,

275
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:27,950
and all those guys, eight, seven
check debt. Thec five bore.

276
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,970
The fuck is in now. Jesus Christ. Don't
say that. I almost said no, they were,

277
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,580
they were the mass. They were the eyes
watch. Ah, fucking what am asshole.

278
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,200
You know what I mean? Listen, I know
who the big four hours anthrax, anthrax,

279
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:46,490
slayer. Megadeath Metallica. I at least
know that. Okay. I'm an I'm new to this.

280
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,260
Please. Please be gentle when you trash
me on social media for not knowing,

281
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,960
uh,
shit.

282
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,700
Thrash Iowa masks.

283
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,220
Let's see what this comes up with.

284
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,730
Why can't I know the name of the
drummer but not the name of the band,

285
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,260
but the fuck does that say about me?
Huh? Oh, speaking of which I did the,

286
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,040
I did the goddamn comedy jam.
Um,

287
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,850
okay, so now they're showing me slip.

288
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,380
Not Fuck. That's right. That's
right. Okay. It's funny, the
first thing that came up,

289
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:29,970
why these 11 bands wear masks?
I Dunno, cause they're smart.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
They want to have a life
after this show's over.

291
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,660
Okay.

292
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,870
Oh, that's the best thing ever. Like
that bucket head. It's fucking genius.

293
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,500
He gets to fucking go around the world
and guns and roses and all these awesome

294
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:47,980
beds. And then the second he doesn't
feel like being that guy anymore.

295
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,450
He just takes the bucket off his head
and the mass goes away. You know,

296
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,350
probably puts it up in a man
bun or something. Looks is
non rock. God is possible.

297
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,390
It just fucking walks away like what's
his face at the end of the usual

298
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,840
suspects,
you know,

299
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,200
straightens out his foot and just
walks right through the crowd.

300
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,920
No one has any fucking idea. Um, anyway,

301
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:17,170
so I did the goddamn comedy jam.
Uh,

302
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,090
thanks everybody. You know, I
played the, uh, I played, uh,

303
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,050
was it Panthera cowboys from hell
and uh,

304
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,520
I thought I had it down. I thought I knew
what I was doing. I got out there, my

305
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,310
Vinnie Paul Costume, I, I actually, I
almost said postmate it, I fucking, uh,

306
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,720
instagrammed it. I grabbed
it. Yolo, my young again.

307
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,730
Um,
the costume that I wore and uh,

308
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,840
that was probably the best part of the
performance was the costumes looking

309
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,100
asshole. You know, Vinny, he's, you
know, he's a Husky fellow, right?

310
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:03,840
So I had like a pillow or a throw pillow
underneath is this fucking shirt and

311
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,010
like a fucking asshole. When I
sat down behind the drums, like I,

312
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,330
I didn't take it off.
I sat there,

313
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:13,080
so it was like I had a kid or something
sitting on my lap and the snare was a

314
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:16,410
little lower than I was used to.
So I fucking got through the song.

315
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,510
I think I fucked up every
single Phil and I got that.

316
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,160
Am I already suck at drums?

317
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:28,140
Why would you add to difficulty with a
pillow and your fucking chest and this

318
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,780
thing up? You know why?
Because it's the comedy jam.

319
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,480
There has to be some sort of comedy.
So I just look,

320
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,780
my double bass playing still whole fucking
thing sucks. So then the closer was,

321
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,670
um,
was a def Leppard pour some sugar on me,

322
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,950
which was a song that
I absolutely fucking,

323
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,340
and not necessarily because it was a bad,
it's a pop song for what it is.

324
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,390
It's a great fucking song.

325
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,391
But here's the reason why I hated it
was because in 1988 my buddy got that

326
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:00,490
fucking tape.
Okay.

327
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,780
And all he did was listened to
that fucking song. Like why don't,

328
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:08,290
can we listen to animal? Can listen to
hysteria? No, no. He just kept fucking,

329
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,750
I remember the time,
he didn't really know the lyrics,

330
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,240
but anytime I would get
to pour some sugar on me,

331
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,150
he'd be like pumping his fist pause.

332
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,300
So was doing the song right

333
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,090
and thank Christ we got out of the middle
part where there's all that busy bass

334
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,170
drum shit that, ah Ha,
well that old shit, right?

335
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,590
We got through all of that,
that whole breakdown thing.

336
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:37,240
And then we're right in the end and I go
to hit the bass drum and no sound comes

337
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,920
out of the bass drum. And
I'm like, what the fuck?

338
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:43,921
And I looked down and my bass drum Beta
had fallen off right in the middle of

339
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,910
the fucking saw. So fortunately I
had the double pedal, so I just,

340
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,410
I just played the, the left one for the
rest of the song. Nobody really noticed,

341
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,370
um, until they got to the end of the
song. And I had to do all my, my songs,

342
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:02,230
fillers and I had nothing. Oh, it's
Paul [inaudible]. Ladies and gentlemen,

343
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,870
welcome to the podcast.
Mr. Paul Versey.

344
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,990
Paul,
can you hear me?

345
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,880
Hey Dude, I'm doing, I'm doing my
podcast. Somebody call you back.

346
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:12,930
I'll be done in about 15.

347
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,810
All right, let's see. Um,

348
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,940
you know, so that, that all
of that shit happened. So I
had such fucking, I hope so.

349
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:27,360
I'm like, I'm going to fucking
murder this song. And I did in a,

350
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,540
in a bad way. I butchered
it. Um, but my standup set,

351
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,450
the thing that actually do for a living
was actually really fun and it was fun

352
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:37,330
to go out there. I wasn't really
being Vinnie Paul, I was just acting.

353
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,360
I was just speaking in a southern accent
and I was talking positively about Ar

354
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,163
15,

355
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,720
which is such a fun thing to do,

356
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,310
um,
in Hollywood

357
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,740
is to dress like a cowboy and then say
why you love Ar 15. So I mean, why,

358
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:02,220
why wouldn't, why wouldn't
you do that? All right.

359
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,330
So anyways, late to the
party, got into parent,

360
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,230
Tara could have seen them live. My younger
brothers were going to go see them.

361
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:15,150
I was like, Eh. [inaudible] I
think I'm okay. I think Mr Right.

362
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:16,650
And I didn't go see them.

363
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,090
Uh,
you know,

364
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,230
just, I don't know when the, when
the fuck did the 1990, they came out,

365
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,380
we're talking, I am literally 30.
I'm 30 years behind the fucking

366
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,160
30 years late.
Wherever the party was.

367
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,010
Like the fucking building doesn't even
exist anymore. How fucking late I am.

368
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:37,910
All right. Continuing, continuing with
the late to the party fucking theme here.

369
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,543
All right.

370
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,710
I finally watched the first moto GP
race and Qatar's that say it and I gotta

371
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,990
tell you something. Okay. For those of
you not into it. That is a professional,

372
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,570
uh,
motorcycle racing at its highest level.

373
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:56,300
It's the formula one of motorcycle racing.

374
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,610
And I have to tell you
something right now.

375
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,130
I don't know why I have to tell you that.
I'm going to tell you something.

376
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,460
I should just fucking, you know, cause I
watched friends, Mcdermott Dermot, right?

377
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,290
I'm going to say something,
right.

378
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,710
I'm going to say something
that fucking sport.

379
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,290
I'm

380
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,940
completely fucking sold on it.

381
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,780
I am a big fan of Andre de Vizios.

382
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,280
So who drives the Ducati and
Italian? Right? I just fucking,

383
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,840
I like love the way rides.

384
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,680
I know Mark Marquez is like the
fucking Derek Jeter or this sport.

385
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:32,010
So whenever I get into a new sport,
you know, it's like Lewis Hamilton.

386
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,630
I'm not going to come into, you know, oh,

387
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,410
this is my first year of watching
Formula One, my favorite drivers,

388
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,070
Lewis Hamilton, the guy who,
fuck it always wins. Um,

389
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,870
so I can't be a markable Aila. I like
Mark Marcus. I'm not saying I'm not a fan,

390
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:49,180
but it's just, I can't be like
some bandwagon guy. So the CEO.

391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,870
So it was a guy watched last year
and I was just like, I like this guy.

392
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:56,100
He's always, you know, he's
always up there, you know,
on the podium or whatever.

393
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,400
He's calming.
I liked him and I liked a Johan Zarko.

394
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,060
I just liked his bike and he was always
up there and he seemed like he didn't

395
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:06,360
have as good a bike is other people that
he was somehow fucking with those guys.

396
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,370
So I watched the first.

397
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,280
MMM.

398
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,280
I watched the first race and uh,
I had missed all the qualifying nic.

399
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,180
Johan Zarko has pulpit
position. I was like, Holy Shit.

400
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,110
Last year his whole story was like,
this guy is like right there,

401
00:25:25,111 --> 00:25:28,830
but shit just kept happening.
Um,

402
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,650
and he didn't quite get over the Hump
and areas. The first race of the year,

403
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,470
the guys got the pole position. So
I watched the race. And by the way,

404
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:38,370
if you think this is a big time
commitment, it's like 22, 23 fucking lap.

405
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:42,570
She can watch the whole race
in 40 minutes. There's no
pit stops. And by the way,

406
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:45,960
it's people racing on motorcycles
going over 200 miles an hour.

407
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,900
Now they're going to say kilometers.
So it's simple math.

408
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:52,410
Every 80 kilometers is 50 miles an hour.
Okay?

409
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,820
So a lot of times they go in
like you know, 240 kilometers.

410
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:00,810
That means they're going to buy 150 miles
an hour. And then on the straightaways,

411
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,600
when they go by,
all the fans to start finish line,

412
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,530
they will get up over 300 320
when they get to 320 they go,

413
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:10,080
they're going 200 fucking miles an hour

414
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,780
on a motorcycle and there's someone
right on their ass and they have a big

415
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:19,940
fucking turn that they have to slow
down for. And the big fucking move,

416
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,050
who has the balls to break last usually
comes out of the turn the fastest.

417
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,630
However, if you go with, if
you brake too fucking late,

418
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,730
you might go to widen the guy who will
cut into neath IA or you could go flying

419
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:35,280
off your bike and die. All right. Now,

420
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:37,500
if that's not enough excitement
for you that I, I don't know.

421
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,820
I don't want to tell you.
So anyway,

422
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:44,821
so I'm watching this race and hand Zarko
in the lead for the whole fucking race

423
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,310
and they keep talking about his front
tire cause he's averaging like, I don't,

424
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,660
I don't know what they're, his average
was like one 50, 150 kilometers.

425
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,170
Uh, which would be what, oh, Jesus built.

426
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,340
That's like a little over a hundred
miles an hour is what he was average.

427
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:06,810
And that's, you know, with all the turns
slowing down and all that shit, right? Um,

428
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,860
I'm sitting there watching this
fucking guy and I'm like, Holy Shit.

429
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:13,020
Is this guy going to go wire to wire
and winning and they keep talking.

430
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,470
This was something, I need
people into this, this, uh,

431
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
into racing to explain to me.

432
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:23,120
They just kept talking about yo hands
Arccos front tire and saying it's

433
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,640
eventually it's going to wear down and
he's going to have a fucking problem.

434
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,060
And before it happened to him and
happened to Valentino Rossi and all of a

435
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:34,590
sudden, like he was in second place and
all of a sudden on one lap he got, um,

436
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,760
he got passed by like two people. But
then it's like he made this adjustment,

437
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,240
which is why he's evidently the
one of the greats of all time.

438
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,990
And he was able to come back and still
make the podium and come in third place.

439
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,150
But when it happened to Zarko,
he just,

440
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,490
he got passed by two people
at the same fucking time.

441
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,510
You went from first place the whole race
down to not even be in on the fucking

442
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,300
podium.
And then he ended up finishing eighth.

443
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,650
And why doesn't he have the same
fucking tires as the other guys?

444
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,150
How come,
how come his tires are wearing down

445
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,240
faster than other people?

446
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,480
What the fuck does this Zarko guy
have to do to get the best shit?

447
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,150
I know, I'm probably fucking this up.
So anyways, uh, to vizios so right.

448
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:20,940
He was like in ninth
place starting the race.

449
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:24,690
So I was kind of keeping an eye on him,
you know,

450
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,810
like what's his face when I was
watching the Formula One when uh,

451
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,160
Valtteri Botox started way in the back
because of the gear shift penalty, uh,

452
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,520
changing out the gearbox fucking
a penalty gear shift penalty,

453
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,280
the gearbox penalty and um,

454
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,310
I just watched him slowly move his way
up through the field and then the last

455
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,530
two laps of the race.
Okay. He's in first place.

456
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,590
Mark Mark has is in second
place and last year.

457
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:53,250
This is like the Brady
fucking Peyton manning.

458
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,590
This is Starbuck for stabler Elway
verse Montana. This is just like,

459
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,970
okay,
this is Jordan verse Dominic Week Wilkins.

460
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,940
Doug can contact one of the
great chaebol a first Russell,

461
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:07,260
whatever the fuck you want to call it.

462
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,470
And these guys were fucking writing
like maniacs for the last two laps.

463
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Marquez is right on divisio sows ass and
he just knew it wasn't easy going gonna

464
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:19,590
pass them.

465
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,560
It's when is he going to pass him because
he did this all fucking last year.

466
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,490
It drove me nuts,
which is why I became a Davinci also fan.

467
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,130
You got to gotta to root for the underdog,
right.

468
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,270
So there's like fucking two or
three corners left and they're like,

469
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,890
I don't think Marquez is close enough.

470
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:39,210
And all of a sudden he braked later than
Divisio so name was right on his ass

471
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:44,211
and the next fucking corner he fucking
goes underneath divisio so and passed

472
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,470
them. And I didn't even
realize I was that into it.

473
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,160
I was in the living room and
I would just went like, Nah,

474
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,210
my wife comes running into,
what's the matter?

475
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,410
She thought there was something
wrong with that kid. So he does,

476
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:05,440
he goes dives underneath the visio.
So at this point,

477
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:10,300
you know that go in like 90 fucking
miles an hour in a turn with their knee,

478
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,210
like a like an eighth of an
inch off the fucking ground.

479
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,840
And he ducks underneath them.
But he was going so fast,

480
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:21,670
he went a little wide and then divisio
so went underneath him and then it was

481
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:25,870
just a fucking flat out race on
a straightaway, just pinning it

482
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,450
all the way to the fucking finish line.
Individ CEO so wins it. It was just an,

483
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,330
it's everything that's missing in Formula
One as far as like, I love Formula One,

484
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm going to continue to watch it,
but I just fucking hate lawyers.

485
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,590
It's just a race to the first corner and
whoever's in the first corner is going

486
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,860
to be driving and clean air
and everything. Everybody
is so equally matched.

487
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:50,350
No one's going to be able to pass them
and then you just have to wait for

488
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:54,920
someone to fuck up in the
pits. Like that's the exciting
passing. It's just like,

489
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,470
can this guy get out of the pits before
that second place guy comes around again?

490
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,300
Um, I dunno just, but if you're,

491
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:07,960
if you're missing passing and Formula One,
uh,

492
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:12,480
I would suggest jumping sports. You can
watch them both. I mean, it's, they,

493
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,320
it's not that much that you're committing
to 40 races a year on a 365 days.

494
00:31:17,321 --> 00:31:21,520
I mean, he can tape them, you can watch
them whenever you want to. So, uh,

495
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,550
I am 100% sold on this fucking sport
and I'm actually going to be taking a

496
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:32,821
vacation coming up when I'm celebrating
my 50th birthday and I just realized I'm

497
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:38,761
going to be in the vicinity of a that
race in Spain and I'm trying to talk my

498
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,820
wife into going with me. That's my, uh,

499
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,460
and I'll just be like,
come on honey.

500
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:48,340
It's my 50th birthday and
she's such a sweetheart.

501
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,170
I think she's going to do it by the way,

502
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:55,230
a honorary mentioned to a cow crutch
low coming in fourth place and run a

503
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,670
writing a great race and having one of
the great fucking names of all time,

504
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,440
cal crutch Lowe is such a fucking
cool name. It doesn't even sound like,

505
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,900
it sounds like an alias.
Like if I was a cop,

506
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,440
I wouldn't believe him if cuts
him under age drinking. All right,

507
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:15,900
give me your names. What's your
name? Uh, cal crutch low. Alright,

508
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,630
get up against the wall. He
going downtown. I just got
it. God, it's my real name.

509
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,650
Um, anyways, all I gotta do a little
read here. I got to do a little re,

510
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,390
I get a little read here. Uh, and
then get on with my fucking day,

511
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,350
cause I got another show. I'm coming
up where I'm going to be playing drums.

512
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,830
I've got to make sure I tightened down
the fucking bass drum beater before I

513
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,590
play.
I'm doing a Dean del Rey's is,

514
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,660
is uh, what was it, 52nd birthday. And uh,

515
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,500
I played drums on his 50th birthday.
It's great. He has a whole standup show.

516
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,450
And then after that he came out for
his 50th birthday with a live band.

517
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,080
He sang the entire AC DC
highway to hell album.

518
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,610
So for his 52nd, he's going
to be singing the, uh,

519
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,030
the entire, uh, power age album.

520
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,880
So I'm playing a couple
of songs off of that,

521
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,620
so I gotta make sure
I have that shit down.

522
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,800
And I'm also gonna make sure that the bass
drum beater is fucking tightened down.

523
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,670
Um, but whatever. And once again,

524
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,570
trying to learn those songs
that I've been learning I,

525
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,680
and really be able to play him a
whole new, I already had a love,

526
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,780
uh, Phil Rudd, but Jesus Christ,
I mean, he's just, he just,

527
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:34,100
it's perfect what that
guy's plays is perfect. Uh,

528
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:37,070
but there's gonna be a bunch of,
you know, big musicians there,

529
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,490
cause dean came up in the, in
that world, the music world,

530
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:43,370
so he knows all of these guys.
Um,

531
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,130
I think there's a flyer somewhere
out there, I believe. I think I,

532
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,590
but actually I believe it's already
fucking sold out. But, um, that's my day.

533
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,010
I'm going to go fucking play drums.
Huh?

534
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,870
I don't know why all you
guys don't become comedians.

535
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,070
You get to be a fucking kid
for the rest of your life. Um,

536
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,510
actually it's not that easy.

537
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,460
After 20 years of
sitting there going like,

538
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:10,850
did I make the biggest mistake of my life?
Then all of a sudden the clouds part,

539
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,680
you know,
unless you have a look,

540
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,590
unless you have a look and then he gets
scooped up early and they chew you up,

541

big believer in their products.

They're the perfect
balance of comfortable fit.

552
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,920
Every month they have new and exciting

tidy whities, you know what I mean?

556

561
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,630
why do they have the title
me on these uses Lens Zig,

562
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,930
Lenzing Lenzing.

563
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,220
That sounds like a metal band that never
made it. Do you remember that band?

564
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:43,200
Lenzing they did a couple of good songs.
Lenzing micro modal,

565
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,700
modal and their underwear.
It's sustainably sourced.
Naturally thought fire,

566
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:51,750
but that starts with beechwood trees
and ends with the most amazing fabric

567
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,680
you've ever experienced.

568
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,120
I have to find a a making
of Lenzing micro modal,

569
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,920
modal. How do you start with trees and
then end up with something that can be up

00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,800
against your body.
You know,

571

but for several,

573

E. L. I. X. Was there a band called that

620
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,150
Hellickson Band said Helix.
Maybe that's why I always fucked that up.

621
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,401
Were they the guys who were like,

622
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:30,401
give me an r o c k and what you got
rock and what are we going to do?

Rock you.

624
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,940
It was like if cheerleaders
made a heavy metal song.

625
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,630
Okay.

626

That's the spirit rebel
against your parents are right.

627
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:51,480
My Internet's not working. All right,
that is the podcast. Have a great weekend.

628
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:56,040
You fucking cunts. I'm going to
be at the Brady that Todd radioed.

629
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,340
He said best the Brady Theater in Tulsa,

Oklahoma with let there be talks.

631
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,480
Dean del Rey and then we're going down
to San Antonio for two shows and I for

632
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:07,111
the life of me,

633
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:12,111
couldn't figure out why it was like 500
fucking bucks a night for a hotel in San

634
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:13,681
Antonio.
I'm like,

635
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:16,920
what do they have some new hipster area
or something and they may can cupcakes

636
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,970
and riding bicycles. Why is
everything so expensive? Well,

637
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:23,880
it turns out that the night I'm there,

638
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:27,330
so it's the final four weekend,

639
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,030
so I bet a lot of you are thinking like,
oh,

640
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:33,270
bill came in town to go to those games
and I had no idea that games were there

641
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:38,271
and I'm just paying five times what I
normally would have paid for 'em for a

642
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:42,450
hotel room. You know, I just
realized whatever happened to five,

643
00:40:42,451 --> 00:40:44,940
four club Faffel Club,
motherfucker

644
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,240
did.
They dumped me in a what?

645
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,980
I am so sick of being,

646
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,020
I feel like I'm that podcast that like
advertisers go to right before they meet

647
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,880
their soulmate podcast.
You know what I mean?

648
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,120
You know that chick who's always the
fucking bridesmaid, never a bride.

649
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,410
That's what I'm starting to feel.

650
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,650
I just don't feel that people
understand what the fuck it is.

651
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,000
It just cause I joked doesn't mean people
take it seriously in the Goddamn copy

652
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,550
and make some listen to it
rather than fast forward to it.

653
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:17,840
It's so fucking simple. Why can't you
Madison Avenue Kuntz figured that out

654
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,830
or maybe they're going to be
advertising my podcast next week. Don't,

655
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,440
and I probably should have checked with
my, my producer before I sit there.

656
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,910
But you know what he did all right.
That's okay.

657
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,130
Here's a little bit of music and then uh,
I don't know.

658
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,870
I guess we'll fucking, we'll play in some
half hour. Greatest Sense. You know what?

659
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,090
I'm actually, I'm going to tell my guy
to fucking put a slayer south. They have

660
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,120
bad odor, right? Go fuck
yourselves. I'll see on Monday.

661
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,413
False.

662
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,700
Have you guys seen this youtube video?
My name is John Dacre.

663
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,620
You got to watch this thing.

664
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,730
I apologize cause it's going to be in
your fucking head for the rest of time.

665
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,760
He's singing, he's singing a moray
and he can't remember how to say

666
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,993
[inaudible]

667
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,610
I can't stop watching. This
guy is guy. I swear to God,

668
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:20,230
I think it's his first TV Gig.
Somebody was sick,

669
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,530
I think they said at the beginning. So
this guy fills in and if you look at him,

670
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:25,990
he's literally having an
outer body experience.

671
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,950
So it's so funny to me
because I can relate to this
person because at first time

672
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:32,710
I did stand up,
I felt like I was watching myself.

673
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,900
I've fucked everything up and this guy,
just the way he says his name,

674
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,440
it's almost the just,
he says like,

675
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,110
my name is John Dacre.

676
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah,

677
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,353
yeah.

678
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,900
It's like,
it's like he was outside.

679
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,930
I think that might be my favorite part of
the video is the when this fucking guy,

680
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:59,250
just the way he says his own name,
he didn't say, my name is John Dacre.

681
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,680
He goes,
my name's John Decker.

682
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,490
I did it right the first time and I just
fucked it up. And you got to hear this.

683
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,680
Yeah, this fucking guy. He says
he's singing all these Jesus songs.

684
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,110
Hang on,
hang on.

685
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,130
Okay.

686
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,760
My name is John Baker.

687
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,890
That's the funniest shit ever.

688
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,560
My name's John Taker.
It's like he's watching his life,

689
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,060
like he already died

690
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,950
and then he came back and he just got to,

691
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,770
okay.

692
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,730
Like he first time you ever realize
my name. My name is John [inaudible].

693
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:43,240
Yeah,

694
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,380
that's my fucking name.

695
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,320
And this is my life and I'm on TV
and I'm going to sing this song.

696
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,490
This is what I did with my life.
You look at the Gut fucking poor bastard.

697
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,130
Yeah.

698
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,900
Oh my God. Listen to him sing. Hallelujah.

699
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,273
[inaudible]

700
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,373
okay.

701
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,960
Ugh. Damn. But for the grace of God,

702
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:25,110
this fucking guy would be the most
interesting Andrew view ever. Just like,

703
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,290
yeah,

704
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,710
he's one of the most fascinating
people I've ever seen. Like what?

705
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,770
What is going on in between
those fucking ears right now?

706
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,950
Think if they could eat,

707
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,980
you could make a show about his fucking
thoughts in all these fucking movies out

708
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,910
. It's, yeah. You know
they show the movie,

709
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:43,690
but it's done in reverse and then they
try to fucking flip you out. Nothing.

710
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:48,160
Nothing pink Floyd could ever fucking
right can match what's going on in this

711
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:50,050
guy's head. Highly
recommended. All right. Yeah.

on. I have to sneeze. Where's The sun?

735
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,630
Where's this on? Come on. Give me some
sun. There it is. There it is. Nothing.

736
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,220
I hate that. When you feel it. It's
like fucking blue balls for you knows.

737
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,620
I thought it was gonna fucking
sneezer nothing. All right.

738
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,520
Anyways, it's Monday, March 29th. Um,

739
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,400
I have not watched one 2nd of
March madness and is always,

740
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:03,100
it's the best fucking sporting event of
the year. And I don't know what happened.

741
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,710
I was over in April and, uh,
I was over in Europe, so, uh,

742
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,130
you know, I wasn't there in the
beginning, so I missed the whole thing.

743
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,440
I watched Kentucky lose
yesterday and I got to Mit.

744
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:17,860
I can't really look at John Calipari the
way I used to have to, what's his face?

745
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,670
Verbally, bitch slapped him. Um,

746
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,880
that angry white haired guy from Indiana
who then went to Texas and now he just

747
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,370
talks about games.
The fuck's his name.

748
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,270
Actually went to a game when I was
out there when it was still out. Damn.

749
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,640
What the fuck is his name?
I keep thinking white to his hair.

750
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,810
Jesus Christ. He's one of the great
coaches of all time. Come on bill.

751
00:48:38,811 --> 00:48:42,980
You've been gone to lumosity.com focus.
Let it go.

752
00:48:42,981 --> 00:48:47,060
Just don't care about it. I
don't give a fuck. No, I care.
My brain can tell. I care.

753
00:48:47,061 --> 00:48:50,450
So it's just hiding it. Just
mocking me. Come on work.

754
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:57,440
Bobby Knight. There we go. Add to think
of him throwing the chair. Uh, yeah,

755
00:48:57,441 --> 00:49:00,940
he called GTV key actually called John
Calipari out on some kind of decent,

756
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,341
he said,
you know,

757
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:05,840
every fucking program that this guy
has been a part of has had some sort of

758
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:10,580
problem with the NCAA and then
he jets out of town, you know,

759
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,600
continuing to build his resume
and he really trashed him. Now,

760
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,490
I'm not saying what he said was right,
but Calipari Ali came back with, was a,

761
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,890
a a respect globby night.
I think he's a great coach.

762
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,260
And he didn't that you didn't
address anything. You know,

763
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,310
somebody told me I killed a hooker
and they were a friend of mine and I

764
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:32,660
respected them. I would address the
killing of the hooker at some point. Uh,

765
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,630
in my innocence of it.

766
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah.

767
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,570
Before I, you know, after, you know,
after I said how much I respected the guy.

768
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,580
Right.
You know,

769
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:45,700
I went to a game one time out there in
Indiana with Bobby Knight was still there

770
00:49:45,701 --> 00:49:48,330
and he was, you know, Indiana
started to lose. It was a year.

771
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,480
Michigan State won the championship.
I think it was the year 2000.

772
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,620
I already 10 years ago.

773
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,630
And I went to this fucking game and I
remember about a student ticket and, uh,

774
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,380
you know, showed up. At that
point I was well into my thirties.

775
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,380
And the guy's looking at
me like, really? You know,

776
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,580
what do you want the fucking 12 year plan?

777
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,960
That's when he got to come with the
fucking Luther vibe from a 48 hour.

778
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,240
I've been busy number.
That's shit.

779
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,990
When he pulls up to the toll booth of
the parking garage thing and the guy's

780
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:24,060
like this tickets like four
years old. Yeah, I been busy.

781
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,070
That was a vibe. Me, I just gave the
guy that's like, come on man, come on.

782
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,110
Really it's me.

783
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,930
So he let me in and I went in there and
I remember watching Bobby Knight and it

784
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,810
was a fucking great arena and
there he was, the legend, right?

785
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,630
I was up in the nosebleeds,
but uh,

786
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,880
Indiana started losing and he started,

787
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,780
he walked out on the court and was
yelling at the point guard bringing it up.

788
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,340
The court like his, his whole fucking
head was just, you know, with,

789
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:56,570
just with every,
you fucking mother fucking like is like a,

790
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,590
like a rooster with Tourette's. Right.
Just, just fucking unbelievable.

791
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,180
And I remember I got so Goddamn
mad watching him do that.

792
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,230
I was just like,
I was,

793
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,510
I wanted that kid just to take the ball
and just fire it right into his fucking

794
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,640
screaming face.

795
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,340
I have a son and he allows himself
to get fucking yelled at like that.

796
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,653
You know what I mean?

797
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,960
You fucking retard control your
goddamn emotions. All right?

798
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,080
You want to fucking blow up a little bit,
Blah.

799
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,180
But this guy had completely lost his shit.

800
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,060
Yeah.

801
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,090
Yeah. Do you ever see Marvin
Hagler when he fought Tommy Hearns,

802
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,720
remember when he was punching him in the
head and Tommy's fucking head would go

803
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:45,700
back in his Jerry curl, all the
shit from it would fly out. Instead,

804
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:50,380
he was doing that with his head to
himself, except instead of going back,

805
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:53,980
he was going forward every time he was
making a point to this kid. He's like,

806
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:58,290
Ben Kingsley and sexy beast make me
look like a right cunt hair dark.

807
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,950
You're fucking learn to fucking,
ah, he's leading with this head.

808
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,790
Fucking right. Cross white to is
fuck, I fucking hate people like that.

809
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,890
Remind me of one of my relatives. Um,
well, I just really revisited that anger,

810
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:15,990
didn't I? Um, so anyways,

811
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,870
I was actually going to do this
podcast last night at, uh, at,

812
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:24,070
at 12 midnight now that I've been over
to Europe and I found out how many people

813
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:27,160
listen to my podcast over there. You
know, I'm starting to have a little, uh,

814
00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:30,700
you know, responsibility for
those people. Like, you know,

815
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,360
I now know that England and Ireland
are seven hours ahead of me.

816
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,420
So if I did it at midnight Monday
nights, if I posted it then, I mean,

817
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:42,250
Sunday nights, you know, they're rolling
into work couple hours later, you know,

818
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,480
and I know what you thinking down
there in Australia. Ooh, what about us?

819
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,580
We're fucking 14 hours ahead.
Go fuck yourselves. All right,

820
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:55,990
the fuck do you want me to do it
on Thursdays every week? You know,

821
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,490
why don't you be happy?

822
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,930
Why don't you guys just focus on the
fact that you guys don't get respect for

823
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,500
living on the largest
island in the fucking world.

824
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,570
You know, Disney should've made a
cartoon about you guys, not Madagascar.

825
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,290
Huh?
What was that about?

826
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,580
So sick of those fucking cartoons about
animals that know about global warming.

827
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,820
And then they teach human beings a lesson.
You know,

828
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,500
do you realize that like 98%, and I
just grabbed that stat right out of ass,

829
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,680
reach right in and pulled it out.
98% of fucking animals,

830
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:33,210
including the goddamn insects. There's an
insect, an animal. I know what a human,

831
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,810
um,
98% of those motherfuckers are murderers

832
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,030
every day,
every fucking day.

833
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,410
When they want to go out and get something
to eat, they have to commit a murder.

834
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:51,480
You know, they got to set a trap.
They got an ambush. Should ever do it.

835
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:55,920
Fucking face to face. You ever
seen a fucking animal, you know,

836
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,880
be a gentlemen,

837
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,700
come up and slap another fucking beast
with his glove and say, I challenge you.

838
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,940
I challenge you to a meal off.
I want to eat,

839
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:12,750
you know, all pieces of shit.
Fucking animals. What about
me? I don't kill anybody.

840
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,790
I go and eat an animal that's already
been murdered. I am accomplice to murder.

841
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:22,050
That's what the fuck I am. Um,
I did I get on that subject?

842
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,160
What was I talking about? It's
talking about Bobby Knight. Oh,

843
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:29,430
some of those stupid fucking animal
movies at Disney's always make and try to

844
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:31,440
make me cry, you know, and say,

845
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:34,260
have some polar bears slide
on his belly into a coke can.

846
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,330
The same fucking thing that would
just be eating me alive. Um,

847
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,420
if you only get mauled by an animal,
if you had to get eaten by an animal,

848
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:46,530
which one would you pick?
I picked the biggest fucker ever.

849
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,360
I want that shit to be over.

850
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,590
Cause I remember when that gay dude
with the evil Knievel, a Onesy,

851
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,430
the Joan Jett fucking Leotard.

852
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,500
Remember those two guys out there sick,
free and roid. Roid sick free and Roy,

853
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,660
Siegfried and Roy,
remember those two twinkle toes out there,

854
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:13,950
dance around with all those fucking,
you know, whatever they had. They,

855
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,050
they're cats. They were doing
cats. The musical for real.
Whenever you thrill cats,

856
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,380
I think that'd be spectacular.

857
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,320
We just skip around and
I'll bleach my hair.

858
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,860
And then you put shoe
fallish in yours. Yeah. Well,

859
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,990
Robert's bowls.
I'm actually,

860
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:35,690
that's bullshit because the musical
cats came out after fucking, uh, the,

861
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,960
the, the fucking, those
two guys, gay evil Knievel.

862
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,160
And uh, and gay. Uh, who's the other one?

863
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,940
What did he look like? A, who's the
other guy at night at the Roxbury,

864
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,800
not will Pharrel. Ah, Jesus.
My is just shot Catan.

865
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,380
That's what it looks like.
If they ever,

866
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,940
if they ever make the movie
that I would cast a Catan.

867
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:10,440
Chris Catan is the one who gets his
neck chopped and then I would have to go

868
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:14,730
with the guy who played
Bo Duke and the rob and I.

869
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,740
He's too fucking old at this point. Who's
got hair like that? God knows I don't,

870
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:24,070
even if you fucking bleached it, I got
enough left. Hang on a second. Who the

871
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,090
fuck would I pick?

872
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,090
Yeah,

873
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,450
whatever. There's your project
for the week. But anyways,

874
00:56:29,451 --> 00:56:34,070
my point is that when he grabbed
the, the, the gay Chris Catan, dude,

875
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,650
it was just over. It wasn't like, Oh
God, I'm getting eaten by an island.

876
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,580
An island, a fucking lie.
Jesus. It wasn't that.

877
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:48,440
It was just scrapped his
fucking throat and that was it.

878
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:53,270
He went chomp and that was it. That
was it. Just fucking off. I know,

879
00:56:53,271 --> 00:56:56,510
Bill, we saw it. We saw
it on fucking Hollywood.

880
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,960
Aina aided a bitch or whatever
the fuck that, that's stupid.

881
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:03,960
He Hollywood bowl shows he Hollywood
fucking stories about celebrities and

882
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,510
addition all this dirt about them.

883
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,270
Did you ever notice that none of
their close friends are on it?

884
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:12,380
It's because it's all bullshit.
You know

885
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,450
they do like the willy aim story
and they have like his fucking made

886
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,010
talk and all sorts of shit about them.
There's grant. Good Eve say anything? No.

887
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,530
Does the kid who played Nicholas Bradford,

888
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:30,340
does he say some shit now with none of
them say anything? It's always like,

889
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:32,740
you know some fucking PA.

890
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,020
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.
I was talking about animals.

891
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,190
Let's rewind this for a second.
Yeah, those stupid fucking call.

892
00:57:40,191 --> 00:57:42,530
If you've got to get killed by an
animal. That's what I'm saying. I want,

893
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,220
I want to get fucking killed by
something like that. A big cat or a bear.

894
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,970
You know there's something about an
alligator though. I just, I don't like it.

895
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,930
I don't like that they have fucking
them. They're mean about it. You know,

896
00:57:55,770 --> 00:58:00,270
they just did. They grab your leg and
then they do that fucking barrel roll.

897
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,040
You know, it's like, can't you just
fucking shot my leg off? Can you just,

898
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,780
just nice clean Ginsu it and you
know it a major writer there.

899
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,040
I'll fucking bleed out
in like five seconds.

900
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,520
Do you really got to Joe
Theismann me to the 10th power.

901
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,160
You guys ever seen that clip?
Non Sports fans.

902
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,930
If you want to see something that'll
just make you lose your lunch for all you

903
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,670
broads out there trying
to lose some weight.

904
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:25,320
If you just had a piece of cake right now,

905
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:32,270
go on youtube and look up Joe Theismann
breaks leg or Joe Theismann uh,

906
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,460
who landed on him. Lawrence Taylor.
Remember that shit? It's, it's a,

907
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:42,850
it's a two foot one break compound
fracture I believe is what,

908
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:47,700
what is what is called the
Tabula and the fibula. Uh,

909
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:49,410
yeah, I think that's
what it is. Look at me.

910
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,420
Follow fucking pulling another
thing out of my age. Um,

911
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,290
alright, so this is the deal. It's
Monday morning out here in Los Angeles.

912
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,090
She probably wondering, hey bill,
you know what? What does that,

913
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:02,070
what does a struggling actor,

914
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,910
moderately successful comedian
do on a Monday morning? Well,

915
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:06,541
I'll tell you right now.

916
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:11,541
I had a fucking audition and I prepared
my little actor hard out for it.

917
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:17,630
And uh, it was one of the roles I've
always wanted to play. All right. Um,

918
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,070
there's a few scenes that I want
that I want to do as an actor.

919
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:22,130
A lot of actors want to win an Oscar.
Of course I

920
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,530
do. But who's kidding, Hill.
You know one of my jeans,

921
00:59:26,531 --> 00:59:30,740
Staple Horn said somebody's
name. I don't know. Fuck,

922
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:34,370
that is a triple horn. I don't know
what the fuck I'm trying to say here.

923
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:37,730
Look who's getting to it will
be 42 years old in June. Okay.

924
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:41,210
If I can just stand near somebody who won
a fucking Oscar, I'm going to be happy.

925
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,790
All right. So anyways, um, and you know
what I'm doing? I'm adjusting my dream.

926
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,681
Okay.

927
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:52,250
Rather than going on Oprah now and
having her ask me how I became so fucking

928
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:55,520
brilliant. Now all I want to
do, I want to have that scene.

929
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,750
I want to play a snitch.

930
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,670
That's what I want to do and I want to
have somebody chased me down a fucking

931
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:02,504
alley.

932
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,710
I don't give a fuck if it's the cops
are the guys I snitched on and I want to

933
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:09,440
come to the end of the alley.
I want that chain link fence.

934
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:12,680
You know where you grab it and you're
trying to climb up it and you think you're

935
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,220
going to make it and then they grab
you by your cheap leather coat.

936
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,690
They pull you off it and kick
the shit out of you. I want that.

937
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,680
I want to do the interrogation scene.
You know when I'm sitting there,

938
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,560
then they're doing the good cop,
bad cop. I've already been the cop.

939
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:30,470
I did that on Chappelle show.
I want to be the guy getting interrogated.

940
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,240
And then the last thing is I want to get
my fucking head blown off in a movie.

941
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,500
So today and I have the perfect head,

942
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:44,480
my big fucking kitchen TV set head,
my Sean Penn forehead. I mean this,

943
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,430
it's just begging to be fucking blown
off in a movie. I'm dying for that scene.

944
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:53,570
Right? And I had an audition
today to, uh, to play.

945
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,170
A Gal gets fucking shot in the
head. In the end, I was site,

946
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,560
I was feeling good. I worked the
whole fucking thing out, right?

947
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,480
So I go down to the audition and I show
up on me at the address and I'm looking

948
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:09,380
at somebody's house like, what the
fuck? This is somebody goddamn house.

949
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,710
This doesn't seem right.
So recheck the address.

950
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:16,820
And then I saw a couple of people
walking in holding this sides. Um,

951
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:20,000
so I was like, all right, fuck it. Not
Sides for those unit in the business,

952
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:22,250
they didn't walk in with like
mashed potatoes and stuffing.

953
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,100
It's fucking sides are basically
the part of the script,

954
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,160
the couple of scenes that they give you.
Um,

955
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,930
so I go walking in there and I walk in
and all I see is two Asian guys in suits.

956
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,940
And I'm like, all right, this is weird.
Because basically what happens when you,

957
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:40,850
when you audition for a role,
they kind of know what they want.

958
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,180
Every once in awhile they do that,
all ethnicities.

959
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:48,410
But basically I walk in there and there's
a bunch of howdy duty looking guys.

960
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:52,910
You know, Donnie most is in there
fucking resent and me, you know,

961
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,370
cause my red hair hasn't
turned yellow yet.

962
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,980
No, it's not all red heads, but you know,

963
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:05,600
it's a bunch of fucking white dudes
about my age, you know. And um,

964
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,350
this time I walk in,
it's two Asian dudes,

965
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:13,070
one with the shaved head and one
with fucking Chow, young fat hair,

966
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,930
and they're both sitting there.
And I'm like, what the fuck?

967
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,930
I must be coming in at the tail end of,
we're trying to find the Asian dude.

968
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:23,070
And uh, I walk in and I sign in and it
was right as I sign in to say I'm there,

969
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,820
the casting person came and I was like,
oh my God.

970
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,200
I tried to call and I was like,
oh fuck.

971
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,750
I tried to call, try to email
you. Basically they, they,

972
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:41,040
I dunno. I Dunno if they cast it, they
gave it to somebody famous or what,

973
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,880
but they basically tried to call me to say
that, uh, they were rewriting the role.

974
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:50,370
I love when somebody says that I
tried to call really what happened. I,

975
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:54,930
I dunno, I, I dialed it, but I
couldn't pick up the, I tried,

976
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:58,380
I couldn't
just be honest.

977
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,540
It was a late night fucking decision,
you know, and I had the one,

978
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:05,580
I was one of the first guys coming out
of the chute. It's no big deal. Whatever.

979
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,170
I'm already showered,
looking good today.

980
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:11,790
It was still would've been
sleeping like a bump. So, uh, yeah,

981
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:15,120
my day started a little fucked up. What
are you going to do? Whatever, whatever,

982
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,940
whatever. I'm 16, 17
minutes into this podcast,

983
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,790
they got a little bowl of grapes here.
Um,

984
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,740
and people let me tell you something.
I am severely, severely off the wagon.

985
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:31,650
All right. I stumbled
in last night and, uh,

986
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,830
all I had was two beers.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

987
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:37,590
I was like stumbling and I,
you know, got out of my car,

988
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:41,970
which I probably shouldn't
have been driving. I two
beers in an hour and a half.

989
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:44,460
So, I mean, I think I'm not drunk, right?

990
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,870
Your body gets rid of a one drink an hour.
Isn't that what it is?

991
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,850
All I know is I have this fucking little
zip up, right? My little fucking, uh,

992
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,380
you know, I don't know what
it is. It's like a fun,

993
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,840
I think it has the English flag
on it. It's white. It's weird.

994
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:03,120
It looks like really American
because it's red, white and blue.

995
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:04,650
It's a fucking cool look and zip up.

996
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,130
It makes me look maybe two and a half
years younger than I am and I'm vain,

997
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:08,964
so I wear it.

998
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:14,260
So I stumble out of my car and I brush
up against the hinge of the garage and I

999
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:19,050
was like, fuck. And I look down and I have
this Greece, at least it was brand new,

1000
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,300
so it was kind of green
looking and I ruined it.

1001
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,320
And I just sat there and I remembered
what this recovered alcoholic told me when

1002
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,050
I wasn't drinking. I was like,
Yeah Dude, I'm done with drinking.

1003
01:04:28,051 --> 01:04:30,720
And he looked at me and he said, yeah
man. He goes, nothing good comes from it.

1004
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,560
And I was like, once again, this
guy is right when you're younger,

1005
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,400
good stuff comes from it. You get laid,
you get charged with date rape later,

1006
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:41,730
but you know, in the moment it's
good. Um, no, you know what I mean?

1007
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,200
Loosens people up.
You don't know how to talk to a luck.

1008
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,860
Be a lady two night.

1009
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,520
Let me get you drunk and less uptight.

1010
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,260
Gonna stick my finger in
your fucking who has sweetie,

1011
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:02,460
whether you want it or
not. Now doing it. I don't,

1012
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,850
I'm not advocating rape here. I just felt
like singing. So let me have a grape.

1013
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,180
Maybe that'll take me down here.
Oh. Oh God. Isn't that delicious?

1014
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:14,360
It was the last time you
bought some grapes and actually
finished. Um, you know,

1015
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,030
I'm trying to, cause I, when
I came back from Europe,

1016
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:23,080
I threw out a hellacious amount of food.
I want you to think a starving kid ways.

1017
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:31,030
Because when I walked out, I felt like I
had like six of them in my garbage bag.

1018
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:35,740
That's how much food I threw out.
Some of them were jars,

1019
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,610
you know, wasn't all food. Some of
it was the containers, but you know,

1020
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:42,910
a lot of it's made out of cardboard at
this point. I threw out a lot of food.

1021
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,900
That's what I'm trying to tell
you. So I'm really, I'm try,

1022
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:47,950
I bought some food this week and
I'm trying to eat all of it up.

1023
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:53,130
I'm trying to be a less wasteful American.
Oh,

1024
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,540
speaking of that shit.
The fuck did I look up?

1025
01:05:55,541 --> 01:06:00,541
I was on youtube the other day and they
had these German mother fuckers and they

1026
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:06,280
would, they would, they were trying
out the new, um, um, dodge challenger.

1027
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,650
The fucking Xjs sets a Jaguar,
whatever the fuck you call it, the,

1028
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:15,070
the Hemi one versus the
Shelby Mustang versus, um,

1029
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,560
that dodge viper and their whole thing
was they just kept relating the cars to

1030
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,570
eating fast food and a big cheeseburger.
They will basically saying,

1031
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:30,490
these are American cars.
Americans are fat fucks. And, uh,

1032
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,930
I gotta admit, man, we earned it. We
did earn it, but you know, we don't do,

1033
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,730
we don't test out a Porsche and Audi
in a BMW with some sort of Nazi theme

1034
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:44,230
underneath it. You know, I'm fucking
really getting tired of this man.

1035
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:48,130
Everybody's taken shots at the good
old USA. So you know you got to do,

1036
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,720
I've got a new segment called
let's get smart America.

1037
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,120
I wish she had some sort of production
on this where I could just have a fucking

1038
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,950
silly ass song.

1039
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:05,790
What are you going to do this week as
it a fucking American to make yourself a

1040
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:08,950
little less fat?
A little less dumb,

1041
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,490
a little less something else.
Cause the magic number's three.

1042
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,070
Say I'm too fucking stupid to
come up with three examples.

1043
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:19,180
What are you going to do? I got to tell
you, these motherfuckers over in England,

1044
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:19,510
man,

1045
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,510
are not in good shape and they weren't
in good shape and fucking in Scotland

1046
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:28,780
either. Ireland, they
were all right. You know,

1047
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,870
it's like they're not fat,
but they just like,

1048
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,230
they look like at a shake.
Seventh graders,

1049
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,100
like there's not a lot of weightlifting
over there. Like I just saw arms.

1050
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:43,060
You don't like straight arms like Dilbert.
I'm not saying they're all like that,

1051
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:46,180
so fucking don't get your blood up over
there. Right. You know what I'm saying?

1052
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:52,240
Put it this way. My girlfriend
saw somebody over in, um, in,

1053
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,480
uh,
we were fucked with,

1054
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,360
I think we were in Scotland and she saw
somebody and this kid looked like he was

1055
01:07:58,361 --> 01:08:01,330
in his early twenties, his
face. But his body was just,

1056
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:06,160
she just looked at me and she just goes,
his body is unacceptable.

1057
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:12,310
And it wasn't even that he was
fucking ridiculously out of shape.

1058
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,160
It's just that not only those
fucking guys over there mushy,

1059
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,330
they were the tightest fucking shirts
ever. I'm not saying I'm in shape.

1060
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,720
I got a nice little fucking poach going
right now that I need to try to work

1061
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,210
down.
But I have the decency,

1062
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,700
the common fucking decency for my
fellow man to wear a button down.

1063
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,520
You know,
give yourself a little space,

1064
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:39,140
let it hang off your man tits a little
bit so we don't have to see, you know,

1065
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,940
these fucking guys over in Europe,
it's like,

1066
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:44,450
they want you to know exactly how
many pounds overweight they were.

1067
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,560
It was disgusting.
You know,

1068
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:49,070
and appreciate a little courtesy out of
my fellow man. That's all I'm saying.

1069
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,830
Okay. You got, you've gotta be
honest with yourself. All right.

1070
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,830
What kind of shape? My mind wife
shape am I and t shirts shape?

1071
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,450
Am I in fucking buttoned down shape?
Do I need to put on a Hoodie?

1072
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:07,430
You know, sport coach
shape. Remember that Shit.

1073
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,330
I used to have a regular job. Why am
I walking around? I think I'm excited.

1074
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,000
This is one of the exciting
moments of the podcast for me.

1075
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:18,200
Look at me pacing back and forth as if
I'm fucking coming up with some brilliant

1076
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,810
shit here.
I remember when I had a regular job,

1077
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:24,050
he used to work in a warehouse
unloading trucks. You know,

1078
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,360
it's not curing cancer,
but it served a purpose and a,

1079
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,830
I remember once a year they would have,

1080
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,490
they'd have the company cookout and all
these fucking suits that you thought

1081
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:38,900
were in shape do. They would show up
with their fucking tee shirts on. Wow.

1082
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:42,160
Wow.
You know,

1083
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:46,890
I'm talking like a fucking big slice of
cake just hanging off each side of him.

1084
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,130
I remember it made me feel
good too because they will
make them more money than

1085
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:50,964
me,

1086
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,773
you know?

1087
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:57,250
You know when you do that,
you just fucking good your
wedding in that category.

1088
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:01,150
So I'm glad that you're losing in
this one. Did that go anywhere?

1089
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,650
Have another grape? God Damn
it. These things are tart. So

1090
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,330
here we go. I'm trying to become
a better speller everybody.

1091
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,090
And uh, I'm sick of being a
fucking moron in that category.

1092
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,530
So I figured I'd give you a
spelling test this week. All right?

1093
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,880
You don't have to play along.

1094
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,790
You know what am I going to do that I
can keep fucking rambling for another 40

1095
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:27,820
minutes. She can tell at this point. I
don't have shit to talk about this week.

1096
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,410
I just emptied my brain on Thursday.
It takes a week for it to fill up.

1097
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:34,660
It's like it just jerked off
and you want another load?

1098
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:38,620
I don't have one inmate got a
fucking empty chamber this week.

1099
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:43,750
All right, you guys sitting at your
desks, this would be even better. This.

1100
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:44,680
And you know what's great about this?

1101
01:10:44,681 --> 01:10:49,681
If I actually add this to the podcast
where I teach it fucking 10 words every

1102
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,280
week, okay? We all learn and
together this is the great thing.

1103
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,800
Cause if you're listening to a guy
at work, you shouldn't be doing that.

1104
01:10:56,801 --> 01:11:00,610
You know it. And I know it looked
down in shame right now at your desk.

1105
01:11:00,970 --> 01:11:02,830
Now don't fuck that.
He shouldn't have any shame.

1106
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:07,360
Did you dream about your job then?
There's no fucking shame fucking off. Um,

1107
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,590
the great part about this part of the
podcast is you're actually going to start

1108
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:14,310
writing and people going to
be thinking, Oh wow, okay.

1109
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,300
Sandy's over there taking notes
on something important, you know,

1110
01:11:18,301 --> 01:11:22,560
who fucks off and writes at the same
time. Um, all right, so here we go.

1111
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,430
Here's 10 words that I think,
uh,

1112
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,530
I don't think anything about them.

1113
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,040
These are just words I fucking found
that I could, I couldn't spell.

1114
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,460
Catalysts is the first word.
What did this yelled at into the mic.

1115
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:40,080
Catalysts is your first word. All right,
let's see how fucking dumb you are.

1116
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:43,200
We need, we need to gauge
how fucking stupid you are

1117
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,490
to have a jumping off point. All
right. Catalyst is your first word.

1118
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,670
Um, can you use it in a sentence?
Uh, I don't think I can. Um,

1119
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,300
this spelling test was the catalyst
to expose how fucking stupid I am.

1120
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,070
Catalyst
is a fucked up one.

1121
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:10,140
We all eat them cantaloupe.

1122
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:11,580
Okay.

1123
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:16,460
Hey, what'd you look at that
fucking cantaloupe? I, you know,

1124
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:21,330
I just realized I could never do this.
I could never be a teacher. Chloroform,

1125
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:23,600
okay.

1126
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,490
Hey, you know what? If you
don't shut the fuck up,

1127
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:29,780
I'm going to take a chloroform reg
and put it over your face there.

1128
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,450
Chloroform.
God,

1129
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,230
this is like designed to make you smarter
and it's really exposing how dumb I am

1130
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,750
is a tough one. Uh, penitentiary.

1131
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:45,160
Don't go to the penitentiary. You might
get fucked in the ass penitentiary.

1132
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:51,010
Uh,
you know,

1133
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:55,570
I love about this podcast is, even though
I have no idea whether this is the,

1134
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,910
you know, I, there's no way
to hear feedback or anything.

1135
01:12:57,911 --> 01:13:01,420
I know this is bombing and I don't give
a shit. I don't know. You know what?

1136
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:04,840
I don't even know how many I've done.
I'm going to fucking do all 10, one, two,

1137
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,870
three. I did three, three c words
and I'm not, I would say contemplate.

1138
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,660
It's too easy. Uh, let's
go with another one.

1139
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:15,380
Yeah.

1140
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:20,200
Was another one. Aesthetics. There's a
great one. Here's a great one. Aesthetics.

1141
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,070
Use it in a sentence. Bill, come
on. You dummy. Jesus Christ.

1142
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:25,210
Look at these aesthetics.

1143
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,470
And you know, it's funny, I know
how to spell all these words now,

1144
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:36,760
but I can't use them in a sentence.
Just really a fucking moron. All right,

1145
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,800
let's go.
Infrastructure.

1146
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:40,960
Yeah.

1147
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,130
You know, I'm sick of this
infrastructure. It's really, uh,

1148
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,780
it's really unnecessary infrastructure.

1149
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,730
Now I can use that in a sentence.

1150
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:56,790
The infrastructure of the
company was a exquisite,

1151
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:02,340
Oh, Jesus Christ. Gee. Oh, G Gee,

1152
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,090
what else we got? How many, how many words
is that? One, two, three. That's four.

1153
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,810
Yeah,

1154
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,990
there is a tough one. Succinct.
I think I did that last

1155
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,700
succinct.
Um,

1156
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,310
what somebody who stutters
brushes his teeth in a succinct,

1157
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,320
can I just do five?
Can I bail on this?

1158
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,110
Are you guys enjoying
how fucking horrific.

1159
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,050
This is a pertinent,

1160
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:33,563
okay,

1161
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:39,490
what does that six, I'm going
to say that six pertinent. Um,

1162
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,910
you know what?
This is pertinent information.

1163
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,940
That's the only time anybody ever uses
that word is when they're describing

1164
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:46,774
information.

1165
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:48,130
Okay?

1166
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:52,540
If I had an access to the pertinent,
pertinent information,

1167
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:57,250
I wouldn't have to deal with this
infrastructure at this cantaloupe colored

1168
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:58,773
company.

1169
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,770
Pardon it? Fuck you. You don't even know
how to spell it. You can't smell it.

1170
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:12,040
Spell it. You can't fucking be
laughing at me right now. All right.

1171
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:12,874
Here's a fun [inaudible].

1172
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,930
These ones are all the ones that have
psycho with the beginning of them.

1173
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,900
Here's one. Uh, negotiate.

1174
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:21,730
Yeah.

1175
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,850
You know,
you guys want more money in your cubicles.

1176
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,770
You're going to have to
negotiate. Oh, they go, she ate.

1177
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:33,870
Was that eight?
Jeez,

1178
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,890
I'm even getting bored with this. Uh, this
is a hell of a dilemma, Huh? Go ahead.

1179
01:15:37,891 --> 01:15:39,720
Spell that one dilemma.

1180
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,470
I didn't realize this was going to bug
bomb and now I'm in a fucking dilemma.

1181
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,383
Dilemma.

1182
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:49,010
Yeah.

1183
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:51,590
And when was the last one here?
A silhouette.

1184
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,930
Yay. When I see your silhouette up against
the mood and makes me want to fucking

1185
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:03,150
baggy silhouette. Ah,
all right. There you go.

1186
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,510
There's your spelling tests for the week.

1187
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,020
Do you have any desire to get better
at this shit, my superimposing.

1188
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,420
That's what I do. I can spell all those
fucking words. Huh? Are you impressed?

1189
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:16,150
You shouldn't be. Um, here's
another new segment bills,

1190
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:19,030
embarrassing moments from
the previous week's podcast.

1191
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:23,320
This is actually from two weeks ago. I
actually re listen to these when I, uh,

1192
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,280
when I upload them,

1193
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:28,060
it takes a moment for me to upload all
of these fucking things that no one can

1194
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:31,390
hear unless you go to bill bird.com.
Um,

1195
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:35,350
[inaudible] um,
and I listened to them and I listen,

1196
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,560
I hear all the dumb shit that
I say and the stuff that I,

1197
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:43,561
I miss pronounce like I was trying to
say exclamation point a couple of weeks

1198
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:48,430
ago,
exclamation point as an exclaim.

1199
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,910
And I actually said explanation point,

1200
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:56,320
like it was explaining it
to me in a very excited way.

1201
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:01,810
Um, Jesus Christ, this is
fucking awful. You know, this is,

1202
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:04,570
you know what this is like, this is
like your second day back at the gym.

1203
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,930
That's what this podcast feels like.
You know the first day like, fuck this,

1204
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:08,861
you know,

1205
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:12,490
when you go nuts and then the next day
you wake up and you're all sore and now

1206
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,220
you just fucking drag and assets.

1207
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,430
What this podcast is just
dragon fucking dragon.

1208
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,720
My Freckle Das. I don't have
a freckle desk. By the way.

1209
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,710
That would mean that I stunned
beds in the nude. Um, all right,

1210
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:27,740
last week I was talking
about how our Avocados,

1211
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:32,120
that whole bullshit where
they're, uh, they're too, oh wait,

1212
01:17:32,121 --> 01:17:35,840
that's for the wrong part of the podcast.
Where the fuck is that information?

1213
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:42,980
No, Jesus Christ. Bill. You know
why? Why? Why do you even try? Oh,

1214
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:45,530
I fucked up. I bet. I can
just tell you the gist of it.

1215
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:50,450
The reason why Avocados costs more when
you go to get a Burrito was evidently

1216
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:54,440
there was some damage done to the crop
a couple of years ago or some bullshit.

1217
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,570
So there was a shortage of them.

1218
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,220
Thus they were more expensive.
And as always,

1219
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:06,080
the corporate cons pass the
expense onto the regular people.

1220
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:10,920
And this is what happens.
Then they had more fucking avocado.

1221
01:18:10,921 --> 01:18:14,930
So it wasn't a fucking problem anymore,
but they were like, well wait a minute.

1222
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,460
People are already paying more for
Avocados. Ain't never fucking complained.

1223
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,020
So they just kept them at the same price.
So now you pay extra,

1224
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:29,060
which means means when
it's time to change,

1225
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:30,800
what it means is that
they're gonna fucking,

1226
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,770
they're going to do that with every kind
of food now cause we're not bitching

1227
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:37,640
about, um, our bacon. I've got a breakfast
sandwich and they said Bacon was extra.

1228
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:41,870
So, you know what? That's my little
rebellion. Fuck you. All right.

1229
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,950
I'm not paying extra for my Avocados,
for my guacamole.

1230
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,180
You fucking cunts. You fuckin
corporate cons helping. Did you?

1231
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,310
Goddamn ya'll gotta be all right.
Let me, let me, I'm, you know,

1232
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:55,040
I'm going to wrap this up. You guys
are getting a mini podcast this week.

1233
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,140
I'm not going to sit here and be treated
this way on my podcast and I sit here

1234
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:02,660
fucking bomb and like this,
I got a reputation. Um,

1235
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:05,870
last week I have saying I
didn't understand the difference
between Great Britain,

1236
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,580
the United Kingdom is England,
a country is England in Scotland.

1237
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:14,570
Two separate countries. Are they the
same fucking thing? It was all confusing.

1238
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:18,230
So a this guy says, hey bill,
I'm from England, so I'll
answer your question mate.

1239
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,660
Uh, England is a country, cause you said
on your podcast, England wasn't a country,

1240
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,610
but is it you meant to write but it is,
what are you,

1241
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:31,100
if you're questioning yourself sir,
what the fuck am I supposed to do?

1242
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:35,390
Scotland is a country, Wales is
a country. I didn't know that.

1243
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:40,070
I thought maybe Scotland was a country,
but I didn't think Wales was a country.

1244
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:45,100
Ireland is a bit different because it's
split into two countries to spelled t oh

1245
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,170
there's one of your smart
fucking Europeans there.

1246
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:52,040
Everybody see that if we
learn how to spell America,

1247
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,450
we can start making fun of them again.
We at least we can have a,

1248
01:19:57,590 --> 01:20:02,000
a basis to make fun of
them. Um, anyways, uh,

1249
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:06,680
continuing Ireland is a bit different
because it's split into two countries.

1250
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:07,890
Northern Ireland,

1251
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:12,540
the Capitol is Belfast and the
Republic of Ireland Capitol is Dublin.

1252
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:16,380
Both completely separate countries.
Countries,

1253
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,010
spelled country apostrophe s yeah.

1254
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:22,570
See this.
That's all they do over there.

1255
01:20:22,571 --> 01:20:25,420
They watch fucking soccer
and eat fish and chips.

1256
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:28,300
They don't have fucking spell either.
United Kingdom.

1257
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:31,180
And this is what the United Kingdom
is. It's a England, Scotland,

1258
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:35,890
Wales and Northern Ireland. Great
Britain. Great Britain is England,

1259
01:20:35,891 --> 01:20:37,420
Scotland and Wales.

1260
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,390
Reason being is Ireland is an island.

1261
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:46,190
Hence why Northern Ireland
and the Republican Ireland
are just known as Ireland.

1262
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:50,550
That doesn't make any sense.
England is in Ireland or whatever.

1263
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,820
Fucking do the United Kingdom is an
island island. I don't understand that.

1264
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,260
How come fucking,
uh,

1265
01:20:55,470 --> 01:21:00,470
Australia is not an eye is not considered
an island surrounded on all sides by

1266
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:04,400
water.
You know what the fuck?

1267
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:09,250
South America is an island at this
point with the Panama Canal, isn't it?

1268
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:13,630
And why does it float away? Um, anyways.

1269
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:19,030
Anyways, this podcast sucks. I'm sorry.
What? What the fuck do you want from me?

1270
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,450
All right. I'm fucking Neil O'Donnell
this week. I've got nothing for you.

1271
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,020
I started doing this spelling test and
all these fucking nerds came out of the

1272
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:28,990
goddamn woodwork. This guy goes, Bill,

1273
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,060
here's an interesting piece of trivia.

1274
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:36,430
Facetious is the only word in the English
language that has every vowel in order.

1275
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:43,160
A. E. I. O. U. Isn't that interesting? Is
that what I did with the spelling tests?

1276
01:21:43,161 --> 01:21:46,190
Maybe this is why I never learned how to
fucking spell cause that's the kind of

1277
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:50,660
people that you attract. Here's an
interesting tidbit of information.

1278
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,800
Do you know that on the fuck,

1279
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:56,590
and they start talking about
some moon off of Saturn

1280
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,380
that instead of fucking air,
it's that their atmosphere as methane gas.

1281
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,580
And I got to sit and I guess sit there
and nod like wow, you know, and I'm like,

1282
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:07,511
and he's sitting there thinking,

1283
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:11,560
I'm nodding because I'm so fucking
interested and I'm really trying to do the

1284
01:22:11,561 --> 01:22:12,430
math in my head.

1285
01:22:12,431 --> 01:22:14,980
Trying to figure out when was the
last fucking time this guy got laid?

1286
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,840
There's another great stereotype.
If you're some fucking smart nerd,

1287
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,930
that means you don't get late in life.
That's bullshit.

1288
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:28,410
It's only in fucking high
school, you know? I Dunno,

1289
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,080
is it, I don't even know if it's
fucking true. I just figured, you know,

1290
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:31,861
when you get smart,

1291
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:35,130
if it's really smart and you're good
at business and that type of shit,

1292
01:22:35,131 --> 01:22:38,790
you go out and make money in the second
you make money, what's going to happen?

1293
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:41,370
A bunch of fucking cons are
gonna come out of the woodwork.

1294
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,000
Who wouldn't have fucked you back in the
day because you couldn't throw a ball

1295
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:47,250
through a fucking hoop.
You know?

1296
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:51,120
That's what that twats wanted to vacuum
up when they were in high school.

1297
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,840
The now all of a sudden look at you,

1298
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:57,740
you invented a fucking Hula
Hoop or whatever the hell
you did and now they want

1299
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,633
to bang you.

1300
01:22:59,770 --> 01:22:59,960
Okay?

1301
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,920
Right. Isn't that how it
works? Anything? I am flailing.

1302
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,300
Yeah.

1303
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,440
I'm walking around.

1304
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:10,250
Why do I feel like I have to make it 50
minutes spill if you don't have anything

1305
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,680
to say, fucking bail.
Um, let me hike this. Um,

1306
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:20,570
the m m m m podcast.com is the fan page,
the official fan page,

1307
01:23:20,571 --> 01:23:24,260
the only one that I sponsor, www. The MLM,

1308
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:28,760
podcast.com. It's the only one that I,
that I did. Well, who's kidding? Who?

1309
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:31,460
It's the only fucking one there is,
but it's the only one that I sponsor.

1310
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:35,750
I'm trying to make it sound more official.
Um, but anyways, I think there is that,

1311
01:23:35,751 --> 01:23:36,830
the podcast for this week.

1312
01:23:36,831 --> 01:23:40,400
I'm literally laying on my back right
now just staring at the ceiling wondering

1313
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:45,170
where it all went wrong. Do I have
anything left to talk about? Oh,

1314
01:23:45,171 --> 01:23:48,770
I got something for you. Somebody
sent me an email. Let me,

1315
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,530
let me just reach for this fucking Straw.
At this point,

1316
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:57,160
somebody sent me an email and it said
overrated in the subject line and then I

1317
01:23:58,131 --> 01:24:03,131
open it and it said the Beatles
and then underneath that he wrote,

1318
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:06,630
yeah, I said it. Okay.

1319
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,620
Let me tell you something right now.
What?

1320
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,610
Like how much I fucking
hate people who go, yeah,

1321
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,300
I said it.
You know like this shocking you.

1322
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,990
Like they're going after some
sort of fucking, you know, taboo.

1323
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:21,420
Okay.

1324
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:25,500
If you're ever in a comedy club, all
right. And there's a comedian on,

1325
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:30,600
on stage and they, they're
allowed one. Yeah, I said it.

1326
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:32,820
If they do any more than that.
Yeah.

1327
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:37,140
You have my blessing to start
throwing shit at them. I hate that.

1328
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:42,141
That fucking false dangerous
fucking horse shit.

1329
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:48,130
Fucking bitches need to get a job.
What asks say ass shit.

1330
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,350
You guys can't handle the truth.

1331
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:57,230
You keep fucking going. Yeah, I said
it. What? I said it, but it's like dude,

1332
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,150
nobody in the crowd is going. Who
said that? Did you say that? Yeah,

1333
01:25:02,151 --> 01:25:05,620
I said it. You know what I mean? Like,

1334
01:25:05,621 --> 01:25:08,830
like they're being let out and
fucking let out and fucking handcuffs.

1335
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,640
When will people realize that
nothing is shocking? You know,

1336
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,940
look at the fucking Catholic Church.
Look what the fuck they're doing.

1337
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,410
You know what is more shocking than that?

1338
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:23,160
The fact that they fucking
look the other way.

1339
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,660
Cause I understand why
they look the other way.

1340
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,690
Cause there's so much fucking
money involved and you know,

1341
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,790
to get to the top of any sort of pyramid,
you have to be an ass kissing cunt.

1342
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:35,730
That's basically what it is.
Unless you created it,

1343
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,820
unless you created
whatever pyramid there is.

1344
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:41,070
And at that point you
want your ass kissed.

1345
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:42,550
Yeah.

1346
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:45,350
So whenever there's money involved,
they don't give a shit. I,

1347
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,340
you know what is the most shocking thing
about all that is that people continue

1348
01:25:48,341 --> 01:25:49,570
to go to the Catholic church.

1349
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:52,310
Okay.

1350
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:56,120
Can anybody out there explained
to me how they separate that?

1351
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:57,110
How do you separate that?

1352
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:02,111
How do you still go to the Catholic
Church knowing that they had 16,000 cases?

1353
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:06,320
Those are just the ones that came forward.
16 fucking thousand.

1354
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,450
That's the population of a small town.

1355
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:14,120
16,000 fucking rates of children and
you still go and you give them fucking

1356
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:17,060
money. What do you think they're
going to use that money for?

1357
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:21,970
Lawyers to get these fucking guys off.
You know?

1358
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,073
I don't know.

1359
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:24,100
Okay.

1360
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,830
Why don't I go Jesus
Christ. Why? Why Bill? Why?

1361
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:30,130
Why do you go down that fucking
road? All right. You know what?

1362
01:26:30,131 --> 01:26:33,820
I'm really off my fucking game. Okay.
Pate manning threw an interception.

1363
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:36,130
The final fucking drive of the Superbowl.
This is my,

1364
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:40,720
this is my fucking Peyton manning
Superbowl game right here. Cause this,

1365
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:41,620
this podcast,

1366
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:45,910
was it disjointed cluster fuck
and I really have nothing done.

1367
01:26:45,911 --> 01:26:48,430
I really think I was going
to come here and I was,

1368
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:52,480
I had a little information
about Avocados and uh,

1369
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:56,260
what is the United Kingdom when I was
somehow going to be able to fucking talk

1370
01:26:56,261 --> 01:27:00,370
for 50 minutes.
Do you realize like when you guys,

1371
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:02,790
you get your,

1372
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:06,310
you have to understand is the level of
fucking ego that it takes that I can look

1373
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:09,190
at three different things and think
that I could run my fucking mouth for 50

1374
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:11,140
minutes. It's not, this is
even the podcast anymore.

1375
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:16,380
This is my confession scene that I didn't
get to do because they're retooling

1376
01:27:16,571 --> 01:27:20,530
it. All right. You broke me down.
It's fucking over. You got me.

1377
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:22,630
I have nothing left.

1378
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,380
I bought the box set of the wire
just looking at mom around my room

1379
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,020
trying to come up with something.
My voice gets weaker

1380
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,210
and I watched the first fucking season
and that's a fucking great TV show,

1381
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:38,770
but I'm not going to be
one of those guys who goes,

1382
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:42,760
it's the greatest TV show ever.
It's fucking good.

1383
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,420
It's a really good show. I
like it. I like it a lot. Did.

1384
01:27:46,421 --> 01:27:48,760
I gave a spelling test
and I really do that.

1385
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:51,310
I gave a spelling test
on the fucking podcast.

1386
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,200
All right. You know what? I'm going to,
I'm going to bow out gracefully right now.

1387
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,530
Okay? If you want, I add, I
added a date. Here we go. Let me,

1388
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,410
let me actually use this podcast.
What I really want to use it for,

1389
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:08,490
my ulterior motive here is the height.
My goddamn dates.

1390
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,560
I got some new dates out there.
Everybody.

1391
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:16,200
Let's go to the official website of
Bill Burr is doing officially one of the

1392
01:28:16,201 --> 01:28:20,670
worst podcasts ever. Um,

cancer show show for cancer.

1395
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,170
Hey, let's get rid of the
cancer. Everybody. I believe
that's the name of it.

1396
01:28:34,171 --> 01:28:37,680
It's a fucking benefit for cancer.
Um,

1397
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:42,150
I'm going to get the punch line in
Atlanta, April 8th, ninth and 10th,

1398
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,540
and I'm hanging around the 11th.
I have tickets for the finals,

1399
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:48,970
not the final is the final
day of the masters. We,

1400
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,300
another buddy of mine are going down

1401
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:56,690

Who's kidding? Who? You know he's sick.

1402
01:28:56,691 --> 01:29:00,420
A Bang in that broad. That's why you
fucked around on her. It was her fault.

1403
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:03,840
She stopped them. You know,
she wasn't washing the dishes,

1404
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:05,910
she didn't make sandwiches
for them anymore.

1405
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,770
She started taking tiger for granted and
tiger was sitting there and his billion

1406
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,210
dollar lazy boy.
And he's like,

1407
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:17,520
is this bitch take and tiger woods the
greatest fucking golfer of all time?

1408
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:19,170
Yeah,

1409
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:21,550
actually isn't Jack
Nicklaus Jack Nicklaus is,

1410
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,040
but she's taken me for granted. Fuck
this. I'm going to go fuck a whore.

1411
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:31,070
That's the one thing that I hated about
that story is how they just never blamed

1412
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:36,261
her for his fucking around
because it was clearly her fault.

1413
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:38,610
Yeah.

1414
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:41,790
And if you're wondering why
I'm coming up with that,

1415
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:44,990
I'm just using the F, you know, it's um,

1416
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:49,530
I'm saying it because of my
respect for females, you know,

1417
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:55,890
because I respect you guys so much
that I'm actually using your train of

1418
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,300
thought.
When you look at,

1419
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,840
when you see a woman get
caught cheating and you always,

1420
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:01,960
you always blame the guy.

1421
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:07,380
Well it's funny cause he wasn't paying
attention to or it's probably because he

1422
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:09,650
was doing this.
It's probably because he was doing

1423
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,830
well the shoe's on the other foot,
you know,

1424
01:30:12,831 --> 01:30:15,380
they never say it's cause she
wanted to go out and get some Dick.

1425
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:19,140
Now they have a cause of that cause
it's something that guy was doing.

1426
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:23,030
He left his shoes in the fucking kitchen
after she'd fucking mopped the floor.

1427
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:27,650
So therefore she had to go to the fucking
Luxor and collapse on somebody else's

1428
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:31,490
cock. Right. It's her fault.

1429
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,460
You know, where the fuck does she get
off getting mad at fucking tiger woods.

1430
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,290
Do you even have a fucking job woman?

1431
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:47,110
What is your job to go around?
Go Dog fucking Tannen. Yeah.

1432
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,333
What are you going to do?

1433
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:54,610
I love these fucking twats who are
married to some unbelievably rich person.

1434
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:55,640
Okay?

1435
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:59,990
They have kids with them and they don't
have a fucking job and they still get

1436
01:30:59,991 --> 01:31:03,800
help. Still got to have some
fucking, you know nanny.

1437
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,620
It's like,
do you want to fucking do anything?

1438
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,890
I tell you that that's the guy's fault.

1439
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:14,030
If you marry a fucking woman who
you're making so much goddamn money,

1440
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:18,260
all right that they don't even have a
fucking job and they still need help.

1441
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,480
You need help with doing nothing.

1442
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:22,573
I'm raising kids

1443
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,470
that are dirty with the foot. My Mother
did that and at a job, you're lazy.

1444
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,130
Twat get off the Goddamn Sofa.
That's what I would do.

1445
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:35,860
I take a right across my knee and pull
off her fucking Gucci flip flop and I'd

1446
01:31:35,861 --> 01:31:40,420
fucking paddle or right butt cheek until
she admitted how fucking wrong she was.

1447
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,270
What do think about that? Maybe that's
why I'm not a billionaire, you know,

1448
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,850
cause that's how I do it. John Papa
Razzi would take a picture of it.

1449
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:53,540
I do that paddle a little fucking
right, Fannie. As I had grapes

1450
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,920
and then when they questioned
me, I just, we fucked you.

1451
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:00,610
The God Damn Golfer in the world.

1452
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:02,860
Okay,

1453
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,170
thanks to me.
Your Sundays aren't boring.

1454
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,923
Okay,

1455
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:11,900
come here. Come over here. I'll fucking
sign your camera for you. All right.

1456
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:16,680
Take the film out as no film anymore.
It's fucking digital, right? I Dunno.

1457
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,580
I want somebody who embrace being a
piece of shit. That's what I want.

1458
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:24,470
That's what I got to say there.
Tiger Woods wife is a lazy fucking Twat.

1459
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:26,690
All right?
And that's why he cheated on her.

1460
01:32:26,691 --> 01:32:28,130
And I'm going to tell you this right now.

1461
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:32,570
The reason why he's playing the
masters is because they need the money.

1462
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:36,890
All right? This guy is at work since
November and I know what you're thinking.

1463
01:32:36,891 --> 01:32:38,990
Oh God, it, well, he's a
fucking billionaire. Yeah.

1464
01:32:38,991 --> 01:32:41,810
And he's living the lifestyle of a
billionaire. Do you think he wants to?

1465
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,050
Of course he does. And he's got
to keep that fucking whore happy,

1466
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,233
you know?

1467
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,320
Do you think she, who do you think
paid for all the fucking window?

1468
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:53,810
She smashed with that golf club,
right?

1469
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:58,970
I like how we denied that shit in that
attack me with a golf club. Really?

1470
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,390
Your windows exploded and then you
drove into a tree where you fucking on

1471
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:05,480
mushrooms. Did you think you
could drive into that little?

1472
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,020
Not In the center of the trunk.
Tiger me a fucking break.

1473
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,540
What are you sticking up for?
You know why?

1474
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:15,170
Because he married her the fucking idiot.
Now he's got this contract.

1475
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:19,400
You can't get ease. He's looking
to lose all the fucking idiot.

1476
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:25,310
I hope. I hope she listens
to this. I don't even know
our Goddamn name. You know?

1477
01:33:25,311 --> 01:33:28,700
I don't know your name sweetheart, because
you never did anything with your life.

1478
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:34,130
You know was the last time you even
fucking, you have even when a swim meet.

1479
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,210
What about the preschool level?
When kids are just happy,

1480
01:33:38,211 --> 01:33:40,640
they can even fucking stand up.
Did even when a ribbon,

1481
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:45,600
what have you ever done
besides suck the Dick

1482
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:55,910
suck the Dick of the greatest golfer
of the last 50 fucking years other than

1483
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:01,740
Jack Nicholas. You know, that's your big
accomplishment in life. Oh, your hurt.

1484
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,970
Let me ask the fellows a question.
Let me ask you this,

1485
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:10,530
what have you was shacking up
with fucking Oprah like Stedman.

1486
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,560
Do you think he gives a fuck
if she fucks around on him?

1487
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:18,390
Got to chase him down this or
down the street with a ladle.

1488
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:23,340
Some other fucking utensil.
Cause you know Oprah be eaten right?

1489
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:28,420
You think he'd flipped? I wouldn't give
a shit gon fuck whoever you want. Oprah.

1490
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:31,760
I don't give a shit.
Can I have another car?

1491
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,670
That'd be awesome. What are
you doing today? Nothing.

1492
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:40,123
Do Nothing.

1493
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:44,630
Well he fucking Xbox that pitches
doing what everybody wants to do.

1494
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,630
Absolutely fucking nothing. You
want to be. Why don't we work?

1495
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:53,590
We work so we can. We can have one
zillions of what that bitch has.

1496
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,590
She has the nerve to get mad at this
guy because he's out there banging some

1497
01:34:56,591 --> 01:35:00,730
fucking skank
cause he's tired of her fucking lazy ass.

1498
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:08,670
The fuck is wrong with people.
Why not the one out what I said it

1499
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:13,700
say it? Yeah, she's fucking lazy.

1500
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:18,380
Anytime you see a guy fucking around
on his woman, I'm telling you.

1501
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:19,920
Yeah.

1502
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,110
Part of it is because he's a dog.

1503
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:25,500
The other part is because
these women are so fucking,

1504
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,390
they'll just lazy
the,

1505
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,400
it's like they're not even human.
They're just slothful.

1506
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:37,730
Do you know they just sit or religious?
Fucking laying around.

1507
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,270
Get off your ass is all you.

1508
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:44,120
You want us to stop fucking around you?

1509
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:46,670
Get off your fucking lazy ass
is what do you think about that?

1510
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,470
All right. That's 49 minutes.
Here we go. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1511
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,620
I'll fucking women out there. Somebody
had to go down so we had to get hurt.

1512
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:59,190
You know I had nothing. I was
flailing. I was on the fucking ropes.

1513
01:35:59,191 --> 01:36:02,490
What'd you want from me?
All right.

1514
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:06,200
49 minutes and 31 seconds. I
have another fucking, uh, oh,

1515
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:10,350
I didn't finish hype and my gigs.
Let me finish typing my gigs. Um,

1516
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,120
I just added a date.

1517
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:17,810
I'm going to be in a
Cincinnati via Newport,

1518
01:36:18,181 --> 01:36:21,990
Kentucky. I'm going to be at
the funny bone. All right,

1519
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:26,040
so why don't you all you fucking rednecks
get or didn't and come down to the

1520
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:28,140
fucking club. All right. Now.

1521
01:36:28,141 --> 01:36:31,590
I know I'm not going to be standing there
and overalls with a fucking piece of

1522
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:31,950
work.

1523
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,780
[inaudible] hanging out of my teeth going,
yeah,

1524
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:36,860
we're try to shoot a
fucking pen and you're gone.

1525
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,860
That's crazy.
Ain't a fucking kid car criteria.

1526
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,650
I know.
I'm not going to be knowing that.

1527
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,580
Why don't you broaden your
fucking horizons? All right.

1528
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:54,850
God damn pig fuckers. When are you guys
going to come into the 21st century? Um,

1529
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,780
where am I going to be after?

1530
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,890
Um, oh, I'm going to be
at the, uh, the Wilbur,

1531
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,440
the Wilbur Theater in Boston.
Jody's got to be at the fucking Wilbur.

1532
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,950
I'm at.
We actually added a date on May 6th,

1533
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:16,720
and for some reason it's not up on my
site. May 6th and May 7th, May 8th,

1534
01:37:16,721 --> 01:37:21,400
and it'll be at the Taj Mahal in
beautiful downtown Atlantic city.

1535
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,570
And when I think a glamour,
I think of Jersey, um,

1536
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:27,970
I'm going to shit on every
fucking place that I'm playing.

1537
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:32,910
All You Jersey shore scumbags going to
come down there with your fucking track

1538
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:37,060
suits, Huh? Oh look.
Like some grease stuff.

1539
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:40,660
Fucking $6 million, man.
You're not impressing me.

1540
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:47,310
Chicks with your big fucking Olympic
sized Jody Watley who bearings.

1541
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:52,120
I know that's not real gold. Just
like you're Tan. It's fucking fake.

1542
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:56,580
Come on down. Uh, what else do I got a,

1543
01:37:56,590 --> 01:38:00,270
I got a Gig in a,
in Los Angeles at the Hollywood improv.

1544
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:05,480
All right, well how do I
shit on this? I live here.

1545
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,410
Come on. You phony. Fuck
out. It's all been done.

1546
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:14,340
How about some of the fucking Mexicans
show up? You know, Jesus Christ,

1547
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,680
80% of the population.

1548
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,680
You figure you could send a fucking crew
to come down there and represent your

1549
01:38:18,681 --> 01:38:21,980
people. Starting to think you guys
don't like me. What? Did I ever say?

1550
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:25,820
Bad about Mexico? Nothing. And you know
why it's cause I haven't read about it yet

1551
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:31,820
and that's it. Then. Don't be a Caroline's
in June. I'm going to be in Montreal,

1552
01:38:31,821 --> 01:38:35,330
Canada. You know, I love that.

1553
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:40,970
That's like the minor league for Paris.
That's what that shit is. You know,

1554
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:46,910
all those silly little French guys going
up there acting like they don't speak

1555
01:38:46,911 --> 01:38:51,470
English, you know, with
their pointy noses. You know,

1556
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:52,041
they all get that.

1557
01:38:52,041 --> 01:38:56,480
Wayne Gretzky face and their little
feathered mullets like run, do gay,

1558
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:59,690
you know I'm going to be coming up there.

1559
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:03,380
You know what sucks is every time I do
Montreal, it's never during hockey season.

1560
01:39:03,381 --> 01:39:06,620
So I haven't been to their new,
their new place sucks. Anyways,

1561
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:10,460
I actually went to the
old forum in March of 89.

1562
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:11,960
You can fucking look this up too,

1563
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,090
because I remember they played
the Minnesota north stars.

1564
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:19,640
I was at that game and uh,
and I had a good time.

1565
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:22,610
And that's the podcast for this
week. Everybody. Do you see that?

1566
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:23,870
We had a spelling test.

1567
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:28,340
I talked about Avocados and I went
off on the broads for like 10 minutes.

1568
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:30,320
There's your podcast
for this fucking week.

1569
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:33,290
I'm really hoping I w w w that
we get everything ironed out.

1570
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:36,110
I'm sick of saying this. I don't know
what the fucking problem is. All right,

1571
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:41,000
but I'm the talent. All right. I'm
not on the computer side. Okay.

1572
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:45,290
That's not up to me. I don't call the
place. All right. I got a headset on.

1573
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:50,330
I just fucking execute them. Alright.
I'm responsible for on field shit.

1574
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:55,410
Not this behind the scenes stuff.
So send all your complaints to Bill Burrs,

1575
01:39:55,430 --> 01:40:00,190
web guy at www dot
[inaudible] dot com backslash,

1576
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:04,720

right, I'll talk to you next week.
