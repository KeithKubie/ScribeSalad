00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.670
It’s big.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.600
Yeah, it’s big.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.670
This is on the big machine, right?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.020
Yeah, this is on the big machine.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.920
Drake with solar active.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.520
Yeah.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.440
Yeah.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.960
So, if we were to take this outside and it
was sunny out…

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.150
Is this, which color is this?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.540
It’s blue.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.040
It would turn blue.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.320
Immediately.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.070
So we’re here today to look at the components
and units that have been completed for the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:04.739
largest canopy, which is over 1,000 different
cells, 1,055 to be exact.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.980
And then we’ll move on to the medium canopy.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:16.920
And so Tom is taking us through the process
on their end and the knitting process is the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.350
first stage in terms of the production.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.800
The second stage will be the finishing and
the sewing of each of the units.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:40.640
So to make this, we make this pattern
and each dot describes each stitch.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.280
So, for example, this blue is programmed to
make a hole.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:59.360
So we make this digital pattern and then this
is actual like language to the machine.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.600
So then we transfer data to the machine.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:18.400
And we feed the data and then, yeah that’s it.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.920
So,  Lumen is composed of many, many parts and
just like in biology where surfaces and morphologies

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.879
are produced from single units, a cell networking
with its neighbor and it networking with its

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.959
neighbor to form larger surfaces.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.310
Each one of these becomes a part of the canopy.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.600
We may have, you know, 250 of these larges that all have the same circumference,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.440
but then when they get finished into the nylon net, those circumferences change based on the pre-stress.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.240
So this side will get sewn to its neighbor,
this side will get sewn to its neighbor,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.000
this side will get sewn to its neighbor.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.190
So it ends up forming a non-standard unit.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.840
And I mean I find knitting so fascinating
on that level.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.720
I mean you can look at the scale of that, right, to the scale of the canopy and there’s a hierarchy

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.320
that takes place in terms of how the material
assembly works.
