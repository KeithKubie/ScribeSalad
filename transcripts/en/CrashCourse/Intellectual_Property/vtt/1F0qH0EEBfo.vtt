Hi, I'm John Green, and this is not Crash
Course: World History because we're taking

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.380
a week off. However, we do have four episodes
of World History left. After that, we will

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.550
be done. We will be done learning about the
history of the world. We will have completed

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.369
it. We will know everything that there is
to know about world history. Congratulations.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.909
Stan has just informed me that, apparently,
there is more world history than just what

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.169
we talked about on Crash Course: World History.
That's disappointing to learn. He also says

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.109
that some stuff happened today that we haven't
covered, and that stuff will happen tomorrow,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.179
and et cetera…hhuuhhh. History. It just
keeps happening!

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.850
Anyway, speaking of Stan: starting in a few
weeks, Stan is going to be hosting a Crash

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.329
Course miniseries on intellectual property
and copyright law, which is hugely important

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.869
to all of us who care about making things and art and
the quality of internet, so I'm very excited for that.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:51.389
Also, there's going to be Crash Course: Economics. Adrian Hill &amp; Jacob Clifford will be teaming up to teach

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:56.889
you economics so that you can understand, you know, why you are oppressed by the system of capitalism.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.059
Apparently Stan says that I can't say that.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.739
So that you can understand why the system
of capitalism has been so beneficial to you.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.820
Apparently Stan says I also can't say that.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
I—I don't know. That's why I'm going—I'm
going to, to learn as well.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.880
As for me, in the coming year I'll be popping
into Crash Course videos here and there, but

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.969
I have this other job, writing books. Come
to think of it, it's both an intellectual

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.270
property problem and an economics problem.
So I, I'm going to try to write a book in

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.430
the coming year, so you won't see quite as
much of me, but enjoy Crash Course: Economics

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.490
and Crash Course: Intellectual Property.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.399
Stan says that I have to leave the frame now
so that he can enter it. Bye!

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.430
Stan: Hi, I'm Stan Muller, and I'm a real
person.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.360
I'm very excited that this April I'm going to spend
a few weeks teaching you about intellectual property.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.440
The idea of protecting intellectual
property has been around for a long time.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.259
We're gonna talk about the history of IP,
how it works, and what it looks like today.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.499
Anyway, I'm really excited to learn about all this amazing stuff with you. I'll see you in a few weeks.
