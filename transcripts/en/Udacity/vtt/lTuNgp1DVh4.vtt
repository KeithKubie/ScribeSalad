00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.400
Now let's try something a little
more tricky but a lot more useful.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.366
Let's say that sales tax is 6.75%.

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.590
And you spend $40 at the store.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.070
How much will you have to pay for
sales tax?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.300
And for this question I
recommend you try something.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.610
And then see if your
answer is reasonable.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.100
If you get an answer of $240, that
probably doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.670
That's too much sales tax.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.610
So just keep that in mind as
you're entering your answer.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.520
And you can enter your
answer here in dollars.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.780
You don't need to
include the dollar sign.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.470
I'll put it there for you.
