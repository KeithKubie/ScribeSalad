00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.794
You all should have these
handouts ready to go now.

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.526
Let's review where we were last
week.

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:25.776
If everyone can settle down a
little bit, you can discuss

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:29.875
about who wants to be the top
chemistry major later on,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.868
after class is over.
All right.

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:36.167
Octahedral case.
Here is our octahedral

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.119
molecule.
And, again, crystal field

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:44.416
theory is just an explanation
for the things that are observed

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:48.236
experimentally.
It is a fairly simple theory.

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:52.925
And, if you go on to study
chemistry, and you will take

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:58.047
more inorganic chemistry later
on, you will learn about more

00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:02.703
complicated theories.
But this is really simple.

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:05.849
This simple theory just thinks
about each ligand,

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.995
each small molecule,
like NH three group,

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:11.813
bound to a metal.
The metal is in the center

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.434
position.
That each ligand considers as a

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.907
negative point charge.
And so then the theory looks at

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:20.987
whether that ligand,
as a negative point charge,

00:01:20.987 --> 00:01:23.609
is pointing toward one of the
d-orbitals.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.000
You need to know about the
shapes of the d-orbitals.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.934
And you need to know about the
shapes of the coordination

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.674
complexes.
And then you need to just ask

00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:38.187
yourself, is that ligand
pointing directly toward a

00:01:38.187 --> 00:01:40.646
d-orbital.
If it is, then it will be

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.473
destabilized.
If it is not,

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:45.142
then those orbitals will be
stabilized.

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:49.358
And so you are talking about
the stabilization relative to an

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:53.573
imaginary spherical and crystal
field, where ligands are just

00:01:53.573 --> 00:01:58.000
sort of everywhere all around
the center metal.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.967
You consider that as sort of
your standard case where all of

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.321
the d-orbitals have the same
energy.

00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.154
But then when you consider
those ligands as negative point

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:11.919
charges in particular locations,
some d-orbitals then get

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.811
destabilized,
and other ones get stabilized,

00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:17.971
in terms of energy.
In the octahedral case then,

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.939
and here is our little cartoon
for the octahedral case where

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.436
there are ligands along the
z-axis, ligands along the

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:29.000
x-axis, and ligands along the
y-axis.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.818
And so if you look at d x
squared minus y squared,

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:36.227
you see that the
ligands will be pointing

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:39.772
directly toward these
d-orbitals, because ligands are

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:43.590
coming along y and along x.
And so there will be a lot of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.522
destabilization.
For d z squared,

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:50.272
you have ligands pointing
directly toward those orbitals

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:54.090
as well along the z-axis.
These have large repulsions due

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.045
to the negative point charges.
Those negative point charges

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:02.000
are heading right toward those
d-orbitals.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.828
And these two are degenerate
with respect to each other.

00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:08.890
They have the same energy,
the same amount of

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.814
destabilization.
And these are destabilized

00:03:11.814 --> 00:03:14.598
compared to this other set of
d-orbitals.

00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:18.357
And in this set of d-orbitals,
none of the orbitals are

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.932
on-axis.
They are 45 degrees off-axis.

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:23.577
The negative point charges are
on-axis.

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.083
There is not as much
destabilization.

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:29.981
The ligands are not pointing
directly toward any of these

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.023
d-orbitals.
You have smaller repulsion.

00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:38.369
All of these three of the same
energy, they are degenerate.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.966
And they are all stabilized
compared to this set.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:44.813
That is what we talked about
last week.

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:48.860
And we also talked about how
you can draw an octahedral

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.506
crystal field splitting diagram.
And here is the average energy

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:58.302
of the d-orbitals with this sort
of spherical crystal field where

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:02.590
ligands are everywhere.
And so when ligands are

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.323
everywhere, all of the
d-orbitals have the same energy.

00:04:06.323 --> 00:04:09.918
But then when you put the
ligands in their locations,

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:13.790
in the octahedral geometry
framework, then these two sets

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.214
of orbitals, d x squared minus y
squared and d z

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:20.703
squared,
are up in energy,

00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:24.022
they are destabilized.
And these three go down in

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.511
energy.
And the overall energy of the

00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:30.611
system is maintained.
Here is the crystal field

00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.189
splitting energy for the
octahedral case,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.509
O for octahedral.
And so it is split.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.311
Two orbitals go up in energy,
so they go up by three-fifths,

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:42.083
three go down,
so they go down by two-fifths

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.983
to maintain the overall energy
of this system.

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:48.785
That is what we talked about
last time, and I just wanted to

00:04:48.785 --> 00:04:52.652
review it, because we are going
to go on and talk about other

00:04:52.652 --> 00:04:54.779
types of geometry.
And, of course,

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.099
remember that Exam 3 is on
Wednesday.

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.142
Extra problems are posted.
I will mention that I actually

00:05:02.142 --> 00:05:06.357
posted the original exam last
year, and the exam that people

00:05:06.357 --> 00:05:09.642
took was slightly easier than
the one I posted.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:14.071
I did that actually by mistake.
But it turns out that if you do

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:18.571
the exam that is posted it is a
better indicator of how well you

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:22.571
will do on this next exam.
The third exam last year was a

00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.714
bit too easy,
i.e., too easy meaning the sort

00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:30.000
of outstanding category was like
98% and above.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.478
And if you got a 97% then that
was no longer outstanding,

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:36.956
so whether you got three
significant figures wrong or two

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:39.068
made some difference in your
grade.

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:42.795
That clustering I don't like.
I like to have the average such

00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:46.645
that people's performance on the
exam really indicates more how

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:50.000
well they know the material.
The exam that is posted is

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.105
actually the better review.
Even though that was an

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:56.770
accident, I will pretend I did
it on purpose because it is a

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.000
better thing.
So, extra problems on.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.868
Today, we are going to finish
up crystal field theory and then

00:06:03.868 --> 00:06:06.913
talk about the relevance of
crystal field theory.

00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:10.655
And the relevance comes in to
explaining the colors of these

00:06:10.655 --> 00:06:13.953
transition compounds.
Compounds with metals have some

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:17.061
really spectacular colors.
And you can explain and

00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.739
rationalize some of these colors
by this really very simple

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:24.038
theory, so that is fun.
And you can also explain some

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:27.653
of the properties and magnetism
of these compounds by this

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.541
fairly simple theory.
Okay.

00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:34.660
Let's look at the tetrahedral
case now.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.779
Here, we have our tetrahedral
molecule.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:44.958
I will try to kind of hold it
up as it is displayed on the

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.017
board.
In this case,

00:06:47.017 --> 00:06:52.003
we have two ligands up,
one coming towards you,

00:06:52.003 --> 00:06:56.989
one going back.
And then we have two ligands in

00:06:56.989 --> 00:07:02.553
the plane of the screen.
And, in this case,

00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:07.126
the convention is to draw the
z-axis coming down here,

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:11.355
and the y-axis is kind of
coming in from the side,

00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:15.152
and the x-axis is coming out
toward you here.

00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:18.172
That is what this picture
indicates.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:23.177
The crystal field splitting
energy tends to be smaller than

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:27.837
the octahedral crystal field
energy because none of the

00:07:27.837 --> 00:07:32.756
ligand point charges are really
pointing toward any of the

00:07:32.756 --> 00:07:36.948
d-orbitals.
Let's just take a look at all

00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:40.778
the d-orbitals and consider,
then, which ones are going to

00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:43.130
have more repulsion than other
ones.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.027
If we go through and take a
look at it, and I have tried to

00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:50.521
indicate, here are our
tetrahedral cases and here are

00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:53.142
five d-orbitals.
And these little lines,

00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:56.636
the negative charge and the
arrow, is sort of a rough

00:07:56.636 --> 00:08:00.399
approximation of how those
ligand point charges are going

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.229
to be coming in and pointing
toward the d-orbitals if they

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:09.000
are coming in with this
tetrahedral geometry as drawn.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.929
And so you can see for the d x
squared minus y squared,

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:16.794
none of those ligands
are pointing right any of the

00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:20.015
d-orbitals, and they are
definitely not for the d z

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:23.429
squared either.
A little bit more here but,

00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:25.941
again, not exactly pointing
toward them.

00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:30.000
Although, this picture looks
like it is a little bit.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.128
Again, it is closer here,
but not exact.

00:08:33.128 --> 00:08:37.540
The result of this is that
there is more destabilization

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.513
down here than there is up here.
It turns out that this is then

00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:47.085
opposite of the octahedral case
that we just talked about.

00:08:47.085 --> 00:08:50.454
And octahedral,
these are the ones that are

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:53.101
most destabilized.
In tetrahedral,

00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:56.550
these are stabilized compared
to the others.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:02.228
It is flipped exactly around.
Again, there would be more

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:07.542
repulsion between the ligands as
negative point charges and the

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:10.628
orbitals that are 45 degree
off-axis.

00:09:10.628 --> 00:09:14.142
Because here,
the ligands are off axis and

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:19.371
also the orbitals are off axis.
They are not directly pointing

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:23.657
at each other but it is
definitely worse down here.

00:09:23.657 --> 00:09:30.000
These guys are really far away
from those ligand point charges.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.687
These two will have the same
energy with respect to each

00:09:34.687 --> 00:09:37.670
other.
They will also be degenerate,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.846
as they were before.
And these three have the same

00:09:41.846 --> 00:09:44.659
energy with respect to each
other.

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:48.920
They are also degenerate.
Then we can draw what the

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.926
diagram will look like for the
tetrahedral case.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.909
Again, here was the octahedral
case.

00:09:55.909 --> 00:10:00.000
Now, this is the tetrahedral
case.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.780
And so we have the splitting
energy, which is the energy that

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.241
splits the orbitals based on
these negative point charges

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:13.384
compared to this theoretical
spherical crystal field.

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:18.244
And we also have a tetrahedral
crystal field splitting energy.

00:10:18.244 --> 00:10:21.431
That is drawn here.
Now, the first thing,

00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:25.016
which I emphasize that I will
point out again,

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:29.000
is that these guys are flipped
around.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.094
Instead of being destabilized
as they are in the octahedral

00:10:33.094 --> 00:10:36.270
crystal field,
the d x squared minus y squared

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.576
and d z squared
are now stabilized

00:10:40.576 --> 00:10:42.905
compared to the other orbital
set.

00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:46.576
They have switched positions.
These, instead of being

00:10:46.576 --> 00:10:48.905
stabilized, are more
destabilized.

00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:52.505
It is a direct switch.
There is also a little change

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:55.894
in nomenclature here.
You can still refer to this

00:10:55.894 --> 00:11:00.991
orbital set with the term E.
But instead of e g we

00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:03.446
have E.
And I will just point out that

00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:07.163
the book calls this E two
and sometimes it calls

00:11:07.163 --> 00:11:08.823
it E.
It should just be E.

00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:12.805
This is kind of a small point,
but I don't want people to get

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.393
confused by that.
And instead of t two g,

00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:18.115
we have t two up here.

00:11:18.115 --> 00:11:20.902
Basically, the g term is gone
in this case.

00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:24.951
And you will learn a lot more
about that if you go on and take

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:29.000
more inorganic chemistry.
These are flipped.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.623
What else is true?
Well, the other thing that is

00:11:32.623 --> 00:11:36.941
true is that this splitting
energy is much smaller in the

00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:40.795
tetrahedral case than it is in
the octahedral case.

00:11:40.795 --> 00:11:45.190
Here there is a much bigger
distance between the orbitals.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.811
Here it is a much smaller
distance.

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:51.049
And that is because in the
octahedral case,

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:55.136
there are ligands pointing
directly at the d-orbitals.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:58.990
In this framework for
octahedral, there are ligands

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.000
right along z,
along x, and along y.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.831
And so they are along all of
the orbitals,

00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.386
pointing directly toward the
orbitals.

00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:11.976
In the tetrahedral case,
they are not really pointing

00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:15.222
directly toward.
They are closer to some than to

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:19.434
others, but it is not as direct.
A result of that is that this

00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:23.025
is just not split that much.
There is not such a huge

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:27.237
difference between the energy
levels of the d-orbitals in this

00:12:27.237 --> 00:12:30.000
case.
What does this mean?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.166
Well, it means that a lot of
tetrahedral complexes,

00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:39.083
because the splitting energy is
small, are called high spin.

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:43.916
And we talked about this last
Monday, that in high spin you

00:12:43.916 --> 00:12:47.666
have the maximum number of
unpaired electrons.

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:52.750
And because of the purpose of
this you can just assume that if

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.000
you have a tetrahedral complex,
is will be high spin.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.696
That will come into play when
you figure out how to put your

00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:07.313
electrons into this diagram,
whether you put them in singly

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:10.975
to the fullest extent possible
without pairing,

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:13.920
or if you start to pair.
In this case,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.457
you can put them in singly to
the fullest extent possible.

00:13:18.457 --> 00:13:20.606
Okay.
As I mentioned before,

00:13:20.606 --> 00:13:24.348
the overall energy of this
system is maintained.

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:27.691
In this case,
you have two orbitals that go

00:13:27.691 --> 00:13:31.657
up in energy.
They go up by three-fifths.

00:13:31.657 --> 00:13:34.173
Three that come down,
so they come down by

00:13:34.173 --> 00:13:35.646
two-fifths.
In this case,

00:13:35.646 --> 00:13:38.407
you have three going up,
so they will go up by

00:13:38.407 --> 00:13:40.924
two-fifths.
And you have two going down in

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:44.545
energy, so they will go down by
three-fifths to maintain the

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:47.000
overall energy of the system.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.500
That's the tetrahedral case.
Now let's consider square

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.299
planar.
Here, we have our square planar

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:10.899
molecule, and we have ligands
along the y-axis,

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:16.200
and ligands along the x-axis
pointing out towards you;

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.500
one, and one going back behind.
And z, then,

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.000
is coming up and down in this
plane.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.122
With these ligands along y and
along x, which orbitals do you

00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:35.000
predict would be destabilized
the most?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.571
I heard d xy.
That is one.

00:14:38.571 --> 00:14:42.346
What else?
d x squared minus y squared,

00:14:42.346 --> 00:14:44.693
right.

00:14:44.693 --> 00:14:48.571
Those two.
The ones that don't have the

00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:53.061
z-component in them.
There is really not much

00:14:53.061 --> 00:15:00.000
destabilization along z.
There are no ligands along z.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.843
Orbitals that have amplitude
along z are not as affected.

00:15:04.843 --> 00:15:09.686
The ones that will be most
affected are the orbitals that

00:15:09.686 --> 00:15:14.962
have component in the x and the
y direction, where the ligands

00:15:14.962 --> 00:15:17.297
are.
Now we can consider the

00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:21.448
d-orbitals and talk a little bit
more about this.

00:15:21.448 --> 00:15:25.254
If we look at these two sets of
orbitals now,

00:15:25.254 --> 00:15:29.924
here, as you correctly
predicted, there will be lots of

00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:33.775
repulsion.
The ligands are pointing

00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:37.695
directly at these d-orbitals.
The ligands are on-axis.

00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:40.950
The orbitals are on-axis.
It is a direct hit.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.391
There is a lot of
destabilization.

00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:47.756
And this one now is going to be
destabilized compared to all

00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:50.641
other ones.
It is going to be by itself,

00:15:50.641 --> 00:15:55.079
the most destabilized orbital.
d z squared doesn't

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:59.000
really have much destabilization
at all.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.217
In fact, it will be stabilized.
There are no ligands along z,

00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:09.000
there is no real repulsion of
the ligands to d z squared,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.565
so it is going to be
a lot less than for this guy and

00:16:14.565 --> 00:16:19.000
also less than d xy.
We can draw this now,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.043
put in two of the orbitals.
This one is going to be way up.

00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:29.000
It is going to be by far the
most destabilized.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.893
It is going to even go up from
where it was in the octahedral

00:16:32.893 --> 00:16:34.515
case.
Whereas, d z squared,

00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:38.213
which was up here,
degenerate with d x squared

00:16:38.213 --> 00:16:41.782
minus y squared
in the octahedral case,

00:16:41.782 --> 00:16:45.740
is now going to drop way down.
These are not equivalent at all

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.816
anymore.
And so this makes sense.

00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:51.255
The difference between the
octahedral geometry is that

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:54.694
there are ligands along z.
Now the ligands along z are

00:16:54.694 --> 00:16:58.522
gone in the square planar case,
so there is a big difference

00:16:58.522 --> 00:17:03.000
between these two orbitals sets
in terms of energy.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.342
Now, let's look at these three.
This one, as people correctly

00:17:08.342 --> 00:17:13.595
predicted, is going to have a
lot more repulsion than either

00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:18.938
of these, because the orbitals
have maximum amplitude along x

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.965
and y.
They are actually 45 degrees

00:17:21.965 --> 00:17:26.595
off x and y, but still,
we don't have anything in the

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:30.781
z-component here.
This will be destabilized

00:17:30.781 --> 00:17:34.343
compared to these two.
And these two are stabilized

00:17:34.343 --> 00:17:38.689
compared to the d-orbitals 
d xy, d x squared minus y

00:17:38.689 --> 00:17:42.536
squared.
Now we can go and take a look

00:17:42.536 --> 00:17:45.956
at where these would be
positioned approximately.

00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:48.949
If we look at this one,
it is not nearly as

00:17:48.949 --> 00:17:52.938
destabilized as this one.
Still, it is a bit destabilized

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:57.000
and above this.
This one is lower in energy.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.938
And if you consider the
difference here,

00:17:59.938 --> 00:18:03.780
again, d x squared minus y
squared,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.472
the ligands are pointing
directly at the orbitals.

00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:10.184
It is on-axis.
Here, it is 45 degrees

00:18:10.184 --> 00:18:13.047
off-axis, so it is not as
destabilized,

00:18:13.047 --> 00:18:17.342
but still is up above where it
was in the octahedral case.

00:18:17.342 --> 00:18:20.958
And then, finally,
these two guys are going to be

00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:25.178
stabilized compared to this
theoretical spherical crystal

00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:27.890
field.
They are going to be somewhere

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.251
down here.
The big points here then are

00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:37.155
that, compared to the octahedral
case, when you get rid of the

00:18:37.155 --> 00:18:40.050
ligands along z,
this guys shoots up,

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.025
this one comes down,
it is stabilized.

00:18:43.025 --> 00:18:47.688
The other d-orbital that has
maximum components along x and

00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:51.949
y, which is where those ligands
are, goes up a little.

00:18:51.949 --> 00:18:56.130
These three are all sort of
stabilized, these two are

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.427
destabilized,
but this one is destabilized

00:18:59.427 --> 00:19:03.351
quite a bit more.
These also will have,

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:06.183
you can draw sort of splitting
energies here,

00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:08.242
but that is just too
complicated.

00:19:08.242 --> 00:19:11.524
We are only going to do this
with the octahedral and

00:19:11.524 --> 00:19:14.356
tetrahedral case,
because there are many more

00:19:14.356 --> 00:19:16.673
layers here.
And these are little bit

00:19:16.673 --> 00:19:19.311
different.
All you need to know is sort of

00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:22.529
this relative ratio.
This is the most destabilized.

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:25.039
This is next.
These guys are stabilized.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:29.850
That is all you need to know.
We are not going to draw

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.476
splitting energies going up by
one-fifth and things like that

00:19:34.476 --> 00:19:37.714
for this case,
but you will hear about this

00:19:37.714 --> 00:19:42.494
more if you go on in chemistry.
What I expect you to know is to

00:19:42.494 --> 00:19:46.657
be able to rationalize.
If you know something about the

00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:50.049
shape of a molecule,
suppose you had a linear

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:54.290
molecule along the z-axis,
a good test question might be

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.759
which orbitals would be the most
destabilized,

00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:02.000
if you are linear,
along z, for example.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.899
You should be able to think
about the shapes of the

00:20:05.899 --> 00:20:09.876
d-orbitals, think about the
shapes of the molecules,

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:14.477
and predict the orbitals with
the most stabilization and the

00:20:14.477 --> 00:20:19.155
most destabilization and to be
able to explain your rationale

00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:22.197
for predicting these splitting
diagrams.

00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:27.032
Now, we are going to talk about
how these diagrams and thinking

00:20:27.032 --> 00:20:31.087
about the splitting of the
d-orbitals can explain the

00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:36.000
beautiful colors of these
coordination complexes.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.558
Let's go back to the octahedral
case for a minute and talk about

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:49.558
two different octahedral
complexes.

00:20:49.558 --> 00:20:54.058
We have iron plus three
in two different

00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:57.235
complexes.
We have a high spin state,

00:20:57.235 --> 00:21:02.088
with iron and six water
ligands, and a low spin molecule

00:21:02.088 --> 00:21:06.235
coordination compound,
with iron and six cyanide

00:21:06.235 --> 00:21:10.666
ligands.
The first thing you are going

00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:15.908
to do, if you are going to be
talking about the splitting,

00:21:15.908 --> 00:21:21.149
is to figure out how many
electrons you are talking about,

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:24.459
or come up with the d-electron
count.

00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:28.505
Let's do that.
If we have iron with six water

00:21:28.505 --> 00:21:32.000
ligands.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.426
The overall charge on that is
three plus.

00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:41.849
What is going to be our,
and this is on the board,

00:21:41.849 --> 00:21:47.383
too, but what will be the
oxidation number of iron?

00:21:47.383 --> 00:21:50.039
Plus three.
This is zero.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:54.134
And so it all has to equal plus
three.

00:21:54.134 --> 00:22:00.000
Then the d-count is going to be
equal to --

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.777
And I will put up a Periodic
Table.

00:22:03.777 --> 00:22:07.444
The d-count will be equal to
what?

00:22:07.444 --> 00:22:11.888
Five, right.
We look up the group number,

00:22:11.888 --> 00:22:15.888
which is 8, minus 3 is going to
be 5.

00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:20.666
And our other iron complex will
be the same.

00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:24.666
This one has a charge of minus
three.

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:30.000
Cyanide is  what?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.921
Minus one.
Iron would also have to be plus

00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:37.652
three to get the correct overall
charge.

00:22:37.652 --> 00:22:43.295
Our d-count over here as well
is going to be d five.

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:48.556
We have the same number of
electrons that we need to put

00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:52.000
into two different diagrams.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.706
We have one.
This is our high spin case.

00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:10.068
And so we can draw the crystal
field splitting diagram for the

00:23:10.068 --> 00:23:12.000
high spin --

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
-- and put in our orbitals.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.743
d x squared minus y squared,

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:36.457
d z squared.
We have our octahedral crystal

00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:42.278
field splitting energy.
We are going up by three-fifths

00:23:42.278 --> 00:23:48.747
and down by two-fifths for these
compared to this theoretical

00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:53.382
crystal field.
And then we have our low spin

00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:55.000
case.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.196
In our low spin case,
we have a larger splitting

00:24:09.196 --> 00:24:10.000
energy.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.857
Again, some are going to go up
by three-fifths and three will

00:24:26.857 --> 00:24:32.943
go down by two-fifths.
Now, we need to put in our five

00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:36.645
electrons.
How am I going to put them in

00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:39.493
here?
Will I fill up all of the

00:24:39.493 --> 00:24:43.860
different energy levels with one
before I pair,

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.943
or will I start to pair in the
lower, first?

00:24:47.943 --> 00:24:52.120
We are going to put them in
everywhere first.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.911
We will put all five electrons.
We will put one in each of the

00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:02.329
orbitals.
I am going to place them singly

00:25:02.329 --> 00:25:04.733
in.
That is because in this case,

00:25:04.733 --> 00:25:08.715
the splitting energy is small.
And, since it is small,

00:25:08.715 --> 00:25:11.269
it is less than the pairing
energy.

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:15.551
The pairing energy is the
energy required to pair up these

00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:18.406
electrons.
There is a certain amount of

00:25:18.406 --> 00:25:21.487
repulsion.
All of the electrons would love

00:25:21.487 --> 00:25:25.844
to be alone in their orbital.
They would prefer not for you

00:25:25.844 --> 00:25:31.369
to put another electron in.
There is a certain amount of

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:36.276
energy required to do this.
If the energy level between the

00:25:36.276 --> 00:25:40.592
d-orbitals is small,
then you put them all in singly

00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:44.230
and don't pair until you
absolutely have to.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.307
This is referred to as the high
spin case, where you have the

00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:52.353
maximum number of unpaired
electrons.

00:25:52.353 --> 00:25:55.400
In this case,
we have a large energy.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.530
That energy,
then, is greater than the

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:03.779
energy required to pair --
-- The PE or the pairing

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:06.375
energy.
Now we are going to put them

00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:10.083
all into the bottom until we
have to go to the top.

00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:13.495
We will first start out putting
them in singly,

00:26:13.495 --> 00:26:16.980
one, two, three,
and then we will start pairing,

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.095
four, five.
Now we fill up this bottom set.

00:26:20.095 --> 00:26:24.322
I should put in the t two g
and the e g 

00:26:24.322 --> 00:26:27.141
labels.
We will put them in this bottom

00:26:27.141 --> 00:26:31.071
set in t two g until
we have to go up to e g.

00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:34.573
Because this is a big energy

00:26:34.573 --> 00:26:36.820
difference.
And you don't want to do that

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.000
until you have to.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.243
All right.
Now we can look at the

00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:52.702
d-electron count,
so where the electrons are.

00:26:52.702 --> 00:26:56.351
Here it is t two g three.

00:26:56.351 --> 00:27:02.253
There are three in the bottom.
And in e g there are

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.652
two.
And over here,

00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:08.005
in t two g, we have five.
There are none in e.

00:27:08.005 --> 00:27:10.725
Those are our d-electron

00:27:10.725 --> 00:27:13.601
counts.
And then, we can calculate the

00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:17.720
crystal field stabilization
energy, which shouldn't be

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.362
confused with the splitting
energy.

00:27:20.362 --> 00:27:24.248
This considers how much
stabilization you have as a

00:27:24.248 --> 00:27:30.000
result of the fact that the
d-orbitals are split in energy.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.532
In this case,
you want to count up how many

00:27:34.532 --> 00:27:40.683
are in the lower energy levels.
There are three down here.

00:27:40.683 --> 00:27:46.726
Three times minus two-fifths
the octahedral crystal field

00:27:46.726 --> 00:27:51.043
splitting energy.
And you have two above,

00:27:51.043 --> 00:27:55.251
so two are up in energy by
three-fifths.

00:27:55.251 --> 00:28:00.000
And so what does that equal?
Zero.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.988
And over here then you have
five that are down in energy.

00:28:04.988 --> 00:28:09.086
You would have minus
ten-fifths, the octahedral

00:28:09.086 --> 00:28:14.520
crystal field splitting energy.
And sometimes in some books it

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.528
also includes,
there is some energy associated

00:28:18.528 --> 00:28:22.181
with pairing,
so occasionally you will see

00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:27.525
this written as two PE,
indicating that there are two

00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:31.000
sets with paired electrons.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.326
There is some energy associated
with that.

00:28:38.326 --> 00:28:41.163
It is not as fantastic a
situation as it look like.

00:28:41.163 --> 00:28:44.000
That there is lots of
stabilization where the other

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.609
has a zero stabilization,
zero destabilization,

00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:49.446
it is just about the same,
but there is some energy

00:28:49.446 --> 00:28:52.340
associated with this so
sometimes you will see that.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.347
And you only need to indicate
that if it is asked for.

00:28:55.347 --> 00:28:58.751
And I think your book doesn't
ask for it, but just so you are

00:28:58.751 --> 00:29:00.892
aware.
All right.

00:29:00.892 --> 00:29:05.625
That is kind of a review.
We talked about these things

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:10.982
last Monday, but I just wanted
to go through it again because

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:15.089
now you need to see how this
relates to colors.

00:29:15.089 --> 00:29:20.267
We have to introduce this idea
that the relative ability of

00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:25.714
certain common ligands to split
the d-orbital level is what is

00:29:25.714 --> 00:29:30.000
meant by this spectrochemical
series.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.032
Which ligands there are,
in one case,

00:29:33.032 --> 00:29:36.233
water and cyanide,
causes a difference.

00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:40.951
And a strong field ligand,
and we talked about this a bit

00:29:40.951 --> 00:29:44.404
last Monday as well,
produces large energy

00:29:44.404 --> 00:29:47.437
separation.
Over here we have a large

00:29:47.437 --> 00:29:51.565
energy, so this would be a
strong field over here.

00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:55.019
It is strong.
It splits those d-orbitals a

00:29:55.019 --> 00:29:57.293
lot.
And a weak field ligand

00:29:57.293 --> 00:30:02.438
produces a small separation.
It is pretty weak.

00:30:02.438 --> 00:30:06.352
It cannot really split those
d-orbitals very much.

00:30:06.352 --> 00:30:09.308
It is weak.
This would be a weak field

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:12.743
case, over here.
There is not much splitting

00:30:12.743 --> 00:30:16.898
between the d-orbitals.
Here are some various ligands

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:19.614
and how they fall into this
series.

00:30:19.614 --> 00:30:24.168
And you need to know this for
the test, only these sets of

00:30:24.168 --> 00:30:27.203
ligands.
There are three in the sort of

00:30:27.203 --> 00:30:31.882
weak field category.
Three in the intermediate

00:30:31.882 --> 00:30:34.442
category.
Three in the strong field

00:30:34.442 --> 00:30:37.454
category.
When it is a weak field ligand,

00:30:37.454 --> 00:30:41.670
you are going to have the small
splitting, as shown here.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:46.263
Therefore, you will have a high
spin system where you have the

00:30:46.263 --> 00:30:48.974
maximum number of unpaired
electrons.

00:30:48.974 --> 00:30:53.039
If you have a strong field,
you have a large splitting.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:56.654
And then you are going to have
a low spin system,

00:30:56.654 --> 00:31:02.000
where you have the minimum
number of unpaired electrons.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.724
In the example that we just
had, this is high spin,

00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:08.779
so it is actually kind of an
intermediate,

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:12.653
but it was determined to be
high spin experimentally.

00:31:12.653 --> 00:31:16.527
The intermediate ones are a
little harder to predict.

00:31:16.527 --> 00:31:20.401
These will be strong field.
These will be weak field.

00:31:20.401 --> 00:31:24.424
These are harder to predict.
Cyanide, according to this

00:31:24.424 --> 00:31:28.000
list, is the strongest field
ligand.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.673
That makes sense that that was,
then, a low spin system.

00:31:33.673 --> 00:31:39.656
Colors are going to depend on
what photons are absorbed and

00:31:39.656 --> 00:31:45.742
the energy level it takes to get
to that excited high energy

00:31:45.742 --> 00:31:48.836
state.
Here, it is a very small

00:31:48.836 --> 00:31:52.859
difference.
Here it is a big difference.

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:57.914
You would need to absorb
differently and then also

00:31:57.914 --> 00:32:04.000
transmit differently to excite
those electrons.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.325
That is going to give rise to
the different colors.

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:11.317
Let's just take a look at this.
Now, we are reviewing back to

00:32:11.317 --> 00:32:14.643
the first half of the semester,
where you saw this.

00:32:14.643 --> 00:32:18.035
We have the energy of the
absorbed light is equal to

00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:20.496
Planck's constant times the
frequency.

00:32:20.496 --> 00:32:24.487
And so we are back here again.
We are talking about splitting

00:32:24.487 --> 00:32:28.611
energies between the d-orbitals,
the amount of energy to excite

00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:32.337
an electron from one set of
orbitals to the higher set of

00:32:32.337 --> 00:32:35.142
orbitals.
We are back here.

00:32:35.142 --> 00:32:39.307
But now we are going to have a
little bit of difference in that

00:32:39.307 --> 00:32:42.935
we are going to add another
equal sign and say that the

00:32:42.935 --> 00:32:46.764
energy then is going to be,
in this case with a transition

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:49.385
metal complexes,
octahedral coordination

00:32:49.385 --> 00:32:53.012
complexes, it is equal to this
octahedral crystal field

00:32:53.012 --> 00:32:55.834
splitting energy.
Again, we are going to be

00:32:55.834 --> 00:33:00.000
talking about exciting electrons
here up to here.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.375
And so that depends,
then, on what the energy

00:33:03.375 --> 00:33:06.751
difference is between these sets
of orbitals.

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:11.048
We have seen this before,
and now we are just adding this

00:33:11.048 --> 00:33:15.191
new term on the other end,
the octahedral crystal field

00:33:15.191 --> 00:33:17.263
splitting energy.
All right.

00:33:17.263 --> 00:33:20.946
This we also saw in the first
half of the course.

00:33:20.946 --> 00:33:24.475
If you have a high frequency of
light absorbed,

00:33:24.475 --> 00:33:30.000
the wavelength of the absorbed
light is going to be short.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.076
And that is that equation.
I think these two equations

00:33:34.076 --> 00:33:37.384
were equations you needed to
have memorized.

00:33:37.384 --> 00:33:40.076
They were not on the equation
sheet.

00:33:40.076 --> 00:33:44.769
That indicates that they are of
really fundamental importance.

00:33:44.769 --> 00:33:48.307
And then, the color of the
transmitted light is

00:33:48.307 --> 00:33:52.000
complementary to the color of
the absorbed light.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.461
Here we need to think beyond
the first half of the semester

00:33:56.461 --> 00:34:00.000
back to, probably,
kindergarten.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.274
When did you first learn about
complementary colors?

00:34:04.274 --> 00:34:07.543
Second grade?
I actually was talked into

00:34:07.543 --> 00:34:12.572
putting something like this on
the exam, so that you wouldn't

00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:15.589
have to have that material
memorized.

00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:19.109
Anyway, here are your
complementary colors.

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:24.390
If you know something about the
color of the transition complex,

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:29.000
you can go back and calculate
and estimate.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.702
If you are given actual
numbers, you can calculate what

00:34:33.702 --> 00:34:38.752
the splitting energy difference
was, or you can approximate

00:34:38.752 --> 00:34:44.238
whether it is going to be small
or large depending on the colors

00:34:44.238 --> 00:34:48.505
that the complexes have.
Let's take a look at some

00:34:48.505 --> 00:34:52.337
examples, here,
of two different coordination

00:34:52.337 --> 00:34:57.126
complexes, both octahedral.
First, we have to figure out

00:34:57.126 --> 00:35:02.497
the oxidation number.
Again, this goes back to the

00:35:02.497 --> 00:35:05.351
last unit on
oxidation-reduction,

00:35:05.351 --> 00:35:08.205
useful for the exam on
Wednesday.

00:35:08.205 --> 00:35:11.951
The number here,
you are going to have plus

00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:17.213
three for both of these guys.
This is zero and that is zero.

00:35:17.213 --> 00:35:22.029
The overall charge is plus
three, so chromium has to be

00:35:22.029 --> 00:35:27.024
plus three in both cases.
Then, when we do the d-electron

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:33.000
count, we have to find chromium
on our Periodic Table.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.333
Look up what group it is in to
calculate the d-count.

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.250
We have that here.
And we have a d three

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.583
case.
What does CN stand for?

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:47.833
Coordination number.
And so what is the coordination

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:50.416
number in this case?
Six, right.

00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:54.500
There are six things here,
six things coordinated.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.750
And that is not to be confused
with a steric number,

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:03.000
which we talked about last
Wednesday.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.649
The type of ligand here,
water, was what?

00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:10.845
What type of ligand,
in terms of weak to strong

00:36:10.845 --> 00:36:13.217
field?
It was intermediate.

00:36:13.217 --> 00:36:15.863
And over here?
It is stronger.

00:36:15.863 --> 00:36:21.154
These guys are actually not
that far apart from each other.

00:36:21.154 --> 00:36:26.628
Water was sort of intermediate.
It is at least weaker than NH

00:36:26.628 --> 00:36:31.316
three.
NH three was in the

00:36:31.316 --> 00:36:35.348
strong category,
so it is at least stronger than

00:36:35.348 --> 00:36:38.179
water.
They are not that far apart

00:36:38.179 --> 00:36:41.611
from each other,
but this one should be a

00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:44.613
stronger field ligand than this
one.

00:36:44.613 --> 00:36:49.418
If we consider a weaker field
system and a stronger field

00:36:49.418 --> 00:36:54.565
system, is this going to make
any difference to how we put in

00:36:54.565 --> 00:36:57.396
electrons this time?
No, it won't,

00:36:57.396 --> 00:37:03.076
because we only have three.
We would put them in the bottom

00:37:03.076 --> 00:37:05.689
regardless.
The issue is when you get to

00:37:05.689 --> 00:37:08.771
the fourth one.
When you have a fourth electron

00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:12.657
you have to decide if you are
going to put it up here or if

00:37:12.657 --> 00:37:15.806
you are going to pair,
but there are only three,

00:37:15.806 --> 00:37:19.759
so the diagrams look the same.
Even though the diagrams look

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:23.243
the same, these compounds are
going to have different

00:37:23.243 --> 00:37:28.000
properties because they have
different splitting energies.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.494
And so the amount of energy
required to bump an electron up

00:37:32.494 --> 00:37:35.750
here is going to be different
than up here.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.547
And so you will have different
colors as a result.

00:37:39.547 --> 00:37:43.732
Let's take a look at that.
Again, this is intermediate,

00:37:43.732 --> 00:37:46.522
so this is smaller.
This is stronger,

00:37:46.522 --> 00:37:49.389
it is large,
it doesn't affect how the

00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:53.032
electrons go in,
but it does affect the property

00:37:53.032 --> 00:37:56.519
of the compound.
Let's go through this and see

00:37:56.519 --> 00:38:00.051
what this means.
Water, then,

00:38:00.051 --> 00:38:03.468
is weaker.
It means the splitting energy

00:38:03.468 --> 00:38:06.709
is smaller.
If the splitting energy is

00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:10.477
smaller, that means you have a
lower energy,

00:38:10.477 --> 00:38:15.734
a smaller energy between them
and a lower frequency that will

00:38:15.734 --> 00:38:17.924
be absorbed.
In this case,

00:38:17.924 --> 00:38:22.743
this is a strong field ligand,
so you will have a larger

00:38:22.743 --> 00:38:28.000
energy and a higher frequency
that is absorbed.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.894
Over here, if we have the lower
frequency absorbed,

00:38:31.894 --> 00:38:34.698
we have a longer wavelength
absorbed.

00:38:34.698 --> 00:38:39.060
For the stronger field case,
we have somewhat of a higher

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.798
frequency absorbed,
so we will have somewhat of a

00:38:42.798 --> 00:38:47.005
shorter wavelength absorbed.
And then, the color of the

00:38:47.005 --> 00:38:50.821
transmitted light is
complimentary to the color of

00:38:50.821 --> 00:38:54.482
the absorbed light.
Here you are going to have a

00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:59.000
transmitted light with a shorter
wavelength.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.776
You had a longer wavelength
absorbed, so you will have a

00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:08.292
shorter wavelength transmitted.
And this compound is,

00:39:08.292 --> 00:39:12.373
in fact, violet.
Over here you are going to have

00:39:12.373 --> 00:39:17.671
the shorter wavelength absorbed,
so the transmitted light will

00:39:17.671 --> 00:39:22.968
be complimentary to that and we
will have a longer wavelength.

00:39:22.968 --> 00:39:26.181
And this compound is,
in fact, yellow.

00:39:26.181 --> 00:39:32.000
If we look again at the colors
and their wavelengths --

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.941
This complex with the strong
field ligand is yellow and the

00:39:35.941 --> 00:39:39.135
one with an intermediate field
ligand is violet,

00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:42.737
somewhere down in here.
Even though water and NH three

00:39:42.737 --> 00:39:46.543
are close to each other,
the one that is stronger

00:39:46.543 --> 00:39:50.825
definitely has quite a distinct
color from the one that is a bit

00:39:50.825 --> 00:39:53.000
weaker.
And, unless you are given

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.194
numbers, you cannot predict
exactly which color.

00:39:56.194 --> 00:40:00.000
You can just rationalize the
relationship.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.644
If you were told this is yellow
and this is violet,

00:40:03.644 --> 00:40:05.539
tell me why,
you would say,

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:08.820
this is a stronger field ligand
than this one.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.444
That is the kind of thing you
can do.

00:40:11.444 --> 00:40:15.453
But if you are given numbers,
and on problems and on the

00:40:15.453 --> 00:40:19.753
final you may be given numbers,
you can actually come up and

00:40:19.753 --> 00:40:23.835
calculate back and forth from
the splitting energy to the

00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:27.261
color that you predict,
from a color back to the

00:40:27.261 --> 00:40:32.000
splitting energy.
What things would be colorless?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.793
Which kind of coordination
complexes would be colorless,

00:40:35.793 --> 00:40:38.000
and why would it be colorless?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.342
This is where things written in
your handout can be read back to

00:40:50.342 --> 00:40:53.362
me.
[LAUGHTER] Unless you know,

00:40:53.362 --> 00:40:57.892
but it is good to think about
it a little bit.

00:40:57.892 --> 00:41:00.621
Okay.
If you filled up all your

00:41:00.621 --> 00:41:04.319
d-orbitals and there is no room
for things to move around,

00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:07.628
when it is not possible to have
a d-to-d transition,

00:41:07.628 --> 00:41:11.261
you filled up everything,
so you are not going to be able

00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:15.024
to do this transition from one
set of d-orbitals to another

00:41:15.024 --> 00:41:18.527
one, then you have colorless.
Here are some examples of

00:41:18.527 --> 00:41:22.420
things that will be colorless,
and let's just prove that that

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.302
would be true,
that those are,

00:41:24.302 --> 00:41:28.000
in fact, filled.
We have zinc and cadmium.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.638
If we look, zinc and cadmium
are in Group 12.

00:41:31.638 --> 00:41:35.276
They both have oxidation
numbers of plus two,

00:41:35.276 --> 00:41:38.997
so 12 minus 2 is 10.
You have a d ten

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.056
system.
This one is also going to be a

00:41:42.056 --> 00:41:46.273
d ten system.
You are going to have all ten

00:41:46.273 --> 00:41:50.242
electrons already in,
and so you are not going to

00:41:50.242 --> 00:41:53.219
have these transitions.
And so these,

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:57.271
in fact, are colorless.
Zinc is a really important

00:41:57.271 --> 00:42:02.265
metal in biology.
And it plays structural roles.

00:42:02.265 --> 00:42:06.569
It can play catalytic roles.
It is a very important metal.

00:42:06.569 --> 00:42:10.874
And often, when biochemists are
trying to figure out how a

00:42:10.874 --> 00:42:14.272
protein works,
they won't realize it is a zinc

00:42:14.272 --> 00:42:17.897
containing enzyme,
because the protein won't have

00:42:17.897 --> 00:42:19.558
any color.
In contrast,

00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:23.560
there are proteins and
cofactors in metals that have a

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.977
lot of color.
And then, actually,

00:42:25.977 --> 00:42:30.205
as you are purifying the
enzyme, it will have this bright

00:42:30.205 --> 00:42:34.923
orange or red color.
And you realize it has some

00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:38.556
metal cofactor in it,
right from the very beginning.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:42.473
Just to go through then and
sort of summarize this whole

00:42:42.473 --> 00:42:46.819
procedure, if you are on this
end with the ligands in the weak

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:49.810
field ligands,
then you are going to have a

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:53.087
small splitting.
Weak things cannot split much.

00:42:53.087 --> 00:42:56.863
They do not have enough
strength to really split those

00:42:56.863 --> 00:43:00.982
d-orbitals apart.
You will have a high spin

00:43:00.982 --> 00:43:04.787
system in this case,
a maximum number of unpaired

00:43:04.787 --> 00:43:07.641
electrons.
In terms of the complexes,

00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:10.813
then they will absorb low
energy photons,

00:43:10.813 --> 00:43:13.191
low frequency,
long wavelength,

00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:17.156
and then they will transmit
high frequency or short

00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:20.248
wavelength.
They are going to be in this

00:43:20.248 --> 00:43:23.102
violet blue-green end of the
spectra.

00:43:23.102 --> 00:43:25.560
And let me just put this one
up.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.000
Actually, I will put all these
guys up.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.594
They will be on this end of the
spectra.

00:43:32.594 --> 00:43:35.587
Again, it is all based on these
two equations.

00:43:35.587 --> 00:43:38.447
If you have a small splitting,
small energy,

00:43:38.447 --> 00:43:40.908
you are going to have a low
frequency.

00:43:40.908 --> 00:43:44.433
And then you will have a long
wavelength for absorbed.

00:43:44.433 --> 00:43:47.160
And the complimentary for the
transmitted.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.951
If you are a strong field,
you will have a large splitting

00:43:50.951 --> 00:43:52.747
energy.
It will be low spin,

00:43:52.747 --> 00:43:56.472
minimum number of unpaired
electrons, and you will have a

00:43:56.472 --> 00:44:00.530
situation like this.
Here you fill them up to

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.954
maximum extent.
Here they are low spin,

00:44:02.954 --> 00:44:05.506
maximum paired,
so then you will have the

00:44:05.506 --> 00:44:07.993
complimentary.
You have short wavelength

00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:10.417
absorbed.
You will have long wavelength

00:44:10.417 --> 00:44:13.096
transmitted.
And you will be on this end of

00:44:13.096 --> 00:44:15.648
the spectrum,
so you would expect yellow,

00:44:15.648 --> 00:44:17.370
orange or red,
in this case.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.942
You can make predictions.
If you know something about the

00:44:20.942 --> 00:44:24.259
ligand, you can predict the
color of the coordination

00:44:24.259 --> 00:44:28.150
complex, or at least rationalize
the color of the coordination

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.000
complex.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.664
Just to show you sort of a real
example, these are all

00:44:38.664 --> 00:44:40.876
octahedral complexes with
cobalt.

00:44:40.876 --> 00:44:45.024
And you can see the colors are
really dramatically different.

00:44:45.024 --> 00:44:49.241
Depending on the ligand to the
cobalt, you can really get this

00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:51.730
beautiful range of colors
associated.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.671
And one of the courses that is
offered during IAP that Dr.

00:44:55.671 --> 00:44:58.782
Shrank teaches,
you go through and actually do

00:44:58.782 --> 00:45:03.000
some of these experiments and
see these colors.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.223
And so it is a little lab
component that compliments

00:45:07.223 --> 00:45:12.358
nicely this part of the course,
as well as a few other parts of

00:45:12.358 --> 00:45:15.588
the course.
Those are these coordination

00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:18.322
complexes.
And cobalt is also in a

00:45:18.322 --> 00:45:20.972
vitamin.
Can someone tell me what

00:45:20.972 --> 00:45:23.788
vitamin cobalt is in the center
of?

00:45:23.788 --> 00:45:26.852
What is my favorite vitamin?
B12, yes.

00:45:26.852 --> 00:45:31.609
These are colors of B12.
This is protein bound to

00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:35.231
different forms of B12,
so there are actually different

00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:38.048
ligands to the cobalt in these
three cases.

00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:40.128
And these are the actual
colors.

00:45:40.128 --> 00:45:43.146
It is really spectacular,
the colors of these.

00:45:43.146 --> 00:45:45.695
And these are crystals of the
proteins.

00:45:45.695 --> 00:45:47.774
The colors are really very
rich.

00:45:47.774 --> 00:45:50.859
When you are doing experiments
on a B12 system,

00:45:50.859 --> 00:45:53.542
you know something about the
form of B12.

00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:57.231
If you have done some damage to
your B12, you know it by

00:45:57.231 --> 00:46:01.256
actually looking at the color of
the molecule you are working

00:46:01.256 --> 00:46:06.425
with.
Or the crystals or the protein

00:46:06.425 --> 00:46:10.535
you are working with.
Very fast then,

00:46:10.535 --> 00:46:14.874
magnetism.
Compounds that have unpaired

00:46:14.874 --> 00:46:21.381
electrons are paramagnetic,
attracted by a magnetic field,

00:46:21.381 --> 00:46:26.633
and ones where they are paired
are diamagnetic.

00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:32.000
They are repelled by a magnetic
field.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.513
You can figure out something
about the geometries often of

00:46:36.513 --> 00:46:40.709
your compounds by figuring out
whether the compound is

00:46:40.709 --> 00:46:45.143
paramagnetic or diamagnetic.
Well, how would you do this?

00:46:45.143 --> 00:46:48.865
Well, if, for example,
you had a nickel two plus

00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:53.695
system in an enzyme,
so you have a d eight

00:46:53.695 --> 00:46:57.099
center in your enzyme,
and it is found to be

00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:01.045
diamagnetic.
You could ask the question,

00:47:01.045 --> 00:47:04.000
can I guess,
then, whether it has square

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.803
planar geometry,
tetrahedral geometry,

00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:10.818
or octahedral geometry?
Because it is diamagnetic--can

00:47:10.818 --> 00:47:14.075
I figure out the geometry
knowing that fact,

00:47:14.075 --> 00:47:17.257
knowing about unpaired or
paired electrons?

00:47:17.257 --> 00:47:19.909
In this case,
we would have to have,

00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:23.318
it's diamagnetic.
All the electrons have to be

00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:26.196
paired.
Here are our splitting diagrams

00:47:26.196 --> 00:47:30.833
for all three cases.
Let's look at octahedral.

00:47:30.833 --> 00:47:33.767
Again, we have to put eight
electrons in.

00:47:33.767 --> 00:47:37.875
Here are eight electrons.
Does it matter if this was weak

00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:40.369
field or strong field in this
case?

00:47:40.369 --> 00:47:42.202
Which is it?
Can you tell?

00:47:42.202 --> 00:47:44.843
Same, right,
because you would put in

00:47:44.843 --> 00:47:47.630
electrons.
Whether you put them in one,

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.124
two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:47:50.124 --> 00:47:53.278
eight, or put them in one,
two, three, four,

00:47:53.278 --> 00:47:56.066
five, six, seven eight,
it is the same.

00:47:56.066 --> 00:48:00.543
This could be either.
Notice we have unpaired

00:48:00.543 --> 00:48:04.837
electrons, so this cannot be the
geometry of this unknown center.

00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:08.461
What about square planar?
Let's put them in starting at

00:48:08.461 --> 00:48:10.809
the bottom.
We will put them all in.

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:13.158
Keep going and just put them
all in.

00:48:13.158 --> 00:48:16.043
There are eight.
It didn't really matter too

00:48:16.043 --> 00:48:18.593
much the order I put them in
down here.

00:48:18.593 --> 00:48:22.216
The important point is,
I really didn't want to put any

00:48:22.216 --> 00:48:24.900
in here until I had to,
because this one,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.919
if you recall,
is really destabilized compared

00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:30.790
to the rest.
All right.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:35.061
These are all paired up.
And let's look at tetrahedral.

00:48:35.061 --> 00:48:38.303
Tetrahedral tends to be what
kind of spin?

00:48:38.303 --> 00:48:42.099
High spin, because the
splitting energy is small,

00:48:42.099 --> 00:48:46.369
because you don't have ligands
pointing directly at the

00:48:46.369 --> 00:48:48.742
d-orbitals.
We can put them in,

00:48:48.742 --> 00:48:51.984
in a high spin fashion,
until we are done.

00:48:51.984 --> 00:48:56.176
And that is our system.
This is small splitting energy

00:48:56.176 --> 00:49:01.000
down here, so we have unpaired
electrons here.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.780
This is paramagnetic,
this is paramagnetic,

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.422
and this is diamagnetic.
Then you could predict that the

00:49:07.422 --> 00:49:10.269
nickel and the enzyme must be
square planar.

00:49:10.269 --> 00:49:13.910
It cannot be this and it cannot
be that, so it tells you

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:17.817
something about the geometry.
And I will tell you that there

00:49:17.817 --> 00:49:21.856
are two square planar systems,
at least, in enzymes of nickel.

00:49:21.856 --> 00:49:25.762
And people predicted it using
similar kinds of techniques to

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:30.000
what you just learned about in
freshman chemistry.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.944
Okay.
Good luck on the exam on

00:49:31.944 --> 00:49:32.944
Wednesday.
