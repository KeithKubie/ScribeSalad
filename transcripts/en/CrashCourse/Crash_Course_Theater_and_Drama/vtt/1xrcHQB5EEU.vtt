Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.200
This is Crash Course Theater, and remember how we said it was gonna take a bunch of buzzkill Puritans to end this huge

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.179
flowering of art and culture and awesomeness? Well, here they are. Today

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.819
we're gonna be talking about objections to theatre in Renaissance England and how the theaters eventually closed. But good news,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.289
they reopen two decades later with smutty comedy and expurgated Shakespeare and also women on stage

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.608
sometimes wearing pants. What a time to have been alive.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.169
As you remember from our episodes on classical theater, Puritans didn't invent hating on theater, a phenomenon we call anti-

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
theatricalism. Boo, hiss.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.919
The father of anti-theatricalism, as far as recorded history goes, is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.220
Plato.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.720
Yeah,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.429
that Plato in "The Republic," Plato says that he wouldn't have any poets in his ideal Kingdom because poetry is a false

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.860
representation of reality. It just

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.179
distracts people from philosophy. Please also note though, that Plato wrote his own philosophy in

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.180
dialogue form, so...

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.979
Anyway, while the Greeks the Romans and the early Christians all had problems with theater and those who performed it to some degree

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.960
there ain't no anti-theatricalist like a Puritan anti-theatricalist. Think of the thing that you hate the most in the world and then

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.169
multiply that hate by a lot more loathing and

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.749
suspicion and also fear of the plague

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.649
You probably still don't hate the theater like the Puritans did. Let's see some examples

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.619
This first is from Elizabeth's reign. A letter sent by the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London in

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:55.199
1597, which called for all plays to be cancelled. Plays, he wrote, "are a special cause of corrupting the youth,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.459
containing nothing

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.359
but unchaste matters, lascivious devices, shifts of cozenage and other lewd and ungodly practices."

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.069
He also went on to say that they make people lazy and criminal and give them black death,

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.039
which, I mean, I've worked with some flat footed lighting technicians

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.249
but no one with the pestilence. Other Puritans came along and started writing some long and unhinged pamphlets.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.390
They said that plays taught people how to sin, that they made men effeminate-

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.509
remember all of those boy actors dressed as spunky heroines in pants? Yeah, the Puritans did not love that- and surprise, surprise,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.520
that plays went against God. And, here's something for the irony fans;

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.810
remember how theater was used to jazz up church services not so long before this?

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.619
Well, some Protestant English critics objected to Renaissance theater because it emerged from liturgical drama

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620
and that made it too

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.170
Popish. Not religious enough, or too religious.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.700
It's almost like the nature of theater isn't the problem here. The greatest example of an anti-theatrical text is probably William Prynne's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.250
Histriomastix,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620
a thousand pages of invective

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.990
against the theater published in 1632. How bananas is this book?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.200
Well, here is an abridged version

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.170
of the title:

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.189
"Histriomastix: the players scourge, or actor's tragedy divided into two parts, wherein it is largely

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.089
evidenced, by diverse arguments that popular stage plays are sinful heathenish lewd ungodly spectacles and most pernicious

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.889
corruptions and that the profession of play poets of stage players together with the pending acting and frequenting of stage plays are unlawful infamous and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.249
misbeseeming Christians." Abridged, people.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.570
This is the abridged title. Yeesh. Somewhere in those thousand pages Prynne mentioned that women actors are

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.720
notorious whores and maybe you're thinking:

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.579
what women actors? Prynne claimed he was talking about a troupe of French actresses who had visited London in

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.239
1629 and had been booed and pippin-pelted off the stage. That means that they got apples tossed at them.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.029
But hey also, remember how court masks featured noble women including the queen, Henrietta Maria?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.029
The nobles remembered, and when the court read Prynne's book he was put on trial for

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.619
seditious libel, because you kinda can't imply that the queen is a whore and not maybe get your own thousand page book thrown at you.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.489
But okay, Prynne's work wasn't the final dramatic nail in the theaters coffin;

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.450
what did it? Well, it starts with Charles I. King of England,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.340
Scotland, and Ireland and hubby to Henrietta Maria. Charles I had worse problems than men seditiously libeling his wife.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.239
His main problem was money. Wars did not come cheap and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.300
he fought lots of them and I'm sure all of those Inigo Jones sets and nymph costumes didn't help things either.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.400
He and Parliament, which was largely puritanical, used to fight all the time about his military spending. So, he kept

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.809
dissolving Parliament. In 1629,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.790
he disbanded it all together and decided to go it alone, levying some unpopular taxes to keep everything afloat.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.709
And that went okay, until 1640, when he needed money to fight against the Scots.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.470
He reconvened Parliament and then dissolved it again, and then reconvened it again and the House of Commons

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.300
basically passed a bill telling the King that he was a royal pain in the neck. Then Ireland

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.180
rebelled- here is where we get back to theatre. Civil War now fully underway, the puritanical

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.989
Parliament used the conflict as an excuse to ban theater, mostly on religious grounds. In 1642,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.260
they passed an edict which read, "Public sports do not well agree with public calamities, nor

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.080
public stage plays with the seasons of

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.830
humiliation, this being an exercise of sad and pious

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.119
solemnity, and the other being spectacles of pleasure too commonly expressing lascivious mirth and levity.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.090
It is therefore thought fit and ordained by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.520
that while these sad causes and set times of humiliation do continue

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.469
public stage plays shall cease and be forborn." Basically,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.600
how can you theatre at a time like this?

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:20.349
In 1647 parliament published another edict threatening punishment for anyone who put on a play. The next year they passed a law saying

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:28.330
actors should be apprehended as criminals and theatres should be demolished. An actor caught acting once was whipped, twice,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.709
treated as an incorrigible rogue, which actually sounds fine, but

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.170
probably it was awful. Anyone found attending a play would be fined five shillings

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.659
which was a mint then, and in 1649, a few months after they beheaded Charles I, the Puritan

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.609
Parliamentarians appointed a provost marshal who was tasked with imprisoning all ballad singers and shutting down stage plays. No

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.750
fun allowed.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800
So, did the theatre disappear entirely?

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.470
Sort of. Public performances were semi-secretly held until the king was beheaded

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.480
but they really dried up after that. Late in the 1650's, the playwright William Davenant

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.150
basically invented English language opera because musical performances hadn't been

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:17.819
specifically forbidden. He was like, look, everybody's singing all the time!

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.500
This definitely isn't a play. No, no, not at all.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:28.169
Otherwise, performances were small and clandestine, held in private homes, tennis courts, and inns, and this would be the case for

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.559
about 12 years. In 1658, Oliver Cromwell

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:39.059
the leader of the Commonwealth, died. His son lost the confidence of the military, the Royalists started rising up again, and in

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:41.729
1660, Charles II was restored to the throne.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:47.518
Almost immediately, he started licensing theater companies and helping theaters reopen. In London,

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:53.669
there were two main companies. One, led by William Davenant, the opera guy, and the other led by Thomas Killigrew.

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:58.438
Descendants of these companies basically had a lock on spoken drama in London until

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:05.579
1843. At first, the restoration theater relied on old plays. Tragic comedies were popular, especially those by Beaumont and Fletcher.

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:13.678
Shakespeare was almost immediately revived, but with a difference. Remember those tragedies where everyone died and it was very moving?

00:08:14.109 --> 00:08:16.109
Yorick does. He knows them well.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:18.569
Restoration audiences were not

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:21.388
into it. After that whole civil war thing

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:24.988
people wanted happy endings, not a stage full of corpses.

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:31.048
So, playwrights rewrote Shakespeare. Suddenly, Juliet gets to wake up before Romeo kills himself.

00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:32.829
And Lear survives.

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:35.249
Also Edgar and Cordelia get married and

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:43.438
Miranda gets a sister. Companies also started using all those fancy scenic design elements that Inigo Jones had introduced, but the biggest difference was women.

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:48.839
Women on stage, Charles II approved it. Why? It's unclear. Though,

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:54.688
actresses were common in France, where he had been hiding out. Women not only took on female roles,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.139
they also took on male roles or breeches parts.

00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:00.179
Maybe they did it for the actorly challenge,

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:07.739
or maybe they did it because theater managers realized that male audience members went crazy when women wore pants and showed their ankles.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.769
Ooh, la la. And women not only appeared on stage,

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:15.508
there were also several important female restoration playwrights, including Aphra Behn and

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:22.019
Susanna Centlivre. The restoration also brought some new styles of playwriting to England. Most were heroic tragedies and

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.290
swashbuckling romances borrowed from Spain and France,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:31.469
but it did birth one homegrown genre: the restoration comedy. Restoration comedies are

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:38.490
smutty, even by today's standards. They're witty, sexy, outrageous plays about upper-class people looking for love.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.920
Lots of that love is

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.689
adulterous. Like most comedies, they rely on familiar types and while they don't have that

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.450
Shakespearean depth of characterization,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.670
they are funny. A bunch of those hoots and hollers derived from voicing a cynical distrust of

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.309
conventional morality, because after that whole beheading the king and living under Puritan rule,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.689
conventional morality just doesn't look so great. In fact, it looks downright oppressive.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:10.350
Marriage isn't the happy ending here. No social contract is treated as objectively rad.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.939
These plays are skeptical of airy concepts like love honor and fidelity;

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.309
they're much more about lust, and envy, and covetousness as motivating forces.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:26.040
For example, William Wycherley's 1675 play "The Country Wife" is sort of based on Molière,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.739
but luder. Take us to the country, Thought Bubble.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.449
Harry Horner, check out that name, decides that the best way to sleep with all the women in town is to spread the rumor that

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.900
he's impotent, so that husbands will leave their wives alone with him.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:43.559
It works! That Horner. Meanwhile, Pinchwife has just gotten married to Margery, and is so worried about

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:50.699
adultery that he won't let her out of the house, won't let her have any friends, and keeps her in the country. Get it?

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.660
She's the country wife. Finally, he agrees to take her for a walk in town,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.779
but only after disguising her as a boy.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.130
Horner meets the disguised Margery, clocks that she's a woman, and runs off with her. When she and Pinchwife are reunited,

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:12.359
he tells her that she can never see Horner again, and makes her write a letter saying how disgusting she finds him.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:19.170
But, instead of a weird chaste affidavit, she writes a love letter. Horner likes her too, but still finds time to

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:25.230
horn Lady Fidget in a scene that uses a lot of ceramics metaphors. It's hilarious.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:32.640
He also sleeps with all of her friends, and maybe you'd expect to playwright to try to protect Margery from sex-addict Horner,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.589
but Wycherley would rather see his characters happily bonking than unhappily chaste.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.810
Margery dresses up as Pinchwife's sister and goes to Horner's room. Pinchwife finds them,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:49.619
but owing to some fast-talking, Horner and Margery get off scot-free and Pinchwife seems to believe the tales of Horner's impotence,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:56.039
leaving him to carouse another day. So it all ends smutilly ever after. Take that, Puritans.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.680
Thanks thought-bubble. That was

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.729
permissive. So, we can see that this is a lot

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.559
rowdier than the Shakespeare style of comedy and even a bit wittier in the text, too.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.429
Restoration comedy encouraged anti theatricalists, too- Jeremy Collier's

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.609
1698 pamphlet "A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage" is

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.870
300 pages.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:27.810
Short by Prynne's standards. Collier writes, "Nothing has gone farther in debauching the age than the stage poets, and

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:33.960
play-house," and his ideas were so influential that he encouraged some playwrights to reform.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.210
He also caught the attention of James II, who decreed that plays should maybe be less money.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.260
Boring.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:48.330
Now, but okay, we're gonna get less money, too- as we head to Spain and France to explore Golden Age drama on the continent.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.110
But until then,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.700
