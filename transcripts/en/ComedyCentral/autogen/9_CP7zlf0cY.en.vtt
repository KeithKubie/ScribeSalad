the<00:12:05.230><c> second</c><00:12:05.589><c> time</c><00:12:05.710><c> something</c><00:12:05.980><c> like</c><00:12:06.100><c> this</c><00:12:06.190><c> is</c>

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:06.339 align:start position:0%
the second time something like this is
 

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:11.420 align:start position:0%
the second time something like this is
happening<00:12:08.820><c> it's</c><00:12:09.820><c> yeah</c><00:12:10.660><c> that's</c><00:12:10.990><c> a</c><00:12:11.110><c> painful</c>

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
happening it's yeah that's a painful
 

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
happening it's yeah that's a painful

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:14.589 align:start position:0%

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:15.450 align:start position:0%
moment but do you think that if you
would<00:12:14.830><c> have</c><00:12:14.860><c> come</c><00:12:15.100><c> to</c><00:12:15.130><c> all</c><00:12:15.339><c> these</c>
