Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast remixed.

Speaker 2:          00:06          So here's the thing, we make this show and we worry about each and every word ever. Each sound, every breath, the really what we're hoping for

Speaker 1:          00:15          is it the stuff ends up in your head and just become some set of thoughts that we could have never imagined. So with that in mind, a couple months ago we teamed up with the site called Indaba music. Yup. To host a radio lab remix contest. But we did was, we put out a bunch of our stories but as multi-track versions so that the voice, the interviews, the music, everything is separated out on its own track.

Speaker 2:          00:40          People could take what we've done and do anything they want with us,

Speaker 1:          00:45          anything. And they did. And our job was to pick a bunch of winners.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Here we are with the results of the first ever, not necessarily annual Radiolab

Speaker 3:          00:56          remix contests. Yes. Five months straight. You flipped through magazines while sitting on

Speaker 1:          01:03          136 submissions, every style that you can imagine. And we're going to play a couple for you right now. Some of the winners right? So let's just jump in with the grand prize winner. So one of the pieces that we offered a as remixed material was this one in the afterlife, you relive all your experiences, but this time with the events we shuffled into a new order is from our afterlife show. And it was a story called sum, which was written by David Eagleman read for us by actor Jeffrey Tambor. And the idea of the story was to imagine a version of the afterlife where all the moments of your life would be clumped together by category for five months straight. You flip through magazines while sitting on a toilet. You take all your painted ones, all 27 intense hours of it. Boom. The story itself isn't, it's okay. It's kind of a, it's a a remix in a way. Yeah, it's a really funny story and point it at times and a lot of people chose to remix this story, including our grand prize winner. My Name is David Minnick. That's him. Is that all you want? We'll hear more from David Mannequin. Just a second. First, let's hear his remix. This is some written by David Eagleman. Read by Jeffrey Tambor, originally produced by Radiolab and remixed by David Minnick. Alright, try it.

Speaker 4:          02:18          Take two

Speaker 3:          02:21          in the afterlife. Here we live. All your experiences with the events. Lori shuffled into a new border. You see all the moments that share a quality. Our group together. For instance, board staring out the bus window, sitting in an airport. Two years of boredom, staring out the bus window, sitting in an airport, two years porch, staring out the bus window, sitting in this airport, two years porch, staring out the bus window. Sitting in this two years. [inaudible] two years or every other Sydney airport, two years, every other bus. Monroe City Airport. Two years [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          03:13          18 months waiting in line. 18 months waiting. 18 months, 18 months, waiting in line waiting. [inaudible] wait, wait, wait. Do you mind? Thank you. He loves waiting in line. Waiting in line, waiting in line, waiting and waiting and waiting. 15 months

Speaker 3:          03:45          looking for lost items, looking for lost items, looking for lost items, looking for lost and private. 15 months looking for lost items, looking for lost items, looking for lost items. Looking for lost by the 15 months. Eight items, lost items, looking for items, looking for lost items. Seven months, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having Sarah, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex, having sex.

Speaker 1:          04:30          And yet it's because you can't take a shower until it's time to take it.

Speaker 3:          04:33          The marathon, shower, hundred day shower, shower, Gel, shower, shower, shower.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Okay. I would like to do a whole show like that. I've never been to it myself. If we did a wholesale like that. Really? Oh, cause you know why it's two Broadway for you. I'm realizing this. For me, this was like, it was the best. It was like, it was um, it was Broadway in a way that made me hurt. But it was also like, it was also just a feat of composing. If I could wake up in the morning and say, I think I'm going to go to the bathroom now. I think I'm going to go to the bathroom now. Oh, I'd kill myself. That if you feel wonderful for me. Hello. Hey, hey. Is this David? Yes it is. How are you? Hi David. This is Jad. Hi Jen. We you like your thing a lot. That was really something. Thank you so much Ella. Truthfully, we kind of disagreed. Robert loved it. I was amazed at what you've done, but it was a little too Broadway from me. That's not my fault. You got to talk to Jeffrey tambor about that. Oh No, I'm not, I'm not, I don't like showtunes either. But uh, his voice was already musical. David explained to us that each line of tambourines reed would guide him to a new melody and a new style cause he's, he's an actor, he's a really good actor and so his voice actually follows a pitch pad five months

Speaker 6:          05:58          straight. You flip through magazines while sitting on a toilet with different magazines about sitting on a toilet for five months. Right. You flip through magazine glass.

Speaker 7:          06:05          A lot of them actually suggested the type of music, like driving the street in front of your house, driving the street in front of your house was already in rhythm. Driving the stream in front of that one. I could actually hear the first time driving the street in front of your house. If you listen to the melody enough times and then you start putting chords to it, it inevitably suggest some sort of style of music.

Speaker 6:          06:27          Last five weeks driving cost, five weeks driving, last five weeks go by because lost lost

Speaker 3:          06:35          two weeks. Wondering what's happened when you die in two weeks. Wondering what's happened. Two weeks wondering what's happening. Really die six days clipping your nails, six days clipping your nails, six days clapping your nails.

Speaker 7:          06:44          I just wanted the, the whole idea of the, of the story to be manifested in, in music. So you've actually feel the long lengths of time when it's two years of doing this, a little less when it's 18 months, staring into the refrigerator, 15 hours writing your signature, et Cetera, and to get shorter and shorter, seven hours

Speaker 3:          07:04          vomiting.

Speaker 7:          07:08          And then when he describes, um, that you imagine your life, all the events in your life being in different order, like real life actually is on earth. Uh, I just wanted to cut from one thing to another, to another, to another and random orders sort of the way life actually works.

Speaker 3:          07:22          This part of the afterlife, you imagine something analogous to your earthly life. Reading books and the thought cars crashed explicitly watching commercials. A life where episodes are split into tiny showers, swallowable pieces, swallowing swollen moments do not endure. You sleep. One experiences the joy of jumping from one event to the next, like a child sitting in thought hopping from spot to spot in this cut on the earnings here working they was born. For instance, flipping your nails, staring out the bus window, waiting for a green light tower, having sex reading books popping from spot to spot or it's crest count of money swallowing, swallowing your eyes, hurting, paying two lasers staring into the refrigerator without opening your eyes. Shower.

Speaker 7:          08:12          Well, I'll tell him about a 60 hours hours, 60 straight hours. Oh No, no, no, no. I've got three kids. I can't say up that 60 hours over a period of a few weeks. My actual job was a piano teacher and a church organist and I teach a couple of music theory courses at a two year college. That's what I actually get paid for. I don't get paid for this time. It's just fun. How often do you do this kind of thing? I've entered probably about 30 contests since 2009 really? What sorts of contexts? Um, well there's, there's the snoop dog contest and I turned it into a pirate song. Pirate Shanti. I just had him singing over pirate music changes

Speaker 1:          08:56          rhythm to make it a sea shanty

Speaker 5:          08:58          suitcase. It's what they say is if they knew me, oh my head, like a two feet. My n***a key kid, that's my little buddy. Toss him holes up. It gets them cutting. Cutting. What's it like? Mine's just kinda tight a long way from Huston.

Speaker 1:          09:11          They to like let, so David Minnick was our grand prize winner. He gets $500 ticket to the live show and a backup from Robert. I didn't, I didn't know. I didn't know I was doing backdrop. Just, I just put that in. But now it's on tape. You got to do it. Okay. And let me just say one thing before we do any more winters, and this is in reference to the whole Broadway thing. If we're going to be representative of the kinds of things that we got in most of the submissions, like I would say about a hundred of them sounded like this.

Speaker 5:          09:36          Wait, listening to radio radio from Jay

Speaker 1:          09:52          four on the floor at tech. No. Which I gotta admit, you know, not being a Broadway guy. I sort of liked this stuff. You like this stuff? Yeah. I mean lower the lights, but the smoke machine on. I'm all about that one. I actually, this and this stuff like this when I'm writing. Really? Yeah. It's just like the sound of energy. I am so sorry for you because not only do you lack any Broadway, but you believe in techno. I just think it's a tasted little loop. It's a great loop. How do I know you?

Speaker 5:          10:21          Please, please.

Speaker 1:          10:28          Okay. We'll be right back and we will have the runners up. Some of them.

And uh, here it is. Do Loving me. Sports and Andre.

Speaker 11:         12:12          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:13          This first one is from a fellow named Jeff Barr. He's actually the editor for a really cool podcast name risk and he calls this one pacing about the lab that the, you know, the Dale

Speaker 4:          12:29          123-FOUR-FIVE-6789

Speaker 1:          12:33          41827347750 1200777777

Speaker 4:          12:42          you

Speaker 12:         12:57          okay?

Speaker 13:         13:05          I really got tuned into this, Jeff, the sounds that aren't meant to be music, but come off as music to me, so I just play with that and turn it into songs. Mother never occurred to me that there might be any big slice of chocolate.

Speaker 14:         13:28          There was blah, blah, blah. There was blah, blah, blah, blah. There was no good.

Speaker 1:          13:41          No, it gets judged. I know will look told them where we are. You know it gets Japan. I know will look, told them wherever we are. You fucking know it gets jealous. I know who we are. You know it gets [inaudible] told them. Right.

Speaker 12:         14:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:09          wow, good. That made me think of, it's like if Radiolab were an actual place in some alternate dimension, that would be like the sound of the dead space between thoughts where you're just pacing around, right or or maybe or perhaps it's what the studio is dreaming about when you're not in it. Oh, like that random sounds like it means random. That is random. Sounds like it means random. That is sound like it means

Speaker 11:         14:37          seven [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:39          and of course there are other award winning [inaudible] runners up out there. Winners and you can listen to them. The ones we've chosen on our website, also an endeavors website, but we now have, I got to say here, the one that really, really delighted

Speaker 7:          14:52          us, we, it's neither a runner up nor the grand prize winner. Maybe we would call this the director's choice. Yes, exactly. The director's choice. So the, just to set this one up, we had a show about vertigo actually about the disease. We turned up an essay from a Burton rouget Shea or the New Yorker who pretty much invented the whole genre of like medical mysteries.

Speaker 1:          15:13          Anyhow, many, many years ago, he interviews this woman about something she's going through and writes an article about it and we had actually actress hope Davis dramatize the readings. I've been home about an hour. Dinner was ready and waiting in the oven and I was sitting at the piano, not really.

Speaker 7:          15:29          Basically in this essay, this woman loses control of her body,

Speaker 1:          15:33          started across the room. I felt the floor sort of shake, good heavens. I said, what was that? Things begin to tilt. The world gets very strange and out of scale. Her arms begin to feel like they're lengthening and then contracting. She just completely loses her relationship to the planet earth. Frank just looked at me. His face was a perfect blank. He made some remark about old buildings stretching and settling and handed me my drink. No, she's suffering from a disease, uh, called Vertigo. That's what the whole essay is about. Uh, the surprising symptoms that happen when you get vertigo. Listen to what these two remixers, these two guys who did this next remix. Listen to how they take that idea of vertigo and flip it.

Speaker 15:         16:27          Everything was quite ordinary. I know we was the presence in a suit. He was smelling solid concern. She could tell the way he moved. He said confidence and safe with every breath he effort was the leave just let loose from the tree. No idea what she was supposed to be or to do. She was just an outline. Some notes on some loose leaf paper and paper was something he knew how to use. He worked for the paper, capturing the tools, a molder of material out looking for Omni was [inaudible]. She wasn't a few sprinkles. Somebody is, every movement is a blue box, became her new sky. They spread across the room. They bled over the [inaudible] for vision. And her view was a huge, that covered the few things she thought. She knew to close that overflow to face and change the way she moved floors on the floor shake. It went down and up. It was as if I were sinking into the floor and the floor was like, it would do under my foot and I would sink.

Speaker 7:          17:36          So can you guys introduce yourselves? Oh, my name is mark out for you. And I go by Demio as a producer in the world of production. So she, Schibsted Chang and I'm, my name is Ryan Vinson. I go by sketch lightly. And that's the whole world of hip hop music. Changan de Ching. So Ryan's the rapper on this thing. And Mark's the guy who makes the music. Well I think all I gave him at first was like listen to the stems. I think I can write something about this interpreting vertigo as something about love and positives and negatives. Um, and he kind of went from there and made all of the music.

Speaker 1:          18:11          Yeah, it was Kinda, it's Kinda, I don't know, came out of nowhere. So I was just trying to make something that would fit with his style. So now how did you go up with the idea of, of taking vertigo, which is a disease where you lose your balance and your relationship to gravity and making that about love and losing yourself in another person?

Speaker 7:          18:30          Yeah, I dunno, I'm listening to the other pieces, uh, that were submitted before mine. People would either just leave all the vocals, basically the same and just do different musical arrangements underneath. And then there were some that would take the vocals and chop them up in all crazy ways and it was really awesome to listen to. But being a fan of the show, I guess I kind of missed the story sometimes. Like just the, the feeling from the stories. I try to think of a way that I could kind of sit in between there. So, um, just the idea of vertigo, just the feelings described in the original piece made me think of love, not knowing where you, how the space works anymore. I think it's a lot like the way people describe falling in love where everything seems different. Right, exactly. Um, is that just,

Speaker 1:          19:17          I think that made sense to you in the abstract or were you drawing from personal ah,

Speaker 7:          19:22          personal experience or something? I don't know. Is there something, something behind that? I guess it's definitely a drawing from personal experience, but I guess these two guys have been in love for a very, very long time. That's what it kind of congressional thing. And you could tell if you ever see us in the same room, you both start cranking up towards me and then I can, I'll start moving. And I know that's an honest question, isn't it? Did you, is there a real into that or, yeah, no, there is. Um, so when I heard the feeling described in the piece, I was like, my question to myself was why can I relate to this? Like why does that make sense to me? Cause I've never been there. I've never had vertigo. But for me I guess, um, I mean getting really personal. Um, I mean I'm, I'm divorced, I'm really young and divorced.

Speaker 7:          20:07          I guess I'm up from most people. Um, but just, um, the second verse talks a lot about this unsure feeling when you, your identity becomes lost in someone else. Um, when you're not sure where you stop and they begin and that can be a really great thing, but also can be really troubling. And um, when you're not sure what you are on your own anymore, I guess. And I guess I've, I have gone through that. It all happened so quickly. Head's spinning. Trump the wedding ring, she was his completely in, he was her everything and she was everything in term, but only in turn she was

Speaker 15:         20:48          Frank's wife first and nobody said, and second she was someone who she couldn't quite pin down the woman that she was before she lost herself in his smile. He was so handsome and successful in her husband and had to say something about the woman who loved him. Right? These were the questions that kept her up at night, eyes wide at the sky, wondering what it would be like if the Sun's light can strike them all. She shuttered shut, arise and pressed herself against us. I was conscious of a new dimension. I had a new relationship to space my face. My whole body felt no shame. I seem to be completely at the mercy of some outside force. I was in war.

Speaker 16:         21:34          Right.

Speaker 1:          21:42          Oh, you're right. That's not a person who's safe. It's not a happy feeling. So in that scenario, I don't want to be too literal about this, but who are you? You're talking from the perspective of the woman about a guy named frank. I assume that you're closer spiritually to the woman's perspective in this case.

Speaker 7:          22:02          Right? I guess I would say, I would say I would more closely associate to the female character, right? Yeah. She just has these all these thoughts and questions, but then the last line is like she shuttered, shut her eyes and pressed herself against his side. So she's kind of brushing those away because it was scary and going back to a security and comfort, but we don't yet know whether she's going to get, you know, going to go solo. She's very each when, thank you. Paying attention, Diane. No, it's like it's a very subtle like line at the end that, I dunno, I meant it to be that way because I didn't want it to feel decisive that you wrote this from the perspective of somebody who's in the middle of it. Right. I guess from the perspective of someone who's in the middle of it and not sure if she even really wants to be on the outside of it, but feels like maybe she should.

Speaker 15:         22:50          Oh, it's a, it's a strange place to be at the mercy of some outside force. I guess. I sat there for a long time.

Speaker 4:          23:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          23:14          he, it's real. It's with kind of like humbling about that whole thing for me. Is it like they found something that was in the story that we didn't even know was in there at that thing. It's kind of beautiful. Yeah. Well she, that's the thing. When Liz idea was created, it wasn't created by me because I thought it was insane. I thought, why would people in the business of their lives go into our raw material and re sculpted? I said, nobody is going to do that. It's just dumb. But the fact that 136 people took the time to do it. Yeah. It brought so much talent and energy and end and cleverness and interestingness to the whole thing. It's quite, it's just, I don't know what to call it. Well, I think it's kind of wonderful is what it is. Yeah, it's just cool. So thank you to everybody that entered. Thank you. And thank you to Indaba for making this possible for us. You can hear a bunch of the remixes on an Davos website that's Indaba music.com and they run a site that's really extraordinary because it gets a whole bunch of people who love music. I love mixing music together. Yeah. So thank you. Indaba yeah, I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thank you for re listening.
