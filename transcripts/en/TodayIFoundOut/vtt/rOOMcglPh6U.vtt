00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.820
The short answer is that there is no 100%
definitive known reason as to why nails grow

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.920
at different rates.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.429
However, there is a really good theory (which
also covers why fingernails and toenails grow

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.799
at drastically different rates) that is backed
up by an awful lot of ancillary evidence.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:16.799
To fully grasp what’s going on here, it’s
important to understand exactly how your fingernails

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:17.799
grow.

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:18.799
Every type of cell in our body grows at different
rates.

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:22.650
For example, we know that hair grows faster
than bones and cancer grows faster than anyone

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.650
would like.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.650
The exact mediating factor of what gives rise
to that growth rate is still the topic of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.650
much research.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019
What we do know is that the answer lies in
our genes.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.019
Now it should be noted that in August of 2012,
a team of researchers at MIT and the Harvard

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.279
Medical School were able to answer when mammalian
cells decide to divide.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.669
They found that cells divide when they reach
a critical phase in development, not when

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.840
they reach a specific size.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.400
This breakthrough in understanding will now
allow them to test the factors that determine

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.620
why they might grow and divide at those rates.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.350
But as to finger and toenails, what we know
about fingernails is that they grow at a rate

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.350
of about 3.5 millimeters per month and toenails
grow about 1.6 mm per month on average.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
The exact rate at which your nails will grow
depends on several factors.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.350
They include things like: age, sex, diet,
exercise, and even the time of year.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.350
Our nails consist of many different parts.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.399
The visible part is known as the nail plate.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.390
Below this is the nail bed.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.539
The white, half-moon shaped part at the base
of your nail is called the lunula (also known

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.539
as the distal matrix).

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.489
The tissue over the top of the matrix is called
the cuticle, and the soft tissue directly

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.899
over your cuticle, is called the eponychium.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.270
The nail itself is grown from the matrix (presumably
your big toe is “The One”).

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.270
It lies beneath the fingernail and extends
several millimeters into the finger.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.360
90% of nail growth comes from here.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.700
The matrix consists of epithelial cells (the
most common type of cells that make up numerous

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.000
things in our bodies, like skin) that grow
and divide.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.620
These cells contain proteins called keratin.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.800
Once the cells begin to reach the end of their
life cycle, they go through a process called

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.770
Keratinization, also known as cornification.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.700
When the cell dies, it loses its nucleus and
other intracellular organelles.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060
What remains is keratin.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.630
It gets enclosed in an insoluble mixture of
different proteins and lipids (fats).

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.110
The enzyme responsible for this formation
is known as Transglutaminase.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.750
The result is the hard nail used to pick noses
and give back scratches everywhere!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.020
Pressure within the matrix of your nail forces
the dead karatinized cells out.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.890
The shape of your nail, as it grows, is merely
a continuation of the angle of your matrix.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.140
It’s then guided along by the nail grooves
and folds on the sides of your nail bed.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.970
Keratinized cells are not just found in your
nails, but also in your hair, skin, and animal

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.970
hooves.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.160
What makes them more hard, or soft, depends
on their thickness and the cross-linked structure

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160
of the keratin.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.189
Now that we know how our nails grow, let’s
get back to the specific question at hand

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.480
and talk about the main theories behind why
fingernails grow faster than toenails and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.110
why nails on different fingers or toes grow
at different rates.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.769
In the end, it really just seems to come down
to blood supply, but there’s a bit more

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.969
to it than just that certain fingers or toes
are getting a better and more oxygen rich

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.700
blood supply than others.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.090
The matrix in our nails is supplied with blood
and nutrients through a highly vascular area

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.290
of capillaries.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.370
They also have special shunts (blood pathways)
between the arteries and veins known as Sucquet-Hoyer

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.489
canals, that help regulate temperature in
your fingers and toes when it gets cold.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.860
When any part of our body gets injured, the
natural reaction is a response that engorges

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.280
the area with more blood and nutrients.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.859
So it is believed that the constant micro
trauma our fingernails endure throughout the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.930
day, like tapping, typing, and bumping, allows
for an even greater increase in blood and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.930
nutrient supply.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.329
Since the toes are always kept locked away
safely in our socks and shoes (and in an office

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.200
like environment, we’re often immobile throughout
much of the day, but constantly using our

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.220
fingers as we type), they don’t receive
the constant “mini-trauma” that the fingernails

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.220
do.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.030
Similarly, certain fingers and toes likely
get more trauma than others, affecting their

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.030
growth rate.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.909
The end result of these micro traumas is a
chronic overabundance of nutrients that make

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.200
more karatinized epithelial cells.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.719
The increase results in more nail.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.739
The reason the “trauma” theory is adopted
by many researchers revolves around ancillary

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.879
evidence.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.569
Fingernails on your dominant hand will grow
faster than the ones on your non-dominant

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.129
hand, presumably because your dominant hand
will have more micro trauma compared to your

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.749
non-dominant hand.

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.900
Additional ancillary evidence towards the
overarching “blood supply” theory is that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.569
nails will grow faster in the summertime.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.549
Since your fingers and toes are warmer, your
capillaries and arterioles are bigger, allowing

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.360
more blood-flow to the digits.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.719
When circulation becomes an issue, like as
we age or in certain medical conditions like

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:26.569
diabetes, the nails will grow slower.
