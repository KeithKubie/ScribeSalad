00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.170
 Time has become difficult with natural disasters, leading political agitation and uncertainty 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.500
 Regarding the future. 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.380
 While most memes revolve around the horrors of the times in which we live, you may be surprised 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.570
 To see your life now compared to what it would have been to be in the past. 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.720
 In fact, most of history includes the subordination of man to malnutrition and hunger. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.730
 In ancient Egypt, severe drought could cause death to 5 to 10% of the population. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 Today's crops are not ideal, of course, with 11% of the population of France suffering from food insecurity 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 Which means that their nutrition is limited by the social and economic situation, and they eat small amounts of nutritious foods 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.860
 With too much carbohydrate and salt, but compare this with years 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.899
 1692-1694 when literally 15% of the French population died because of the high price of food only. 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.190
 While millions today suffer from malnutrition, technological development, and government agencies 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 NGOs help to ensure a majority 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.469
 In fact, for the first time in human history, overweight people are more malnourished. 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.170
 When the human race began to live in cities, there was a tremendous rise in disease. 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 During the 1330 years there was a terrible outbreak of what they thought were demons, foul air or angry gods 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.590
 Killed 75 to 200 million people. 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.900
 We are aware that flea was the dwelling place of Yarsine plague, which is historically known 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.930
 Black Plague. 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.010
 But people at that time did not realize what was killing them. 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 In 1520 a small Spanish fleet bound for Mexico was carrying a person 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.189
 Has an early case of root disease. 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.299
 The disease kills within two months one-third of Mexico's population 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.780
 In the years that followed, several infectious diseases spread in Mexico 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 Bringing the population down from 22 million to 2 million in a span of 60 years. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.630
 Deaths from diseases continued unabated and no one knew how to cure them. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.240
 The medication then included praying, taking cool showers and rubbing black beetles on the sores. 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.570
 Until recently, in 1981, the Spanish flu spread internationally and within a few months 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.909
 Infection has spread to one-third of the world's population, with 3 to 5% dying 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.520
 Today, our concern about flu is associated with acupuncture needles. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.150
 Modern medicine saves millions of lives. 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 The vaccine for smallpox eradicated the disease entirely from our planet. 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.640
 When diseases such as severe acute pneumonia or Ebola occur and the world wakes up to a severe emergency for public health 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.349
 The number of deaths is much lower thanks to international organizations, new technology and continuous medical progress. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.349
 When Europe colonized America, there were as many as 100 million people dead 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.569
 But the pre-colonial population is not well documented, so some estimates go up to millions more. 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.891
 85 million people died during World War II and in ancient agricultural societies 

00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:49.989
 Human violence caused 15% of the total number of deaths. 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.310
 Today human violence causes 1% of the total number of deaths. 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.180
 In 2012, 120,000 people lost their lives in wars, while 1.5 million died of diabetes. 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.670
 For the first time in human history, most people do not assume war when looking at the receptor 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.620
 When we meditate this year, while there are still famine diseases, wars and inequality, 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.459
 We find that it is radically better than most human history. 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.180
 But we must remain critical of our government, challenge companies and rethink 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.790
 In how human society is structured in order to sustain progress 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.430
 , Recognizes the successful human effort in medical research, economic reforms and peace initiatives 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.960
 And government support to reduce hunger, epidemics and violence will be found 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.730
 Hope for the future. 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.150
 Hope is a value concept that needs to be emphasized while looking for a path of satisfaction in a world 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.030
 It may sometimes seem overwhelmingly bad. 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.940
 If you want some fun explore the latest shirt we made 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.959
 "The rotation of the earth makes my day", which we will launch in the next two weeks 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.909
 Only in asapscience.com/merch 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.049
 We really appreciate your support during all these years and we would not appreciate doing this video without you!
