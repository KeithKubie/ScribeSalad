00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 this capture we'll see how in a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.980
 hlm have made the inference of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.469
 the most plausible explanation 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.490
 so we've seen so far how 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 make a reference filtering type ten 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 wise make the prediction 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.240
 the last title of inference we want 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 explore here is the most 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 plausible ie find out what 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.900
 is the complete sequence of hidden states 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.960
 which explains the best 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.440
 the observation sequence so ds is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 until you grow up so we have a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 case maximization rather than a sum 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 we had to do in the others 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 probability titles in fact one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.649
 calls for a very direct link between 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.379
 others the calculation of the alpha chart that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.789
 involved men and the calculation that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 will do that the most explanation 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.620
 plausible that will involve earlier 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.109
 maximizing then the problem again 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 once is that if we make the time 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.229
 to solve the problem of maximization 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 naively we will still have a 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.610
 exponential enumeration of the number of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.979
 possible sequences that one must consider 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 to make the maximization so for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.530
 to be precise if we take an example of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 tea is equal to 3 so we assume that the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 just three observations then 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.689
 the most plausible explanation 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.100
 found 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.869
 the dh star sequence from the dh sequence 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.950
 that I'm going to call h stars that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.369
 maximizes the probability of s1 up 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 is king and h1 until h3 so in fact 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.290
 here all that we have there all this 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 line there here actually it corresponds to p2 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:56.909
 s1 up is king and p2h 1 that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.439
 I call stars until h3 so in 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.790
 did I just use the years 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.040
 by the conditional ars to write 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.469
 this probability joy and com and at the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.990
 probity of h1 times the probability of the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.629
 sister sacha h1 for the probity of h2 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.710
 knowing h1 and so on until the 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.170
 paralysis of s3 sasha 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.090
 h3 so that's just the independences 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.550
 conditional that we have there by the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.350
 structure to let go even and one has to 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.070
 make a maximization of finding the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.310
 value of cash statements and 2 h 15 until 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.430
 3 that maximizes this probability is 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.870
 so except in the case where there are three 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.880
 it may not be a lot of 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 sequences but for a great value of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.240
 your other than three it's going to make a 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 exponential number of sequences 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.040
 grown exponentially compared to 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.600
 the length of the sequence 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.980
 however we notice if we do 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.350
 maxima are on all sequences 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 it's like making party so this 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.270
 successful notation is like having the mac 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.940
 / h swiss max on age 2 that of the mac 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.010
 / h3 and in fact we can put them in 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.810
 any order of the reports and in 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.310
 do what we notice is that since 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.930
 all these unpeeled terms the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.600
 products are limited in one order 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.420
 any one could all push the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.150
 terms that depend only 2h hours 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.920
 here push them to the right and take the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.530
 maximize ation only on agen is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.910
 she too pushed her to the right one can 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.710
 do that because if we maximize by 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.280
 report to achraf but all the terms 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.200
 who before do not depend on h1 and so 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.270
 I can pass them in front of the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.970
 maximization so if I have only the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.980
 ladies who depend on h and end 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.860
 the ofs that expression here here it's 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.740
 possible for me from there to maximize for 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.140
 all possible values ​​2h 2h 2 who 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.940
 is not specified yet so I could 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.910
 solve this maximization the support puts 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.380
 the intermediate calculation in memory then 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.900
 then to resolve each other 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
 maximization versus hd and again 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.380
 once I did the same thing I 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.810
 put all the terms that depend 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.300
 only from h2 and I put them to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.430
 right the maximization and there now 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.220
 so from my intermediate calculus 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.530
 here then new calculations here I 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.640
 to be able to solve any maximization but 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.560
 now compared to Thursday 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.740
 I could go on like this until 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.020
 go to h 3 then finally finished the 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.970
 maximization when I just described 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.799
 in words actually it's going to be the equivalent 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.100
 of the dynamic program that we will use 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.860
 to solve this problem there and with gonna 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.340
 to be very very similar to the program 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.900
 having dinner 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.280
 dynamic associated with the women market 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.520
 it's just conferring a maximization 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:38.100
 rather than a sum so let's look at them 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:43.840
 details i'm going to define alpha 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:47.979
 stars as being the probability of s1 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:53.979
 until August and is one of the indices of 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.320
 my chart and h1 up to buy less 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.040
 one that takes the optimum value up 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.650
 now and buy and equal a 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.430
 given value which is the other index of 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.639
 my chart so notice that it's 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.750
 very similar to alpha alpha ink 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.120
 dalphond did we did not have this 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.669
 part here here we only had that 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.289
 so can the difference here is 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.169
 that with alpha normally we have 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.789
 marginalized the other h while in 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.830
 our camp the waters maximize for 9 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.710
 set the value of the best purchases 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.120
 value find until now and 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.310
 as in dynamic programming 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.520
 we will make the link between what has been 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.580
 calculated at time t 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.160
 and what was calculated at the moment 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.300
 before 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.729
 so we will note a recursion we will 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.380
 which must be calculated at the moment 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.150
 follow a convoy bound with what has been 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.000
 calculated at the moment preceding so by 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.690
 alpha and toualy definition of the most a 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.490
 that's equal to that term here so the 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.410
 probability of what is observed from 1 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.300
 to healthier ones 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.260
 so we have a plan instead of first tnt 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:13.150
 + 1 and the maximum sequence of 1 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:16.389
 up to healthy witnesses as well as buy 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.450
 which is equal to gmail here we maximize by 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:25.360
 report to me so there we try to so 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:30.520
 the equivalent describe a tea is equal to 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.660
 h stars from 1 until time it's the 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.310
 same thing as saying I'm going to you 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.289
 learn what was optimal 1 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.879
 until witnesses hours i'm going to look 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.499
 a priority to buy galas a 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:43.159
 value of giving j but i'm going to take 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.749
 the one that is maximum so that's okay 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.180
 maybe in fact the value lies that goes 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:51.469
 maximize that's going to be my h stars of 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.419
 tea in celebration so this probability so 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.110
 these two terminals here it corresponds to 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.409
 h 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.449
 and you are laurent until you and we have 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:02.869
 then bought + 1 supposed to be 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:06.830
 equal to 10 10 being Monday what I have 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:08.809
 here so as for the calculation of the table 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.119
 alphabet game can decompose seven 

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:13.490
 producers like and at the parity attached 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:21.259
 from what is observed in one up 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:24.319
 your times forgiveness and h1n1 until witness 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:28.189
 one that takes its optimum value and https 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:30.409
 gala j times the policy bought + 1 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:32.779
 skip gallery since ht be 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.369
 equal acts so we get out we have no 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.259
 dependence here on observations 

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:38.149
 previous because of independence 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:41.419
 conditional we had previously 

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:43.459
 in a hlm as well as buy more one 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:45.409
 is equal to 1 of which quoted above 

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:48.050
 is equal to small is is more a being 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:49.849
 given that bought + 1 equal to there is still 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.939
 once it's independent of others 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:56.499
 elements in my probity so two 

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:58.999
 bought then from s to st because of 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:01.939
 because it does not have six blocks so we 

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:04.550
 conditional independence 

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:07.430
 so here and then whose hair 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:10.849
 maximization arises from this expression 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.860
 here I notice that this term does not 

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:16.129
 does not depend on gidon I can place 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.379
 in front of the maximum I notice this term 

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:23.029
 there here in fact by definition it's 

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:24.289
 alpha stars jt and I still have more than 

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:26.779
 this term there he learns quickly and from 

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:29.269
 make a transition from j to y 

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:30.469
 in the kachin state so I managed to 

00:08:29.269 --> 00:08:35.229
 to link my story 

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:35.229
 at &amp; t +1 an actor canvas market 

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.890
 and finally with regard to 

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:44.810
 initial values ​​of the first column 

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:50.360
 from my alpha star chart so I 

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:52.940
 young initialises pde sang gala yx 

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.970
 p of the astreinte equal to small to what 

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.000
 is observed at the first instant knowing 

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.100
 that a welsh tea has so it's a 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.160
 application of this definition there so 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.170
 for all gala 1 in fact I have 

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.340
 ask me about thieves 2 h until 

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.390
 1 - 1 until 0 so no dh finally 

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.120
 so that's why I do not have any 

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:19.520
 maximization for the special coc for you 

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:24.170
 guys there finally in regards to 

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.970
 find the probability of the sequence 

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.880
 observe and the best sequence 

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.100
 for the hidden state just take the 

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.900
 maximum on the last column of alpha 

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.000
 stars and there now if I want 

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.830
 find find out what is the share of 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.650
 all this sequence there is what loose 

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.940
 star 1 up big t but what I 

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.550
 will do if I'm going to take up arms 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.470
 axes of the last column t more 

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.830
 of that I'm going back to borrow the 

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.230
 weapons axes that were made for all 

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.810
 the sequences of the right for all 

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:56.330
 years from the right to the 

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:59.570
 left doing what I call to 

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.860
 from the arts max previous so that 

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.570
 it is a concept that is illustrated a little 

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:07.310
 better with an example and we will do that 

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:11.210
 in the next hours positive then 

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.800
 we come to our example where I have 4 bits 

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.110
 that have been transmitted and there I want 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.200
 know what is the sequence of beats 

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.850
 h1 h2 h3 hy4 that the person wanted 

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.650
 really send me so is what has 

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.940
 had noise then that in fact there is 

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.480
 some of the shops are not the ones 

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:29.030
 beats that had actually been sent 

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.950
 by the person who sent me the 

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.020
 message 

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.310
 so I have my star alpha chart that 

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.440
 genissary reads according to conditions 

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.339
 initialization which is the formula here 

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.339
 we saw previously 

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:48.150
 so alpha stars 0 1 it's ph is equal 

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:51.990
 at zero x pds inde equal to zero knowing 

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:56.640
 that h is equal to zero is 0.9 0.5 so 

00:10:51.990 --> 00:11:01.980
 0.45 that I insert here I do the same 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:03.570
 thing with alphand star 1 1mg floor 

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.790
 ready to apply my recursion to the 

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.070
 left to the right 

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:10.860
 so here we have the formula we saw 

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.280
 previously on the link indicated to 

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.440
 left 

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.290
 the left column with the column of 

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.490
 right so actually the calculation of a 

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.750
 element here is going to involve calculations of 

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.940
 all the elements in the column of 

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.740
 left but instead of having a sum 

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:32.160
 as was the case with alfa have 

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:36.090
 a max instead for the alpha body 

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.040
 0.2 stars it will match p2 s2 

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:43.260
 equal to zero that each age debt equal to 

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:48.060
 zero times the max between so be alpha 

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:51.720
 and 3.01 times bought Wales forgiveness hd is 

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:54.990
 equal to zero bag bought yann at zero or 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.810
 your censor or half way canvas 1.1 

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:01.020
 times the policy h2 is equal to zero 

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.400
 shat that h1 and thus matching the choice in 

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.890
 is actually seeing is this 

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.530
 more likely that I have passed 2 

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.690
 0 that I got back to zero or that 

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.790
 I was right and more likely than 

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.500
 I was at 1 to 20 since now I 

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.880
 am at 0 cashed the two things that 

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.860
 are compared here in fact if we do some 

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.730
 calculations in that if the maximum is 

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.460
 the first theme 

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:25.320
 so in fact what am I going to do in 

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.090
 if I had to program his section to have 

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.100
 a pointer that will bring me back I 

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.920
 got here I did the math of 

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.620
 this element there from the alpha stars 

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.390
 here and if it's pointing to where I want 

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.330
 follow at the end to do the decoding 

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.670
 of the entire sequence corresponds to the 

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.580
 sequence to the most explanation 

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.720
 plausible 

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.680
 so I did the same calculation for 

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:52.530
 alpha stars 1 2 because if still 

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.000
 once it's the term that depends on 

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:57.120
 alpha stars 

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.740
 your breasts that fits the max so 

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.500
 it's more likely according to our 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.920
 calculations to be first was a gala tea 

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:08.280
 0 then to be switched to h 2 equals 1 

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:11.070
 than to have been bought gala 1 then 

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.800
 to have gone hot is equal to 1 so 

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:15.420
 I'll note that with a pointer here 

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:20.820
 and then I will write in my table 

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:22.590
 the calculated value and I continue as 

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:26.610
 that an inhabitant regulating the 

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:28.590
 left to the right and I fill everything 

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.300
 my table like that by filling but 

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.360
 point also so remembered me 

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.080
 doubs was calculated the different 

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.950
 elements of the painting alphand antoine 

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.010
 then to do the decoding 

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:44.160
 now I'm looking at the last 

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:46.920
 column and I take the max so on this 

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.230
 element here here this is the element with 

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.400
 probity or the maximum value in the 

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:55.320
 column which my last column and so 

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.250
 that's the probability of the 

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.540
 best sequence 

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.430
 now i want to know so this is 

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.810
 well I have this reality right now I 

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.310
 want to know what is the sequence with 

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.820
 this probability the sequence of toques 

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.180
 hidden that generated this priority 

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.550
 maximum 

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:12.900
 and when I'm going to do what I'm going 

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:14.910
 follow the arrows in this case also said 

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.190
 if I go there water I go 

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.830
 here and from here I surrender the skin when 

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.410
 I spend here 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:25.380
 so if I read all this stuff 

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:28.530
 that I'm going to do and it's that h4 is 

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:31.470
 equal to 1 in the best sequence h3t 

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:34.800
 gallas 0 in the best h2 sequence 

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:36.720
 equal to 1 in the best sequence then 

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.390
 agent is zero in the sequence 

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.230
 with the highest probability 

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.330
 notice that the pointers are 

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:45.030
 important it would not have worked 

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.860
 just take the max on each of 

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.270
 columns will have to follow the pointers if 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.400
 I had done the max on each of 

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.950
 columns I would have rather selected six 

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.470
 6 to 10 h from tig to 0 it was not the 

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.710
 good answer so for this problem if 

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:01.470
 although I have observed 000 1 

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.089
 in fact what is most likely 

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.100
 is that the person who sent me a 

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:05.970
 message wanted to send me to sing gas 

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.060
 0 

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:11.009
 is equal to 1 h web equal to zero hk 

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.839
 rigal so it's more likely that 

00:15:11.009 --> 00:15:14.790
 wanted to send me 01 01 

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:17.250
 but that because of the noise in the 

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.019
 transmission that my second goal was 

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.300
 britt and then that I got instead 

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.990
 of the brain 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.759
 that's how we calculate 

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.120
 the most plausible explanation in a 

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:26.120
 hlm
