00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.250
We're told to look at the
coordinate grid above.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.830
I put it on the side here.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.600
Identify one system
of two lines that

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.910
has a single solution.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.690
Then identify one system
of two lines that

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.270
does not have a solution.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.655
So let's do the first part
first. So a single solution.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.370
And they say identify one
system, but we can see here

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.000
there's actually going to
be two systems that

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.650
have a single solution.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.229
And when we talk about a single
solution, we're talking

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.170
about a single x and y value
that will satisfy both

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.850
equations in the system.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.370
So if we look right here at the
points of intersection,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
this point right there, that
satisfies this equation y is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.970
equal to 0.1x plus 1.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.940
And it also satisfies, well,
this blue line, but the graph

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.180
that that line represents,
y is equal to 4x plus 10.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.530
So this dot right here, that
point represents a solution to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.460
both of these.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.950
Or I guess another way to think
about it, it represents

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.290
an x and y value that satisfy
both of these constraints.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.890
So one system that has one
solution is the system that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.880
has y is equal to 0.1x plus 1,
and then this blue line right

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.800
here, which is y is equal
to 4x plus 10.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.020
Now, they only want us to
identify one system of two

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.650
lines that has a single
solution.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.080
We've already done that.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.730
But just so you see it, there's
actually another

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.730
system here.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.380
So this is one system right
here, or another system would

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.130
be the green line and
this red line.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.900
This point of intersection right
here, once again, that

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.740
represents an x and y value
that satisfies both the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.930
equation y is equal to 0.1x plus
1, and this point right

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.070
here satisfies the equation
y is equal to 4x minus 6.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.289
So if you look at this system,
there's one solution, because

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.020
there's one point of
intersection of these two

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.530
equations or these two lines,
and this system also has one

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.000
solution because it has one
point of intersection.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.510
Now, the second part of the
problem, they say identify one

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.950
system of two lines that does
not have a single solution or

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740
does not have a solution,
so no solution.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.180
So in order for there to be no
solution, that means that the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.840
two constraints don't overlap,
that there's no point that is

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.660
common to both equations or
there's no pair of x, y values

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.360
that's common to
both equations.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.840
And that's the case of the two
parallel lines here, this blue

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.230
line and this green line.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.410
Because they never intersect,
there's no coordinate on the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.950
coordinate plane that satisfies
both equations.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.420
So there's no x and y
that satisfy both.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.380
So the second part of the
question, a system that has no

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.450
solution is y is equal to 4x
plus 10, and then the other

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.250
one is y is equal
to 4x minus 6.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.680
And notice, they have the exact
same slope, and they're

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.270
two different lines, they have
different intercepts, so they

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.660
never, ever intersect,
and that's why

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.600
they have no solutions.
