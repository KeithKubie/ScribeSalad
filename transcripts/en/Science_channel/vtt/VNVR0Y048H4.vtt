00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.434
THIS IS MY IMPROVISED ARMOR.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.667
NOW, IT'S MADE OF

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.601
A HIGH-STRENGTH GYPSUM CEMENT
CALLED FGR 95,

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.100
WHICH IS FILLED
WITH POLYPROPYLENE FIBER,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.534
AND WE'VE ALSO INSERTED TWO
LAYERS OF COMMON BATHROOM TILES

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.367
A LITTLE BIT BACK
FROM THE FRONT.

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:20.701
Narrator: WITH ITS
GEL VITAL ORGANS AS BACKSTOP,

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.801
THE MANNEQUIN WILL TAKE THE HIT
IF THE TILE PROVES PERMEABLE.

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.434
WELL, HERE AT
THE MYTHBUSTERS ARMORY,

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:28.334
JAMIE SAID HE WANTED TO
TEST THE JAMIE TILE.

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.067
WE WANTED TO GIVE IT
A GOOD SOLID TEST.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:34.434
WE CHOSE WIDE BANDWIDTH OF YOUR
BASIC ARMAMENTS AND AMMUNITION.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.767
SO LET ME GIVE YOU
A TOUR OF TODAY'S ARSENAL,

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.968
STARTING OFF WITH A HANDGUN,
9-MILLIMETER.

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:41.000
MOVING ON TO THE HANDGUN,
.45 CALIBER.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.767
THEN TO THE SHOTGUN, BOTH WITH
BUCKSHOT AND THE DEER SLUG,

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.400
FINALLY FINISHING OFF WITH
THE HIGH-SPEED RIFLE ROUND,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100
THE .223.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.801
THAT OUGHT TO GIVE THIS THING
A RUN FOR ITS MONEY.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.400
GOING HOT!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.501
Narrator:
AND SUITED, LOCKED, AND LOADED
FOR THE FIRST BIG TEST,

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.968
LET'S PAUSE
FOR A PREDICTION FROM JAMIE.

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:01.567
AS FAR AS PISTOLS GO, THE
9-MILLIMETER HAS A REPUTATION

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:03.367
FOR PENETRATING QUITE WELL.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.801
I'M GONNA GO OUT
ON A LIMB HERE, THOUGH,

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:08.767
AND SAY, I THINK
MY JAMIE TILE'S GONNA STOP IT.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:13.300
Narrator: BUT WILL CONFIDENCE
BE CONFIRMED BY THE CONCLUSION?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.200
FIRING IN 3...

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.334
2...

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.200
1.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.367
IT STOPPED IT.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:22.901
IT TOTALLY STOPPED IT.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.300
THERE YOU GO.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.801
IT'S A 9-MILLIMETER.

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.000
I'D SAY IT'S JAMIE TILE -- 1,
BULLET -- ZERO.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.901
Narrator: IT'S A GOOD START
FOR JAMIE'S TILE,

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:36.300
BUT NEXT, IT'S STARING DOWN
THE BARREL OF A .45 HANDGUN.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.267
OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A NICE STOP.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.968
BEAUTY.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.267
HARDLY A DENT
IN THE BACK.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.701
HA HA HA!

00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.000
JAMIE TILE -- 2,
BULLETS -- ZILCH.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.767
Narrator: NEXT UP
IN THE RAMP-UP, IT'S BUCKSHOT.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.868
AFTER WATCHING WHAT IT DID
AGAINST THE HANDGUN ROUNDS,

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:55.200
I DON'T THINK BUCKSHOT'S GONNA
MAKE IT THROUGH THE JAMIE TILE.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.200
WOW!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.167
HA-HA-HA, HA-HA!
LOOK AT THAT.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:03.767
WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT,

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:07.000
BUCKSHOT IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST
THINGS YOU CAN GO UP AGAINST,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.834
AND THE JAMIE TILE STOPPED IT,
AND IT STOPPED IT COLD.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:12.000
Narrator: BUT NOW
THINGS GET REALLY SERIOUS

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.400
AS BUCKSHOT TAKES A BACKSEAT,
REPLACED BY THE DEER SLUG.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.501
THIS IS ALMOST
AN OUNCE OF LEAD.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.601
IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF FORCE
COMING OUT OF THAT GUN.

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:24.300
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'LL BE
ABLE TO STOP IT OR NOT.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.667
Man: RANGE IS HOT!
EYE AND EAR PROTECTION ON.

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.133
HA HA,
I SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:33.934
Narrator:
AND THE FEARS ARE FOUNDED.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.634
WOW, LOOK AT THAT HOLE!

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.434
YOU'D BE HURTING.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:40.000
YOU'D BE DEAD.

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:44.968
Narrator: THE DEER SLUG
WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TILE

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:48.734
AND TOOK OUT
THE VITAL ORGANS, TOO.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.000
OHH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE CHAMPION'S BEEN TAKEN DOWN

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.267
BY AN UPSTART
NAMED "DEER SLUG."

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:58.467
Narrator:
AND AFTER THE SLOW-MOVING
BUT DEADLY DEER SHOT...

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.501
NOW WE'RE GONNA
MOVE ON TO THE .223.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:02.567
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE END
OF THE SCALE.

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:05.701
IT'S A REALLY SMALL BULLET BUT
IT'S MOVING REALLY, REALLY FAST.

00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:09.267
Narrator: BUT CAN IT TAKE OUT
A JAMIE TILE?

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:10.734
RANGE IS HOT!
EYE AND EARS!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.901
Narrator:
AND IT'S THE LAST MAN STANDING.

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.934
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU THINK IT WENT THROUGH?

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.067
I THINK IT WENT THROUGH.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:20.400
YOU DO?
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.267
THERE'S THE BULLET.
THAT WOULD BE A KILL.

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:25.634
WOW! LOOK AT THAT.

00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:28.300
YOU CERTAINLY
SLOWED THAT BULLET DOWN

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.334
FOR IT TO END UP IN THE GEL,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.634
Narrator: AND THERE'S NO ARGUING
WITH THAT.
