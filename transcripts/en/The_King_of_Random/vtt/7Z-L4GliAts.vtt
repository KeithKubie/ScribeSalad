00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
These cheap paper rockets from a different
project will cruse over 300 feet, if you've

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.789
got the right equipment to get them airborne.
In this project you'll learn how to convert

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.109
common sprinkler parts into a powerful and
portable hand-held rocket launcher.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.229
For this project, I based my design on the
style of an AK-47 assault rifle. I rounded

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:48.400
up these PVC sprinkler parts for about $45
at a local hardware store. To get started,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.080
we'll need to measure some 9" lengths of 2"
PVC pipe, and when those are cut, they connect

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.060
to these reducing adaptors. Together, these
will act as the pressure chambers that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.780
power the rocket launch. I'm placing the parts
on my worktable in the basic form of the finished

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.320
rifle, so I can measure custom lengths of
1" pipe for the body. I'm happy with the look,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.939
so let's cut a 2' length of 1/2" pipe for
the barrel, and commit to this design by making

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.539
it permanent. Purple primer will go on first
to clean the connections, and when they're

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.840
dry, it's time to add the PVC cement. When
we make our connections, it's important to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.440
use glue on both components, and twist them
together to make sure we get a great seal.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.159
There's gonna be a lot of pressure in these
chambers, and we don't wanna take any chances

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.460
with a bad connection. Alright, the frame
is complete, and now we can focus on adding

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.819
a pneumatic coupler to this cap. This will
allow us to pressurize our system with an

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.659
air compressor. The pneumatic coupling is
added by drilling a hole in the top of cap

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.159
and tapping the hole to form threads that
will secure the adaptor air tight. Next, we

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.079
can drill a hole in the other cap just big
enough for a momentary switch.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.880
I'll shape the bottom with my belt sander and a rotary
tool so that this trigger cap will fit snug

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.160
on the handle. I'm getting this ready for
painting, so I'll need to clean off the stickers

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.639
with some adhesive remover, and tape over
the parts that I don't want exposed. We still

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:07.929
need to attach the trigger before we can paint,
and we also need to attach some doorbell wire

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.310
as well as this poly tubing. These together
will join the electrical system to the trigger

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.730
switch in the cap. To connect them up, we'll
have to cut a hole just bigger than the tube,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.340
and we're at it, let's drill a hole in the
center of this plug as well because we're

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.110
gonna need that later. Next let's strip
our doorbell wire so we can connect each wire

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.230
to the switch. When those are in place, and
tightened, we can secure the switch on the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.330
cap, then pull the wires through the bottom
hole. We need to get these wires through the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.110
protective tubing and I found that could be
done by sucking a string through the tube

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.010
first, then attaching the wires to the string.
This way, they pull through the tube easily.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.970
Alright, the tube is in place, and we can
add some hot glue to help keep it there, and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.319
now we're ready to attach the trigger to the
frame. Hot glue goes on the back, and it presses

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.400
into place nicely. I'll add just a little
more glue to fill in the gaps. Ok, it's time

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.470
for a paint job, and I think it will be fun
to use a variety of camouflage paints, so

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.480
I'll hang this up and start attacking it with
4 different colors. I'm letting each layer

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.290
dry before adding the next color, and just
spraying in random patterns for effect. I'll

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.950
add a coat of finish, and when it's dry I
think it looks pretty good. The masking tape

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.040
we used to cover the trigger switch and pneumatic
coupling can all be removed, and then thread

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.110
tape can be added to each of the threaded
connector nipples. We need to make sure these

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.560
are screwed back on fairly tightly because
we don't want any air to leak. Let's add the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.610
in-line sprinkler valve next and then screw
the barrel onto that. The valve wires get

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.310
pulled through the 90 degree joint, and the
elbow presses nicely onto the solenoid casing.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.489
Now it's time to rig up the electrical system.
The ends of each wire need to be sniped to

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.510
size and stripped to expose the bare copper
wire. The other side is made ready by pushing

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.709
the poly tube through the hole in the end
plug that we made earlier. Next, we need to

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.859
wire a 9 volt snap connector in series with
the valve and the switch, and that can be

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.239
done by twisting the ends together. I used
electrical tape to cover the connections and

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.030
it ends up looking like this. Now we can snap
our battery in place, and add hot glue to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.950
hold the tubing inside the plug. When that's
cooled, the wires and battery tuck very comfortably

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.150
up into the casing to shield the battery from
the elements. The system is finished! At this

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.200
point you should have your very own "AK-47
style" compressed air rocket launcher. I'm

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.840
really happy with the way it looks and handles.
I've even made barrel adaptors for shooting

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.360
paintballs and water balloons, and a valve
stem adaptor for hooking up a bike pump for

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.340
anyone who doesn't have an air compressor.
A little pose for the camera, and I'm ready

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.930
to test out one of my 5 cent high pressure
paper rockets. Look for the video on how to

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.050
build those. Alright, all my neighbors are
at work, and the streets are clear so it's

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.830
time to fire. Woah, where did it go? I actually
lost sight of it, but after a few minutes

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.449
of searching, my little boy helped me find
it way down the street almost 300 feet away.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.430
That's nearly the length of a football field!
And it's still in perfect condition, so let's

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.870
shoot it again! I'm firing these at 135PSI,
and they're out of sight every time. Well

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.120
this has far surpassed my expectations. Not
only can it launch rockets completely out

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.770
of sight, but it's portable, customizable,
and can be modified to launch paintballs and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.210
water balloons hundreds of feet! That's it
for now. If you liked this project, perhaps

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.070
