00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.350
So, how do we forget? One reason we forget things is because of interference.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.158
Interference is a disruption of memory because of new information that competes

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:13.625
with information we are trying to recall. Now, there are two types of

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:18.420
interference. One is called retroactive interference. With retroactive

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.767
interference new experiences or information cause people to forget what they've

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:28.024
previously learned or experienced. The second type of interference is proactive

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:32.637
interference. Proactive interference occurs when previously learned information

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:37.162
interferes with the learning of new information. Let's look at an example of an

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:42.886
retroactive interference. First is a learning task. Study psychology. Next, is

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:47.588
a learning task, study sociology. For retroactive interference, we would have

00:00:47.588 --> 00:00:52.610
memory loss for the first task, studying psychology. An example of proactive

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.260
interference would be, first, studying psychology, then learning sociology.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.977
With this, we would have memory loss for studying sociology because it came

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:03.170
second.
