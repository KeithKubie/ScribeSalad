Tomlinson: Hi, my name's
Jason Tomlinson.

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.334
I'm an engineering manager
at Hands-On Mobile.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:05.767
I'm here today
to talk to you

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.300
about an Android application
I've written

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.534
which uses the accelerometer
feature of the platform.

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:11.467
The game is called "Amazed."

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:12.734
The whole idea of the game

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.801
is to navigate a marble
through the maze

00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:17.167
by tilting the device
in various directions.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:18.868
Whatever direction
you tilt the device,

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:20.601
the marble will follow
the same path.

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.968
You have to try
and navigate the marble

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.300
to the light blue area,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.067
which will then
take you to the next level.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.834
As you progress through
the ten levels of the game,

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.701
each level gets
progressively harder,

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.534
until you
get to Level Ten

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.868
which is almost impossible.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.234
So that's the game.

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:37.501
You can find it
open-sourced

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.834
on the Apps for Android
project.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:40.968
While it is only
a simple technical demo,

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.200
I built it to play around
with the accelerometer feature

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.501
of the Android platform.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:46.133
It was born from the fact

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.467
that I was working
on "Guitar Hero: World Tour"

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.334
which we're bringing
to the Android platform,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.400
fully leveraging
all the specific features

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.667
including multiplayer
battle mode,

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.434
so you and your friends
can play against each other

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:57.801
in real time.
