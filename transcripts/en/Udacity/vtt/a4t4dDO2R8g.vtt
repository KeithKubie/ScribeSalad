00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's walk through a possibility together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's handle A times 0.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In such a case, we want to return B

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or the number 0, whichever you prefer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Anything times 0 is 0. [return tree]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the other thing I am supposed to handle is A + 0,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
at which point I just return A.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I could have been more complicated potentially

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and changed the if condition up here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that we're returning A in only 1 place,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but for optimizations, readability is more important.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because we really want to make sure we're getting the right answer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So we've added in support for 2 new optimizations.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And presumably--now you can imagine how if we had a bunch of these

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we could just write them all out here,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or maybe we could have a slightly more concise system

00:00:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
for checking patterns and replacing them.
