00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.970
Mad Max fury road this movie was incredible

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.900
There are movies, and then there's Fury Road

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
It kicked our asses so much, it kicked our mom's asses

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.000
No other film will be better than Fury Road

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was sitting in the theater like this. AWWWWWW!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Fury Road is the greatest film ever and I haven't even seen it yet

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
OH MY GOD! This is the greatest movie I've seen in my life

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is everything you want and more

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Go. Watch. See this movie

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.930
My name is critic

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.050
And my world is Mad Max. As the internet went more bat shit crazy for fury Road

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.569
It was hard to tell who was more Bat shit crazy

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.450
Me or everyone else?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.059
Yes, I am the one who runs from both the fanboys and the haters

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.369
I mean, it's good really good, but is it the masterpiece everyone praises?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.669
Hell, I have to be careful. Even just thinking that can piss off some extreme fanboys out there . . . Oh boy. . .

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.900
What's this we here about you hating Fury Road?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.500
I never said I hated it. I thought it was good.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.000
GOOD?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Don't you know that's the same as saying it's bad?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.830
Just thought it was short on story and not very practical

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.330
GASP!

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.880
Did you hear that In-practical Joe?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.969
It is not above the logical necessity,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.089
But the excuse to display the amazingly

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.970
Action-Packed awesomely awesomeness. We even have a station running 24 hour Mad Max

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.800
Imagery so that the people can see how superior Fury Road is.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800
Honestly, I think Thunder Dome was the best one.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.300
DAH!

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.300
Mediocre! Destroy him my fanboys! Destroy all of his mediocrity!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
Pitch Perfect 2 beats Mad Max at the box office.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300
AHHHHHHHH!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.300
Anna Kendrick is so over rated.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.200
Stop him!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.280
Nobody likes Thunder Dome

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.200
the best in My cave,, house, thingy.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.200
You can't beat Fury Road Raggedy Man.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Even Master Blaster thinks it's better.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.100
Fury Road better! Thunder Dome weak! Fury Road better! Thunder Dome weak!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100
DAAHHHHHHHH!

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.800
Drive!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.100
Worst braces ever.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.000
Just drive!

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.900
Says who?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.900
My foot!

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.800
Treason! Betrayal! An enjoy-er of Thunder Dome!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Ride my beloved fanboys.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.200
Show them a world of excessive testosterone.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
DAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.400
Watch it!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400
You watch it!

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.400
You'r with me.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400
AHHHHHHH!

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.000
Here. apply a never fully explained silver chrome.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Tihs isn't chrome, it's cake glaze.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Oh, what a glaze. What a lovely glaze!

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.170
Yeah, that's one we're going with. Blow me.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.100
Hang on!

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.229
Does Tom Hardy always have to wear shit on his face? Aah! fucking Fury Road

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.900
What you didn't like it?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900
No, I did like it. It was good action, and it was a great rush.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
But, why does that make a masterpiece?

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.500
Oh, so you're one of those first two films people.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.500
Actually, I liked Thunder Dome the best.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.100
Did Tina Turner's popularity drop recently?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100
Sorry, but nobody likes Thunder Dome the best.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100
What is with everybody's hatred of Thunder Dome?

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.100
We'll just sit here until you take it back.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.000
What's your name?

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.600
Curiosa.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.400
Curiosa, aren't you "Curious" how I can like Thunder Dome more than the other films, even Fury Road

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.400
Just keep driving, and I'll explain.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400
well . . .

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400
Mad Max never hit number one at the box office.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400
Dah! Fine.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.389
We're running low on fuel. Boost the engine with some intense fast motion stairs.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.300
AHHHHHHHHHHH!

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.300
Hey, wait a minute.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.800
Okay, so we know the Mad Max movies take place in an apocalyptic future where ex-cop Max loses his family.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.700
In Fury Road, he saves the abuse wives of a religious dictator who controls on the water.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.600
It also gives us, arguably, some of the best action in movie history.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.100
Right.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.600
But does that and an adrenaline rush equal a great film?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.200
you do have a penis don't you?

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.720
Okay, but on 96% rotten tomatoes great?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.700
Oh. God 96% that's awesome

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.649
Yeah, until you realize that according to the critics, that technically means. It's better than pulp fiction,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.759
Fargo, Jurassic Park, Exorcist, Die Hard, Hunt for Red October,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.930
Terminator 2,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.980
And every, Indiana Jones movie .

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.900
really?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.010
I think people got so hyped up on the adrenaline that they forgot

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.010
It's just a simple Chase movie.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.200
And what makes your precious Thunder Dome less mediocre?

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.689
Because the chase is only the climax. The rest is character, story and unforgettable lines.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.899
Who said the first two films didn't have memorable lines?

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.510
Name one right now

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.100
Oh, what a lovely . . .

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.020
That's Fury Road

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.200
Witness me.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.000
Fury Road

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Hmm, let me see.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.760
It's Fury Road isn't it. Yes it is. Now, quote some lines from thunderdome.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.519
Oh, I know. raggedy man. Who Runs Bartertown?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.860
Master-Blaster. Two men enter, one man leaves

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.660
Exactly, you remember it more because it was more engaging. It broke up the action with good writing and twists and turns

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.320
It was just better storytelling.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.200
Hey, just because we don't have a lot of "talking" doesn't mean we're not telling our story.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.753
We're telling our story through strong visuals and through strong acting.

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:30.160
Oh, come on. The acting is good, but . . .

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.559
Tell me what I'm thinking by just looking at my stairs.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.980
You're on a mission, and you're not gonna fail.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.439
Right, and this one?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.900
sigh.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.120
You're afraid what's gonna happen to the hoes just swore to protect.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.749
You got it, and this one?

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.749
JESUS!

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.749
AHHHHHHHH!

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.749
Get back here, you fucking nut!

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.000
Crap! Hand me another exploding stick!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.300
We have a big bazooka?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.000
Explodig stick!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
AAAHHHHHHH!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Under the seat, under the seat.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
AHHH! I can't find it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Look in the box that says "Exploding sticks".

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I never learned how to read!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.660
They're gaining on us!

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.800
no. I was doing remourse.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.169
No. I mean they're gaining on us!

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
Yeah.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.409
What the hell is that?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.520
Oh?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.940
That's weird ass guitar guy.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.339
No, I mean who is he? where does he come from? Why is he have a Blindfold on?

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:42.159
I don't know. I don't know and because he has so much testosterone that his eyes shoot shark-shaped explosions.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.720
Okay, that's exactly what I'm talking about. As fucking awesome as that is, nothing about it is explained

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.400
Who are the people on the stilts in the swamp?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.819
What is the basis behind this crazy cult religion?

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:01.900
Who are the people he hallucinates about? His family, people he let die or are they just hallucinations?

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.700
None of this has ever talked about

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.500
It doesn't need to be talked about. Here.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500
Will you watch the fucking road?

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.200
Weird Ass Guitar Guy!

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.000
Unleash your blinded rage!

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.300
Are those dinosaur missiles?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.300
RUHR!

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:34.619
So a lazy film gives you a blank page. Something you've seen a million times. and film trying too hard gives you too much

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.620
so you can't make it out?

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.079
Fury Road doesn't give you all the information, but it lets you see it for what it is.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.139
It allows you to become more engaged because you can you connect all the dots.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.270
Like how I'm not quite connecting how  these fucking dinosaur missiles flying at me just seems like something this crazy ass world would create?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.420
Exactly, just because there's no details doesn't mean there's no answers.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.870
Ow.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.050
Speaking of answers how the hell is he constantly missing Us?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.050
How the Hell are you constantly missing them?

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.050
What are you blind?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.000
Folded

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
Well then sniff them out and send them to Valhalla or

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.740
Whatever the hell, we believe in

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.560
Oh, crap.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.480
What is it?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.040
It's more enemies to keep the energy hide?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.890
Why's that bad? I thought you loved that

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.060
there menanists.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.679
Can you believe they gave a gun to a chick in this movie?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.700
Tell me about it. I'm man tweeting right now to let the internet know my disgust.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.380
That's the manly thing to do.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.560
Hell Yeah!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.600
They act like they're being discriminated against when a woman wants to do something that a man does.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.669
We have that it was called the 40s.

00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:34.439
Well. They're not very good at growing up.

00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:36.130
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.680
Well, it's got to be better than our other friends here.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.983
More meninist?

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:42.030
No Tom hardy fan girls

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.030
EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.900
They're women who think Tom hardy is the second coming of christ for some reason.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.600
Really I mean he's a good actor, but who would go crazy over him?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.050
probably someone who spends their whole entire life obsessing over fan bases.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.050
Hey Critic!

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.771
Punch Line? I mean Hyper?

00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:04.000
I found a new calling Critic. converting everyone to the miracle of Tom hardy.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.100
Oh praise He.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.119
Well, I'm glad you found something more sensible.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.800
It's about time the world saw an incredible talent he is.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.720
And you don't think any of that stems from mere physical attraction?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.220
No, no, since he's a feminist. It would be hypocritical to love him just for his looks.

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:22.780
Well mark Ruffalo's a feminist.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.780
NEEEAHHHH!

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.220
Patrick Stewart's a feminist.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.410
NEEEAHHH! He's bald.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.410
Louis C K's a feminist.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.410
NEEEAHHH! He's even balder.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.100
but Tom loves dogs,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.500
The Tom loves dogs.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.869
Do you know hard it t is to find a man who likes dogs?

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:43.500
Look, whatever your attraction, you can't act like Tom hardy's one of the best things in this movie.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.599
Don't get me wrong.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:55.459
He does a fine job. He does just as well as Gibson, but for his minimal dialogue and mostly dubbed over lines That are strangely more obvious than when he did Bane, he's serviceable at best.

00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:58.340
Which is really all what Max is supposed to be anyway.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.039
But the work of his body? I mean, the body of his work?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.000
Yeah! You tell those Femanazi's

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:08.300
Yeah. Max is barely in the film. He's spent half the time letting some broad to all the fighting.

00:11:09.058 --> 00:11:09.900
yeah

00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:16.128
So, you're saying what the rest of the world sees as the manliest movie ever made, you see as being too girly?

00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:17.040
Man Yeah!

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.100
It's a disgrace to everything that Mad Max stands for.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.900
yeah!

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:27.629
Well, that's Interesting,  because there is a Mad Max movie where he appears even less in it and spends most of the time talking about his feelings.

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:28.840
Really? which one?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.409
The original you fucking moron!

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:37.159
In proportion of the running time, Mad Max appears less on-screen in the first film than he does in Fury Road.

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:43.879
He doesn't even do anything that violent until the final third. On top of that much, like every George Miller film, the least

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:51.019
interesting character is always the main character. It's the environment that always takes center stage. Max is merely the observer.

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:54.198
It's like saying you wanted more Alice in Alice in Wonderland.

00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:54.819
It's just not how it works.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.329
yeah.

00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:01.399
But he's working with a woman and even taking orders from her and Max never does that.

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:06.019
Oh, you mean like in Thunder Dome when he specifically goes to a woman saying" I'm looking for a job."

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:07.425
"Please give me orders."

00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:08.479
You actually liked

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:10.319
Thunder Dome

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:13.519
Look, imagine for a minute that Charlize Theron's character wasn't a woman.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.910
NEVER!

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.788
We're way too close-Minded for that.

00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:18.803
Well, let's pretend that you pretended.

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:22.160
Max used to have friends in the police force before he went rogue

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.619
So the idea of him being able to work with someone again is actually kind of uplifting for Max's character.

00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:33.019
He spend so much of the other movies just doing everything alone that to finally find someone to work by his side,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.199
you could argue gives a link back to his humanity.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.580
Actually, it brought something to the character that's relatively new

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.820
But that doesn't coincide with the teachings of our one true leader.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.600
Oh, and who is your one true leader?

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.169
Michael Bay, the Master of Action here.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.970
And now Critic, as we all know if you really wanted this to be a manly movie

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:02.089
you make it at least three more hours long and the women should be draped across the cars, not driving them.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.620
That's like me showing female military in the movie, you all know it's never Gonna happen.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:17.400
And I can make out way too much what was going on. Clearly the cars should have been computer generated instead of the background. You had it the other way around.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.560
I Imagine you're driving while those computer-generated cars now aren't you?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.180
well yes I do, but why would you want to know . . .

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.030
John.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820
Autobots, transform

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.480
AHHHHHH!

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.629
Oh dear now. I'll never see the flower show.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.000
What was that?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.500
I don't know if I have a sudden need to compensate even more bring me the giant Swingy stick thing!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.510
I feel like our weaponry is to stick heavy.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.010
Stick me!

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.010
AHHHHHHHHH!

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.830
Hey, Skeletremor.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.679
I think I figured out a way to get on that car and BLOW them to smithereens

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:55.900
Destroy the Mediocre critic and his mediocre mind and I myself will carry you into the premiere of the next Mad Max movie.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900
Oh, you don't need to do that. I just like killing stuff.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.500
You will walk the red carpet. Sugared and glazed. Now, out you go

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500
AHHHHHHHHH!

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.800
Grossly Inadequate for the task at hand!

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:20.640
UHG!

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.080
They're too far gone. I guess I shouldn't have milked that slow mo shot

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.569
But at least it gave the audience a chance to catch their breath. You good? great. Back to the action.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.400
Oh My God, are you Devil Boner?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.200
You're like the manliest man got a men.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.900
yeah I am. But who are you?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.400
we're menanists.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.517
We stand up for our right to be men.

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:47.869
Hey, now that's a cause I can get behind.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.800
Scoot over. So what manly thing to do? you play football or you build muscle?

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.160
No, we make rent videos.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.700
What?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.680
I have two youtube subscribers. Of courses these guys.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.320
you

00:15:16.279 --> 00:15:18.600
So if Thunder Dome's your favorite which one's your least favorite?

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:25.900
well, I love them all but if I have to answer the question, it used to be the first one. But now with Fury Road, it might be Road Warrior.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.109
Wow, those are the two that people likes the most.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.900
I mean, the comment section is already planning your death,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.969
But to Fury Roads credit, it kind of changed everything.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:45.609
Each movie had their own distinct feel. the first a low-budget exploitation film Thunder Dome low survival flick and Road Warrior a chase movie. But the problem is Fury Road is a chase movie too.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:52.690
They both focus on the action and stunts rather than twists and turns in the story because Fury Road is so much better.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.539
There's barely a reason to even watch Road Warrior now.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.346
It just feels like a slower version of Fury Road,

00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:01.210
But it was the first one to give mad max its style.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.770
That is true.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:11.829
Road Warrior is considered by many to be the first "real" Mad Max movie in that it takes place in the desert and focuses more on the action-packed loner.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.729
The first one is a revenge story and even then not until the very end.

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:20.420
Story wise and stylistically, it has the least amount to do with the others

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.439
Actually, seeing as the movies are called mad Max and he never really seems that mad, maybe all the other movies are in his head.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.140
Actually, that kind of makes sense.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.060
I wrote a fanfiction about that.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.270
BANG

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:38.379
Maybe he went nuts after his wife and kid died. In many respects the film's do kind of keep repeating themselves.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:47.739
There's always a tyrant. there's always a group of people he doesn't want to save but gets shoehorned into doing so. there's often religious figures, gang culture pigs an old woman with a shotgun.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:55.930
A wild kid or kids and no places that look anything like the first movie. They even use the same actors in different roles.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.720
Truth be told it's actually not that bad a theory.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.930
great. So does that mean you've accepted hardy as your one true Max?

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.700
I'm sorry, but I still think Thunder Dome is better.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.439
Oh

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.240
Really?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.200
With all the other films, you knew it was gonna be in the first few minutes. With Thunder Dome it kept you guessing.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.719
It changed up locations, it threw in new characters, and it wasn't all one big chase.

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:18.960
What the Hell was that?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.100
I think Impractical Joe is impractically using is impractical swinging sticks.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.909
You will walk the red carpet, sugared and glazed.

00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:27.459
You will walk the red carpet, sugared and glazed.

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:29.459
You will walk the red carpet, sugared and glazed.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900
Look, it's raining men.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.900
Hallelujah.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.979
Popsicle! I'm out of fanboys to launch!

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.300
JESUS FUCK!

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.350
I'm not okay.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.840
Wonder if the menanists are having this much fun?

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.400
And how dare George Miller have all the male penguins and Happy Feet stay with the kids.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.030
Yeah!

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.559
While all the women penguins did all the hunting.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.238
Because that's what penguins do!

00:18:02.238 --> 00:18:03.759
Well they should change that.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.980
Women ruin everything like in Mad Max.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:13.100
So it's that's all you guys do? You just sit around complain how you hate hot women you want see more shirtless buff man?

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.200
Man! Yeah!

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.230
Are you guys gay?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.200
I mean, it's fine if you are, but you clearly got some anger issues you need to address.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.100
No, we're we're not anti-gay.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.157
No, no, no. We're very fair in our hatred.

00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:29.440
Yeah, it's just women we hate.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.950
Yeah!

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.489
We've had hundreds of years of advantage and we're not giving it up now.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.455
Let's go watch Pain and Gain. That's a straight movie.

00:18:37.455 --> 00:18:38.950
Oh, I do a commentary on that.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.940
Extend the mechanical claws of Grabbiness!

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.620
Oh right. There's nobody left. Just me.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.160
I'm sorry, but Furi Road is just one big chase, and I can't see what's so brilliant about that . . .

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:09.310
My God, I see now. I get it. I know why Fury Road is a Brilliant film.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:16.360
It finally hit me. I know now not only why it's genius, but as the most ingenious out of all the Mad Max movies.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.190
Why?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.679
Don't you see what this is? Don't you see what this all is?

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.460
Meep meep.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.319
A Roadrunner cartoon? What are you talking about?

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:37.440
The Roadrunner cartoons have lasted for years. With little to no dialogue, quickly identifiable characters and nothing but chases.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:47.590
People see it as classic because it's so minimal and yet so interesting. It says so much with just a few clever choices. Fury Road is the same way.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.900
Just because it's all one big Chase doesn't mean that isn't smart and it doesn't mean that It's not a game-changer.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.900
As much as I love Thunder Dome ,there are a few scenes that are kind of boring and I can skip.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.680
But with fury Road, I can't imagine skipping any of it.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:10.220
It's all amazing to witness. From the music to the action to cutting out anything that's simply not needed.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.422
It gets Right to what people want to see and keeps them there throughout the entire flick.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:18.420
I can hardly think of any other field that did that throughout the entire thing

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.960
you were right,  you've always been right. Fury Road is the better Flick.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.960
Hey, Impractical Joe, I . . .

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.900
I don't think he wants to listen.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.120
Hang on.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.900
BANG! BANG! BANG

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900
Hey! Whoa, Ah! Cut it out!

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.900
Ugh! You whore! You Mediocwhore!

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.100
Sharp turn

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100
Whoa! Hardy save me!

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.790
And that's my Sammack's should have been a man.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.000
What are you doing?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I have an idea.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.159
I can't see a thing with this on. I'm just gonna take it off.

00:20:57.659 --> 00:21:03.900
I am the redeemer! I am the savior! I . . .

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.900
Am in deep shit.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.900
CAB-LAM!

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.960
Well, that's something I didn't think I would see today.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.460
HEY!

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.680
I forgot about national insecurity.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.809
They can't have a woman do that. You should have let that Critic do it.

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:30.700
Yeah!

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.300
Wait, I know how to shut them the fuck up.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.510
Stop the car!

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.900
WHOA!

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.640
Everybody out!

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.060
Go out there.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.060
What?

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.989
Trust me they're meninists. Just go out there.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.180
Boy, we're gonna show them.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.900
UM!

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.680
Wait.  You have actually talked to a woman before right?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
UM!

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.380
You want to go out? Oh?

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.820
OH THANK GOD!

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.478
If I had to listen to these pussies one more time, I was gonna shoot my balls off!

00:22:15.478 --> 00:22:16.460
Thank God. You stopped

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.329
We really needed a pee break.

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:21.133
Hey look! Devil Boner's on her side. Traitor!

00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:22.130
You ain't no man.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.100
Yeah!

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.293
And you are? Christ! If you're the future of what being a man is, slap a fucking vagina on me!

00:22:28.293 --> 00:22:31.720
I'd rather be a bad ass like her than whiny little bitches like you!

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:38.329
Hey, here's a thought. If you have to complain about how someone's stealing your manhood, chances are you've never had your manhood to begin with!

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.680
What are you five?

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.039
You're afraid you're gonna get cooties? And how's that working out for you anyway?

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:50.000
Are women just falling at your feet because you bitch and complain about them online? Real chick magnet guys! You must get laid a lot!

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:59.029
You know what, keep living in your mama's basement. Because the grown-ups are gonna make the more bad ass world and we don't need your cry baby tears pussing it up!

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.710
Are you single?

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.460
I could be.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.740
And now a message from the President of the United States.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:16.300
My fellow Americans. In light of the recent meninist movement, all female Soldiers Shall be immediately removed because women shouldn't be fighters or saving men.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.900
Yeah! Now that's what I'm talking about.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.280
Really?

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.680
Instead, all female soldiers are to be replaced with meninists.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.880
Yea . . . huh?

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.420
Seeing us how they complain that only men should do the fighting they're to take their place and be deployed immediately.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.260
Guess what guys, I just got a new job.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.780
NOOOOOOOO!

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.640
Thus, all female Soldiers Shall be rewarded the Tom Hardy movie Marathon.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.080
YAY!

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.320
Who, as we all know is a method actor.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.960
Ugh. I didn't know that...

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.920
So uh, are you a feminist?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.380
I'm whatever you want me to be.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.740
(Applause)

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.500
It's over.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.240
Everyone's cheering because we destroyed him practical Joe and all is right in the world.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.000
Wait. That's it? He didn't have any followers or anything like that?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.080
It's kind like the death star once it's gone you don't really question the logistics of it.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.320
Oh.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:27.740
Well I've learned what a phenomenal film Fury Road truly is and that it has earned its place rightfully in film history.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.370
Hey, that reminds me.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.250
What is your name anyways?

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.029
Critic. My name is Critic.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.180
Boy, that wasn't as shocking as I thought it was gonna be.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.180
Yeah it's the title. I don't know why we thought that would be such a big deal.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.600
Well, why don't you just end things in a typical Fury Road way?

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.520
Oh, you mean with a visual that seems half assed, but it's actually bad ass?

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.460
Yep.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.980
You will walk the red carpet, sugar the glazed.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.829
Hey, everybody Doug walker here doing the charity shout out sadly

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.210
I don't have any video for you this time

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:50.069
But I do have pictures and I'm even in a few of them and speaking of which

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:53.580
Do you like comics or Manga if you're watching me you probably do

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.889
This charity is actually for the Carolina Manga library

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:04.170
This is a traveling charity that tries to raise awareness and teach literacy

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.530
through Mangas and comic books they travel from

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.120
Kanaka they travel from school to school

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.859
They do all sorts of various events and pretty much the idea is to teach you reading through manga and comic books because a lot

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.280
of people don't see that as

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.309
Reading and of course it is you can also get some wonderful artwork you can find out new ways of discovering

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.770
storytelling and this very much is

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.010
Allowing people adults and kids alike to find a place where they can read some of their favorite stories

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.710
Donate books if you would like and help spread awareness that reading is important everyone needs to do it

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:43.559
And it only makes you smarter and more creative they have access to tons and tons of comics and Mangas

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.779
