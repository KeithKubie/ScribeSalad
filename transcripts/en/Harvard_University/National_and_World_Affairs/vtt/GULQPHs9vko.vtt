My mother was a uh... Italian immigrant
at the time she was married had to come here

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.599
two years before my dad even though they were
married

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.579
and she was working on a factory in Cambridge

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:12.849
and uh...

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.070
and then uh...  Kennedy I think was running
for Congress at the time and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.259
uh... was given a speech to the factory workers

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.529
and she was wispearing something for her friend
and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.310
JFK asked a friend

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.339
what did your friend say

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.219
and my mom, my mom's friend reply cause
my mom couldn't speak any english she wanna know

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.290
why she's married

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.500
was able to come to this country when her husband couldent
come over

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.280
and JFK reply something along the lines
that it was a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.340
it was something he was aware

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.379
and uh... and it was

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.140
something he was focused on two bring
to bring family togethers and allow immigrants the same opportunity

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.640
in this country that immigrants for generations
had had at that time

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.810
and uh... something a story that i
didn't know till a few years back

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.730
that my mother stills retells today 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.040
my dad would tell me that as new people to this
country

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.810
that he felt that they were inspired by his

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.020
caring and compassion for all mankind and
all people all citizens than people want to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.920
play positive role in in in this country and
they felt like he protected them

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.800
and and for many italian immigrants uh... and
I some Italian immigrants that was very inspirational

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.930
I often tell people you know I like being the mayor but 
I love doing the job I love doing the job

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.409
because i feel like to make a difference as
mayor

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.950
to make my community better place to live
work play and raise a family in and those

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.160
are JFK's words ringing true in my mind

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.520
that's the service

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.090
not the position that's greatness

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.909
and you could take it in to different perspective 
I can achieve greatness by being elected

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.890
or I can achieve greatness 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.690
by doing the service and its the service

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.090
that moves me every day
