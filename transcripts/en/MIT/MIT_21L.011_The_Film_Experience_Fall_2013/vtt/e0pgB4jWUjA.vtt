00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.140
DAVID THORBURN: One of the ways
that the study of literature

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.120
and the study of film
differs from the study

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.360
of technical things, and
the reason I teach it,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.530
is that it belongs to
everyone, that it's

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.190
valuable for everyone.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.810
Not everyone needs to know
about quantum mechanics.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.800
But I believe everyone should.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.890
And if they don't, I feel
they're impoverished.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
Know how to read a good
story, enjoy plays,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.450
know how to enjoy the movies.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.450
So I feel that what
I'm giving my students

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.022
is, in some sense, something
even more valuable to them

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:34.730
because it will be
something that they'll

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.271
have with them for their whole
lives and their whole careers.

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:41.570
One of the things MIT
students often do not realize,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.160
is that a very
large number of them

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.630
do not end up making
their living in the areas

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.170
in which they majored.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.380
But all of them end up
wanting to go to the movies.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.300
All of them end up
with the capacity

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.400
to read and enjoy literature.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.460
And I hope that coming
out of my classes,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.380
they'll do those
things with greater joy

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.012
and with greater intelligence.

00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:01.470
One of the things
I hope all of you

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.450
will have when you come
out of this course,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.430
is a much more confident sense
of how to look at movies,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.290
not to spoil your enjoyment
of kicking back and looking

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.800
at a stupid Schwarzenegger
entertainment

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.440
if you want to, not to make
you feel guilty about that,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.820
but to make you be able
to tell the difference

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.260
between something like that and
what I'll call a work of art.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.520
Implicit in my film
course is an admiration

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.800
for a certain kind
of achievement,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.130
and admiration for a
certain kind of artist,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.727
and artist like Jean
Renoir, the great filmmaker.

00:01:31.727 --> 00:01:34.060
If I were deprived of the
pleasure of seeing Boudu again

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.330
for the rest of my
days, I would never

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.420
forget that grass, that
dust, and their relationship

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.460
to the liberty of a tramp.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.170
The point of this
exercise is to remind you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.770
of the immense
power, the potency,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.950
of even a single camera move.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.660
Think what that 180 degree pan
suggests as Bazin brilliantly

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.910
argues for us.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.000
So the conclusion then is that
the visual style of a film,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.690
or of certain films anyway,
can express a moral vision.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.470
And by moral vision, I
don't mean moralistic,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.270
what's didactic right
and wrong, but a vision

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.700
of having to do with the
values and assumptions

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.220
you make about the
nature of the world.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.750
There's a moral vision
implicit in the tentativeness,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.980
the hesitancy, the
retarding impulse

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.530
to dwell and linger on
things in Renoir's camera,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.290
and in the basic habits
of poetic realism

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.820
that you will see
brilliantly embodied

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.130
in the film you're going to
watch tonight, Grand Illusion.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.810
Because I want to set up, as a
candidate for their admiration,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.760
and alternative to Wall
Street, an alternative

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.500
to entrepreneurial genius.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.660
I admire Jean Renoir's genius,
Or Orson Welle's genius,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.140
or James Joyce's
genius universes

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.390
more than I admire
what entrepreneurs-- I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.820
respect what entrepreneurs do.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.720
But I am in awe of
what great artists do,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.385
and of what great doctors do,
while we're on the subject.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:19.180
Which, I'm uneasy about
the extent to which even

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.600
within MIT's
culture, we've become

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.630
so preoccupied by
what we might call

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.040
commercial or financial success,
instead of the kind of lasting

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.540
success that great art, or
the practice of medicine,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.850
or the practice of
nursing, or dare I say it,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.832
the practice of teaching,
might also embody.
