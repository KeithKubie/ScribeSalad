hello I'm gravity a student of
 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.030
hello I'm gravity a student of
electronics and communication your

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
electronics and communication your
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.800
electronics and communication your
invention has been successfully

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
invention has been successfully
 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.410
invention has been successfully
implemented in mp3 players and other

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420

things how do you feel when you see that

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
things how do you feel when you see that
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.270
things how do you feel when you see that
your inventions have had immediate

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
your inventions have had immediate
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.040
your inventions have had immediate
applications yes a good question what I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
applications yes a good question what I
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.769
applications yes a good question what I
feel is that science and research walk

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779
feel is that science and research walk
 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.240
feel is that science and research walk
this is my main conclusions I was not

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
this is my main conclusions I was not
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189
this is my main conclusions I was not
completely convinced at the beginning of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
completely convinced at the beginning of
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.709
completely convinced at the beginning of
the carrier but now I see that this

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
the carrier but now I see that this
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.520
the carrier but now I see that this
research works well and that means that

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530
research works well and that means that
 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.549
research works well and that means that
you can start you mind some scenario

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
you can start you mind some scenario
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.080
you can start you mind some scenario
with electron spins you can be skeptical

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
with electron spins you can be skeptical
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.000
with electron spins you can be skeptical
at the beginning that finally I saw that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
at the beginning that finally I saw that
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.819
at the beginning that finally I saw that
after this abstract construction in the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
after this abstract construction in the
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.979
after this abstract construction in the
mind can become concrete experiments and

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
mind can become concrete experiments and
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.709
mind can become concrete experiments and
finally concrete device that everybody

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
finally concrete device that everybody
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.760
finally concrete device that everybody
use in the shops in the interest rate on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
use in the shops in the interest rate on
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.380
use in the shops in the interest rate on
computer or elsewhere so my feeling is

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390
computer or elsewhere so my feeling is
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.020
computer or elsewhere so my feeling is
that the research is a powerful tool do

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
that the research is a powerful tool do
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.260
that the research is a powerful tool do
and that transforming or the product of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
and that transforming or the product of
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.780
and that transforming or the product of
your imagination in device that you can

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
your imagination in device that you can
