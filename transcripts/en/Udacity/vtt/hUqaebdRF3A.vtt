00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.670
All right, so
we've brought back in Jonathan,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.180
to talk a little bit more about
how to move forward with InVision,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.470
making better prototypes.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.690
To start with, how would you go about
making a higher fidelity prototype,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.050
than our current sort of
clickable prototype in InVision?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.350
&gt;&gt; Sure, there's a couple of
ways that you can do this Jay.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.780
The first way is,
we have this option called overlays, so

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.950
you can make a modal window or
a drop down menu.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.930
And you simply basically need to
mock up a section of your screen, or

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.350
an image of the section of your screen,
and upload that as a separate screen.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.660
And InVision will allow you to
use that screen as an overlay

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.430
on top of any existing screen,
so that would be one method.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.960
Another method is you can use advanced
animations through animated gifs.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.670
An animated gif we accept in InVision,
so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.540
that you can demonstrate
in advanced interaction.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.260
&gt;&gt; Right, so as an example,
our current like navigation drawer,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.620
we could use that as an overlay and

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.560
it would just sort of show up
actually on top of the other screens.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.020
&gt;&gt; Sure, that's a great example.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.960
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.223
So what are some other tools
within InVision that we can use

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:09.968
to sort of make better prototypes,
what other options are there?

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:14.832
&gt;&gt; Sure, there are a number of
different options in InVision that

00:01:14.832 --> 00:01:17.600
allow you to share out the project.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.454
To see the workflow or the progress of
your screens as you move it through,

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:26.110
the time or
the life cycle of your project.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.510
We also have a feature called boards
that allows you to showcase your

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.720
designs in different formats.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.160
So for example, if you have a prototype
that you have in a website.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.440
But then you also want to
display it in a mobile phone or

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.980
a tablet, you can display
all those in a single ward.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.800
&gt;&gt; Right.
Okay.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.670
That makes perfect sense.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.699
And then are there best practices for

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:53.820
doing user research with these
clickable InVision prototypes?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.760
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.660
The best practice is to
turn off hotspot hinting.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.017
That's an advanced feature,
when you share out of ShareLink.

00:02:03.017 --> 00:02:07.155
So when you click the ShareLink button,
there's an advanced option that

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:11.240
allows you to then turn off hotspot
hinting or prevent hotspot hinting.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.100
&gt;&gt; This allows a user to then, view the
prototype either on a mobile device or

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.880
on a desktop computer And
click around interact.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.160
But they're not prompted with
your hotspots, because otherwise,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.550
you'll get feedback that may not
necessarily be natural or organic.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.645
&gt;&gt; Right.
because you'll have maybe a tiny

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:32.620
hotspot.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.560
But if it's brought out in blue and
the user is like, oh, well,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.530
clearly that's a thing because it's
a bright blue square over this image.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.250
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.990
Yeah.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.220
Preventing those sort of prompts or
tips to the user is always best,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.240
because you want the user to
give you the most natural

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.977
feedback that they would otherwise,
give you in a normal environment.

00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:56.320
&gt;&gt; Right, you don't want to optimize
this app for being shown in this format,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.210
you want to optimize the app for
being used.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.260
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.995
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:01.920
Thanks for coming in and
giving us so much insight.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.630
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.
