It's all about Alex Rodriguez and the steroids scandal and a w one of the guys in it as a fake doctor who would wear a stethoscope around his neck. Like he got his, he got his degree in some Janky overseas university and wasn't legal to practice medicine in the United States, but he would call himself a doctor and he had like the stethoscope that you'd wear. Well, and his office, he'd walk around with a stethoscope around his neck, like hanging around his neck. I just think he's going to check your heart meatball. All he's doing is prescribing steroids cause it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:54          This kid that was walking around, he posed as a doctor and had multiple patients and got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember this is in Florida, the same play I guess in Florida too. It must be pretty easy. Of course it's in Florida. Is this name? Does his name say Malakai? Uh, yeah, like a creepy name. That's like children of the corn that's like, how do you pronounce that? Malika Malakai. Yeah, that's, that is ballsy. Do W wait a minute. That's not his real name. Mary Malakai Love Robinson. Why not? That sounds like a character from like some sort of porno. There he is. Dr Malakai, a Fasti Fasti, h h p Dash c a m p dash CV death or all those things, HIV. What are all those other things that he is a health care proxy? Maybe some bullshit amp. I don't know what the hell that sounds like a gas station in Kansas.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Let's read his, his thing let's says is a well doctor Malakai a love Robinson is a well rounded professional that treats and cares for patients using a system of practice at basis, treatment on physiological functions and abnormal conditions on natural laws governing the human body. That doesn't even, that's a run on sentence. You missed it. Hold on a second. Docs would love. Robinson utilizes physiological, electrical and mechanical methods such as air, water, light, heat, earth, photo therapy, food and herbs, therapy, psychotherapy, electro therapy, physio therapy, mechano therapy, natural path corrections and manipulation and natural methods or modalities together with natural medicines, natural process foods and herbs and nature's remedies. Cool. Oh, what you just said? The only thing that was true about that was manipulation. Well, how is this guy like who, who read that and went, all right. Yeah, we're in. Yeah. Who read that was like, I need to make an appointment.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Immediately found the real doctor. All this other bullshit doctors that don't use manipulation. One doctor goes like this in a photo. All of them. Now imagine that became the new thing. I would not go to that doctor. Huh? Get offices. So someone had to like rent him the spot. So they believed them too. Not just the patient or he at least had an off a office, like an office guy whose dad could have a bullshitter that pretends to be a doctor, actually gets patients. It's got a stethoscope. Got a website. Isn't that good? It's good enough that he's got patients like it actually worked. Like imagine being so crazy that you tell everybody you're a doctor. You don't know shit about biomedical medical practices. You know, you read his little bio there and you get offices and then you get patients, you treating patients.
