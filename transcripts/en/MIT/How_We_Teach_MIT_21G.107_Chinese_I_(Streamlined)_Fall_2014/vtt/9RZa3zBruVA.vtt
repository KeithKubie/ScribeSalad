00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.650
MIN-MIN LIANG: So my philosophy
of teaching Chinese-- well

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
it's a very interesting
process because when I started,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.510
I knew one method.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.010
And I thought that was
the best in the world,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.700
to do drill instruct-- drill
the students all the time,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.920
make them repeat.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.320
But throughout the
years, I realized

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.590
they can say certain
things, but they could not

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.440
have a conversation.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.460
So they can do well on tests.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.880
It doesn't mean they can
go and have a conversation.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.310
So I think I've
evolved, and right now I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.670
think the main
philosophy for me is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.950
to have a welcoming
environment to help students

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.840
to speak the language, not
to talk about the language.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.650
So that's my current
philosophical idea.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.430
So everything I do
is to carry this

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.455
out and create an environment
for this philosophy.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.030
So I did a lot right
for the past few years.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
I started changing,
and I did a lot--

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.830
they said scaffolding
instructions and very

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.750
student-centered instruction.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.650
I used to be very
teacher-centered.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.830
Which is very efficient.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.730
Don't get me wrong.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.360
It's a very effective tool.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.230
You kept the students
on their toes.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.630
They have to
[INAUDIBLE] right away.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.510
And I got this
evaluation one year.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.150
And they said, oh, the
teacher is incredible.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.700
She was so good, but I wish
I can learn how to speak.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.720
I was like, what does that mean?

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.250
And you spoke well.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.420
And I realized he was
doing the drill pattern.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.970
He can say a certain
sentence when I asked

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.330
him to say and repeat after me.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.940
But have him to have
a natural conversation

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.860
was really difficult.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.229
So that dawned on me.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.940
I start changing.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.610
And I try to attend
conference and workshop,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.840
not related to just
teaching Chinese.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480
More like how to educate people.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.570
More education and how to create
an environment for all students

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.060
to feel safe.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.090
So I adapt those philosophies
in my course, too.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.610
So my philosophy is a
welcoming environment.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.370
That means building a
community for students

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.830
to feel very safe to speak the
language in this community.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.900
They're not afraid
to make mistakes.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.010
And they'll always
volunteer their opinions.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.980
That's my goal.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.820
The first step.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.310
As I said, my philosophy is to
create a welcoming environment,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.150
to build a community.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.200
So for example, recently--
two years ago-- I

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.170
went to a workshop called
Responsive Classroom.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.280
Responsive Classroom is
geared to K through 12.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.240
It's more treating the
younger kids-- try to get rid

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.544
of the behavior issue.

00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:29.210
I don't need to do
that in my classroom.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.640
But I think the strategy
of theirs actually works.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.840
First thing they do
is building community.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.810
So for example, I do the
first week of my course--

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.040
and these are hard to learn.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.470
They already know how to speak.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.730
But they are so
embarrassed with them

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.850
because they would tell
me, my pronunciation bad.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.670
I don't speak to anybody
else, only to my parents.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.840
I don't want to speak
in the classroom.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.620
So basically, I do the greeting.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.090
The very easy things
they're comfortable with.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.500
For instance, they talk about
their name, what their major,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.770
they can all speak
these in Chinese.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.020
So what I do is the
first day like that.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.340
And then start it-- I
build into a routine.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.300
So every class I spend five
to 10 minutes every day--

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.380
we call greet-- every
class, not every day.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.050
We don't have a everyday
class-- called greeting.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.980
Basically I ask everybody to
write their name on the card.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.260
So I collect the card.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.600
I put the card in the
middle of the classroom.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.060
I would start because I
need to model what it means.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.870
So I will pick up
a student's card.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.450
For instance, I
say, oh, Sarah Ling.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.130
OK and I call her
in her Chinese name.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.420
And I would start saying,
how are you today?

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.410
What did you do last night?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.240
Stuff like that.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.870
Daily life things.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.930
And then I ask a student,
did you see what I did?

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.330
So follow my model, and
come here, pick up a card,

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.140
greet your classmates.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.620
So every day I would do this.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.550
I think after two
weeks, everybody

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.510
knows everybody's name.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.780
And while greeting
this is not just simple

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.660
greeting because you have
a natural conversation when

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.780
you say oh, I went to bed
really late last night.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.080
And people would say, why?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.390
So I started very
structured, for instance,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.560
just everybody just say
very limited things.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.025
And then I would
say, OK, so Sarah

00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:23.000
says she went to bed
really late last night.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.500
Do you guys want to know why?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.140
All in Chinese, so they
would start asking.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.590
So I build on that difficulty.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.070
The Monday class is really fun.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.630
They love it because you
can talk about weekend.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.080
So kids here, they did all kinds
of activity during the weekend.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.350
So they're so interested
in finding out

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.480
what their classmate did because
they might not know each other.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.260
Some took classes together.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.230
So they would [INAUDIBLE]
same course together

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.880
in the classroom.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.530
Many teachers probably
think it's a waste of time.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.090
Why are you talking about that?

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.770
But I think through this,
you build a community.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.380
So the moment they walk into
the classroom, after one month,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.110
they could have a test
before the top Chinese class.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.440
The moment they walk into--
because of these greeting

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.150
rituals, they have to switch
their gear into speaking

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.420
Chinese right away.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.760
And because you're
having a conversation,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.200
so you really need to
engage your classmates.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.350
So that's what I mean
building a community.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.100
They feel so freely.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.561
Can talk about
anything they could.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.560
And they don't know the
words, they will ask me,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.936
how do you say this?

00:06:37.936 --> 00:06:39.310
This is what I'm
doing right now.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.810
It's really blah, blah, blah.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.560
And people really
want to find out.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.250
And I add another
component after a few weeks

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.940
is to-- by the time now, they
already know each other's name.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.410
Every lesson, I ask
them to write an essay.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.510
I give them a topic
to write an essay.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.240
So I will ask them,
for instance, I'll say,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.480
we talk about family.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.610
So our topic is Chinese family.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.260
So I wanted them
to go home to write

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.510
about maybe Italian
family or Spanish family.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.050
So the structure.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.640
Model on the textbook.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.310
So nobody knows what other
students are writing about.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.640
So this time we call sharing.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.340
So this sharing part is to
talk about what did you write.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.060
So some students, oh, I
wrote about Spanish family.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.400
And I said, what was that?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.145
Tell us not just the title.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:39.270
What was the content about?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.320
So they talk about--
everybody has a chance

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.080
to talk about quickly.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.680
And then I said, oh,
this is very interesting.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.020
So student will automatically,
naturally, just ask,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.440
why did you pick this topic?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.370
Did you know any Spanish people?

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.880
So the natural
conversation just flows.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.800
So they get into a routine.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.710
So every time they
come to my classroom,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.300
they know they
should speak Chinese.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.540
And they should talk
about their life.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.170
And that's what they're good at.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.110
They cannot talk about politics.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.660
They cannot talk about history.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.750
But they can talk
about themselves.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.860
And so to make the oral
proficiency higher,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.590
and they can speak much better.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.060
I remember there's one student
after the Thanksgiving--

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.780
she came back.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.970
She was so excited.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.970
She said oh, [INAUDIBLE]
that's how they address me

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:44.520
as teacher-- and said, you know,
I my father had this friend.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.320
And I always call him Uncle.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.340
He is from China.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.550
He doesn't speak any English.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.450
So I met him in New York
when it was September.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.290
I cannot communicate
with him at all.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.350
So during the
Thanksgiving, my home

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.750
is so far away, so I
went to my uncle's place.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.030
And I can talk to him.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.720
And he kept saying that
my Chinese improved.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.770
And she said, oh my god,
it's only two months.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.010
I can't believe I can
speak the most Chinese.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.780
Even though I speak
Chinese with my parents,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.890
I can never speak to anybody.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.310
And she just came
back so excited.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.390
And I feel great.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.320
So I know it worked.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.260
Because to her it's
talking, speaking in Chinese

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.500
doesn't have to be something she
has to think about-- how do I

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.980
come up with the
first sentence--

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.540
anymore because she does
that in our class every time.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.990
So it's very natural for her.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.877
And plus, she
actually knows Chinese

00:09:43.877 --> 00:09:44.960
because of her background.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.750
So she crossed the barrier
to be able to speak

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.645
to other people,
which is fantastic.
