00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
I have the number 210. Let's try to factor this into prime numbers.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.200
So 210 is 2 times 3 times 5 times 7.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.640
It's the product of the first four prime numbers. This is its unique prime factorization.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.200
And what are these prime numbers? These are numbers that can't be factored into smaller numbers.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:30.400
And we leave 1 out of the game because it's special. And so the prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.960
and they go on forever, as was proved

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.960
maybe 2,300 years ago by Euclid. Now one thing that you can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.140
obviously see about these primes is that, after 2,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.880
they're all odd numbers.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.700
That means that, except for 2, if you add two primes together you get an even number.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.840
So the two primes could even be the same prime, so for example:

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.860
I get 3 plus 3 equals 6.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.680
I get 3 plus 5 equals 8.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.900
I get -- let's see -- 3 plus 7 equals 10.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.839
I also have that the same as 5 plus 5. So 10 has two representations as a sum of two primes.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.450
There's a conjecture of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.009
Goldbach from the 18th century that every even number starting with 6 is the sum of two

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.360
odd primes. And I should state this with a question mark.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.160
It's -- It's -- It's not known. There have been novels written about the quest for proving this conjecture of Goldbach.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.880
We don't know the answer.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.920
My friends who are analytic number theorists would die to prove Goldbach's Conjecture.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
It really is, would be a great prize, a great coup.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.680
We strongly suspect that the answer is yes, and why do we suspect so?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.120
Well, because the primes are very numerous. Even though they thin out,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.800
they are very numerous. And so, a given even number has a lot of chances to be the sum of two primes.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.680
210, as you can quickly see, is an even number. And Goldbach would predict that it's the sum of two primes.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.960
In fact, it's not only the sum of two primes. It's the sum of two primes in a lot of ways and a champion

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.440
number of ways. So what I mean by that if --  if you're going to write 210 as p plus q

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.800
where p is less than or equal to q and p and q are prime numbers and q Is

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.960
greater than or equal to 105.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.460
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.660
So let's take -- let q be any prime with 105

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.260
less than or equal to q, less than or equal to 210. OK? Any prime whatsoever and now let's look at

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.080
210 minus q. What can you tell me about that number? That number Is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.480
less than or equal to 105.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.480
105 being half of 210 and q Is above the halfway. 210 minus q is not divisible by 2.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.660
How do I know that?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.660
Because 210 is divisible by 2 and q is a prime and it's bigger than or equal to 105 so we're taught.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.240
OK?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.260
It's not divisible by 3. How do I know that? Because 3 Is a divisor of 210

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.860
and q, being a prime and bigger than or equal to 105, Is not divisible by 3.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.679
And also this number is not divisible by 5 or 7.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.409
For the same reasons, since 210 Is 2 times 3 times 5 times 7.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.290
So this number does not have -- as prime factors -- 2, 3, 5, &amp; 7.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.499
So what is its least possible prime factor?

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.460
Well, it would be the next prime after 7 which is 11.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.040
So if this --

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.820
-- a composite number, it would have to be some prime greater than or equal to 11 times something else

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.020
bigger than 1. But the least candidate is 11 times 11

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.160
which is 121 which is bigger than 105. So we conclude that 210 minus q

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.840
is 1 or prime.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.800
And it's not 1.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960
And how do I know it's not 1?

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.199
Well, if it were 1, that would mean that q is 209 and q is not equal to 209

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.949
because 209 is not a prime (it's 11 times 19). So every prime q

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.800
between 105 and 210 gives us a p such that p plus q equals 210.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.000
So, Goldbach is not only right about the number 210,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.440
he's REALLY right about the number 210. And -- in fact --

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.174
you can ask how special is this property that 210 has.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:56.570
It's the last number with this property.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.263
So let's look at all these primes between 105 and 210.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.339
Here they are.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:07.339
Look at them.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.449
Every one of them is a candidate for writing 210 as a sum of two primes

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.680
And, if it works, then 210 minus one of these primes will itself be a prime.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.620
Is there a pairing for each one of these primes where the prime's smaller than or equal to 105?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.080
And we find 210 is the very last case where this ever happens.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.600
It has happened for a few smaller cases so, for example, for the number 36.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.660
It works. OK, that's boring. 36 is small.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.640
210 is, you know, getting up there and it works for 210,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.642
OK? It doesn't work at all for any other number bigger than 210.

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:50.268
[Brady] And this is a -- this is proven?

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:54.980
[Carl Pomerance] And this is a proved theorem, and I can even tell you the names of the people that proved it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.460
It was done in 1993 and the authors were:

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.600
Jean-Marc Deshouillers, Andrew Granville, Wladyslaw Narkiewicz, and myself.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.280
[Brady] Professor, I'm going to call 210 VERY Goldbach-y

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.840
[Carl Pomerance] Very Goldbach-y.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.980
That's an excellent name, Brady. I like it.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.960
[Professor David Eisenbud] -- 20.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.980
Here's 11 and 11: 22.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.500
And as you can see as it goes down I sort of fill things out.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.340
Now what you don't see from this picture so

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.300
well is that actually, as the numbers get big, there are really a lot of ways of

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.000
writing the numbers as the sum of two primes. And --
