00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.485
You just clicked on this video, so you're alive

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:05.405
and interestingly in order to understand exactly where you came from

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.405
we must first understand what it means

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:10.295
to be alive. Life is an organised

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.575
genetic unit capable of metabolism,

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.325
reproduction and evolution. It's important to

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.465
remember this as we go way back in history to figure out exactly how you got here.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.735
Astronomers believe our solar system began

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.820
to form 4.6 billion years ago, when a star exploded

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.980
and then collapsed to form the sun

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.000
and around 500 smaller planets collided with each other

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.465
to from the inner planets we know today, including your home, Earth.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:35.725
For about 600 million years

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:38.705
Earth was too hot for life, most of the water was

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.855
evaporating into space, and even if some simple chemical

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.505
reactions began to take place creating life,

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.040
the comets and meteorites hitting Earth at the time

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.620
would have brought enough heat to make the developing oceans boil,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.300
destroying all potential life. As comets and meteorites subsided

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.240
Earth cooled and it became possible for water to remain on the surface.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.920
And so, life begins

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.045
about 3.7 billion years ago. There are many theories about how

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.075
exactly it began, some believe simple life

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.075
arrived from a meteorite, while others think chemical evolution

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:11.065
started with compounds reacting to heat,

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:14.005
or perhaps they were struck by lightning. And while the exact date

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.005
is difficult to pinpoint, a new study claims to have found

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.035
the oldest fossil ever at 3.77 billion

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.185
years old. An ancient microbe that flourished

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:26.125
around a hydro-thermal vent on the ocean floor. It's around

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.125
this time that the first simple cells began to evolve

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:32.125
on Earth, they were able to capture energy, replicate themselves

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.005
and evolve and became the single unit

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.800
on which all life will be built, including you.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.600
For 2 billion years, all organisms on Earth are

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.585
unicellular, and they likely lived in the oceans,

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:46.155
shielded from the hard ultraviolet (UV) light of the sun

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.700
but then something remarkable happened...

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.340
Photosynthesis.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.120
Around 2.5 billion years ago, a random mutation occurred that was

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.695
advantageous to cells, and they began using the energy of the sun to power their metabolism.

00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.685
And since oxygen, or O₂,

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:03.555
is the product of photosynthesis, our atmosphere changed

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:06.805
eventually creating the ozone layer which acted to shield the Earth

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.815
from the sun's deadly light. Of course at this point

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.395
O₂ is poisonous to most organisms

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.605
but over time, cells evolve to tolerate it, and because metabolic

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:18.735
reactions using O₂ were more efficient, cells could grow larger.

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:20.775
Around 1 billion years later,

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:24.125
cells begin to engulf and co-opt smaller cells,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.135
increasing their abilities to live in diverse environments. This

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.405
selective advantage led to cells sticking together in a coordinated manner

00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:32.915
even after dividing, and these cells eventually

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:36.175
began exchanging genetic material,

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:39.245
AKA, they had sex. Single celled organisms would divide by mitosis

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:41.785
or simple nuclear division, but once

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.875
meiosis evolved, genetic reorganisation began to occur

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:47.385
and the rate of evolution increased as offspring

00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:50.405
were now more genetically variable and some of these offspring

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:53.465
were more likely to survive and reproduce, and so the tree of life

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.425
began to explode. First there were plants

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.295
and then fungi, coral then protosomes like crabs,

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:02.345
echinoderms like sea urchins and then fish like sharks

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:05.405
and cod, and tetropods evolved from fish

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.885
and began adapting to living outside of the water part-time,

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.315
initially gulping air and absorbing oxygen in the gut.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:14.085
As time passes, species would evolve lungs separate

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:16.905
from the gut for absorbing air as well as a new way to walk

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.875
on land. In come amphibians, reptiles,

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.225
dinosaurs and finally, mammals. In fact our entire

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.895
ancestry stems from a cute, furry tailed, rat-like mammal

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.915
which survived and thrived around 66 million years ago

00:03:29.915 --> 00:03:32.995
just after an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.805
And after tens of millions of years of evolution

00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:39.940
and new species emerging, one branch of the Protungulatum family tree

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.800
evolved into our ape and monkey ancestors. And nearly 4 millions years ago, one of the first

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.695
human-like creatures arrive, Australopithecus Afarensus,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.520
the most famous discovered remains being that of Lucy, who stood upright.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.715
100,000 generations later

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.435
or 2-3 millions years ago, the species group

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.405
'homo' began which had a bigger brain

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.200
and started using their hands for more complex activities like creating and

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:05.215
wealding tools. This was the first step of transforming

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:08.135
our environment to improve our lives. It was also

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:10.275
a catalyst to switching from a vegetarian diet

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:13.195
to one containing meat which is a more concentrated

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.465
form of nutrition, and less effected by seasonal shortages.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:19.455
These simple stone tools allowed us to rip through meat

00:04:19.455 --> 00:04:22.445
and would become the tool of choice for 2 million

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:25.545
years. And around 1.8 million years ago, homo erectus

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:28.515
emerged, the direct ancestor to our species.

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:31.515
Finally, a few hundred thousand years ago, modern humans,

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:34.545
or homo sapiens, step into the light. Larger,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.565
smarter and more capable than their predecessors.

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:39.015
Interestingly, we almost didn't make it.

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:41.895
A climate change event around 140 thousand years ago

00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:44.885
plummeted the human population to only hundreds of people,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.315
an endangered species. But, we survived.

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:50.765
As recently as 60,000 years ago

00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:53.455
three different species of the 'homo' family co-exist.

00:04:53.455 --> 00:04:56.465
Homo neanderthalensis, homo denisova and we,

00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.515
homo sapiens, which all lived on this planet together.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:02.505
In fact, sapiens and neanderthalensis mated quite often which is why

00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:05.255
most contemporary humans, including you

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:08.205
have neanderthalensis DNA. The neanderthalensis died out around

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:11.140
30,000 years ago when homo sapiens were arriving

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.195
in what is now Europe, and from this point on, the

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:16.945
homo sapiens were the only living humans left on Earth.

00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:19.925
Unlike our primate relatives whose evolution favored strength,

00:05:19.925 --> 00:05:22.335
ours chose brain power, in fact

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:24.985
your brain weighs 2% of your body weight

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:28.115
but uses 20% of your caloric intake. And this brain power

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:31.265
allowed us to survive in a variety of environments, as we began to

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:34.435
migrate around the entire world. Where we started

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:37.455
as small wandering groups of less than 100

00:05:37.455 --> 00:05:40.465
we began to settle in groups of thousands and millions

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.575
and now, billions. You were born

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:45.315
a homo sapien, and that is how you got here.
