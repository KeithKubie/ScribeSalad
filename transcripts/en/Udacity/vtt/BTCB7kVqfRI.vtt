A famous histogram can be obtained by looking at the age distribution.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For the USA, the distribution looks about as follows.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Again, going to the statistics is an endless number of actual ages and so on.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's make a histogram that is somewhat simplified

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that only looks at people from age 0 to 40.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here is the data set from 21, 17, 9, 27, and so on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm asking you for all these four graphs in a histogram how high are the bars

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for each of those four ranges as shown over here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Again, the horizontal axis depicts age, and the vertical axis the count.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please, enter your answers here.
