Done already? Let me show you how it's done. As I said before, we

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.640
get the forecast by calling getItem from

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.940
the forecast adapter. And here's how we actually

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.542
display the toast. Note that the context

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.023
is actually available through getActivity in our

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:20.982
fragment. However, it won't do anything unless

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:25.450
we also show the toast. Displaying a toast

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.170
is useful to see how an Android interaction works. But this method should

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.060
really be used to start our detail activity. This is what we'll do next.
