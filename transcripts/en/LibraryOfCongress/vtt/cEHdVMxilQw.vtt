[ Applause ]

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.550
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.240
On behalf of the
Library of Congress,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.700
we would like to express
our deep gratitude to AARP

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.880
for making this presentation
possible.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660
AARP has been a longtime
supporter

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.050
of the Library's
Educational Initiatives.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.310
And we're very grateful
for that.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.610
[ Applause ]

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.890
It's now my honor to
introduce the cochairman

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.510
of the National Book Festival,
an indefatigable champion

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.070
of reading and literacy,
David Rubenstein.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.370
[Applause].

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.670
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.970
So. Thank you.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.270
Thank you.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670
So. [Applause].

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.240
We're very honored,
very honored to have one

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.410
of our country's foremost
historians and writers

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.730
and biographers here,
Doris Kearns Goodwin.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.530
Thank you very much
for coming, Doris.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.140
[ Applause ]

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.190
How many people here, how many
people here have read Team

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.490
of Rivals?

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.790
Anybody? Okay.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.080
How many have read Bully Pulpit?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.860
Wow. How many people read
her book on Lynden Johnson?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020
What about the Kennedys
and Fitzgeralds?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.430
Okay. Alright.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.910
And how many people here
agree that she's one

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.010
of our foremost writers
and historians?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.310
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.320
So, for those who don't know her
background, just very briefly.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.890
She grew up in New York,
Brooklyn and ultimately went

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.620
to Colby College, got
her PhD at Harvard.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.860
She was a White House Fellow
in the Johnson Administration.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.660
Helped President
Johnson with his memoirs

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.060
and then ultimately went
back to teach at Harvard.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.890
And for the last
number of years,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.390
she's been writing
extraordinarily well received

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.950
and terrific biographies
and histories and winner

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.500
of the Pulitzer Prize for
one of your books as well.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.280
So, you're going to be writing
a new book that's coming

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.910
out September the 18th.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.390
It's on leadership.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.810
And it's about a book
on the leadership skills

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.870
of four people you've
written about.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.430
One is Abraham Lincoln.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.940
One is Teddy Roosevelt.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.550
One is Franklin Roosevelt.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.880
And the other is Lyndon Johnson.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.720
So, we're going to
talk about that today.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.100
And I wanted to ask you
first, why did you decide

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.390
to write a book about
four different people?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.690
You've already written
books about them.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.160
Why not pick somebody new and
write a book about somebody new?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.460
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.380
Well what happened is each
time I'd finish writing one

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.020
of the books, and I have to
take all of that person's books

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.520
out of my study to make
room for the next guy,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.110
I felt like I was betraying the
person who was there before.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.530
It's like having
an old boyfriend

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.630
and moving to a new boyfriend.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.800
So, I figured what if I could
keep my guys together this time

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.300
instead of doing that.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.200
But I knew I'd have to do it
by having a chance to look

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.230
at them anew in a new way.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.000
And I've always been
interested in leadership.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.450
I mean, once upon a time when
I was a graduate student,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.910
we would stay up late at
night discussing questions

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.210
about leadership.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.710
In those days you're
reading Plate and Aristotle

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.920
and you're thinking about
where does ambition come from?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.820
And does the man make the times?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.170
Or the times make the man?

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.800
Are leaderships traits
born or made?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.730
We also talked about
boys and girls

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.030
and what was going
on in the world.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.330
But those were the
kind of things

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.630
that really interested us.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.440
So, I decided what if
I look at these guys.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.790
And I do call them my guys.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.480
It seems maybe a
little disrespectful.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.650
But I've lived with them
for so long each time

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.270
that I feel familiar to them.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.420
What if I just take
them and I look at them

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.760
through the exclusive
lens of leadership.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.540
And so, it became a
great project for me.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.840
It took five years.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.140
Not as long as some
of the others.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.440
But as not as short
as I thought.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.740
Because I didn't know
as much about them

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.040
as I thought I should.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.340
And I loved every minute of it.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.750
It's really been a
great, great [inaudible].

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.950
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, the
only one of these Presidents

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.610
that you actually knew, of
course, was Lyndon Johnson.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.260
And before we get into the book,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.340
you might relate how
you actually came

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.380
to know Lyndon Johnson and
how you almost lost your job

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.800
on an article you wrote.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.100
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: True.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.400
So, when I was chosen
as a White House Fellow,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.700
I was 24-years-old.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.560
And we had a big dance
at the White House.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.440
It's a fabulous program,
the White House Fellowship.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.830
Colin Powell was a
White House Fellow,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.430
Wesley Clark, Senator Tim Wirth.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.430
We had a big dance at the
White House the night we

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.730
were selected.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.030
He did dance with me that night.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.330
Not that peculiar.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.230
There were only three women out
of the 16 White House Fellows.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.960
But as he twirled me around
the floor, he whispered

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.830
that he wanted me to
be assigned directly

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.250
to him in the White House.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.860
But it was not to
be that simple.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.540
For in the months leading
up to my selection,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.550
like many young people, while
I was a graduate student

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.610
at Harvard, I had been active in
the anti Vietnam War Movement.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.290
And I had written an article
against LBJ, which we had sent

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.590
into the New Republic.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.890
Hadn't heard anything.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.580
But it suddenly came out
two days after the dance

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.040
in the White House [laughter].

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.520
And the title of the article was
-- How to Remove Lyndon Johnson

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.820
from Power [laughter].

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.950
So, I was certain he would
kick me out of the program.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.460
But instead surprisingly
he said,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.980
oh bring her down
here for a year.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.360
And if I can't win
her over, no one can.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
So, I did eventually
end up working

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.960
for him in the White House.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.590
And then accompanying him to
his ranch those last years

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.490
to help him on his memoires.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.790
And I must say, it was the
most extraordinary experience.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.670
He's the most formidable,
interesting, strange, brilliant,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.670
colorful character
I've ever met.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.480
And what a privilege it was
to have spent so many hours

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.250
with his aging line of a man.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.790
I'd like to think that the
empathy that I began to feel

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.220
for him despite not changing
my mind about the War

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.610
in Vietnam is what I hoped
I carried over when I went

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.410
to each President after him.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.690
And probably might not have been
a Presidential historian had it

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.470
not been for Lyndon Johnson.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.770
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.070
let's talk about each
of these Presidents.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.370
And we'll do it in this way.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.670
What you've done in your
book is you have each

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.970
of these four Presidents.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.120
And you've, to make it
simple, there are three parts

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.530
to each description of the
book, of the Presidents.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.740
One is how they were
educated and grew up.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.660
And whether they were kind of
destined for greatness or not

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.170
and people thought
they might be.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.070
Second -- what was the,
the problem in their life

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.550
that depressed them,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.590
maybe thought they were
not going anywhere in life.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.120
And they were even
suicidal at points.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.410
And third -- what challenge they
met as President that showed

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.180
that they had great
leadership skills.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.340
So, let's go through
Lincoln first.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.510
Lincoln grew up not
in a wealthy family.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.940
Did his father try
to educate him?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.310
What was the, what
was it like growing

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.020
up as a son of Mr. Lincoln?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.940
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: The
circumstances that Lincoln grew

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.380
up in took enormous perseverance
and determination to overcome.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.440
He. It was subscriptions
schools in Illinois then.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.770
So, the only way you
could go to school was

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.330
to pay a certain amount.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.560
So, he never went past the
age of nine or 10 in school,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.260
because the family, not
only couldn't afford it,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.850
but the father thought it was
a waste of time for somebody

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.890
to educate themselves, when he
should be working in the fields.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.190
So, it meant that Lincoln had to
scour the countryside for books

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.230
and get everything he
could lay his hands on.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.450
At one point, he walked like
16 miles to get a certain book

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.040
that he wanted to have.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.690
And in a certain sense, somehow
books became much more important

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.250
to him as a result of that.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.660
It was said, when he got a
copy of the King James Bible

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.870
or Aesop's Fable or one
of Shakespeare's plays,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.360
he was so excited he couldn't
eat, he couldn't sleep.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.160
And there was a sense in which
books carried him to places

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.600
that he could never go.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.070
Through books, he began to
develop an alternative thought

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.580
for what he might be in life.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.880
He was really smart.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.800
In those few years when he was
in school, he was without peer.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.300
And I think that's where some
of his confidence came from.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.110
After a while, he was teaching
the other kids in his class,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.590
rather than the teacher,
because he had learned so much.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.890
But in a certain sense,
once he started reading

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.560
about other people
and other places,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.630
he began to think maybe I
can have another life other

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.830
than shucking corn
or splitting rails.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.870
And he had to get
away from the father,

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.610
who when he would see him
reading would destroy his books.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.340
So, he finally left the home.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.870
When you couldn't leave until
you were 21 in those days.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.410
And he finally left
and went to New Salem.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.620
And that's where his
political career began.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.350
He ran for office after
being there only six months.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.820
And he writes this amazing,
amazing handbill that he gives

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.920
out to the people
explaining why he's running.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.640
And he said, every man
who's 23-years-old,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.330
every man has this
peculiar ambition.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.410
Mine is to be truly
esteemed of by my fellow man.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.390
To do something worthy
to get their esteem.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.000
To think that way
when you're 23.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.310
And then he said, I'm young and
unknown to many of you and I've,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.260
if I, if you don't put me in
office, I won't be disappointed

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.860
that much, because I've had so
much disappointment in my life.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.090
But if you do, I promise I will
do everything to pay you back.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.580
And then he said, and if
I don't win this time,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.480
I'm going to try five
or six more times

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.660
until it's too embarrassing
and too humiliating

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.810
and then I'll never try again.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.470
Well, he didn't win
the first time,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.110
but it didn't dampen
his ambition.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.120
The second time he tries,
he had met more people.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.530
They had seen the kind of
person he was, the kindness,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.520
the humility, the storytelling
ability, the patience.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.450
And he wins that next election.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.790
And that's the beginning of this
extraordinary political career.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.390
you point out that
he wasn't educated

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.760
in this traditional
sense of going to school

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.210
and law school, graduate school.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.910
Is there a reason to
think that maybe not going

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.620
to these schools enables
you to be a great writer?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.740
He wrote the Gettysburg Address
without having been educated.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.710
What was the secret behind
his ability with words

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.430
and to be able to
write so eloquently?

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.240
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, he probably had a gift

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.540
for the rhythm of language.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.570
I think maybe you're
born with that.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.930
But more importantly
maybe, he read great books.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.830
I mean, he was not spending
his time reading a lot

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.290
of horizontal books.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.980
He's just reading
things like the Bible,

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.600
great poetry and Shakespeare.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.890
And he dives so deeply
into them.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.410
And he said whenever he read
something that he really loved,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.710
he wanted to read it aloud.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.000
And then, he would take, he
would take his, his, his knife,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.830
if he was on a plank, when
he was working on a rail

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.270
and he would write out
the words on a rail.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.240
And then, he transferred
them to paper.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.650
And then, he'd finally
memorize them.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.200
And they'd become part of him.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.150
So, it's almost like vertical
learning for him was deeper

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.970
than those of who read
all these wide things

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.270
and can hardly remember them.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.570
He read the best.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.170
So, he ran for office.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.470
And he ultimately is
elected as State Legislature.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.110
And ultimately, he served
two years in Congress

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.410
as a member of the Whig Party.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.490
And he was a competent lawyer.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.130
But there were a lot
of competent lawyers.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.680
Lots of people work in Congress.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.080
Was there anybody who said this
man is destined for greatness?

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.380
Was there anybody who said that?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.570
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
you know it's interesting.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.470
Theodore Roosevelt once wrote
something about the importance

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.910
of a crisis making
a leader great.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.910
And he said, if Lincoln
had not had a war,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.910
if there'd been no war, no
one would've known his name.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.220
But he's wrong.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.340
Because all the people
who'd seen him

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.350
from the time he was
young, even if they hadn't,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.000
if he'd never become
President, they knew they were

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.280
in the presence of
somebody special.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.810
They saw how much he
was trying to learn.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.340
They wanted to help him
on his upward climb.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.640
They would lend him books.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.510
The guy who was the village
cooper would keep his fire

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.700
on late at night so
that Lincoln could read

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.020
because that was the one
place where there'd be light.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.570
They watched him help widows.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.260
They watched him help people who
needed something done for them.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.070
They saw his sense of humor.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.720
Even as a young kid, he
learned how to tell stories.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.670
He used to listen to his father
entertain people who came

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.170
by the street and tell stories.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.090
The father had the one
thing that he valued,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.880
which was being a
great storyteller.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.990
And Lincoln became this
fabulous storyteller.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.650
And he had a sense of humor
that matched his melancholy.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.690
Because there was a sadness
about him when he was young,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.030
because he had these
huge ambitions

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.010
and he thought I'll
never reach those goals.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.540
But the way he whistled off
sadness was through his humor.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.660
They saw all these traits
and they knew he was special.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.550
Whether they knew he would
ever become President,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.840
I doubt that they could
have thought that big.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.900
But they knew that there was
something about this guy.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.540
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Let's
talk about Teddy Roosevelt.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.480
He did not grow up
in a poor setting.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.750
His father was a
very wealthy person.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.050
But did that mean he was going

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.120
to be necessarily a
very smart person?

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.470
Or did it mean he was going
to be very good athlete?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.540
What was it like growing
up as Teddy Roosevelt?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.100
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, the most important thing

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.510
for Teddy Roosevelt growing
up was that he suffered

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.660
from an almost life threatening
asthma when he was a child,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.270
which meant that he
couldn't participate

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.940
in physical activities.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.650
But it meant that he
developed his mind.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.400
He read books too,
like Lincoln did,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.320
in every spare moment
he could find.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.940
Unlike Lincoln, however,
all he needed

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.760
to do was pull a book off
his vast library shelf.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.580
Or if he told his
father, who he loved

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.840
and who had a fabulous
relationship with,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.140
that he wanted a certain book.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.440
It would suddenly
magically appear.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.980
In fact, there's one time
when he wrote in a letter

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.340
that he had written,
he had read 50 novels

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.810
that summer on a vacation.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.450
And then, the father took him
on trips around the world.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.750
He would teach him.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.590
The father was like
the tutor for him.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.850
And eventually, that sense

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.250
of reading became
a huge part of him.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.080
He said that books were
the greatest companions

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.980
that a leader needs know
about human nature more

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.280
than anything in the world.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.120
And the best way to learn about
human nature is through books.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.270
But for him too, books
created an alternative future

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.710
because here's this
little kid who wants

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.010
to be a fearless person.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.310
And he's very timid.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.980
And he's got this asthma.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.130
So, he reads about
explorers in Africa.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.080
He reads about soldiers.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.750
He reads about deer slayers.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.680
And he begins to imagine
himself one of those.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.120
And later, he becomes
this courageous guy,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.940
this strenuous guy,
because what,

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.510
at a certain point his
father says to him, Teddy,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.670
you've got the mind,
but not the body.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.670
And without the body, the mind
cannot go as far as it should.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.280
You must do something
to make your body.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.390
So, the little kid
says, I'll make my body.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.810
And he goes into all
these strenuous exercises.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.460
And he becomes a champion
and a very strong person

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.810
by the time he gets
to be past Harvard

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.640
and into, into the Presidency.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.940
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.240
So, he goes to Harvard.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.540
And is he well respected there?

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.020
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, he's rather an odd duck

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.760
at Harvard, because he really
wants to be an ornithologist.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.520
And he collects dead
snakes and dead birds.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.200
And they're all in his room.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.130
And when he first comes,
he's kind of a prig in a way.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.370
He doesn't want to make
friends with anybody,

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.560
who was not on the social
register, because he wants them

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.860
to be part of his same class.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.240
And he's also different
from the other kids.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.540
He speaks up in class.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.840
He interrupts the professors.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.410
And those were the times when
you just sort of a C student

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.830
and that's what you're
supposed to be.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.250
And he worked hard
and he did very well.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.300
But the interesting thing
is that once he gets

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.100
out of Harvard, he ends up
at the age of 23 running

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.400
for the State Legislature.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.530
Because, again, somebody comes
to him and says, you know,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.830
maybe you'd be a good candidate

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.280
because your father
had been well known.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.450
He was a philanthropist,
his father.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.140
And once he starts going
around meeting people

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.030
from the working class,
meeting people that were

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.330
in the other part
of the district.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.700
He's in the silk
stocking district.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.810
But there's also
tenements in that district.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.770
He began to feel
at ease with them.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.470
He was easily able
to talk to them.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.250
And he lost that kind of sense
of privilege that he had before.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.390
And he became a natural
politician.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.690
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Alright.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.990
So, he is in the
State Legislature.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.430
But he's kind of full of
himself a bit, doesn't make

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.670
as many friends as
he might want.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.370
Did anybody say this man is
very smart, he's a good athlete

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.380
and he's going to President
of the United States?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.680
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, what happens to his.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.980
Is you're absolutely right.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.380
When he was first in
the State Legislature,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.850
he developed what he himself
admitted was a swelled head.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.150
He used to.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.450
He had a great way of language.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.180
So, he could make
headlines in everything.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.490
He would pound his desk
when he was mad at somebody.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.010
He would say these
outrageous things.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.010
And he became well
known in New York.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.790
But after a while, he
couldn't get anything done

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.880
in the State Legislature because
he had burned so many bridges.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.900
So, he finally realized this
is where humility came him.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.140
An important quality
in all my guys.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.820
When they finally
develop humility,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.940
which means the ability to
recognize your limitations,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.490
to acknowledge your mistakes,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.660
he realized that he
couldn't fix it alone.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.260
Well, he didn't quite
say it that way.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.340
He said, I can't do it alone.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.480
I need cooperation
of other people.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.160
And then he became a
more mature politician.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.560
People knew again
that he was special.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.540
Whether they could
predict at that point

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.280
that he would be a
president, I don't know.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.700
But they knew they were in
the presence of somebody

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.930
with charisma, somebody
with energy,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.840
somebody with quite
a lot of brilliance.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.970
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
his, he's related to FDR how?

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.270
How is he related?

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.920
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
he's like a sixth cousin to FDR.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.010
But more importantly,
Teddy Roosevelt's brother,

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.910
Elliot Roosevelt, was the
father of Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.460
So, that's what the
real connection is.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.580
So, Eleanor's uncle is Teddy.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.910
And her father, Elliot,
Teddy's younger brother, was,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.100
had epilepsy as a child,
became an alcoholic.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.400
And died young.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.220
So, Teddy Roosevelt really
became like a father to Eleanor.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.960
And Franklin loved
Teddy Roosevelt.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.740
So, all three of them become
this wonderful circle.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.040
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.450
FDR grows up in a very
wealthy setting as well.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.030
He's the only child

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.870
of his father's marriage
with his mother.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.540
But it's a bucolic setting
in, up in Hyde Park.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.450
But was there anybody who
thought this man is going

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.230
to be President of
the United States?

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.680
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Certainly not FDR.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.290
But the interesting
thing about both FDR

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.840
and Teddy Roosevelt is
they were the center

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.680
of their parents' love, which
gave them a certain confidence.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.300
I mean with Teddy Roosevelt,
not only was he the center

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.940
of his father's love
and his mother's love,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.560
but the other siblings made
him the center of their lives,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.910
because he used to
tell them stories.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.250
After he read books, he
would tell them stories

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.810
and they would sit around and
he would organize their games.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.600
And so, too was FDR the
center of his parents' life.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.530
In fact, Teddy so wanted to be
the center of everybody's life

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.350
after having experienced that
as a child, that his daughter,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.840
Alice, once said, he wanted
to be the baby at the baptism,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.300
the bride at the
wedding and the corpse

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.640
at the funeral [laughter].

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.340
So, so, FDR had that
same sense, I think,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.310
of being adored as a child.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.620
But he. And he had any
book that he wanted

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.240
to in this magnificent
library that he could have.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.010
But when he was young, he
learned in a different way.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.440
He liked to read aloud.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.900
He liked to listen
to his mother read.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.180
There's a story one time when
his mother's reading to him

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.870
and he's playing with
his stamp collection.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.170
He loved stamps.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.470
He loved maps.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.770
He loved collecting things.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.070
I think it was his way
of having an independence

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.200
from the smothering of the
parents' who loved him so much.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.190
And his mother said, oh,
you're not listening to me.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.490
I'm not going to
finish reading the book.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.210
And then he recited back the
whole passages of what he said.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.830
He said, I'd be ashamed
of myself

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.340
if I couldn't do two
things at the same time.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.450
But because he was
not a regular student.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.600
I mean, he became a C student at
Groton, at Harvard, at Columbia.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.520
People thought he really wasn't
as smart as he turned out to be.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.820
In fact, that famous quote

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.310
where Oliver Wendell
Holmes meets him much later

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.990
and says he has a
first rate temperament,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.660
but a second rate intellect.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.470
He was right about the
first rate temperament.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.220
The being born with that
optimistic temperament,

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.180
which got him through everything
he had to get through later

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.980
in life was probably
the greatest gift

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.540
that he was bedowed
[phonetic] with.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.740
But he was much smarter
than people knew.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.300
He had a problem
solving intellect.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.190
For example, when he studied the
stamps, he would want to know.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.490
He's a little kid now.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.790
He wants to know
where the country

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.190
that issued the stamp came from.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.490
So, he'd look in
the encyclopedia.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.210
He'd read everything
about the country.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.510
And then, he would
finally figure

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.360
out if he didn't know the words.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.820
He would, he said to
his mother, I'm half way

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.360
through Webster's Dictionary.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.660
He studied maps.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.960
He studied atlases.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.260
And he wanted to know all
about the terrain and he'd read

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.350
about mountains and
the environment.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.940
And all of that became so
important when this man had

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.800
to lead us through World War II.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.170
And when he becomes
much a leader later on,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.470
he has a brain trust.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.770
He can bring information

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.190
out from the other people
by listening to them.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.960
So, the idea that he wasn't
smart because he didn't do well

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.660
in school is something we
make a terrible mistake about.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.660
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,
Lyndon Johnson is sort

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.960
of in between all of them.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.000
He is not poor, but
he's not rich.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.790
He's not a book learner,
but he's pretty smart.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.080
So, how do you describe
his background

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.520
and his father's
relationship with him?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.820
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
the most interesting thing

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.150
at the beginning is
that what I learned,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.450
which I hadn't known
all that much before,

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.480
was that when he was
two-years-old he learned

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.780
the alphabet.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.190
When he was four-years-old
he learned to read.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.210
And he could recite long
passages of Tennyson

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:26.040
and Longfellow, because
his mother wanted him

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.680
to be that kind of a kid.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.710
The mother had been
college educated.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.010
She wanted to be a writer.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.310
She was a journalist.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.610
She had met her husband,
a State Legislator,

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.260
when she interviewed him.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.730
And so, this mother really.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.230
He said, when he would recite
these passages, he told me,

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.920
and she would hug him so much.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.410
She was so proud of him.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.530
That he felt like he was going
to be smothered to death.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.850
In fact, there's a funny
story relating to the mother.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.930
Which is that when I was
working with Lyndon Johnson,

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.250
everything was going great.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.540
You know, I knew he had
a womanizing reputation.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.540
But I was constantly talking
to him about steady boyfriends,

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.780
even when I had no
boyfriends at all [laughter].

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.770
And so, you know,
everything was going great

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.880
until one day he wanted to
discuss our relationship,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.450
which sounded ominous when he
took me nearby to the lake,

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.040
conveniently called
Lake Lyndon Johnson.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.970
And he had wine and cheese
and a red checked tablecloth.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.270
All the romantic trappings.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.790
And he started out, Doris,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.660
more than any other
woman I have ever known.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.140
And my heart sank.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.410
And then, he said, you
remind me of my mother.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.710
[Laughter].

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.780
It was pretty embarrassing,

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.590
given what was going
on in my mind.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.720
But I guess somehow
I was at Harvard.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.020
I was an intellectual.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.320
And here was this mother.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.620
But the interesting thing is

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.680
that even though he had those
talents when he was young,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.600
all he really wanted was
to be following his father.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.330
And after a while, he
only wanted to read books.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.630
He said, is it real?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.500
Is it about somebody in history?

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.800
And he didn't want read fiction.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.100
He didn't want to
expand that mind.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.430
He wanted to go with the
father on the campaign trail.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.980
He wanted to go with him to the
State Legislator, Legislature.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.070
And politics became his love.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.580
And the father and the mother
never got along very well.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.340
So, choosing one over the
other was more complicated.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.250
But the sad thing is because
he never did well in school,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.780
because he was too restless
to sit, even though he had

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.070
that extraordinary
mind, he always felt

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.780
like somehow he would never be
appreciated by the Harvard's.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.590
His father said to him, if you
brush up against the grindstone

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.570
of life, you'll have more
polish than any of those Harvard

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.870
and Yale people ever did.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.730
And he said, I wanted
to believe him.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.030
But I never could.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.170
And even when I was first
starting to work for him

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.380
and he had wanted me to
work full time for him.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.680
And I told him I couldn't.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.980
I was going back to Harvard.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.280
I was going to start teaching.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.580
And so, he said, all or nothing.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.880
You can either come
all or nothing.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.200
And so, I thought I
wasn't going to go.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.300
The last day of his
Presidency he called me in

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.960
and he said, alright part time.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.230
And then he said, you know,
it's not so easy to get people

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.610
to work for you when
you're no longer

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.910
at the height of your power.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.730
I won't forget what
you're doing for me.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.460
And then, he said, now I know
you're going back to Harvard.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.760
You'll be coming on vacations.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.200
Don't let those Harvard's
get to you.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.380
Don't let them make you hate me.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.250
So, always that feeling
toward that larger world

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.610
that he easily could've
been a part.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.910
He was as smart as McNamara,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.940
as smart as Bundy,
any of those guys.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.790
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: As a young
man, though, did people think

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.000
that somebody who's father
was a State Legislator,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.350
he wasn't a wealthy person,
not particularly well educated,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.960
that he would be President
of the United States?

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.240
Was that anybody's dream
that for Lyndon Johnson?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.540
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, yes.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.840
This is what's interesting.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.500
So, once he gets into politics,
he's an absolute natural.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.220
And he, as a young.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.580
And when he was young, he was
a real new deal Congressman.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.570
He wanted to do for people
what would help people.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.930
And he meets FDR for the first
time when FDR is President.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.770
And he's a real.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.670
I was about to say something
that I know I can't say

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:36.970
on television [laughter].

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.110
Anyway, he was, he was
a natural storyteller.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.800
He could make up
things, for example.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.100
Let us say it that way.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.400
[Laughter].

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.490
So, you can guess what
that word might have been.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.080
So, he knows that FDR
is going to fishing.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.520
He knows nothing about fishing.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.980
And he starts telling how
much he loves fishing.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.670
Anyway, they get
along terrifically.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.700
And FDR tells somebody,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.790
I've just met this
amazing young Congressman.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:04.130
Do you know, he's the kind of
uninhibited pro I would've been

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.960
if I hadn't gone to Harvard?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.480
I think some day he may be
the first southern President

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.070
of the United States.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.370
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.740
So, let's talk about the
depression crises that each

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.410
of these men experienced
relatively early

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.810
or in their career
in their lives.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.060
So, Abraham Lincoln
gets to the point

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.870
where he's almost suicidal.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.470
They're so afraid he
might commit suicide,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.730
they take away the razor
blades and so forth.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.650
What were the things that
caused this enormous depression?

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.010
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
what happened to Lincoln is

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.970
that he broke his word
to his constituents.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.300
And he broke his word to
Mary when he asked her

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.170
to undo their engagement.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.140
And for him, his word
meant everything.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.920
He had promised his constituents

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.180
that he would bring
infrastructure projects

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.680
into their area so that they
could get their goods to market.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.850
Dredging the harbors
and making the roads.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.430
And then, a huge
recession hit the state.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.340
And they had to stop
the projects in halfway.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.160
And the state went into
bankruptcy and debt.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.460
And he was blamed.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.920
He took responsibility for it.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.250
And he said, he was going to
leave the State Legislature.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.150
At that same time, he broke
his engagement with Mary,

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.740
not sure he could
support a wife.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.060
But also not sure, as he said,

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.090
that his heart was
going with his hand.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.280
But he knew what it meant
to her to be humiliated.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.580
And the fact that he
had hurt these people,

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.790
that he had hurt his
constituents was so painful

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.020
to him that he went into
this suicidal depression.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.120
And he stayed in his
room for weeks on a time.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.420
And the friends came.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.390
And as we say, took
all knives and razors

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.690
and scissors from his room.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.640
And his best friend, Joshua
Speed, came to his side.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.030
And he said, Lincoln, you
must rally or you will die.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.360
He said, I know that and I would
just as soon die right now.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.910
But I've not yet
accomplished anything

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.780
to make any human being
remember that I have lived.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.890
So, fueled by that
worthy ambition,

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.190
always from the beginning,

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.240
he had this double ambition,
not just for himself.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.640
But for doing something
larger than that.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.680
He returned to finish
out that final term

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.050
in the State Legislature.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.090
And, as you said, eventually
won a seat in Congress.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.150
And then, he loses
twice for the Senate.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.320
And yet, instead of it again
undoing his ambition, he said,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.790
we've made a mark on the
enduring problem of the age,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.590
slavery, because of his
debates with Stephen Douglas.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.030
And then, he still losing
twice is willing to try

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.310
as a Dark Horse Candidate
for the Presidency.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.170
And the rest, as
they say, is history.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.740
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
with Mary Todd Lincoln,

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.040
he was engaged to her.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.730
And then he broke
up the relationship.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.160
And why did he decide
to go back?

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.460
And, and you might talk

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.350
about his earlier
girlfriend, who died.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.650
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Right.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.950
I mean, the, the hardest
thing for Lincoln was

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.250
that death really
surrounded him.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.870
I mean, his mother died when
he was only nine-years-old.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.310
His only sister, Sarah, died in
childbirth a few years later.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.420
And his first love, Ann
Rutledge, died at the age of 22.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.100
And the hard thing was that when
his mother died, she didn't say

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.650
to him, we'll meet
in another world.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.670
She simply said to him, Abraham,
I'm going away from you now.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.970
And I shall never return.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.990
And that's when he
began to be obsessed

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:54.490
with what happens
to us after we die.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.330
And when he began to think

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.690
that if I can only
accomplish something,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.380
maybe somebody will
remember me after I die.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.470
And they'll still be
telling the story of me.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.480
I will still live on.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.780
It was true, I think.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.680
People have studied this
more and more even than me

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.190
that he did love Ann Rutledge,
who died suddenly from one

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.030
of those things that
comes through.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.460
And when he first
met Mary, I think,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.060
he really did care
greatly for her.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.360
She loved poetry.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.660
She loved drama.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.890
She came from a very
educated, wealthy family.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.330
And she was one of the
few people at the time

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.690
who loved politics
and that world.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.250
She'd come to live with
her sister in Springfield.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.610
And her sister was married to
the then Governor of the state.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.290
And when he first
asked her to dance,

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.180
she later remembered she said,
he said, Mary, I want to dance

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.480
with you in the worst way.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.250
And after they finished
the dance, she said,

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.550
he certainly did [laughter].

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.850
But.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.450
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And,
by the way, by coincidence.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.910
Who was the other suitor
to marry Mary Todd Lincoln?

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.210
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Stephen Douglas.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.510
That's what's so amazing.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.370
It's a very small circle
of these politicians.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: But
she was dating somebody

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.550
who was six foot four and
somebody who was four foot six.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.850
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Right.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.150
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Okay.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.450
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
So, she'd have to stretch

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.750
or go back down, right?

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.050
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.350
Okay. Let's talk
about Teddy Roosevelt.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.810
He has an experience in
life that nobody wants to go

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.410
through on one day that really
put him into a depression.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.710
You might describe
what happened.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.010
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Yeah.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.310
I mean, he's in the
State Legislature.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.320
And his wife, Alice,
who he dearly loved.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.140
He had fallen in love with
her when she was at Harvard.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.710
And she was a beautiful
young woman,

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.010
was having their first child.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.120
And he got a telegram
saying, Alice's child is born.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.420
And they have cigars.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.810
They were all celebrating.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.900
And then, an hour later he gets
another telegram saying you must

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.660
come home immediately.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.590
Your mother is dying
and Alice is dying too.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.550
The mother had come
to take care of Alice.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.420
She was only 49-years-old.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.200
And she got typhoid fever.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.500
And she was dying.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.560
And then, he goes
back home immediately.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.110
His brother, Eliot,
meets him at the door.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.270
And says, there's a
curse on this house.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.570
He goes inside.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.870
His mother is dying.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.170
He holds her in his arms.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.470
She dies at three AM.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.980
Twelve hours later,
Alice died in childbirth.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.560
They said that he walked around
in a dazed, stunned state.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.920
He couldn't stay in the
State Legislature anymore.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.400
He had to get away.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.810
So, he had gotten a
ranch previously just

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.580
to think he might go
every now and then

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.100
out west in the Badlands.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.930
And he went for two years.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.730
And he became essentially
a cowboy,

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.030
a rancher in the Badlands.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.670
He said, as long as he could
ride his horse 15 hours a day,

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.020
physical activity
prevented over thought.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.520
And he was finally
able to sleep at night.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.310
But later, he said, this was
the best educational asset

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.630
that he could have
possibly developed,

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.430
because he developed this love
of the land, of open spaces

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.690
that was permanently
associated with his name

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.250
through the Conservation
Measures.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.660
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, the
daughter, who was born then.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.650
His first daughter named Alice.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.120
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Right.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.990
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Why would
he not really mention her

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.290
name ever?

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.590
Why did he kind of ignore her?

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.890
He had his sister, I
guess, raising her.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.190
What was the nature
of that relationship?

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.490
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Yeah.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.480
He had a very peculiar
attitude toward death,

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.270
which was that once, once
his wife, Alice, died,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.150
he couldn't bear to even say
the name of the little girl,

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.770
who they called Alice.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.510
So, he only called her baby.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.660
And he didn't even want
to bring her up somehow

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.740
because she reminded him too
much of the woman who had died.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.450
So, he did give her to
his sister to bring up.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.330
But then what happened is he
had once been very friendly

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.690
with a young woman named
Edith, whom he'd grown up with.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.250
And who was in love with him
from the time she was young

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.450
until he lost her
by going to Alice.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.730
And eventually, when he
started to get healthy again

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.720
in the Badlands, he started
corresponding with Edith.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.390
And in the end, he had a
marriage with her that was

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.150
as good a lifelong love of
marriage that he could possibly.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.740
I mean, a whole bunch of kids.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.700
But somehow when something hurt
him in the past, unlike Lincoln

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.790
who would talk endless about
the people who were in the past

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.120
and who wanted to remember them

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.720
because he thought that's the
way you bring them back to life.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.280
He thought if somethings gone,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.860
you just exercise
it from your mind.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.650
It wasn't a health part
of him in my judgement.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.650
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
when his wife and mother died

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.430
in the same day, he later wrote
a letter, a very famous letter,

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.590
saying the light had
gone out of his life.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.890
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Right.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.190
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.490
And he essentially felt
his life was over, right?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.790
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Right.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.090
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
And the idea

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.390
that he would ever become
President of the United States

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.530
at that time certainly didn't
exist in anybody's mind, right?

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.830
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
The most interesting thing

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.430
that happened to him,
I think that's right,

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.810
is before this all
happened to him.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.980
He looked at his life,
as many people do

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.650
when they're ambitious,
as a series of rungs

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.950
that he would like to go up.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.530
Okay, I'm in the
State Legislature now.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.250
I'd like to get in
the State Senate.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.890
You know, and then I think
I'd like to go to Congress.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.190
And then I could be a Senator.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.490
He was ambitious.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.180
And then, who knows what
might happen after that.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.350
But once this fatalistic
thing happened to him,

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.080
he decided that you can't plan
your life that way anymore.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.060
So, I'm just going to take
whatever job looks good to me

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.160
at the time where I can broaden
my horizons, where I can want

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.960
to do it a worthy job.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.300
So, he comes back to New York.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.140
And he becomes a Civil Service
Commissioner in Washington.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.200
A job that his friends
think that's way below you.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.500
You have huge talents.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.760
But he wanted to make
the merit system work.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.790
And then, he becomes Police
Commissioner of New York.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.800
And they say, why in the
world are you doing that?

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.230
And it turned out to be an
extraordinary experience

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.530
for him.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.030
He goes into tenements that
he had never seen before.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.330
He's walking the
streets at night.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.370
He made himself when he was
in the police department,

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.460
he would disguise himself so he
could go and walk on the beat

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.650
between midnight and four AM.

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.490
And just to see if the
policeman were on the beat.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.250
And they didn't recognize him
until finally he would say,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.380
I'm the Police Commissioner,
why aren't you on your beat?

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.090
And after a while these
cartoonist had pictures

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.590
of these big teeth of Teddy's.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.130
And those funny spectacles.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.430
And the policeman terrified

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.430
of the thought they
might encounter him.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.730
But those experiences.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.780
And then, he becomes a soldier
in the Spanish American War.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.080
And then, he becomes a Governor.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.500
And then, he becomes
Vice President.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.880
And then, he becomes President.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.360
He had the broadest experience.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.950
And he was the youngest
president.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.240
And he said that he learned
fellow feeling or self,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.130
you know, he was no, not
self conscious anymore going

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.430
into places that he

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.300
of his privileged
background might never go.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.720
It's one of the things
that's saddened me

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.090
about the last 2016 election.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:56.240
That politic experience
was considered a handicap.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.990
In his case, it broadened him.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.330
It made him learn other
ways of life that he

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.180
from his background
would never have known.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.870
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, for
Lincoln and for Teddy Roosevelt,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.470
the depressions, the
problems they had

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.010
in life were somewhat
psychological.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.740
Franklin Roosevelt has
a physical problem.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.970
What is that physical problem
and how'd that come about?

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:16.930
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Well, he's up at Campobello.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.760
And he doesn't feel
well one morning.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.770
But he goes out and
exercises all day.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.210
And he comes home so tired

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.010
that he can't even take
off his bathing suit.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.060
And he goes to bed.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.360
And within 48 hours,
he was paralyzed

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.660
from the waist down,
having gotten polio.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.050
And years of striving
would follow him from that.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.500
And it changed his life.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.800
There's no question.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.100
I mean, he.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.960
When he was in a wheelchair in
the early days and they told him

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.710
that the only chance
he really had was

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.780
to strengthen his upper body.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.200
So, he would ask to be taken
out of the wheelchair and put

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.240
on the library floor so he
could crawl around the floor

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.310
so that his back
would get stronger.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.730
And then, he decided
to crawl up the stairs.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.700
And he would hoist himself up
the stairs one rung at a time,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.250
holding onto the banisters,
sweat pouring down his face.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.110
And Eleanor said, the
extraordinary thing was

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.070
when he made it to the
top, they would celebrate

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.290
as if a mountain
had been climbed.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.910
And she realized
that when each one

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.740
of these small wins
was celebrated,

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.980
he began to get his
joy in life back again.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.950
Because it had been
a terrible depression

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.460
when he thought not only that he
would be paralyzed for the rest

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.290
of his life, but he thought
that his own ambitions

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.280
in politics would be undone.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.450
Because at that point, he'd not
only been in the State Senate,

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:27.940
he'd been Assistant
Secretary of the Navy.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.600
And he'd been a Vice
Presidential candidate

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.540
in 1920 before he got polio.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.370
So, he was definitely thinking
he was going somewhere.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.240
The polio changed
that possibility.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.560
Or so, it seemed.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.120
But then, amazingly, in
1924 Al Smith was running

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.420
for the Presidency.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.880
And they asked if
Franklin Roosevelt --

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.630
he hadn't really been in
public since the polio --

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.060
would give the nominating
speech.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.750
And he knew he would
have to somehow traverse

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.480
from there to the podium.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.690
And the only way he could
appear to be walking --

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.390
he could not walk
on his own power --

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.170
was if he had braces
locked in place.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.000
And he could lean
on somebody's arm.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.800
He could appear to be walking.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.710
So, he practiced for weeks
at home, measuring he steps

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.380
that he could do leaning
on his son, Jimmy's, arm.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.130
When he finally got to
the podium that night,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.660
the sweat again is
pouring down his face.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.490
But he delivers this
incredible happy warrior speech.

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.890
And he comes home that night
and he said to his family,

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.380
we made it, we made it.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.280
And then, much more importantly,
he's still not ready

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.580
to go into public life.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.110
He still thinks he
cannot be a politician,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.460
he can't be a President
unless he learns how to walk.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.680
But he goes to Warm Springs,
because he hears that's a place

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.680
where the hot waters
can help you.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.550
And once he gets there,
something much larger happens.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.720
He develops it into a rehab
center, first real rehab center.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.010
And it's not simply to help
his fellow polios learn how

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.190
to use the water to
help their muscles.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.500
But he wants them to
have fun in life again.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.870
He wants them to enjoy things.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.920
So, he arranges dances
with the wheelchairs.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.470
He arranges poker games, soccer
games and things in the pool.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:00.030
And he learns what it's like to
make other people feel better.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.390
And as Frances Perkins,
his Labor Secretary, said,

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:04.850
he emerged different from
that whole experience.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.080
Completely warm hearted with an
understanding of other people

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.570
to whom fate had also
dealt an unkind hand.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.400
He became a leader,
a much deeper leader

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.700
than he had been before.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now, it
wasn't a secret to most people

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.320
in the political world
that he had had polio.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.000
But most people in the United
States probably didn't know it

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.300
or it wasn't as well advertised.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.430
But why was it that the
press was willing to go along

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.650
with the idea of never
photographing him

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:29.950
in his wheelchair?

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.250
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Yeah.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.550
It's an extraordinary thing.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.850
Even though people
understood that he had polio,

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.330
they didn't understand
that he was a paraplegic.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.980
They didn't know that.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.650
And everybody around had made
a code of honor on the part

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.340
of the press that they'd
never photograph him

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.390
and never shows him
with his braces on.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.360
The most amazing moment
is in 1936 when he came

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.930
to give the acceptance
speech, he was being helped

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.230
to walk down the aisle.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.300
He reached over to shake the
hands of somebody and he fell.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.840
His braces unlocked.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.050
His speech sprawled
all over the floor.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.220
And he finally said
to the Secret Service,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.520
get me together again.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.960
They put his braces on.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.260
They get him up on the podium.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.050
And he delivers the great
rendezvous with destiny speech.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.260
But most importantly,
not a word was said

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.820
in the press the next
day that he had fallen.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.880
They simply gave the
words of the speech.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.780
When I think about where
we've come since then.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.300
When President Bush is sick in
Japan, when President Ford falls

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.180
down a plane step, we
can't wait to find them

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.140
in those embarrassing
situations.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.980
There was a code of
honor, as I said.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.580
If a new photographer came
along not knowing it and tried

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.190
to take a picture of him, an
older one would knock the camera

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.490
out of the [inaudible].

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.870
There was a dignity
to the Presidency.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.720
I mean, you wished that he
didn't feel he had to do that.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.340
You would hope nowadays that
he could be a paraplegic

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.690
and still be the Franklin
Roosevelt that he was.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.400
But he made the decision then
that that was not possible.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.940
And if he said that and his
political instincts are better

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.190
than mine, looking back,
then I believe him.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:51.250
But there was a sense that there
was a way of treating people

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.370
with dignity in the way
press handled politicians

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.030
that I wish we could
restore today.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.200
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
now Lyndon Johnson's setback

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.500
or depression is something

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.450
that only Lyndon Johnson would
think was quite comparable

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.750
to the other ones.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.050
He lost an election.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.250
But can you describe why that
would be such a terrible thing.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.660
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
It does seem crazy, right?

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.520
I mean 1941 he loses a Senate
Election that he should've won.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.350
At the last minute, he lost.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.750
And it did catapult him
into such a depression,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.760
because for him, losing an
election was a repudiation

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.100
of his deepest self.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.400
I mean, that's what he was.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.700
He was a politician.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.000
I mean he loved his wife.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.300
He loved his children.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.390
But politics had to fill
this big hole in him

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:32.140
that was too hard to fill
without politics being there.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.030
And what happened is he
went into a decline really.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.340
Sometimes these kind

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.470
of adversities can send you
backwards, rather than forwards.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:40.990
And in his self, he's,

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.320
he decided that he would pursue
wealth instead of just working

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.140
as he always had in politics.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.110
He turned his back
on the New Deal.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:50.340
He realized if he ever were
going to win another chance

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.810
at a senate seat, Texas
was becoming increasingly

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:54.850
conservative, so
that he would have

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.850
to become conservative as well.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.590
And when he wins finally in
1948 and gets into the Senate,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.890
then he pursues power.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.620
And he becomes incredibly
powerful.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.210
I mean he knows how to do it.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.980
He becomes majority leader.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.190
But then, the incredible
thing is he has a second

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.490
big adversity.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.110
Just six months after he
became majority leader,

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.400
he had a nearly fatal
heart attack.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.390
And when he was in the hospital
and he began to say to himself,

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:23.320
the proximity of death was right
there, you know, if I died now,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.630
what would I be remembered for?

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.010
I mean all of these people it's

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.750
so interesting they
think about that.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.290
It's something larger than
what maybe ordinary people

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.590
think about.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.670
And then, he comes
back to the Senate

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.310
and he becomes once again
the progressive person he had

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.610
once been.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.580
And he gets the first Civil
Rights Bill through the Senate,

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.000
even though it's a strong Bill.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.200
It's the opening of
door to Civil Rights.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.540
And then, of course, when
he gets into the Presidency

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.520
that becomes the
thing he wants to do.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.380
To do something that
he'll be remembered for

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.680
and it becomes Civil Rights.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.980
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: And that
election, one of the things

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.260
that depressed was that he
could have won the election.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.560
He was maybe supposed to win.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.600
But he thought the election
was stolen from him.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.760
And did he resolve never
to let that happen again?

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.080
And how was it stolen?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.740
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
what happened is in those days,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.070
in 1941 and then again in 1948,

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.940
people knew that there
were certain counties

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.630
where you could put as many
votes in as you wanted to.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.370
I mean they could
just make people go

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.000
and add up extra votes.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
So, if they were your
counties, you usually would wait

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.530
to say how many votes
you had in them.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.920
And to know how many you needed

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.100
when you knew how close
you were to the other guy.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.270
But he was so sure
he had won in 1941,

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.020
he wanted to make
it happen earlier.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.920
So, he announced that
he had X number of votes

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.220
from one of his counties.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.870
And then, he was carried around
on the arms of his people.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.920
Well, the other guy
had his county still.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.420
He could then put more votes in
his county than LBJ had in his.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.720
So, he happens to win.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.180
So, in 48 he reversed
the process [laughter].

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.480
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.640
let's go through the
leadership examples you go

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.940
through in your book.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.240
You could, have cited many.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.690
But let's talk about in the
case of Abraham Lincoln.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.550
Obviously, a great leader.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:57.240
But you cite principally the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.710
Why do you think that is an
example of great leadership?

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.530
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
if my just say something first,

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.580
which is that in dealing
with them as leaders,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.800
I realized that all of them
lived in turbulent times.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.560
And thus, the title
of the book --

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.080
Leadership in Turbulent Times.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.380
I mean, think about it.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.350
It's become a little bit
more relevant now than it was

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.300
when I thought about
it five years ago.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.200
But each one of them faced
an extraordinary situation.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.430
And in Lincoln's case, of
course, he comes into office.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.260
And the Civil War
is about to begin.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.630
The country is on fire.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.380
It's divided into two.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.230
And he says if he had
ever known that the terror

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.560
of what he would face, he
wasn't thought he could live

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.860
through it.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.820
But the big question
he has to face is

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.190
that when the war starts, it's
predominantly being fought

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.200
to preserve the Union,
to bring the south

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.230
and the north back
together again.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.580
He had always hated slavery.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.460
And there were some
people who were hoping even

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.370
at the beginning
of his Presidency

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.510
that he would do something
about liberating the slaves

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.980
at the same time as
preserving the Union.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.460
But he was stuck by the idea

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.750
that the Constitution protected
slavery in those states

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.780
that wanted to keep slavery.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.080
And so, he.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.970
And he knew that most of the
Union Army was fighting simply

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.270
to preserve the Union.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.190
Not to emancipate the slaves.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.650
But as the war went on and as
the north was doing so badly

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.000
in the Peninsula Campaign
in the summer of 1862,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.440
he went to visit the
soldiers, which he always did

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.740
in the middle of any battle.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.410
He knew he wanted to walk
amidst the thinning ranks

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.710
of the soldiers.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.530
To, you know, to visit the
wounded in the hospital.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.750
And to get a sense
of the situation.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.950
And while he was there, he
began to realize more and more

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.310
that the slaves were helping the
Confederates in an enormous way.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.610
They're serving as teamsters.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.050
They're serving as cooks.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.310
They're, they're
tending the plantations

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:45.990
so that the soldiers
can be liberated

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.400
to come to the battlefield.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.080
And he realized that he had
powers as the Commander in Chief

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.430
that if something were
a military necessity,

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.730
he could use those powers.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.650
He went to the soldiers home
that summer and he was able

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.520
to think this all through.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.210
So, he came to this
cabinet and he said,

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.370
I'm going to issue an
Emancipation Proclamation

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.810
as Commander in Chief.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.430
The south is benefiting
from the slaves.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.230
If we take that benefit
away, it'll help the north.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.160
So, it's military necessity.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.690
He finally convinces
his cabinet,

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.050
even though some
didn't agree with him.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.440
They thought it would make
the midterm elections lose.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.090
It would make the war go on
even longer than that it would.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:24.020
But somehow he had so created
a sense of trust in him

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.390
that they didn't make
their disagreements public.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.390
And then, he had to
convince the Army,

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.330
who at the first were upset
about the idea of this.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.100
But so, trusting had
the Army become in him

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.310
because he had visited
them so many times

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.850
that they went along with it.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.860
And so, finally,
in January in 1863,

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.550
he actually makes the
Emancipation Proclamation real.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.850
And the question some people
thought is, would he go back

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.000
on his word, because
there was a lot of outcry

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.860
about it, even at that point.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.090
But when he went to sign the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.260
his own hand was
numb and shaking,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.770
because that morning
there'd been a huge New

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.160
Year's reception.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.460
And at that New Year's
reception,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.390
he had shaken a thousand hands.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.210
So, when he went to
sign the Proclamation,

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:06.260
his own hand was
numb and shaking.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.630
He put the pen down.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:10.800
He said, if ever my soul were
in an act, it is in this act.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.560
But if I sign with
a shaking hand,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.000
posterity will say he hesitated.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.920
So, he waited and waited
until he could sign

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.850
with an unusually bold hand.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.510
And then, the amazing
thing is that Joshua Speed,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.400
his old friend, came
to the White House soon

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.200
after the Emancipation
Proclamation was signed.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.910
And they both remembered that
terrible moment when he was

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.140
in that near suicidal
depression.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.120
And when he said that I would
as soon die now, but I've not

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.170
yet done anything to make
any human being remember

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.470
that I've lived.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:40.960
And he said to Joshua, I hope in
this Emancipation Proclamation

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.200
that my fondest hopes
will be realized.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.280
That this will be something
that will be remembered.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.850
And so, it surely has been.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.880
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So, in the
movie Lincoln, which was made

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.940
after the book, Team of
Rivals, it's only about,

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.130
although you wrote about
500 pages or so in the book.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.790
It's only about three or four
pages in the book is the movie.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.160
And that's a whole
separate story.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.330
But it's about the
13th Amendment.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:02.820
Why did we need the
13th Amendment

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.430
after we had the
Emancipation Proclamation?

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.120
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
just to mention about the movie.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.480
The thing that was so
wonderful about the movie was

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.950
that even though they wisely
choose a smaller subject,

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.590
the 13th Amendment, rather

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.850
than the whole horizontal
atmosphere of the war.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.410
It still gave everything that I
cared about that most important

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.180
that Lincoln would've cared
about, about his character,

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.110
his humor, his melancholy,
his storytelling ability,

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.800
his moral convictions,
his political genius.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.780
And that was the
important thing to show.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.840
And also Spielberg wanted
Daniel Day-Lewis to play Lincoln

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.230
from the very beginning.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.840
And he had not said yes to
these more horizontal scripts.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.850
When he finally said yes, he
knew that he had gotten his man.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.390
but the reason the 13th
Amendment was so important was

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:51.070
that Lincoln worried that
once the war came to an end

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:55.120
that then military necessity
would no longer be a valuable,

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.880
a viable way to have
undone the Constitution.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.750
So, he wanted a permanent
Constitutional Amendment

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.540
that would end slavery forever.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.410
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Let's
talk now about Teddy Roosevelt.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.960
There are many examples of
leadership that he gave you.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.180
And you focused on
the Coal strike.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.200
What was the Coal strike?

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.500
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
So, what happens is

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.960
that this is the pivotal
moment in Teddy's Presidency.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.520
I tried to choose moments
that were pivotal in each one

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.400
of their Presidencies, instead
of doing the whole Presidency.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.200
Partly because I knew that
I didn't want the book to be

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.240
as fat as some of these
other books were [laughter].

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.410
When a woman was
reading the Bully Pulpit,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.520
she told me she was
reading at home at night.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.110
And she was reading
it in hardback.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.950
And she fell asleep
and it broke her nose.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.250
So. [Laughter].

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.940
So, I figured I'm going
to try and make this book

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.690
on leadership not as fat.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.790
So, if I went through
their whole Presidencies,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:44.950
it would be fatter
and fatter and fatter.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.940
So, I chose the pivotal moments.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.290
So, in Teddy's case, the pivotal
moment was there was a strike.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.670
A six month strike between the
miners and the coal barons.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.250
And in New England, coal was
the only way you got fuel.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:00.470
So, as winter and
fall were coming,

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.830
hospitals were closing down.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.130
Schools were closing.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.510
It could've been a
national emergency.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.480
And certainly a New
England emergency.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.330
But the problem for
Teddy Roosevelt was

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.220
that the President
had no precedent

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.480
to intervene a labor
management strike.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.060
Everything was considered
private then.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.340
The government had no business
being involved in these things.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.630
So, he had to begin
to see the idea

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.920
that there were three
parties to this strike.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.430
There's labor, there's
management

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.730
and there's the public.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.660
And he represents the public.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.710
So, he started to go around.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.940
And he loved to go around
on a train to talk to people

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.480
and create public sentiment.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.710
To tell people that perhaps the
President did have some power

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:41.130
to get involved in this,
because the public was involved.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.810
And these train trips that he
took were such an important way

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.560
of creating public sentiment.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.700
He loved to go sometimes
six weeks in the spring

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.000
and six weeks in the fall.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.740
And he would stop at little
stations along the way.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.480
And then, he would continue
to go and wave to people

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.030
who would just be standing on
the tracks in these small places

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.940
when the train wasn't stopping.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.570
There's a great story that he's
waving frantically at a group

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.190
of people and they're not
responding rather coldly

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.260
until he's told because
of his near sightedness

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.710
that he's waving
frantically at a herd

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.590
of cows [laughter] little wonder
that they weren't responding.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.160
So, anyway, he starts
telling people

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.350
that I think a President
has a steward,

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:16.970
a stewardship role
to this office.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.500
And he decides finally to invite
both sides to the White House.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.030
Never had labor management
come to the White House before.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.080
This is so different
from what we imagine now.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.380
So, they come.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.250
And they have this really
unproductive meeting,

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.420
because the coal barons won't
even talk to the minors.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.880
They say, we're not
talking to these guys.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.180
They're outlaws.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.970
We can't even have a
conversation with them.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.110
And so, the lucky thing
Teddy does, though,

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.910
he had had a stenographer
at the beginning take notes.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.810
And he asked them
if he could do that.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.970
So, and the minor guys
happened to be very open.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:48.020
They actually suggested
arbitration.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.320
They said, we'll do.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.680
If you put into arbitration,

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.820
whatever you decide,
we'll go with you.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.600
And the coal barons said,

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.900
we're not even listening
to these guys.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.200
They're outlaws.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.080
So, he publishes
the whole meeting.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.200
And it sounds terrible on
the part of the minors.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.680
I mean on the part
on the coal owners.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.880
So, they finally decide that
they will go to arbitration.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.210
But they won't go if Teddy
suggested, they won't go

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.510
if the minors suggested.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.110
So, Teddy gets JP Morgan
to go and suggest it.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:14.770
And then, that saves
face for them.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.070
They get together.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.370
They settle it.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:18.670
It's settled on the
matter of both sides.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.780
And it really was the
symbol of his square deal,

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.320
which was the program that,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.140
that really symbolized
his entire Presidency.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.850
Square deal for the
rich and the poor,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.700
the capitalist and
the wage worker.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.990
And that's really
how he made his mark.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,
FDR may be associated

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.550
with the leadership of
helping us win World War II.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.240
And maybe he's most
remembered for that.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.480
But you focus on your book
on something that happened

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.260
when he just took office.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.640
We were in a depression.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.330
Hoover had not been able
to solve the depression.

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:49.580
What does FDR do in
your book that is so ex,

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.290
a good example of leadership?

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.590
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.700
what happens is the real thing
he has to face when he comes

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.660
into the office is there's
a terrible banking crisis

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.350
that in the weeks before
he was inaugurated,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.640
banks were collapsing
all over the country,

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.250
because people were
going to, they'd heard

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.330
that banks were collapsing.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.320
So, they started going
to their own banks to try

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:11.660
and take their money out.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.370
Long lines would be coming.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.740
And the banks didn't have
enough deposits on hand

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.160
to give the money back.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.960
So, it was becoming violent.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.060
So, once he gets into office,
he decides the very first day

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.350
that he's going to call,
what he calls a bank holiday,

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:25.710
ironically named.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:29.430
Close the banks for a week until
he can get Congress into session

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.830
and get Congress to shore up
the weaker banks with currency

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.130
that needed the money.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.440
Almost like a bail
out of the banks.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.140
So that he gets a law through
the Congress that week.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.440
They do it.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.070
They know which banks are
strong, which ones aren't.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.650
But then he has to
persuade the public

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.380
that what he's done
will make it safe

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.170
to bring their money back again.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.400
So, he decides to give the
first of his fireside chats

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.580
on the radio, which
will become a symbol

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.250
of his entire Presidency.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:57.680
And in patient, very
simple terms,

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.130
he explains to people
how banks work.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.570
He said, you put
your money in a bank.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.020
They don't put it in a vault.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.320
They invest it.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.620
They invest it in mortgages.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.040
They invest it in businesses
to keep the economy going.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.360
And he says what's happened
in this situation is some

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.410
of those banks invested their
money in the stock market.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.340
The stock market fell, so they
didn't have the cash on hand.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.640
Others were strong enough.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.800
But they don't have the
assets to do it at the moment.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.100
So, we're going to
help those banks.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.760
We're going to figure
out which is strong.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.880
And I promise you that if
you bring your money back

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.920
to the bank the next Monday when
the banks are going to open,

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.810
it's safer than keeping
it under your mattress.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.240
But they still worried
would they bring it back?

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.100
That Monday there's long
lines all across the country.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.690
And they worry, but they're
bringing their money back.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:38.490
They bring satchels
in to bring it back

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.280
in the bank because of his word.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.810
They trusted his word.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.990
And then, those fireside chats
become the most important way

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.570
that he communicates
with the people.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:50.240
That first one was followed
by 29 more, 35 fireside chats

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.070
in his 12 years in office.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.630
And his voice was so reassuring.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:57.260
People felt he was coming
into their living rooms.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:01.010
Saul Bellow has this great
memory of being in Chicago

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:02.980
on a hot summer night.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.450
And he's walking down the
street and he looks inside

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.050
and everybody's sitting
with their radio on.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:09.960
And they're watching the radio.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.260
And they're listening
to his voice.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.630
And his voice came
out the window.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.450
And Bellow said you could
still walk down the street

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:15.750
and not miss a word
of what he said.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:17.160
And then, there's a story

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.320
of a construction worker
going home one night.

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.270
And his partner said,
where are you going?

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.570
He said, well my President.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.060
He's coming into my
living room to talk to me.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.740
It's only right that I
be there to greet him

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.050
when he comes [laughter].

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.450
But what a difference
it was in that time

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.510
when we could trust the
word of the President.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:48.500
[ Applause ]

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.550
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: President
Kennedy had a very ambitious

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:51.850
Legislative program.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.620
But many of the things that
he wanted didn't get very far.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.440
When Lyndon Johnson becomes
President, he decides I'm going

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.060
to push Kennedy's agenda and
do a better job than Kennedy.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.480
One thing you write about that
he particularly pushed is the

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.970
Civil Rights Legislation.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.370
Why was it so important to him?

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:09.460
And how could he, being
from a southern state

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.800
that wasn't really that
interested in integration

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.100
and his best friends

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.310
in the Senate were not
integrationists, let's say.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:17.900
How did he manage
to pull that off?

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.280
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin: Well,
he knew when he first came

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.110
into office that he had
to do something to show

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.240
that he had grabbed
the reins of power.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.900
Because there was a real vacuum
after John Kennedy was killed.

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.430
And a lot of people had
no real understanding

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.260
who Lyndon Johnson was.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.550
So, he decided that he would
make his first priority passing

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.730
the Civil Rights Bill, which
had been stuck in the Congress.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.850
Indeed, none of John Kennedy's
domestic initiatives had

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:41.150
gotten through.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.160
Congress was as broken then,
as it seems now, surprisingly.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.460
I hadn't fully realized

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.760
that until I went
back to look at this.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.260
Somebody was writing about
the Republic was not going

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.270
to live anymore if Congress
couldn't figure out how

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:53.200
to get something done together.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.410
His friends warned him
that if you do this,

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.590
your own election
is 11 months away.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:00.270
A southern filibuster will
inevitably materialize.

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:02.030
It'll probably paralyze
this Bill.

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:03.330
You won't get any
other Bill through.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.720
You're going to be expending
all your power and all the coin

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.140
of the Presidency
on this one thing.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.610
And he said to that person,
well what's the President,

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.210
what the hell is the
Presidency for then?

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.390
And he said, I'm
like a poker player.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:17.220
I'm going to put all my
chips on this one thing.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.520
I think he believed that
if he could get the south

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.430
to desegregate, it would
be better for the south,

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.660
even though they might not
believe it at the time.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.940
He knew that the Civil Rights
movement had reached a stage

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.360
where something had to be
done or violence or dis,

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.120
problems would really arise.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.680
And he wanted to do it.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.490
And so, he took that risk.

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:38.280
It was one of the great
moments of his Presidency.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.850
And, you know, despite the
fact that he did so much more

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.720
in the next 18 months,
Medicare, Medicaid.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.020
It's extraordinary.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:49.050
NPR, PBS, immigration reform.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:50.500
And voting rights.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.220
And fair housing.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.590
The War in Vietnam obviously
cut that legacy in two.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.550
So, when I knew him in those
last days at the ranch,

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.380
there was such as
sadness as he talked

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.300
about these early 18 months
and how extraordinary it was,

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.880
because he got Congress
to do things.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.640
I mean, that Bill would
never have passed,

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.450
in my judgement, without him.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.110
He understood that he needed
the Republicans in order

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:12.640
to bring Republican supports

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.270
to break the Democratic
filibuster from the south.

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.510
So, he knows that Everett
Dirksen, the minority leader,

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:19.410
is the guy he got, has to get.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.950
So, he has drinks
with him every night.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.840
He's telling him, what
do you want in Illinois.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.040
These are the days when
earmarks were fine, you know.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.340
You want a postmastership?

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.640
You want an ambassadorship?

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.940
You want a project in?

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.240
Anything you want,
Everett, anything.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.540
I'm going to give
you all the credit.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.000
I'm going to give the
Republicans the credit.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.350
And then, finally, he knows

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.360
that Everett Dirksen wants
to be remembered too.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.660
So, he said, you know, Everett,

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.160
if you come with
me on this Bill.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.230
And you bring your Republicans
to break the filibuster.

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:43.730
And we get this Bill passed,

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:46.600
200 years from now school
children will know only two

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.950
names, Abraham Lincoln and
Everett Dirksen [laughter].

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.250
How could Dirksen resist?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:56.270
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: So,
let's suppose you say I, I,

00:54:56.270 --> 00:55:00.860
I admire your books, but I don't
have time to read this book.

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.570
Can you give me the
essence of leadership?

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:04.870
[Laughter].

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:09.460
What would you say these four
individuals had in common?

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:13.050
And what can other leaders
of our country learn

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:14.780
from these four people?

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.620
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
I did feel that I,

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.520
after exploring this,
that there were certain

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.820
family resemblances.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.180
There's no master
key to leadership.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.960
And they're all very different
in their style of leaderships.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.230
But they do share
certain qualities.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:30.720
I mean they shared eventually
an empathy toward other kinds

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.020
of people.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.860
So, that they could bring them
together and unite the country,

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.870
rather than dividing
the country.

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:39.680
They had a humility that allowed
them to acknowledge their errors

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.320
and to learn from
their mistakes.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.990
They had an ability to
communicate to the public

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:47.880
in their own technology
at the time.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.410
I mean, Lincoln, as I said,

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.080
because he was such
a good writer.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.110
His speeches would
be written in full

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.850
and people would read them
allowed in their places.

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.680
Teddy Roosevelt had
the perfect language,

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.470
that punchy language was
his phrases speak softly

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:01.970
and carry a big stick.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.000
He even gave Maxwell
House the slogan,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.480
good to the very last drop.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.860
He was perfect for
the newspaper age

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.030
at the turn of the 20th century.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.550
FDR had the perfect
voice for radio.

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.920
When you think about
JFK and Ronald Reagan,

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.570
they had the perfect ability to
talk on television in the time

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:20.640
of the three television
networks.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.710
And then, Obama becomes a
master of the internet wold.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:28.610
And then, Mr. Trump masters
the social media at the time

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.590
when he was running
for campaigns.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:32.320
But there's a problem, in
that there's a difference

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.440
in campaigning and governing,
which we've discovered

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.320
that these instant comments
can become more troubling.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:41.600
When Lincoln was President, he
could've debated with anybody.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.900
He was the best debater.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.780
He could have spoken
extemporaneously whenever he

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.080
wanted to.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.480
When people would go
after him, somebody said

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.780
to him you're two faced.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.340
He immediately responded
if I had two faces,

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.650
do you think I'd be
wearing this face?

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:52.950
[Laughter].

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:56.300
But as, but as President,
but as President,

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:58.400
he never spoke extemporaneously.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.170
He only wanted to be prepared.

00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:04.110
He knew something that we need
to know today that words matter.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:05.690
That they have consequences.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:07.510
And he knew that.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:15.160
[ Applause ]

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.040
So that, that was one
skill, that was one skill,

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.930
that was one skill they shared.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:25.270
But the other skill that I think
is too often unheralded is they

00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.350
all knew how to relax and
replenish their energies

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.780
to find time to think.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:34.380
Something that we think in our
24/7 world think we can never do

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.680
because we're so busy.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.570
Well, they were pretty busy.

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:41.410
But they somehow figured it out.

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.800
Lincoln actually went
to the theater more

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.420
than 100 times during
the Civil War.

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.310
He said when a Shakespeare
play come on,

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:52.230
he could imagine
himself back in the war

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:53.880
of the roses with Prince Hall.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.310
And he could forget the
war that was raging.

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:59.780
He said, people may think
my theater going peculiar.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.690
If I didn't do it, this
terrible anxiety would kill me.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:03.990
So, that's.

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:07.920
And he also had his sense
of humor that allowed him.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.610
When things were
tough, he would come

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:13.920
up with one of his
funny stories.

00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.070
And he would entertain
the cabinet meeting.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:19.140
And they'd have to
relax for a few moments.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.780
When he couldn't sleep
at night, he would wake

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.840
up his two aids,
Nikolay and Hay.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:31.440
And he would read them comic
passages from Shakespeare.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.720
He said, so then he could
go to bed at night thinking

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.280
of those comic passages instead
of thinking about the war,

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.220
which meant that
he could survive.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.610
Teddy Roosevelt, not
surprisingly given his asthma

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.700
and his need to build
up his body,

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:51.460
was able to exercise two
hours every afternoon

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.760
in the White House.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.260
And again, we think we
don't have time to go

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.490
to the gym for 30 minutes.

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.830
And he's doing something pretty
important while he's doing this.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:06.200
He would have a boxing
match, a wrestling match.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.360
Or his favorite exercise was
to walk in the wooded cliffs

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.150
of Rock Creek Park, where
he had a very simple rule

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:15.850
that you had to go
point to point.

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.850
You couldn't go around
any obstacle.

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:25.230
So, if you came to a
rock, you had to climb it.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:28.720
If you came to a precipice
you had to go down it.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.010
So, these companions who are
on these ridiculous walks

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:37.080
with him are falling by the
wayside all the along the way.

00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.820
But the best story was told by
the ambassador, Jules Jusserand.

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.120
He was from France.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.420
And he was so excited for his
first walk with the President.

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.720
He said, he had his
silk outfit on.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.020
You know, he thought they'd
be on the [foreign language].

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.320
He found himself in the woods.

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.620
He was dying.

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:48.920
He couldn't wait
until it was over.

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.220
They finally come
to the big stream

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.520
and he thought thank
God we're going home.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.820
So, he said, [inaudible]
my horror,

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.120
I saw the President
unbutton his clothes and say,

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.420
well it's an obstacle
we can't go around it.

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:56.720
So, we don't want to
get our clothes wet.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.020
So, we might as well
take our clothes off.

00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.320
So, he said, I too for the honor

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.620
of France took off my
clothes [laughter].

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.920
However, however, I left on my
lavender [inaudible] gloves.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.220
Why? It would be
most embarrassing

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.520
if we should meet
ladies on the other side

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.820
and I didn't have
gloves on [laughter].

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.120
So, anyway, they found.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.420
Now, the most interesting
person though is FDR.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.720
So, he had a cocktail party
every night during World War II,

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.020
where the rule was that you
couldn't talk about the war.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.320
You could talk about books you
had read, movies you had seen,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.620
gossip that was going on.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.920
And after a while, this cocktail
party was so important to him

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.220
that he wanted the people who
would be at the cocktail party

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.520
to live in the White House to
be ready for the cocktail party.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.820
So, for example, his Foreign
Policy Advisor, Harry Hopkins,

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.120
came for dinner one
night, slept over,

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.420
never left until the war
came to an end [laughter].

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.720
Princess from Norway in exile
in America during the war lives

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.020
with the family on the weekends.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.320
Lorena Hickok, who's
a friend of Eleanor's,

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.620
has a bedroom next to Eleanor.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.920
His secretary, Missy LeHand,

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.220
lives with the family
in the White House.

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.520
And the great Winston Churchill
came and, weeks at a time spent

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.820
in the White House
with Roosevelt.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.120
So, when I was working on
the book, I became obsessed

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.420
with the thought of all these
people in their bathrobes

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.720
at night in the corridor

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.020
and what amazing conversations
they must have had.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.320
And wishing that when I had
been up on that second floor

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.620
with Lyndon Johnson when I was
24-years-old, I had thought

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.920
of asking where did
Churchill sleep?

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.220
Where was Roosevelt?

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.520
Where was Eleanor?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.820
But, of course, I wasn't
thinking in those terms then.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.120
So, I mentioned this on a Diane
Rehm Show, here in Washington.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.420
And it happened that
Hillary Clinton,

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.720
then in the White
House, was listening.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.020
So, she promptly called me
up at the radio station,

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.730
invited me to sleep overnight
in the White House [laughter].

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.370
She said, we could then wanter
the corridor together and figure

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:56.850
out where everyone had
slept 50 years earlier.

01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:58.150
So, two weeks later,
she followed

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.220
up with an invitation
to a State Dinner.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.910
After which between midnight
and two AM, the President,

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.230
Mrs. Clinton, my husband and I
went through every room up there

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:07.600
and figured out yes,
Chelsea Clinton is sleeping

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.090
where Harry Hopkins slept.

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.130
The Clinton's are
sleeping where FDR.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.500
And the room they gave us was
Winston Churchill's bedroom.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.360
There was no way I could sleep.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.480
I was certain he was
sitting in the corner.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.260
He was drinking his
brandy, smoking a cigar.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.510
In fact, that bedroom is the
scene of my favorite story

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.360
in World War II when
Churchill came there right

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.220
after Pearl Harbor, he
and Roosevelt were set

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.170
to sign a document that
put the associated nations

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:32.780
against the axis powers.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.050
But no one really liked the
word associated nations.

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:36.350
So, that morning he awakened

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:38.750
with a whole new idea
calling them United Nations

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.160
against the axis powers.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.200
So excited that he was
that he wheeled himself

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.920
into Churchill's bedroom, our
bedroom, to tell him the news,

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.840
but it so happened that
Churchill was just coming

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.860
out of the bathtub and
had absolutely nothing

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.160
on [laughter].

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.470
So, Roosevelt said,
I'm so sorry.

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:53.010
I'll come back in a few moments.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.730
But Churchill amazingly
still dripping

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:58.430
from the tub has the presence of
mind to say, oh no, please stay.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:06.560
The Prime Minister of Great
Britain has nothing to hide

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:14.690
from the President
of the United States.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:15.990
[Laughter].

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:17.290
Now that's a guy you can love.

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:18.590
[Applause].

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:21.050
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Now,
you mention your husband.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:27.850
And unfortunately your
husband passed away recently.

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:31.440
In his honor, you're
working on another book.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.740
You might describe that book.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.040
&gt;&gt; Doris Kearns Goodwin:
Yes, indeed.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.080
My husband had cancer this
last year of his life.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.660
But he had started five
years earlier a book

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.960
that meant a lot to him.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:44.820
It was really a biography
of his mind in a way.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.040
Public service was something
he valued so much in his life.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.750
Despite graduating first in
his class at Harvard Law School

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.160
and clerking for Frankfurter.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.190
He really never cared about
going in and making money

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:01.550
and turning money around
from one place to another.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:05.230
He wanted to do something
in public.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.340
So, he went to do
the investigation

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.640
of the [inaudible] shows.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.260
He then was a young
speech writer for JFK.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.310
And then, with LBJ and wrote all

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.420
of LBJ's great Civil
Rights speeches.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.820
That incredible we
shall overcome speech.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.770
The great society speech.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.840
The Howard University speech.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.800
Bobby Kennedy's ripples
of hope speech.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.510
Al Gore's concession speech.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.440
But more important
than the speeches even,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.190
is that he devoted his
life to public service.

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.490
And he's watching.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.120
He was 86-years-old
when he died.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.260
And he was watching, he said,
what was going on right now.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.510
And he realized that through his
long life, he had seen the turns

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.540
and the twists in
American history.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.510
And like me too, he
believed, he said that the end

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:54.730
of America has loomed
many times before.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.770
America is not as
fragile as we think.

01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.470
So, he wanted to write a
book that would show people

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:04.380
that politics and public service
can be an honorable vocation,

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.520
wanting to make young
people believe once again

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.270
that they could enter public
life and have a fulfilling time.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:12.470
And he hadn't quite
finished the book.

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:13.770
He got cancer this last year.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.070
But the book kept him going.

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:19.060
I mean it was so incredible to
watch that he wanted to live,

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.380
not just for the book,
but because he was happy.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.640
And there was nothing I could
care about more than knowing

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.100
that this man, who I've
known for 45 years,

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.480
married for 42 years, wanted to
go through everything he could.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.920
He went through surgery and they
thought they got it, the cancer.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.220
He went through radiation
for seven weeks.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.520
They told him he got it.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.820
And we came and had
champagne with the doctors.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.120
And then, he came
home and he got.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.420
Two months later, two
months before he died

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.720
in May, it came back again.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.020
And this time the only thing
they could do was immunotherapy.

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.320
And he finally got pneumonia.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.620
And came home to Hospice.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.920
But it was the most
extraordinary thing.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.220
I've never seen death the
way I saw it with him.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.520
My parents died when
I was young.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.820
And they had heart attacks.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.120
So, it was over in a minute.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.420
But he knew.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.720
I don't know that he
knew he was dying.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.020
But he would wake up
from his pain medicine

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.320
and it was like an Irish wake.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.620
All our friends came in.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.920
day after day they'd come in and
he'd wake up and talk to them.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.220
And he'd say something to them.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.520
And he had this light
in his eye.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.820
And I must say, the
last thing he said

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.120
to me was you are a wonder.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.420
Something I will never
forget for as long as I live.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.720
[Applause].

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.020
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Thank you very much.

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.320
[Applause.]. Thank you, Doris,
for a [inaudible] story.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.620
Congratulations.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:10.420
Thank you.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:15.420
