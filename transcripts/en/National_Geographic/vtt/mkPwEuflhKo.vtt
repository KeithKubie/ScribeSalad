00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:04.971
( intro music )

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:11.744
( Aarti chanting )

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:13.245
Pete McBride:<i> Mother Ganges.</i>

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.514
( Aarti chanting )

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:18.752
Pete McBride:<i> This river
 supports 400 million people.</i>

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.920
<i> The river is believed to have
 curative powers,</i>

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.824
<i> it can wash you of your sins,
 bring you closer to God,</i>

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.059
<i> but of course,
 there's a great paradox.</i>

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.628
<i> They don't think
 they can actually hurt it,</i>

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.430
<i> because it is their God.</i>

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.400
<i> They said 'The river is sick
 but it is still God'.</i>

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.671
( Aarti chanting )

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.543
( applause )

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:45.745
Pete McBride: I wonder
what would happen

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.380 line:0%
if we took a river
that was actually believed

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.050 line:0%
to be sacred. It could...

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.453 line:0%
it was actually believed
to be a goddess or part of

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:57.557
a living entity
that was part of religion.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.626
<i> The Ganges River
 is 1550 miles.</i>

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.262
<i> It supports 400 million people</i>

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.398
<i> and is believed to be
 sacred by one billion Hindus.</i>

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:09.401
<i> So, we decided
 to follow the river,</i>

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.071
<i> start all the way at the top,
 as far as we could go.</i>

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.607
<i> This is basically
 the epicenter,</i>

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.143
<i> 21,000 foot Shivling peak,
 which is believed to be</i>

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.045
<i> the center of universe
 in the Hindu world,</i>

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:22.115
<i> where Lord Shiva came down
 and slowed the river</i>

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.351
<i> from the heavens to the Earth
 through the locks of his hair.</i>

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.119
<i> We decided
 to go past Shivling,</i>

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.555
<i> which is in the back.</i>

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.190
<i> All the way to the top of
 Gangotri glacier,</i>

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.192
<i> into the Garhwal region
 of the Himalaya,</i>

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.562
<i> up near the China and
 Pakistani border.</i>

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.063
We weren't even allowed
to bring satellite phones,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.130
they were afraid

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.033
they are using them
for terrorism activity.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.736
So, three of us came up to
this very remote region

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.538
in an attempt to climb
this peak...

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:48.741
<i> right there, Chaukhamba IV.</i>

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.545
<i> Never climbed before,
 22,500 feet high.</i>

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.980
<i> This is a little out of
 my climbing range</i>

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.949
<i> to be honest.</i>
( laughter )

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.951
<i> Well these two guys,</i>

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.821
<i> Jake Norton, he found
 Mallory's body on Everest.</i>

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.824
<i> Dave Morton, he has guided
 all seven summits.</i>

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.125
<i> Combined they've stood</i>

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.760
<i> on the top of Mount Everest
 nine times.</i>

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.228
<i> Seemed like
 pretty good company.</i>

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.730
I was actually a little nervous,
they were just going to

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.199
drag me into anything.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.500
And we got up to the top,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.303
<i> 18,000 feet
 of the Gangotri glacier</i>

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:20.473
<i> and we were getting prepared
 to climb this unclimbed peak.</i>

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.542
<i> We were gonna do
 water samples up at the top</i>

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:26.145
<i> and... an unpredictable
 monsoon pattern rolled in.</i>

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.182
Jake could detect it hours
before it happened.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.783
'What are you talking about?
The weather is great.'

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.085
Sure enough this weather
started rolling in.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.954
<i> At 4 pm, it started snowing.</i>

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.790
<i> It snowed three feet
 in 12 hours.</i>

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.525
<i> Did count 36 avalanches</i>

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.060
<i> counting through the night
 which...</i>

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.832
a mix between thunder,
artillery, distant drones,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.668
and someone banging a drum
over my head.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.103
So, we packed up our tents.

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.140
We had to leave much of
our stuff and basically fled.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.509
Hiking out with
no trail down the glacier,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.844
with heavy packs,
is challenging,

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:01.414
especially when you have to
fight it through three feet.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.382
<i> In retrospect,
 we left our ropes,</i>

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:04.817
<i> which maybe wasn't
 the smartest thing</i>

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.519
<i> as we were crossing
 a lot of crevasses.</i>

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.154
<i> But we were challenged,
 it was either tent or ropes.</i>

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:10.923
<i> 'What are we gonna do here?'</i>

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.059
<i> So, we came down
 and negotiated safely</i>

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.894
<i> through some of these
 crevasses</i>

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:19.098
<i> and made it back to the safety
 of this little tiny ashram,</i>

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.701
<i> this place where a guy named
 Silent Baba lives.</i>

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.036
<i> It is at 14,000 feet.</i>

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.206
<i> Silent Baba is a really
 interesting guy.</i>

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.509
<i> Many believe that
 further up the Ganges you go,</i>

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.810
<i> it is more sacred.</i>

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.711
The river is believed to have
curative powers,

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:34.746
it can wash you of your sins,

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:38.384
they can-- it can bring you
closer to God.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.153
Well, Silent Baba decided,

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.255
he is going to go all the way
to the top and live up there,

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.223
at 14,000 feet
and in addition

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.658
to prove that
he is that devoted,

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.859
he is not going to speak
anymore.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.527
So, he doesn't talk.

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.396
<i> And if you look at his
 front yard,</i>

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:53.565
<i> basically below Shivling,
 you can see the wild ibex</i>

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.401
<i> leaping about
 and jumping across.</i>

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.604
<i> This is one of the spots
 that I took a water sample.</i>

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.271
<i> I will show you
 some of the water sample data</i>

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:00.839
<i> as we move downstream.</i>

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.176
<i> So, unfortunately these guys</i>

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.444
<i> are big... sponsored,
 Eddie Bauer athletes.</i>

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:06.812
<i> They were bummed
 we didn't climb,</i>

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:08.647
<i> I was somewhat
 secretly relieved</i>

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.749
<i> that I didn't have to go
 up that mountain.</i>

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.051
( laughter )

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.253
<i> And we found...
 negotiated our way</i>

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.055
<i>back down the Gangotri glacier,</i>

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.723
<i> it took us four days.</i>

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:20.059
And to give you an idea of

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.262
how powerful
this Ganges River is...

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:24.997
<i> There was a glacial outburst</i>

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.867
<i> from another one of its
 tributaries</i>

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.703
<i> that literally tore through
 this area called Uttarkashi</i>

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.338
<i> and you can see
 how populated it is</i>

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.407
<i> once you descend out of
 the Upper Garhwal region.</i>

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:41.214
<i> It killed 6000 people.</i>

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:42.581
<i> And then once you leave</i>

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.783
<i> the very upper highlands
 of the Ganges</i>

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.654
<i> you come down to this
 remarkable dam, the Tehri Dam.</i>

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:51.190
<i> The largest dam in Asia.
 Very controversial!</i>

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.426
<i> Mostly controversial because
 if this river is God</i>

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:58.364
and you dam a river
that is God, you dam God.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.266
What becomes of God,
is it still sacred?

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.803
So many ask that
on a spiritual level.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.774
It also submerged 40 villages
and displaced 100,000 people.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:08.974
But it does produce

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:11.443
200,000 megawatts of electricity

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:13.379
which is very important in...

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.281
in a developing nation,
of course.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.950
<i> Just downstream is Devprayag,
 a very spiritual place.</i>

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.384
<i> Officially on the map,</i>

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:21.486
<i> this is where the Ganges
 starts.</i>

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:23.656
<i> The river on the left
 is the Bhagirathi,</i>

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.490
<i> that's the source river,
 that's the river we went up.</i>

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.693
<i> The river on the right
 is the Alaknanda.</i>

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.194
<i> You can see
 the difference between</i>

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.396
<i> what a dam does
 and what a dam doesn't do.</i>

00:05:31.396 --> 00:05:32.965
<i> On the right
 is the natural hue,</i>

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.034
<i> the sediment carrying
 loads, etc.</i>

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:37.636
<i> That emerald green again,
 clear water coming down</i>

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:39.805
<i> on the left
 because of the dam.</i>

00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:42.641
<i> When you get below Devprayag,</i>

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.110
<i> down into some of
 the more populated foothills,</i>

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.379
<i> this is around
 Rishikesh and Haridwar.</i>

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.381
<i> You start to see the real</i>

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.317
<i> love and adornment
 of the river.</i>

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:52.785
<i> This is called Aarti,</i>

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.487
<i> it's a daily ritual
 in the Hindu culture</i>

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.789
<i> where they come to do
 offerings and sing songs</i>

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.090
<i> and offer flame.</i>

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.793
<i> Flame which equals light,
 which equals humility</i>

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.662
<i> in front of your gods.</i>

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.397
<i> And they basically come out
 every single day at 5 o'clock</i>

00:06:05.397 --> 00:06:08.968
<i> and give this river
 a group hug.</i>

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.637
<i> And it's beautiful.
 It's really beautiful.</i>

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.639
<i> But of course,
 there's a great paradox.</i>

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.140
<i> They don't think
 they can actually hurt it,</i>

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.409
<i> because it is a God.</i>

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.211
Well, they may do offerings
and are unaware that

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.712
they are putting plastic
in the river, that's bad.

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:24.549
So, the people that adore it
are also partially killing it.

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:25.918
Now, just to give you a flavor,

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:27.286
some sights and
sounds of Aarti,

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.454
I'm going to play you
a short video.

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:38.264
( Aarti chanting )

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:25.144
( Aarti chanting )

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:51.871
( Aarti chanting )

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.185
I'm gonna keep moving
you downstream,

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:10.056
try to get us
to the end of this river...

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:12.191
<i> Remarkable river
 when you get up in the air.</i>

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.927
<i> But to give you an idea
 how hard that is in India,</i>

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.129
<i> helicopters and aircrafts are
 used for the military only.</i>

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.298
<i> This took me
 two years to get this flight.</i>

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.966
<i> But you are able to see
 from the air,</i>

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:23.769
<i> kind of the beauty,
 the marvel of the Himalaya</i>

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:26.071
<i> and as this river descends,
 and through the terraced</i>

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:27.606
<i> and populated areas.</i>

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:31.143
<i> I mean to think this river
 supports 400 million people.</i>

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.878
And we wanted to do
something different too.

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:34.680
We didn't--
I wanted to document it

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.316
and try to raise awareness,
but I also wanted to...

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:40.486
to do some testing to prove
'Is this-- people claim

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.521
it's the most contaminated
river in the world and

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.657
what is this situation with
this water. How bad is it?'

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.892
<i> So, we brought some
 water testing devices.</i>

00:08:46.892 --> 00:08:48.694
<i> This is actually
 in front of Agra,</i>

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.030
<i> the Taj-- in Agra
 in front of the Taj Mahal.</i>

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.863
<i> Many people...</i>

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.599
<i> maybe some of you have been
 to the Taj Mahal,</i>

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.467
<i> but nobody goes out here.</i>

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:56.902
<i> This is the most putrid river</i>

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:58.537
<i> I've ever stepped my foot
 in my life.</i>

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:01.406
<i> I mean, it was garbage
 and crap everywhere</i>

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:04.877
<i> and there was a half-eaten
 dead monkey floating by me.</i>

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.778
Nasty, nasty water.

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:10.449
And, they do say that
the Gangajal,

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.918
the Ganges water is powerful,
it is curative,

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.486
there is something
special about it.

00:09:14.486 --> 00:09:17.289
I'm like 'Really?
We need to figure this out'.

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:18.791
As early as 1896,

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.526
the British were actually
putting

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:25.965
cholera bacteria into
Ganges water and it was dying.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.534
So, the Ganges had
a power to it, a curative power

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:31.871
that was in fact... unusual.

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:35.040
<i> But here in the Yamuna River,
 this is what our data showed.</i>

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.442
<i> This is the oxygen,
 dissolved oxygen content.</i>

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:39.812
<i> If you are above 8, on a river
 with dissolved oxygen,</i>

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.348
<i> which all the species and
 plant and flora need,</i>

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.816
<i> you're a healthy river.</i>

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:46.785
<i> Well, right there at Yamuna
 in front of Agra, it was zero.</i>

00:09:46.785 --> 00:09:49.821
<i> Basically, a dead river,
 and just to give you an idea</i>

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:51.423
<i> of what happens
 on the inverse,</i>

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:53.359
<i> we tested for 21 heavy metals,</i>

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.095
<i> this was one of the,
 just the higher ranges.</i>

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.830
<i> The yellow line
 is the safety line</i>

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.832
<i> for human interactions,
 of course, I was standing</i>

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:03.669
<i> knee deep in the river
 that is just laden with zinc,</i>

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.838
<i> just one of the many
 heavy metals it was high.</i>

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:08.974
So, not a healthy river,
but what's interesting is

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:11.710
<i> the oxygen level came back,</i>

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.013
<i> you saw that dip,
 it came back up.</i>

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:15.580
<i> So, somehow this river,</i>

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.983
<i> on some level
 is restoring itself.</i>

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.719
We jump back over to Kanpur,

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:23.122
<i> where you see people,
 of course, treating the river</i>

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:24.623
<i> much like a laundromat.</i>

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.224
<i> Nobody was swimming here
 in Kanpur,</i>

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:30.229
<i> they said ''The river is sick,
 but it is still God'.</i>

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:33.065
<i> First signs of fishing we saw.
 This is in part</i>

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.067
<i> because we started coming
 into the Muslim religion</i>

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.102
<i> that is mixed
 in the section of Ganges here.</i>

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:39.004
<i> The Hindu religion,</i>

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:41.173
<i> they are all vegetarian
 and won't fish or allow it.</i>

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.275
<i> but in this area
 we saw some fishing.</i>

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.411
<i> And then we also wanted to see
 some of the industry.</i>

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.046
<i> Kanpur was basically built
 as a textile town,</i>

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:49.348
<i> by the British.</i>

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:52.117
<i> Great access
 because of the Ganges river.</i>

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:53.919
<i> So this is a leather tannery.</i>

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:56.755
<i> There are 400
 running tanneries in Kanpur</i>

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:59.225
<i> and they produce 8%
 of the world's leather supply.</i>

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.993
<i> Much of us are probably
 wearing their leather.</i>

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.828
<i> It goes to our fine shoes.</i>

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.264
Most of it it's buffalo,
some cow.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.865
Yes, the cow and buffalo
are sacred,

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:09.934
but if you are not Hindu,
you can work in this industry.

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:11.170
<i> When you are in the tannery,</i>

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.337
<i> this is one of the
 cleaner ones.</i>

00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:13.739
<i> They are actually following
 protocol.</i>

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.941
<i> They have to recycle
 the water now...</i>

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.075
<i> by government.</i>

00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:18.677
<i> 70 tanneries were
 shuttered down</i>

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.146
<i> by the government, but it is
 one of the most toxic places</i>

00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:22.681
<i> I've ever been in my life.</i>

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.984
<i> This was like walking into
 a bottle of ammonia.</i>

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.953
<i> My nose almost exploded
 when I walked in here.</i>

00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:29.354
<i> I mean,
 they are basically bathing</i>

00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:31.990
<i> in this heavy metal
 called chromium,</i>

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.728
which is a very toxic,
very nasty, uh, heavy metal.

00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:38.931
It creates lung cancer,
liver failure,

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.467
kidney damage
premature dementia.

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:44.402
And in 2013,
they did a study...

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:47.606
that they are basically
pumping out 79 million gallons

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:51.644
of contaminated water
into the Ganges around Kanpur.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:54.846
And they only have a capacity
to process 45 million gallons,

00:11:54.846 --> 00:11:57.416
so only half of the water
is getting cleaned.

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.351
<i> This is a worker
 outside of a tannery</i>

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.520
<i> trying to bathe himself off
 and he is kneeling on</i>

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.923
<i> basically a pancake of
 dried chromium.</i>

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:09.061
<i> Outside, the kids are playing
 a gleeful game of cricket,</i>

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.428
<i> the national sport,</i>

00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:12.630
<i> and they are playing
 on a field of</i>

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.001
<i> chromium laden leather scraps.</i>

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:20.940
( sound of water pumps
and motors )

00:12:39.023 --> 00:12:41.494
( sound of industrial dryer )

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.042
( children shouting )

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:51.129
( sound of flowing water )

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:56.969
( sound of machines )

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.372
Pete McBride: It makes me
think about my leather shoes

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:01.707
in a whole new way.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.408
<i> Like I said we tested
 21 heavy metals,</i>

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:05.811
<i> I just want to give you
an idea what it's like in Kanpur</i>

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:08.413
<i> where the tanneries are,
 that's chromium.</i>

00:14:08.413 --> 00:14:09.815
<i> It spikes right off the roof</i>

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:11.883
<i> even with
 all the new recycling</i>

00:14:11.883 --> 00:14:13.919
<i> that the government
 is trying to do.</i>

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:18.490
<i> We move downstream,
 Indian traffic jam.</i>

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.426
<i> Very typical.
 India is a spectacular place.</i>

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:23.695
<i> It is so rich in humanity.</i>

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:24.996
<i> Practicality sometimes</i>

00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:26.498
<i> and functionality,
 doesn't always work,</i>

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.333
<i> but it is overcome with
 humanity,</i>

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:29.735
<i> it's really wonderful.</i>

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:32.337
<i> We moved into Varanasi.</i>

00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:35.608
<i> It is one of the oldest
 inhabited cities in the world.</i>

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:38.176
<i> People have been living here
 for 5000 years.</i>

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:40.645
<i> Again, one of these
 Aarti ceremonies.</i>

00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:42.347
<i> Varanasi is considered sacred,</i>

00:14:42.347 --> 00:14:45.016
<i> they perform Aarti
 in sacred cities.</i>

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:47.486
<i> Again fire equals
 light equals humility,</i>

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:50.088
<i> people coming from the banks
 to watch it.</i>

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:53.392
<i> And then just downstream,
 you can come here to pray</i>

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:57.095
<i> and round the corner,
 people come to die.</i>

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:58.964
<i> All this work
 and a bunch of essays I wrote</i>

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.966
<i> were published on
the National Geographic magazine</i>

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:02.534
<i> 'Proof' blog recently.</i>

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.370
<i> I'm just going to read you
 the opening sentence</i>

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.907
<i> of the blog that went
 with the Varanasi story.</i>

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.942
<i> "When you step off
 a wooden boat</i>

00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:12.510
<i> onto the banks
 of the burning ghat</i>

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.746
<i>in the oldest of India's cities</i>

00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:17.816
<i> and you weave through a maze
 of funeral pyres hissing,</i>

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.818
<i> steaming and
 spitting orange embers</i>

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.653
<i> into the inky night</i>

00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:24.022
<i> and you feel
 the metronome clang of bells</i>

00:15:24.022 --> 00:15:27.592
<i> vibrating inside your chest
and a wave of furnace-like heat</i>

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:30.495
<i> consuming everything
 in its reach,</i>

00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:33.164
<i> you realize
 how removed you truly are</i>

00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:36.135
<i> from the ritual of death."</i>

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:37.536
That was the most
run-on sentence

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:39.170
I've ever written in my life,
but I liked it.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.340
( laughter )

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.276
That was in the evening
in the burning ghat.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.644
<i> This is in the morning,
 back here</i>

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.645
<i> at 4:30 in the morning.</i>

00:15:47.645 --> 00:15:49.114
<i>Very challenging to get access.</i>

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.315
<i> You are not supposed to
 photograph here.</i>

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.551
<i> It took me three days
 to get access.</i>

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.753
<i> Very powerful place to be,
 you see...</i>

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:57.956
<i> the goats eating flowers,
 the dogs,</i>

00:15:57.989 --> 00:15:59.791
<i> that's a femur bone.</i>

00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:03.461
<i> These are all the ashes and
 bodies that have been burned.</i>

00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:06.631
And the belief is that if...

00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:08.533
you are burned
on the bank of the Ganges,

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:12.437
and in Varanasi specifically,
and your ashes are thrown

00:16:12.437 --> 00:16:13.671
<i> into the Ganges river,</i>

00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:16.474
<i> which you are seeing
 right here that is human ash,</i>

00:16:16.474 --> 00:16:19.077
<i> that you will achieve
 a level of Moksha</i>

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:20.212
<i> in the Hindu religion.</i>

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:21.480
<i> And Moksha means,
 you will break</i>

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.948
<i> the cycle of
 birth and rebirth.</i>

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.883
<i> You'll not come back
 into this world,</i>

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.052
<i> you'll not come back
 as a cricket or cow or</i>

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.420
<i> another human, whatever.</i>

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.188
<i> You will actually
 go to heaven.</i>

00:16:30.188 --> 00:16:33.592
So, many people actually
will come to die in Varanasi,

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.829
it is that important to them
to reach heaven this way.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:40.331
And one challenge though,
of course is

00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:43.335
burning all these bodies uses
a tremendous amount of wood.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:47.539
It can take 1100 pounds of
logs to burn one large body.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.074
50-60 million trees

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:51.076
from the Himalaya
are getting cut down.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:54.546
You see them getting barged up
to the burning ghat here,

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:57.215
very complicated situation.

00:16:57.215 --> 00:16:59.984
<i> And of course this is
 a very common sight</i>

00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:01.486
<i> when you get further
 downstream.</i>

00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:03.287
<i> This is just 200 yards
 from the Ganges,</i>

00:17:03.287 --> 00:17:06.191
<i>this is a very typical drainage.</i>

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.627
Of course,
it stems much in part from

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:09.861
'the Ganges is God'.

00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:11.596
I mean, the Ganges is
going to clean itself.

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:14.399
That isn't a big deal
if you pollute God.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.167
God is all-powerful.

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:18.636
God is however we perceive it.

00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:21.873
<i> We moved further downstream
 all the way to Patna,</i>

00:17:21.873 --> 00:17:23.408
<i> a place few people go.</i>

00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:25.977
<i> And of course, we left the
 crazy monsoon storm</i>

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:29.114
<i> with three feet at the top
 and we entered into a cyclone.</i>

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:30.114
<i> We figured, what the hell,</i>

00:17:30.114 --> 00:17:31.983
<i> we've gotta make it
 to the end though.</i>

00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:34.653
<i> It was raining so hard,
 my eyelids were peeling back.</i>

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:37.222
<i> I felt like I had a
 sand blaster on my face.</i>

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.757
<i> It didn't stop these guys.</i>

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:41.259
<i> These guys are out
 celebrating at full tilt</i>

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:43.028
<i> a festival called Durga Puja,</i>

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:45.263
<i> good over evil,
 and they build big,</i>

00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:46.497
<i> big statues of
 their deities and</i>

00:17:46.497 --> 00:17:47.699
<i> they bring them down
 and of course,</i>

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:50.501
<i> they offer them to Ma Ganga,
 mother Ganges.</i>

00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:52.838
<i> Offer these offerings
 to the God.</i>

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.739
Of course,
the river is bigger now.

00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:56.541
It has got a bigger current,
it is wider.

00:17:56.541 --> 00:17:58.744
But all of these offerings
just sort of float

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.645
and collect on the banks.

00:18:00.645 --> 00:18:02.848
And many of them have
led paint and plastic,

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:05.750
and what not. They are not
all biodegradable.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.587
<i> Further downstream,
 we moved across</i>

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:11.323
<i> into Bengal, the last state
 on the Ganges.</i>

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:14.059
<i> Durga Puja continued and raged
 through the night here.</i>

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:15.927
<i> All the villagers were
 building their statues and</i>

00:18:15.927 --> 00:18:18.730
<i> coming and giving offering,
 putting ghee on the mouths and</i>

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.031
<i> then carrying them,
 and then</i>

00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:22.734
<i> throwing them in the Ganges
 as a great offering.</i>

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.836
<i> In Calcutta,
 on the southern edge,</i>

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:27.806
<i>in the Indian side of the delta,</i>

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:30.708
<i> we've now come
 about 1500 miles.</i>

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:32.944
<i> This is one of the
 main shipping lanes</i>

00:18:32.944 --> 00:18:35.814
<i> for Calcutta and a very
 typical scene, you have</i>

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:39.117
<i> somebody praying,
 somebody drinking water,</i>

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:40.518
<i> somebody washing their hair,</i>

00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:42.654
<i> somebody collecting
 sacred Gangajal,</i>

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:45.657
<i> they are going to bring back
 to their village.</i>

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:48.593
Back to our water data,

00:18:48.593 --> 00:18:50.829
this whole concept of
the river coming back to life

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.464
is interesting because

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.766
there's a thing... they are
calling it the X-factor.

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:58.103
They believe it is related to
bacteriophages, that...

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.238
if all these people come
into the river everyday,

00:19:00.238 --> 00:19:02.073
and they are treating it
like a bathroom,

00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:03.675
why are they not
getting sicker?

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.543
Well, the oxygen level
does return

00:19:05.543 --> 00:19:07.646
and the oxygen
actually helps to...

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.148
to support
these bacteriophages,

00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:11.583
which eat bacteria.

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.051
And that's one theory why

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.121
these epidemics, cholera
epidemics haven't occurred

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.488
with one million people

00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:19.324
coming for certain festivals
and what not.

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.760
So, there is some element of
the curative power

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.095
to this river.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:26.264
And after six weeks,

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:30.435
travelling 1550 miles,
roughly three vertical miles,

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.737
in theory,
we were free of sin because,

00:19:32.737 --> 00:19:34.239
believe me, I did wade,

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.675
walk, swim, fall in

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:40.412
the Ganges
many times on this trip.

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:43.081
Yes, I was free of sin
and I was free of 35 pounds.

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:45.284
I lost a bit of weight.

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.818
It is a good
weight loss program.

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.286
<i> We reached the Bay of Bengal,</i>

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:50.087
<i> it's Sagar Island
 where you can come,</i>

00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:52.190
<i> give an offering to Ma Ganga,</i>

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.358
<i> to the river,</i>

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:56.828
<i> to this pack of stray dogs,
 that all are related.</i>

00:19:56.828 --> 00:20:00.198
( laughter )

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:02.033
<i> So, there is the Ganges,</i>

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:03.568
<i> just to give you
 a little overlay of</i>

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:05.603
<i> the locations
 and the water testing.</i>

00:20:05.603 --> 00:20:09.341
<i> This is the
 heavy metal testing.</i>

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.543
<i> You see some heavy spikes
 on the Yamuna River,</i>

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.244
<i> which is basically
 flushing out</i>

00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:15.947
<i> New Delhi and all the
 industry there.</i>

00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:18.816
<i> Agra, of course,
 is the lower part of that.</i>

00:20:18.816 --> 00:20:22.087
<i> So, it somehow digests a lot
 of that heavy metal input</i>

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.555
<i> and puts it at bay
 to a degree,</i>

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.789
<i> but it's not gonna last.</i>

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:26.858
Now, the new Prime Minster
of India, Modi,

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.593
has actually budgeted,
and this is

00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:29.961
very new,
it is very recent,

00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:32.163
$340 million to clean up
the Ganges.

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:33.565
So, there is some hope.

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:36.167
There are people listening
and paying attention.

00:20:36.167 --> 00:20:38.604
<i> This was some of our
 other testing.</i>

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.605
<i> Nitrates are very high
 at the top of the river,</i>

00:20:40.605 --> 00:20:42.106
<i> this is probably blowing
 in from China,</i>

00:20:42.106 --> 00:20:43.774
<i> from fertilizer.</i>

00:20:43.774 --> 00:20:45.877
<i> You can see the temperature</i>

00:20:45.877 --> 00:20:47.345
<i> basically steadily drop</i>

00:20:47.345 --> 00:20:48.780
<i> and this is oxygen,
 the main one.</i>

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.782
<i> So you see the river
 try to come back to life,</i>

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:52.517
<i> which is unusual,
 but it slowly,</i>

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:55.586
<i> it turns into nearly a
 dead river at the end.</i>

00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:56.955
But I want you
to remember

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.890
not the river for its data
or its contamination,

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.658
I want you to remember for
its sounds, so I have

00:21:00.658 --> 00:21:03.328
one more Indian video, it is
just a minute and half long.

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:17.843
( walking through snow )

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.515
( sound of pouring tea )

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.590
( sound of flowing water )

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.774
( chanting )

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:27.279
( music )

00:22:31.816 --> 00:22:34.486
( sound of flowing water )

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:49.066
So all the rivers in our--
all the water in our rivers

00:22:49.066 --> 00:22:52.204
and our ecosystems, our water
table is very limited.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.806
And no matter whether you
live in Washington D.C.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:56.074
or you live in Colorado,
where I do,

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.342
or you live in India,

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.776
I'd like to urge people
that I think

00:22:58.776 --> 00:23:01.112
all these rivers and all our
water systems should be sacred

00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:02.681
because they all are scarce.

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:04.282
Thank you very much.

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:07.052
( applause )

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:09.654
( outro music )
