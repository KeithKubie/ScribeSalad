00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.270
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.960
of International Studies.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.430
Our guest today is Charles McCurdy,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670
who is professor of history and law

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.710
at the University of Virginia.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.710
He is the 2014 Jefferson
Lecturer at UC Berkeley.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.100
Professor McCurdy, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.933
- Glad to be here.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.070
- Welcome back to Berkeley, I should say.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.620
Where were you born and raised?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.330
- I was born and raised in Pasadena.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.323
My father was a machinist.

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:19.471
My mother was just around the household.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.220
I was really the first person in my family

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.940
to get a bachelor's degree, go to college.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.110
- Looking back, how do
you think your parents

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.380
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.400
- I don't think they shaped
my thinking about the world

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:40.170
so much as they instilled in
all of us a drive, some drive.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.800
They were very hard working people.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.200
- And was there discussion
around the dinner table

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.260
or in the family about world affairs,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.850
or about law, and society, and so on?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.101
- No, it was mostly about baseball.

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:57.934
(laughter)

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.090
- Well, that's a good way to prepare

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.693
for understanding politics.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.720
What about at school?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.300
Any teachers before
you went off to college

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.550
that really impacted your thinking?

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.203
- None that really stand out looking back.

00:02:12.203 --> 00:02:14.163
They were all good. They were solid.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.850
I went to public schools in Pasadena

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.403
and they were quite good.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.600
- So where did you do
your undergraduate work?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.070
- At UC San Diego, which was a brand new

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.560
undergraduate college them.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.810
It's now 27,500, but when I went there

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.860
there were only 2,000
undergraduates there.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.110
- And as an undergraduate
is that where you decided

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.369
to become a historian and lawyer?

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.393
- Well, it took a while,
but by the time I graduated

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:47.193
I was at least thinking
seriously about doing history.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.610
- And any teachers,
professors, that stand out

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.669
when you look back now,

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.143
sort of influencing your perspectives?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.260
- The teacher I remember
best for me in undergraduate

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.320
was Herbert Marcuse, who was
in the philosophy department,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.823
and taught a course called
theories of society.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.327
It was a very challenging course.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:17.337
It broadened my view of most everything.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.600
I think I probably worked
harder in that class

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.140
than I had ever worked in
an academic endeavor before.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.513
And I enjoyed doing it.

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:35.790
- Is that where you first got a sense of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.780
kind of the interface of
politics, society, and law,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.622
or did that come later?

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:43.100
- Politics and society, but no law.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.903
Law came really much later.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.337
I think if you had asked
me when I was a sophomore,

00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:50.887
"What do you want to major in,"

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.235
I would have said political science.

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:55.240
But there was no political
science department

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.300
at UC San Diego.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.850
And in fact I transferred to UCLA in 1967

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.167
and they said, "Well, you
have to come to summer school,

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.607
"and we'll admit you for the fall term,

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:08.850
"and you can major in political science."

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.223
I went to UCLA that summer and I hated it.

00:04:12.412 --> 00:04:14.923
It's just too big. So I went back.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.210
There was a new guy on the
faculty, a recent PhD from Yale,

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.623
John Blum's student,
named Michael Parrish.

00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:27.870
We bonded then. We're
still good buddies today.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.620
He directed my undergraduate thesis.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.893
Really got me interested in history.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.850
He's the second most influential

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.370
undergraduate teacher I had.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.020
- And then you went on to do graduate work

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.650
and get your degree at San Diego also.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.800
- That was really
something of an accident.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.270
I graduated in 1970,
and in February of 1970

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.270
was the very first lottery for
the draft for conscription.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.283
And I got a very high number.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.850
I just assumed after I graduated

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.250
I would be going to Vietnam.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.560
I got this high ping pong ball number.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.680
And I had fallen in love
with a freshman at UCSD.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.680
So I applied to graduate
school just kind of on a lark

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.100
so I could hang around, I
could play intermural football,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.580
play intermural basketball,
romance my girl.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.823
And it turned out I really
was pretty good at it.

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:31.640
So I did another year.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.360
And that's when Harry Scheiber
came to UCSD from Dartmouth.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.807
And Parrish said, "Go to Harry."

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.653
That's when my capacity to do law

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.080
and history really took off.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.347
- And Harry Scheiber, I should
mention, is here at Berkeley

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:55.690
and a professor of history and law

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.053
at Berkeley's law school.

00:05:59.194 --> 00:06:03.950
What then did you do your dissertation on?

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.493
- I wrote about a chap
named Stephen Field.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.450
Harry had run into one of his opinions

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.390
called the Chicago lakefront case.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.243
Illinois Central Railroad
against Illinois.

00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:22.610
This was a case where the city of Chicago

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.780
granted, to the Illinois Central Railroad,

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.260
the whole harbor of Chicago,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.300
and then tried to get it back.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.360
And current standards of
constitutional law at that time

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.130
said once you give it,
once you make a grant,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.544
you can't reclaim it.

00:06:35.544 --> 00:06:37.280
And they went to an
opinion of John Marshal

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.590
in the early part of the 19th century.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.180
And Field had carved out an exception

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.760
known as the public trust doctrine

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.930
that a Berkeley professor
named Joseph Sacks,

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.020
who just recently died,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.490
he used that same case to
create a public trust doctrine

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.310
in modern environmental law.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.140
This was around 1970, '71.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.400
And I went back and read that opinion

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.780
not through the eyes of Joseph Sacks

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.180
but through the eyes of Stephen Field

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.130
and figured out that what
he was really trying to do

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.682
was across a whole wide array

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:13.000
of doctrinal categories
in constitutional law

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.390
to draw really strict
and immutable boundaries

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.720
between the public sector
and the private sector.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.680
And so this was a
private sector overreach,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.530
and it was the public sector doing...

00:07:23.858 --> 00:07:25.510
The city of Chicago doing something

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.100
it had no business doing.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.230
- That is giving away...

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.300
- Giving away something
that belonged to the people

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.333
generally, the harbor of Chicago.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.750
At common law, lakes, and
oceans, private owners,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.640
you usually can only own to
the ordinary high water mark.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.240
And then the rest of that resource

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800
belongs to the public generally.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.170
And here was the city of Chicago saying,

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.900
we don't care about the
inhabitants of Chicago.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.060
We're giving it to this
very wealthy corporation.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.060
- And this was surprising
to see Field do this

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.810
because he was generally
perceived as a conservative.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.220
- Well he was a conservative,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.530
but he was a much more
systematic conservative

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.570
than people had led on.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.100
The conventional wisdom,
in the historiography,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.210
and in the political science literature,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.690
was that basically he carried

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.673
the sword for the railroad companies.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.580
And he fought off any interference
with their activities.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.050
And here was an example
that ran counter that.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.810
And if you read enough opinions,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.453
which is what I did that semester,

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.640
you could get a whole new perspective.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.240
So that article made a big splash.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.253
I was a very fortunately young guy.

00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:45.510
The Organization of American
Historians actually gives

00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:49.560
a prize to the best essay by
a graduate student nationally.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.910
And that essay won that

00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:54.460
and opened doors for me

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.190
that might otherwise have never opened.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.447
- So in this work, what
was it that was your task

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.840
to really go in systematically

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.720
and look at all of his opinions

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.460
and really see them for what they were.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.960
How important was biographical
information about him,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.330
the political context, and so on?

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.530
- Well, those two things were important

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.280
but the most important thing was to

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.140
recover the conceptual framework

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.253
with which Field looked at these issues.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:33.589
And by doing that,

00:09:35.522 --> 00:09:38.080
by reconstructing his conceptual framework

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.220
you could get a perspective
on any one case,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.810
or a bunch of cases,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.920
or indeed, lots of bunches of cases

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.410
that you couldn't get before.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.990
Basically it was an exercise
in intellectual history

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.663
in its relationship to
political and legal history.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.980
- In the political way
of looking at Field,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.840
he was typecast in such a way

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.498
that you wouldn't get
a sense of the fullness

00:10:10.498 --> 00:10:12.500
of his thinking about the law.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.350
- That's correct.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.433
- After San Diego, did
you then start teaching?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.860
How did you pursue your studies?

00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:28.110
- At the end of three years
you take qualifying exams.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.610
And so I took those and passed.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.663
Now I just have to write a dissertation.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.250
And I applied for a fellowship

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.380
from the Russell Sage Foundation

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.810
and was very fortunate to get it.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.550
It sent me to the Yale
law school for two years.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.980
And in the first year there

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.540
I learned to walk and talk, be a lawyer.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.260
I took all the first year classes.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.153
Property, and civil procedure,
torts, and contracts.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.760
And I worked on my dissertation.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.780
And then in the second
year I taught a course

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.050
in collaboration with a
regular faculty member

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.103
who is sort of supervising me as I taught.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.773
And then finished my dissertation.

00:11:08.683 --> 00:11:10.400
And then I was in the job market

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.840
and got a job at the
University of Virginia.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.250
And I've been there almost four years.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.560
- What did Yale contribute to

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.700
broaden your sense of where the law stood

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.810
in relation to society and politics?

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.881
- I'm not sure that it
changed my perspective

00:11:27.881 --> 00:11:30.260
on where law stood relative
to society and politics.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.665
But I was pretty good at society,

00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:32.911
and I was pretty good at politics,

00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.243
and I was pretty good at history.

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:36.023
And then I became a pretty good lawyer.

00:11:37.285 --> 00:11:40.460
So that I could do interdisciplinary work

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.330
in such a way that lawyers
could nod their heads at,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.201
this is pretty good stuff,

00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:46.489
and historians could nod their heads,

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:47.343
this is pretty good stuff.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.580
That was, I would say, the secret

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.860
of whatever success I've
had as a legal historian

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.200
really ever since.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.200
- What year did you go to Virginia?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.033
And then what was it
like there at that time?

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:08.803
- I went in the fall of 1975.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.250
The University of Virginia

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.993
had just desegregated five years earlier.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.850
The first women were admitted

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.060
as undergraduates five years earlier.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.060
It was about 35% female

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.520
and no more than 2% African American

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.990
when I started teaching
in the college there.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.360
The faculty, in history and in government,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.610
there was not a political
science department,

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.870
but government.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.610
There was a guy in government
named Henry Abraham,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.340
who they lured away from Pennsylvania.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.400
In the history department
was William Harbaugh,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.350
Merrill Peterson, Robert Cross,

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.450
people who had been big shots in the trade

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.600
from places like Brandeis, and Columbia,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.330
and Connecticut is where
Harbaugh came from.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.590
And they were terrific.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.623
And they were such warm senior people.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.180
They really wanted the best

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.840
for the young people they recruited.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.290
And they helped me grow a great deal.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.920
I loved Virginia from the outset.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.810
- And was civil rights issue still,

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.803
was there still turmoil at
the campus at that time?

00:13:21.933 --> 00:13:26.933
It was an acceptance of
the changing university

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.800
in the context of the
civil rights revolution.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.765
- I'd say even in town you could sense

00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:35.660
that the mores weren't all that different

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.940
in Charlottesville than what
they had been in New Haven,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.003
or in San Diego.

00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:44.783
It didn't feel like a southern town.

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:51.149
Now, it wasn't a diverse
place, like Berkeley, in 1975.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.703
Although it has evolved to
be like that 40 years later.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.640
- I like to ask my guests about
the skills and temperament

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:06.390
of what it is you do as a legal historian

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.880
in case students are watching the program.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.880
What do you see as the requisite
skills for a historian,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.423
first a historian, and
then a legal historian.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.710
- Well, the most important
thing for a historian,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.156
whatever they're doing,
history of science,

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.823
history of the presidency,

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:33.263
is curiosity and imagination.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.763
Asking new questions about old stuff.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.400
But in order to get to
answers to those questions

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.510
which are gonna be
persuasive to other people

00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:49.140
you need some skills.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.157
So you can't do the history of science

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:52.970
unless you know something about science.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.340
You can't do the history of law

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.083
unless you know something about the law.

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:05.659
Curiosity and imagination get
you started, the training,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.770
in the skills you need
to do what you want to do

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.920
to come up with the right kinds of answers

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.030
to the questions you're inclined to pose

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.760
is really a never ending process.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.720
- What about temperament?

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.070
- You've got to be patient.

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:26.543
Doing history takes a
long time to do well.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.910
We always argue with deans and stuff

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.820
that historians are
different than physicists.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.980
We don't do four papers a year.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.120
We do a big book every 10 years

00:15:40.042 --> 00:15:42.210
because that's what it
takes to do it right.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.930
So it does take patience.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.220
A lot of times it means
using scraps of paper

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.153
from archives that are hardly legible.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.010
So figuring out what they say

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.660
and then figuring out how you can use them

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.303
to say something new about your subject.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.810
- Virginia for you was a unique place,

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.960
or became a unique place,
in the sense that there was

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.760
collaboration with history
department and the law school.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.090
I noticed on your vita that
you've really supervised

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.120
an extraordinary number
of DCs and dissertations,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.103
many of them with law
students, many with historians.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.440
- When I came, my main job
was to be the coordinator

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.880
of something that was called

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.530
the joint program in legal history

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.670
which had been established
before I got there.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:43.240
And this joint program
enabled history departments--

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.760
history students in the PhD program

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.040
to take law school courses

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.460
for credit toward their PhD

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.143
up to four, of fourteen, maybe.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.860
And it enabled law students
to earn a masters degree

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.150
on the same day they would
earn their law degree

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.223
without any summer courses,
just working really hard.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.370
My job was to coordinate that.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:15.920
It turned out it was kind of
like managing a baseball team.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.896
There were a lot of moving parts

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:20.260
and the idea was to get
everybody working hard

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.260
and keep riding each of those students.

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:28.659
It's been a terrific program.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.930
Of my 30 PhDs, 26 are
teaching in law schools now.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.420
And a great number of the JDMAs

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.483
are also teaching in law schools.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.580
They're not finding jobs
in history departments,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.750
but they're finding jobs
teaching legal history,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.510
and whatever it is they know really well.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.923
Tax, or torts, or whatever
it is they know really well.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.370
- And how would you
characterize the benefits

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:04.600
for a law student or a lawyer

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.533
to have a historical perspective?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.000
- Well, there are really two.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.100
One is just curiosity about where

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.100
all the stuff they've learned comes from

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:16.210
and why it evolved the way it evolved.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.010
When the big shake ups came,

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.910
why did they come when they came?

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.680
They're all fascinated to learn that.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.500
But much more importantly is that lawyers,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.583
legal scholars have written
about the past forever.

00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:35.306
The program we have at
Virginia enables young people

00:18:35.306 --> 00:18:39.100
to do a piece of scholarship

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.410
before they begin their
professional career.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.380
And if they're really good at it

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.040
they may decide they want to be a scholar

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.010
rather than a prosecutor

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.323
or somebody who advises Wall Street.

00:18:53.483 --> 00:18:58.397
- Your major book is on anti-rent era

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.193
in New York law and politics.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.570
How long did it take
you to write that book,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.960
before we talk about it?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.363
What was your goal there?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.560
- Well my goal was to...

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.060
The basic storyline is a bunch of farmers

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.383
in the Hudson Valley,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.730
their land tenure was unlike

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.400
anybody's land tenure in American history.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.310
They owed so many days of
work per year to the landlord.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.830
If they sold the family
farm they had to give

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.983
a quarter of the purchase
price to the landlord.

00:19:39.897 --> 00:19:42.430
If they didn't pay their rent

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.960
the landlord could come and distrain,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.810
take and sell, a sheriff's sale,

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.573
without any further process,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.027
their livestock, growing crops,

00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:55.083
valuable stuff out of the barn.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.070
So these were quasi-feudal
leased land tenures in New York.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.420
And these guys, the
farmers went on strike.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.143
They declared their
independence from the landlord.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.950
And everybody who addressed

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.150
the practicalities of the situation said,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.160
well, the farmers' argument is persuasive.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.530
The problem is that there was

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.370
very difficult to come
up with a legal means

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.280
of extinguishing the landlord's interest

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.313
in the tenant's land.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.610
The rent strike lasted 26 years.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.730
That's why it took so
long to recover the story

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.870
in all of its dimensions.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.110
And everybody lost.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.890
The tenants lost, the landlords lost

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.890
because they spent more money
defending their interests

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.903
than their interests
turned out to be worth.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.083
And a lot of political
careers were shattered.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.220
Some pretty prominent
lawyers looked pretty silly

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.440
over this period of time.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.017
So it's a story about how law and--

00:21:05.371 --> 00:21:09.250
legal ideas and political ideas interacted

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.858
to generate a result that nobody liked.

00:21:12.858 --> 00:21:14.830
I thought that was a fascinating story.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.830
- And the years we're talking
about is 1839 to 1865.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.750
You clearly saw a problem
which needed a solution

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.900
with everybody having the expectation

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.300
that the problem would solve.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.500
And then by the end it wasn't
solved. It just disappeared.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.600
- Everybody just said,

00:21:39.044 --> 00:21:41.455
"This is the best we can do. Move on."

00:21:41.455 --> 00:21:44.448
- How did you research that problem?

00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:47.680
Because this is a long enough period

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.980
that there were always different reasons

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.993
for why there was no resolution.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.930
- Well, the resolution
was gonna have to come

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.610
from the New York state legislature

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.760
which had annual sessions
which lasted generally

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.793
from January until May of each year.

00:22:10.093 --> 00:22:12.730
I took the big question
and broke it down to,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.530
well, what happened in the 1840 session?

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.263
What ideas materialized?

00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:23.046
What movements toward each solution

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.690
in each session of the legislature,

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:32.599
what legal problems,
constitutional problems,

00:22:33.247 --> 00:22:35.840
did they pose?

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.000
Who emphasized those constitutional
problems or deficiencies

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.347
in the means that had been discovered

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:51.908
that created doubt about the
capacity of the legislature

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.140
to pass such a statute
incorporating those means.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.620
And then you had to recreate
the political context,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.400
the political ideas of the majority

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.330
in the state legislature,
and of the governor,

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.220
who asked the legislature
to act on this problem.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.650
All of those were factors.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.483
So basically the story
evolves almost year by year.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.880
- And this is all about solving
this particular problem.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.800
- All about solving
this particular problem.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.891
But that particular problem
was intersected with

00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:28.060
what to do about slavery,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.500
what to do about the regulation of banks,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.000
what to do about state spending
for canals and railroads.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.468
Because the same sort of political ideas,

00:23:40.468 --> 00:23:41.390
the same sorts of political ideas

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.990
and legal ideas generated
in those issue areas

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.870
also played a role in the issue area

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.130
about landlord and tenant.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.240
- And there were very
prominent politicians

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.800
involved in this.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.930
During this part, at
least part of the period,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.540
Seward was the governor of New York.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.270
- At the very outset of the story

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.460
Seward is governor of New York.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.540
And of course he's Abraham Lincoln's

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.370
chief competition for
the presidency in 1860.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.833
And then Andrew Johnson's
secretary of state.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.800
Silas Wright was regarded as

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.890
the most important democrat in the country

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.773
and a very close friend of
Martin Van Buren in the 1840s.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.863
So yes, some pretty big names.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:33.670
- In the end, there's no resolution.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.053
And as you studied this landscape,

00:24:37.914 --> 00:24:41.290
clearly what emerged for you was

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.540
a sense of the logic of the
lawyers and of the legal system

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.780
and the logic of the politicians
in the political systems.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.070
And the interface between them

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.993
often leads to stalemate, or stasis.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.630
It's almost like the stars
have to be in perfect alignment

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.270
before you can get the
politicians and the lawyers

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.000
agreed on a particular solution,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.790
to a particular policy problem,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.830
at a particular moment in time.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.460
- Give me other examples of

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.400
what would confront the politicians

00:25:22.729 --> 00:25:26.010
as they tried to resolve this

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.220
and thought they were gonna resolve it.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.770
- Well, in 1846 the governor of New York

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.014
is Silas Wright, a democrat.

00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:36.550
He's got a big democratic majority

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.500
in both chambers of the
New York legislature.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.900
He has some ideas for
how to solve the problem,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.360
and he works those into his annual message

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.600
to the legislature.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.000
One house of the legislature
goes to work on the problems.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.810
Meanwhile the other
house of the legislature,

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.600
it's the New York senate,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.680
is working on the problem
of the state printer.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.780
At that time the democrats
were divided into two

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.440
relatively identifiable factions

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.770
known as the barn burners and the hunkers,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.423
conservatives and radicals.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.240
And they have such a huge
fight over the state printing

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.550
that the conservative democrats

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.420
end up working with the
Whigs to subvert the solution

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.210
that Silas Wright, the governor,

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.713
has provided for the
anti-rent difficulties.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.620
They do this so they
can destroy his capacity

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.610
to run successfully for governor in 1846.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.590
And that's the way it works out.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.590
- And so the problem on
the table is not solved

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.290
because there's another
problem that leads to a fight

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.780
so you can't build the coalition.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.380
- That's right.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.664
And the problem on the table,

00:26:41.664 --> 00:26:44.350
nobody disputes the validity,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.860
or the utility, of the
solution on the table.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.680
It's just that the
enactment of that solution,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.120
at that moment in time,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.570
was gonna serve the political
interests of Silas Wright

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.837
and the majority of the
senate wants to destroy him.

00:27:00.898 --> 00:27:05.898
- The logic of politics
is a story of personality,

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.890
of timing, of other agendas.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.040
- And also loyalty, party loyalty,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.973
or loyalty to factions
within a particular party.

00:27:21.546 --> 00:27:24.280
- Hypothetically, is this
a problem that another

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.630
political system in another state

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.700
could have solved more easily?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.670
Or would your argument
be no, this is politics.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.930
- Well, this is politics in America.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.351
I think James Madison
wanted to make it hard

00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:43.470
for people to be able to do
things in American public life.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.460
And I think it still is.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.860
We can all think of moments

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.070
where all kinds of things
got done very fast.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:55.173
1933 or 1937 for example.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.600
But Roosevelt had just huge majorities

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.570
in the senate and the house.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.480
We had an external situation
that everybody agreed

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.493
was absolutely awful,
the Great Depression.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.020
Under those circumstances,

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.270
overcoming some of those other bonds

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.210
that make American
politics such a difficult,

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.150
and its connect with the law,

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.167
so difficult to achieve things,

00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:24.830
were sort of set aside in the 1930s.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:29.830
So, how did we do on getting
a solution to slavery?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.313
Not very good.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:36.903
We had the Civil War.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.180
- Now what about the
logic of the legal system?

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.620
It obviously plays into the logic

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.180
you just described in
the political system.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.380
How are the lawyers different

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.263
in their contribution to the
stalemate of this problem?

00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:55.330
- [Professor McCurdy] How is
their contribution different

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.573
than the politicians?

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:03.220
- How do they bring to
the table roadblocks

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.650
that are different from
those of the politicians?

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.580
- Well, because they
are very interested in

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.730
constitutional limitations
on what governments can do.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.860
So article one, section 10

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.120
of the Constitution of the United States

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.730
says no state shall pass any law

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.563
impairing the obligation of contracts.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.340
If the legislature just wanted to say,

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.710
New York legislature just wanted to say,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.710
all those old agreements
between landlord and tenant

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.903
are void, unenforceable,

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.260
that would be, everybody
agreed, unconstitutional.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.270
See, there had to be other ways

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.610
that you could massage that
constitutional language

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.360
in order to find ways to get around it.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.990
You could use the tax power.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.510
You could use the power to regulate

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.640
what one person could pass to his heirs

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.390
in the next generation.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.010
You could act on the remedies

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.823
that the landlords had
against defaulting tenants.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.897
One solution was simply to
expropriate the landlords,

00:30:07.897 --> 00:30:09.910
paying them just compensation,

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.120
to use the imminent domain power to take

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.680
their reserved interest
in the tenant farm.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.602
These are all kinds of
ideas that people put forth.

00:30:18.602 --> 00:30:21.780
Some of them were more
congruent with the attitudes

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.063
of one political party
than with the other.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.100
But the lawyers' task,
if that's the right word,

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:36.030
was to formulate the legal
barriers or obstacles

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.120
for doing what everybody wanted to do

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.250
and then to try to come up with solutions

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.343
that were congruent with the
public philosophy of the party.

00:30:47.524 --> 00:30:50.930
And that's really what the
story, my story, is about.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.020
- You mentioned one of
the founding fathers.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.020
And I'm curious, is this problem embedded

00:31:01.183 --> 00:31:05.370
in an American political culture

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.370
that really lays a foundation that says,

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.550
well, we don't want to move too quickly,

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.680
and we may not want government

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.633
to do anything in this regard?

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.520
- Maybe better not to have it do anything

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.950
than to have it do too
much of the wrong thing.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.730
But yes, the separation of power is to...

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.559
Madison said let's have
ambition check ambition.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.820
He was thinking of
departments of government,

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.033
legislative, executive, judiciary.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.660
But ambition checks ambition

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.723
also between rival political parties.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.330
He wanted, as he said in Federalist 51,

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.500
it's great to have a division of power

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.610
between the national
government and the states

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.910
because that too can act as a mechanism

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.560
to check constructive activity

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.300
which may tyrannize over minorities.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.030
And really, the whole
way the republic works,

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.780
he said in Federalist 10.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.330
But taking in a wider
variety of interests,

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.720
the interests themselves
will check one another

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.782
and make it more difficult

00:32:10.782 --> 00:32:11.960
for a majority to find common ground.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.280
And certainly all three of
those things that he forecast

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.320
as good things for our republic in 1788

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.390
were present in New York public life

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.490
between 1839 and 1865.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.843
- How did this problem
disappear, or did it?

00:32:32.794 --> 00:32:34.160
- People just said, we've done all we can,

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.130
and the controversy is over.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:41.040
- And so now if somebody buys a property

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.040
which has this clause in it
that they owe rent to somebody,

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.650
or have to present a pig to somebody,

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.050
is that still on the books?

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.682
- That's still on the books

00:32:53.682 --> 00:32:55.583
except all the pigs have been monetized.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.163
And the days of work have been monetized.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.210
The old quarter sale requirements

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.750
where if you sold your property

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:07.570
you had to pay 25% to the landlord,

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.330
that was abolished by judicial decision

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.420
in New York in 1853.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.470
Which then it opened another
door of possible attack

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.140
by the anti-rent forces.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.590
And so that's a whole chapter

00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:23.683
on how they attempt to say
even the rent is unlawful.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:31.010
So, today people do buy property in Albany

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:35.930
and Rensselaer counties in
particular in New York state.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.760
And they owe a perpetual annual rent.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.010
It's pretty nominal today.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.423
Today it's probably $40 a year.

00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:49.090
$40 a year was a lot more money in 1839

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.100
than it is in 2014.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.260
- Now it's interesting because this is,

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:59.000
in a way, a state/local problem.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.330
But in bringing the microscope to it

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.070
you're actually giving us a sense

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.463
of what happens on the national stage.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.410
When I was looking at your
book what came to mind

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:17.100
was the financial crisis of 2008

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.830
where there was so much difficulty

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.300
in getting any kind of movement

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.540
that would respond to the crisis.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.520
Is that a leap I shouldn't make,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.740
that a historian would
tell me no, don't do that?

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.639
- This historian would say

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.960
national politics and
national public policy

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.763
are inextricably linked to state,

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.930
in part because the activities

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.060
of political parties at the state level

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.060
set the range of possibilities
open to that same party,

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.390
or parties, at the national level.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.670
But more important, national politics

00:34:55.670 --> 00:35:00.670
shape state politics in
a wide variety of ways.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.750
For example, there was a major depression

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.090
began in this country in 1839.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.170
And one of the questions was,
well, what do we do about it?

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.540
And what the Whigs wanted to do

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.040
was a big flow of money
from the national government

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.770
to the several state governments.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.063
Which would enable them, the Whigs,

00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:26.660
William Henry Seward and his friends,

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.840
to use that money to
expropriate the landlords

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.133
and pay off the tenants.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.040
They thought they had
this thing figured out

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:39.040
and their president, who they
had elected, Harrison, dies,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.010
and the vice president
vetoes all the Whig plans

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.010
for generating a huge
amount of federal spending

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.003
that would be dispersed
through the several states.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:00.910
- You gave a talk and paper

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:06.010
on a classic article
written by Herbert Wechsler

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:15.690
proposing a theory that
in a way consolidated--

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.140
the article was written in 1954--

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.303
the New Deal vision of
the role of government.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.677
- Especially the role of the Supreme Court

00:36:27.677 --> 00:36:29.470
and a certain kind of controversy,

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.740
whether or not the Supreme
Court should ever intervene,

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.530
should declare unconstitutional
an act of congress

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.680
in order to protect the
autonomy of the several states.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.610
That was the question that he asked.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.680
And he came up with a general theory

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.820
as to why congresses' choices should never

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.196
be interfered with by the Supreme Court.

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:55.183
- The point I would like
to draw out of you is

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.760
part of the role of lawyers

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.650
in the national political process

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:09.650
requires a foundation in theories of law

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.860
that draw on existing theories
but modify them to support

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.240
or define the work of
one branch or another

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.897
of the government.

00:37:24.897 --> 00:37:26.409
Talk a little about that.

00:37:26.409 --> 00:37:29.420
I don't know, where was this
article published by Wechsler?

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.980
- Columbia Law Review, 1954.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.433
- And it's seminal, right?
- Yes.

00:37:36.783 --> 00:37:40.550
- It's seminal because in other words

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:45.550
it draws on bodies of law to
frame a new understanding...

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.300
- That was congruent with
the understanding already,

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.120
no theoretical foundation.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.700
There was a general understanding

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.730
among people in the New Deal coalition

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.840
that the Supreme Court
should not say no to congress

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.120
in situations involving the
protection of states' rights.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.573
That the states could protect themselves.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.720
- To do this there is a defining

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.720
of the role of the federal
government vis a vis the states.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.640
I think the term he used was interstitial

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.220
meaning that what the congress is doing,

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.800
because it's so shaped by the states

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.390
and who's in the congress,

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.360
becomes a way of saying, well,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.860
therefore don't interfere with
what the congress is doing,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.070
telling the Supreme Court.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:38.903
- That's right.

00:38:39.975 --> 00:38:42.550
This interstitial concept for Wechsler

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.000
was important for still another reason.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.963
And that is,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.000
the claim was that every
time congress acts,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.173
whether it's on interstate
highways or healthcare,

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.090
they act against the
backdrop of state law.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.160
And they tend to act only interstitially.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.510
That is, only building on the deficiencies

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.823
that exist within state law.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.170
Therefore the states and state law

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:22.170
provide a major foundation
for congressional reasoning,

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.160
whether you're a republican or a democrat.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.430
What the states have previously
done serves as a backdrop

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.540
for determining what to do now.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.800
This, argued Wechsler, creates...

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.380
It means that the burden of persuasion

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.900
to do something more than
is done in the states

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.443
is always cast upon the
congress of the United States.

00:39:48.813 --> 00:39:50.870
In other words he was
a very Madisonian guy,

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:55.870
saying that the system is
rigged to make it very difficult

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.210
for the congress of the
United States to legislate.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.670
And when they do, that's
the reason the Supreme Court

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:09.200
should defer to their
definitions of purpose

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.950
and legitimacy in adjudicating
constitutional controversies

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:19.260
in which the rights of states
as states are involved.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.760
- As a historian you are
looking at the Wechsler argument

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:29.789
and really demonstrating the processes

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.430
that the legal system requires

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.430
in order to consolidate a
political revolution, really.

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:44.000
This is consolidating
the New Deal revolution

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.510
and then it is drawn on by the courts

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:52.110
as it furthers the civil rights
revolution that comes later.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.589
- Right.

00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:56.190
So the lecture I gave in
2011 on the Wechsler thesis,

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.810
what I tried to do is
reconstruct the origins

00:40:59.835 --> 00:41:02.110
of this idea of the states

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.503
as serving as the political safeguards,

00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:07.853
the political safeguards of federalism.

00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:13.480
And I found a realist strand,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.000
or functionalist strand,
to New Deal thought,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.760
a political process theory
strand of New Deal thought,

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.130
and an originalist strand
of New Deal thought,

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:27.620
and showed how Wechsler
fused those three strands

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.450
into a new bundle that was
tighter and more persuasive

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.150
than had existed before.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.490
And that's the reason it had served as

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.520
really the touchstone
of the Supreme Court's

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.520
federalism decisions from
1954 really until the '70s,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.190
when some people began to question

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.450
whether Wechsler had been right,

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.840
or even if he had been right,

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.300
whether the conditions
of the American polity

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.230
had changed enough in the interim

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.050
such that the way
Wechsler thought about it

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.270
should be challenged.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.800
So my premise in that paper
was that the Wechsler thesis,

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.150
the argument that there are

00:42:05.036 --> 00:42:05.869
political safeguards of federalism

00:42:05.869 --> 00:42:10.053
which makes a judicial safeguard
of federalism unnecessary.

00:42:10.987 --> 00:42:14.320
That thesis could be used as a lens

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.740
for looking at currents of
political and legal thought

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.580
about federalism from the New
Deal really to the present.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.580
- Is this sort of reminiscent
of your original work on Field

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.160
in the sense that you
really have to dig in

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:36.160
either to court decisions or
to legal theorists' writings

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.900
as through time they're
grappling with a broader theory

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.640
so you can't dismiss a
piece of what they've done

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.580
without seeing the big picture?

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.440
So this is really giving us insight

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.440
into what courts, lawyers,
and legal theorists do.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.303
- I hope so.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.260
The work on Wechsler,

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.053
and the lecture I'm gonna
read today here in Berkeley,

00:43:06.206 --> 00:43:09.700
are all, in method,

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.090
traceable to my initial
work on Stephen Field

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:18.090
in that I try to take the
constellation of ideas

00:43:20.746 --> 00:43:23.640
at work at a particular moment in time

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:28.640
serious enough to see how
each of the several elements

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:33.650
of thought intersected with the others

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.090
to create a fairly coherent body.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.920
And then to see how that
coherent body works over time.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.370
- Now the thrust of
what Wechsler was doing

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.670
was to legitimate--

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.750
I'm saying this as a political scientist.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.600
- He was definitely doing legitimacy.

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:55.308
(laughter)

00:43:55.308 --> 00:43:58.590
- The nationalization
and the centralization

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.330
that were implicit in the New Deal

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.550
and then the civil rights movement

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.500
which followed Wechsler's arguments.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.340
Did you...

00:44:08.189 --> 00:44:10.310
- I was gonna modify that
claim a little bit to say

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.770
yes, he was legitimating
the centralization

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.747
that flowed from acts of congress.

00:44:15.747 --> 00:44:18.430
But the same time he was very interested

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.170
in also legitimating a
Supreme Court decision

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:25.960
called Erie Railroad in
which Louis Brandeis,

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.000
speaking for the court,
had preserved the autonomy

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.410
of the states over the common law.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:35.390
And he was trying to do both

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.300
in a way that reinforced
his bigger project

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.190
which was to say that judicial
review of acts of congress

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:46.070
has no place except to
protect individual rights,

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.980
never to protect states' rights.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.230
- In the article you point out that

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.470
something is bubbling
up from the grassroots

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.353
that suggests a swing of
the pendulum the other way,

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.210
that even as this doctrine
is put on the table,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:15.210
this legal theory,
there is dissatisfaction

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.070
which one is finding in
the political system.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.210
And we happen to be doing this interview

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.140
on the day when the Supreme Court

00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:29.100
has yesterday reached the verdict

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.260
in McCutcheon versus the
federal election board.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.120
This is clearly the pendulum

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.893
swinging in the other direction.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.053
So my question is,

00:45:44.953 --> 00:45:48.320
part of what a historian contributes

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.320
is an understanding of
the swing of the pendulum.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:59.060
- And also the seeds
that started the pendulum

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.522
in that arc in the very first place.

00:46:02.522 --> 00:46:05.260
- So what the challenge becomes is

00:46:06.419 --> 00:46:10.230
a more conservative Supreme Court today

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.230
on Obamacare, on rules for
campaigns, and on other matters,

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.804
is trying to come up with a rationale

00:46:20.804 --> 00:46:23.680
that builds on that seed

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.810
and then moves the pendulum
in the other direction.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.690
- That's right.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.765
- And the job of the legal historian is to

00:46:31.765 --> 00:46:36.580
analyze how well a job they're doing.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.580
- Not so much analyze how
well a job they're doing

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.091
but to ask the questions
why are they doing

00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.233
what they are doing now.

00:46:45.207 --> 00:46:49.890
And a presupposition is that
the seeds of what they're doing

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.900
and why they're doing it now

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.170
were begun, germinated,

00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:00.110
and organized into fairly
coherent bodies of thought

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.640
at some earlier date.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.280
So the historian's first question is

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.703
why and when did that
certain array of ideas

00:47:07.703 --> 00:47:11.540
begin to coalesce in a form
that we see recognizable

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.763
in the opinions written by
certain justices, say, in 2014.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.880
And then there's another question

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.773
which is what generates
the motion of the pendulum.

00:47:23.792 --> 00:47:28.792
What political, social,
intellectual forces were at work

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.450
that allowed those ideas
not just to germinate

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.460
but to flower.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.387
- In the lecture you're
gonna give later today,

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:39.930
and this will not be
broadcast for several weeks

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.560
so we're not taking
away from your audience,

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:47.270
you look at the sedition acts
passed by the federalists

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:50.630
and the response of the republicans,

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:53.560
the Jeffersonians, to that act.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.560
And again here is a case where
to pass the sedition acts,

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.423
and we should say what they were.

00:48:03.376 --> 00:48:08.376
The federalists looked to legal theory

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:12.960
to justify what they were doing.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.353
- Absolutely, yeah.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.820
They said the First Amendment,

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.940
which says that congress shall not abridge

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.130
the freedom of the press.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.920
They said their statute didn't abridge it.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.120
Which meant that they had to define

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.670
freedom of the press
differently than we do.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.640
But that shouldn't be
surprising that they would.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.110
That was the 18th century, after all.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.500
And so they defined it on
the basis of the common law.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.474
And the common law had
authorized abridgements

00:48:37.474 --> 00:48:39.160
of freedom of the press of all sorts

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.773
so long as, this is what free
press meant at common law,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.940
there was no censorship
of what was published.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.350
They also had an argument about, well,

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.250
why could congress pass a
law regulating the press.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.870
There's nothing in the constitution

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.150
that gives congress the
power to regulate the press.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:56.590
So they had to have an argument

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:00.260
of where congress got the
power to pass such a statute,

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.580
and not just an argument as to why

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.730
the First Amendment would have barred it.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.850
So I tried to explore that package,

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.690
the way in which the Jeffersonians
contested that package

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.970
between 1798 and 1800.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.840
And then what happened to that package

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.080
or its pieces, component pieces,

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.113
once the Jeffersonians came into power.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:26.300
And that kind of dialectical analysis

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.050
of the rise and fall
of structures of ideas

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.780
is something that I really have

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.603
enjoyed doing my whole career.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:38.470
- And interestingly
enough, this body of ideas,

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:44.270
even when the Jeffersonians come in,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.313
are not totally rejected.

00:49:49.649 --> 00:49:51.560
And for example,

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:56.560
Jefferson criticized the
concept of inherent powers,

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.190
which had been justified

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:03.460
because it was what other
nation states were doing.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.380
And he said, hey, this will work for me

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.452
when I want to acquire
the Louisiana Purchase.

00:50:09.452 --> 00:50:11.650
- Well his friends said
this will work for you.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:14.027
And he said, "Well, I'm not so sure.

00:50:14.027 --> 00:50:15.557
"We should get a constitutional amendment.

00:50:15.557 --> 00:50:18.107
"But if you think this will
work, let's go for it."

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.960
He was circumspect but
he nevertheless invoked

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.210
the very doctrine which he had
spent the previous five years

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.050
condemning in order to justify
the purchase of Louisiana.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.810
- In the sedition acts it said okay,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.620
you can publish, because
of the First Amendment,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.620
but if you publish
things that are not true

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.120
then you can be sued for libel.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.033
- You can be prosecuted and punished.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:49.080
- And Jefferson's and the
republicans' reaction to that

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.203
was this will create a monarchy.

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:56.140
What aspect of this that you're describing

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:01.000
is that as a legal aspects
are embedded in the politics,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.910
the way they are characterized

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.300
is part of the political process

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.300
and the criticism can lead
to extreme exaggeration.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.740
So Jefferson was saying
this will lead to monarchy.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.978
It will destroy the
Constitution. And on and on.

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:26.450
So this is another way in which

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.142
the interface of these two processes

00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:33.150
help us understand where we wind up.

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:34.260
- Absolutely.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.000
And surely, if the
Jeffersonian's really exaggerated

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.070
about a number of points
between 1798 and 1800,

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:43.962
and they really did.

00:51:43.962 --> 00:51:47.030
They anticipated the political tactics

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.653
we see in our own time.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:53.160
Exaggeration is also still very much

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.410
a part of the political process.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.030
You'd have to listen to MSNBC
and Fox News for a few days.

00:51:59.342 --> 00:52:04.342
- What are you left with, as a historian,

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.850
as you think about current affairs,

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:10.953
whatever your ideology is?

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:16.850
Are you left with a sense that

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.090
really things don't change much

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:25.090
because of the constitutional
order, the fragmented system,

00:52:27.025 --> 00:52:29.060
the structure of the government

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.490
that was created by the founding fathers.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:37.950
And every time somebody uses
an originalist argument,

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:42.490
which Wechsler did, it just confirms that

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:46.740
everybody is agreed about that system.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.610
But maybe that system can't help us solve

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.773
some of the new problems
that are emerging.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.450
- It might not be able to.

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:59.150
Certainly its capacity
for growth and change

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.623
has been substantial over 200 years.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.653
We might not like all the developments.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.410
We might not like, as I suggest,

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.690
happened in the aftermath
of the Sedition Act crisis

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.190
is that certain ideas which people

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.860
had dismissed as ridiculous and impossible

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:20.930
suddenly became feasible, feasible again.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.540
So there's always change

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.823
in the American constitutional
and political orders.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.740
They don't always lead to the solutions

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.610
on particular policy questions,

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.300
or to a kind of political culture

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:40.300
that we might wish we had
in our more utopian moments.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.800
So, I'm hopeful for the future.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.210
I don't suggest that my
career of scholarship

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:54.133
in any way suggests that
problems can't be solved.

00:53:56.105 --> 00:53:59.743
But it does suggest that it's difficult.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.333
And maybe it was designed to be difficult.

00:54:04.333 --> 00:54:05.850
- One last question.

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:10.270
How would you advise students
to prepare for the future,

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:14.730
especially historians and lawyers,

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.120
as they deal with the set of problems

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.703
they're gonna have to deal with?

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.510
- Well my favorite
admonitions along those lines

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:31.510
came from Louis Brandeis, who said,

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.630
deal with problems in their context.

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:40.200
Deal with situations. Get
to the bottom of the facts.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.960
Don't worry too much about theory.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.260
Generate a good result.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.660
Be, in other words, pragmatic.

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:55.180
And I think pragmatic politics
or pragmatic lawyering

00:54:57.234 --> 00:55:01.220
are to be much more valued than
ideologically laden politics

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.433
or ideologically laden law.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.840
The heroes in my anti-rent book

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.410
are the very fine lawyers
who tried to transcend

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.543
the particular interests of everybody,

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.830
come up with solutions that would work,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.070
and to think of ways in
which those solutions

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.980
could be melded, in logical ways,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.050
into the party's public philosophy

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:26.750
so it would have a good chance

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:30.023
of resonating with the legislators,

00:55:30.023 --> 00:55:34.460
resonating with their
constituents, and getting enacted.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.500
The guys I really don't like in that book

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.260
were the ideologically driven,

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:46.230
politically opportunistic types.

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.163
Unfortunately we have many of those,

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.170
many more of those, at work
in American politics today

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:57.053
than we have of the Brandeis-like

00:55:57.053 --> 00:56:02.053
pragmatic lawyers and pragmatic
policy-oriented politicians.

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:06.430
- Well, Professor McCurdy,
thank you very much

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.890
for coming to deliver
the Jefferson lecture

00:56:10.787 --> 00:56:12.670
and being a guest on our program

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:17.130
to talk about being a
historian of the legal system.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.380
