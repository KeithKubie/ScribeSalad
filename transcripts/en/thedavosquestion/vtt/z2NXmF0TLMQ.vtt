Loic: I'm also video blogging Davos, and my
answer to the question is very very simple.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.139
That's what Davos is all about.
I think what everybody should do in 2008 to

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.530
help the world make a -- become a better place
is to think outside of our box and outside

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.330

open your mind and try to focus an hour or

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.920
two or more a day on something else than what
we can bring.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.899
Like Nicholas Negroponte for example you know
creating the one laptop per child PC a few

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.190
years ago and launching it now.
That's fantastic.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.150
