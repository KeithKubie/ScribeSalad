00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.470
it seems that memory is random some

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480
it seems that memory is random some
 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.500
it seems that memory is random some
things we recall better than others it's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510
things we recall better than others it's
 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.269
things we recall better than others it's
probably not random it's just that we

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279
probably not random it's just that we
 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.970
probably not random it's just that we
don't always understand what makes one

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980
don't always understand what makes one
 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.600
don't always understand what makes one
experience more memorable than another

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610
experience more memorable than another
 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.820
experience more memorable than another
one way to wrap your head around this is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830
one way to wrap your head around this is
 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.120
one way to wrap your head around this is
to think about emotional memory anytime

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130
to think about emotional memory anytime
 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.580
to think about emotional memory anytime
we experience something in a heightened

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590
we experience something in a heightened
 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.950
we experience something in a heightened
emotional state we're more likely to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960
emotional state we're more likely to
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.619
emotional state we're more likely to
remember it for example most of us who

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629
remember it for example most of us who
 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.500
remember it for example most of us who
are baby boomers remember exactly what

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
are baby boomers remember exactly what
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.600
are baby boomers remember exactly what
was happening to them the day that

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610
was happening to them the day that
 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.060
was happening to them the day that
President Kennedy was shot but it's

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
President Kennedy was shot but it's
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.160
President Kennedy was shot but it's
unlikely that we remember what was going

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170
unlikely that we remember what was going
 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.920
unlikely that we remember what was going
on the week before or the week after so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930
on the week before or the week after so
 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.229
on the week before or the week after so
there are experiences that taint or

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
there are experiences that taint or
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.210
there are experiences that taint or
exaggerate certain memories that make

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220
exaggerate certain memories that make
 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.570
exaggerate certain memories that make
them fix into our memory stores better

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580
them fix into our memory stores better
 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.290
them fix into our memory stores better
than others

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300
 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.180
to be malleable that is they seem to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190
to be malleable that is they seem to
 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.970
to be malleable that is they seem to
change over time and I've had the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980
change over time and I've had the
 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.770
change over time and I've had the
experience i'm sure many of us have had

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
experience i'm sure many of us have had
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960
experience i'm sure many of us have had
the experience where we go back to a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
the experience where we go back to a
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.260
the experience where we go back to a
place and we're convinced that it's on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
place and we're convinced that it's on
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.600
place and we're convinced that it's on
the other side of the street or there's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
the other side of the street or there's
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700
the other side of the street or there's
something different about it and yet

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
something different about it and yet
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.880
something different about it and yet
that hadn't occurred and what happens is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
that hadn't occurred and what happens is
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310
that hadn't occurred and what happens is
that memory is basically stored in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
that memory is basically stored in
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740
that memory is basically stored in
little neurochemical packets in the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
little neurochemical packets in the
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.430
little neurochemical packets in the
brain and there are a lot of

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440
brain and there are a lot of
 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.960
brain and there are a lot of
physiological processes that can affect

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
physiological processes that can affect
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420
physiological processes that can affect
those neural chemical packets so they

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
those neural chemical packets so they
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850
those neural chemical packets so they
can be changed and our memories can

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
can be changed and our memories can
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.180
can be changed and our memories can
deceive us very often
