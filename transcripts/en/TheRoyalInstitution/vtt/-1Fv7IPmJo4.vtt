00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.440
So can I ask you to sit down?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.580
Martin, you are a consultant head and neck
surgeon at UCLH,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.840
and you Francesca are a soprano singer

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.590
from the Royal Opera House Jette Parker Young
Artists Programme.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.769
And what we are going to do is use this rather
alarmingly large piece of equipment

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.480
to have a look at a larynx in action, I understand.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.579
We are.
- OK, so what actually is this?

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.559
So this is equipment we use in the clinic
in the hospitals every day.

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.429
And it's a nasal endoscopy stack,

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.480
and we use it for looking at the throat and
diagnosing people.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.520
Can we actually do that now?
- Absolutely we can.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.660
Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.819
What's the actual device like?

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.260
What we've got here is, it has three bits
to this.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.200
We got a light source here.
We've got a processor.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.640
And we've got a strobe light generator.
This itself is the endoscope.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
In the old days these used to have, they were
fibre optics,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.140
and so you'd get an image that was made up
like the eye of an insect.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
Nowadays we are fortunate enough to have very
high definition cameras.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130
Much better than the ones in your phones.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.450
Right on the end so we can see right inside.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.609
OK, so can we do that now?
Is that alright with you?

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.640
So we're going to drop the endoscope down
actually to look right at Francesca's larynx.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.240
That's precisely what we are going to do.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.439
You'll be able to see the image on the screen
here.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.740
OK, thank you very much.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.719
Just breathe gently through your nose.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.001
Relax your shoulders.
This is going to tickle a little bit.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.040
Could I see the screen, Idris?

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.780
Thank you very much.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.240
Is that the back of the nose?

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.481
No, we're actually going through the nose
at the moment.

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:51.460
The nose is very important for the voice actually.
It's an air conditioning device.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.880
It warms, humidifies, filters the air that
we breathe

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.359
to make sure that everything that we breathe
in is nice and clean.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.460
That's why it's bad to breathe through your
mouth.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.120
And that's the larynx?
- It is.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.980
So what we are looking at there is a very
alien looking thing, isn't it?

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.970
It's the larynx in the middle of the view
there.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.360
The vocal cords are the two grey things moving
in and out, forming a V-shape in the centre.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.380
The big floppy thing is called the epiglottis.
It's like a trap door.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.970
It stops food and drink going down the wrong
way.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.820
And the two round things towards the back
are called aritenoides.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.940
They are bones that move the vocal cords in
and out.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.240
Francesca, would you feel OK to sing a note
for us?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.240
- OK.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.440
Any note? Just go for it?
-Absolutely.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:48.760
[Sings note]

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.710
I could hear and I could see that the larynx
came together, but I couldn't see the moving.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.840
You'll see it now. We've now switched to a different light source.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.960
It's going to flash light out of phase with
the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.280
fundamental frequency of the sound that she
makes.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.340
Basically strobing like in discos, when I
was a young man a long time ago,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.540
it slows down movement. You should see this
here.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.520
So if you'd like to make a slightly higher
frequency sound, Francesca.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.000
[Sings high pitched note]

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.920
Very good.
- Fantastic.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.320
I could feel that.
- Very well done.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.160
Could you do a glissando for us? From as
low as you can to as high as you can?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.200
This feels so weird.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:48.560
[Sings a glissando]

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.480
Beautiful, so you can see the vocal cords lengthening
and shortening.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.960
[Applause]
