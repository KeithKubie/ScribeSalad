NADAV: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.651
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.190
Good afternoon and welcome
to Talks at Google Cambridge.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.710
I'm honored today to
introduce Samantha Lakin.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.670
Samantha is a Cummings
Foundation fellow and a PhD

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.120

and of Brandeis University.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.659
She has interviewed and
research Holocaust survivors

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.514

She continues to work with
the World Health Organization

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.630
on worldwide gender issues.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.100
Samantha has

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.720
Samantha's research
explores the stories

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.790
of survivors of the 1994
Tutsi genocide in Rwanda

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.540
and how their experiences affect
their current communities.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.600
She focuses on
memorials, rebuilding,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.490
and the transitional justice
of the Rwandan community.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.100
Please help me welcome
Samantha Lakin.

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:27.600
SAMANTHA LAKIN: Hi.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.220
Thank you so much
for joining me here.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.760
My name is Samantha
Lakin, and Nadav said,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.530
I am a current PhD
student at the Strassler

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.570
Center for Holocaust
and Genocide Studies

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.240
at Clark University.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.980
And what I want to
do today is give you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.960
a little bit of
information and insight

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.440
about my journey working
with survivors of genocide

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.690
and conflict and also looking at
issues of transitional justice,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.130
of how societies recover from
conflict and genocide to peace.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.790
And I'm going to do that
in a very special way, what

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.650
I feel is very special.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.639
I'm going to do that by taking
you through a number of themes

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.080
and stories that highlight the
post-conflict and post-genocide

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.240
landscape in Rwanda
today, to give you

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.960
a sense of those types
of places and spaces

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.550
that I've been able
to enter while doing

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.900
this work for the past six
years and to help you rethink

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.280
and reframe your own
conceptions of post-genocide and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.510
post-conflict justice,
whatever that means to you.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.440
And I'm hoping that by
the end of this talk,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.890
you'll have seen some new
things, seen some new sights

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.810
through the photos, much
most of which I've taken,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.960
and also learned to think
a little bit differently

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.540
about the successes and
challenges that we often

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.300
experience through the media
or through other stories

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.830
that we've heard sitting
here in Cambridge

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.780
and how they affect
people in Rwanda

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.090
and around the world writ large.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300
So the talk today is
called "From Genocide

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.200
to Dignity and Justice."

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.730
And basically, the main
questions I want to address

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.900
are these-- I want you to
think about what themes make up

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.239
the landscape of
post-genocide Rwanda.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.530
And don't worry if you don't
know too much about Rwanda

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.946
right now, because I'll be
giving you a bit of information

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.656
in a minute.

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:24.030
And the second
thing I want to do

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.740
is challenge us to rethink
our framing and assumptions

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.010
about conflict and recovery
and to use the stories that I'm

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.840
going to tell you
and the experiences

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840
that I'm going to share
with you to understand

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.050
these realistic goals,
developments, challenges,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.220
and areas for
future involvement.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.590
And while I was speaking
with Nadav beforehand,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.280
this subject sounds like
something about genocide

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.230
and death, my goal is actually
to get us thinking differently

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.020
and reframing our ideas and
conceptions about what recovery

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.440
means to a place where
we're not sitting depressed,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.550
thinking about how Rwanda was
in 1994 but we are thinking

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.550
about ways that transitional
justice and other justice

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.330
initiatives can really
help societies recover,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.890
and thinking about that in
a realistic and focused way.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.390
So when we think of
post-genocide Rwanda,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.529
what comes to mind?

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.008
Is it something like this?

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.130
Or is it something like this?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.970
The first photo is from one
of the National Memorial

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.130
sites to genocide
in Rwanda and shows

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.740
some of the scars and the
bullet holes, for example,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.070
on the skulls of
genocide victims.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.840
This contrasting image
speaks about three women

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.470
who graduated from
Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.450
running and having
fun in their village

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.300
on the day of their graduation
in their cap and gown.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.390
So very contrasting
images to get us started.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.870
So I want to give you
a snapshot of Rwanda.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.870
So basically, Rwanda is a
country in Eastern Central

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.030
Africa, and I'll show you a map
in a minute, where there are

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.450
about 12 million people living.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.890
The languages are
Kinyarwanda, English, French,

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.940
and some Swahili spoken.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.710
Most of the country is
Catholic or Protestant,

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.220
with a small minority of Muslims
and non-affiliatedd religious.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.640
It borders Burundi,
the Democratic Republic

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.860
of the Congo, DRC, Tanzania,
and Uganda, but what's amazing

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.220
is it's approximately the
size of the state of Maryland.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.720
So

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.660
when you look at the map, if you
haven't seen where Rwanda is,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.120
you'll be pretty amazed.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.110
That little red dot in
the Central East of Africa

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.240
is the country of Rwanda.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.100
Looking at the entire continent
of Africa, that small map,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.140
that small red dot is
the country of Rwanda.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.540
So it's very small
territorially.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.720
And I want to give you
a little bit of history

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.380
about the genocide in Rwanda.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.619
I don't want to focus too
much today on the history.

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:07.910
That's not what I'm here to do.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.700
What I'm here to
do is really help

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.360
bring you into some spaces
about the reconstruction

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.670
and reconciliation
processes in Rwanda.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.060
So I'm going to go through
this a little bit quickly.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.294
If you have questions at
the end, please let me know.

00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:21.960
But I just want to
give you a background

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.330
so you can have an
understanding of what happened.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.950
So in 1994, there was a genocide
that took place in Rwanda.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.950
The population at the time
was about 84% Hutu, about 15%

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.790
Tutsi, and about 1% of
indigenous Twa people.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.300
And the story goes
that-- the history

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.540
goes that the Belgian
colonial powers helped

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.570
construct these identities--
Hutu, the majority, Tutsi

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.860
the minority, and also
had put Tutsi in power

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.690
as indirect rulers during
Belgian colonization.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.110
And this created a lot of
conflict between the Hutu

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.790
and Tutsi communities.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.650
And I'm saying communities
because Hutu and Tutsi are not

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.820
exactly ethnic identities.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.780
In Rwanda, everybody speaks
the same language, Kinyarwanda,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.670
and had come from
similar backgrounds.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.990
So these divisions
were not particularly

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.630
salient or meaningful until
the Belgian colonizers

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.670
came to power.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.310
So again, they favored the
Tutsi, who basically they

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.410
gave a lot of positions to you
in government and in education.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.040
And after that, the Hutu
extremist government

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.680
came to power in the
First and Second Republic

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.750
and started to persecute the
Tutsi population between 1959

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.750
and 1994.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.830
In 1994, on the 6th of
April, that Hutu hardliner

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.930
president,
Habyarimana, his plane

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.260
was shot down on
the 6th of April.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.700
And on the 7th, the
Rwandan Armed Forces

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.170
and the Interahamwe Militia
started the systematic killing

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.080
of Tutsi and moderate Hutus.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.190
And as we know, many of us who
were alive during this period

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.800
or who were watching the news,
the international community

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.680
really abandoned Rwanda.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.380
We've even seen recent articles
come out in "Foreign Policy"

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.410
that heads of state
in the United States

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.530
knew what was going
on and were concerned

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.110
about calling it a genocide
because of what intervention

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.030
would mean.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.050
And so these debates are
ongoing, but in Rwanda people

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.330
generally feel that
the United Nations

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.980
and international
community let them down.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.620
So the killings began, and
there were about 100 days

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.049
of genocidal killings all
throughout the country

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.640
with very popular involvement.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.059
So killings on the ground,
we call it low tech

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:47.330
killing with machetes and clubs
and other household and farming

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.320
weapons.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.510
And on the 4th of July in
1994, the Rwandan Patriotic

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.850
Front and the Rwandan
Patriotic Army,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.520
who had been in exile
in Uganda, came in,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.820
took control of the
capital city of Kigali,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.230
liberated the
country, and started

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.930
to form a transitional
government.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.540
So that's the history
we've got of what

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.650
happened during the genocide.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.550
So the current RPF, Rwandan
Patriotic Front-led government

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.390
and the state in
general, has really

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.620
attempted to rebuild social
order and social fabric

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.460
in Rwanda since 1994.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.960
And the goal of the state
with regard to survivors,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.320
which is specifically
what I research,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.740
is threefold as
identified by the state--

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.610
to provide security, to combat
genocide ideology and denial,

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.590
and to reunite the country
under the Banyarwanda,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.340
that we are all Rwandan, we
are all one Rwandan people.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.780
And these ideals
are very prevalent

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.440
and have been there since the
end of the genocide in 1994

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.400
and are heavily present
in the reconstruction

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.090
that we see today.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.560
So just some statistics
about survivors before we

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.577
get into the meat,
the good stuff, where

00:09:59.577 --> 00:10:01.160
we're going to enter
into these spaces

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.570
and I'm going to tell you a
little bit about these themes

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.580
that I've identified
and the stories that

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.060
go with them, the experiences
that I've had being in Rwanda

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.430
and being with different people.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.910
But we have about 1
million genocide victims,

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.600
Tutsi and moderate
Hutu massacred in 1994.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.970
About 300,000 survivors,
with 58% women,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:27.740
64,000 or 65,000 orphans,
widows, rape victims, children

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.000
born of rape, which is a major
issue right now in Rwanda,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.700
and also handicapped.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.430
So these are some of
the scars that have

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.800
been left after the genocide.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.730
So these are the
spaces of healing

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.410
that I wanted to speak about.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.990
And I've identified
basically five categories,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.120
broad categories,
that I've really

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.420
experienced that are taking
place in Rwanda today.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.650
And as I said, they have their
challenges and their successes.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.920
And what I really want
to do is to introduce you

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.680
to those challenges
and successes

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.020
so that we can gain a really
comprehensive understanding

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.390
of how to even start
thinking about post-conflict

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.370
development.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.190
You won't be experts
by the end of the day

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.230
but I'm hoping to give
you something to take away

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:15.170
that will allow you to think
about how you envisioned

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.200
post-conflict
societies and what you

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.580
might think after this lecture.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.900
So spaces of healing,
development, recovery, truth,

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.610
and grief and Rwanda I've
identified as memory, justice,

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.360
youth and education,
psychological health and trauma

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.210
healing, and technology
and research.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.187
I'm also not going to try to
give you the standard examples

00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:42.520
today, the ones that you've
read in the news or the ones

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.976
that you've seen
a million times.

00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:45.600
What I'm going to
try to do is take you

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.260
through my experiences
over the past four years

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.980
and help, again, enter
into these spaces

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.230
that are little known and
that you might not otherwise

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.080
be able to see or access to help
us broaden our understanding.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.730
So I want you to
take a deep breath

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.450
and look at this really
beautiful photo of a sunset

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.040
in Nyarubuye, Eastern Province,
Rwanda, where my godbrother is

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.340
from and survived from.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.610
And I want you to just
take a minute before we

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.330
enter into these themes.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.020
And think to yourself what
does post-conflict mean or look

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.970
like?

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.280
We saw those two photos.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.230
Does it look more
like the skulls?

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.429
Does it look more like
the graduates, the women

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:21.720
who have graduated high school?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.803
What does it look like to
you right now, before we

00:12:23.803 --> 00:12:24.930
enter into this moment?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.550
OK, I think we're ready.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.850
The first theme I want
to address is memory.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.100
And I want to
introduce you to Omar.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.460
This is Omar, who is standing in
Nyamata Memorial Church, where

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.330
nearly 335,000 Rwandans were
massacred in early April 1994.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.380
And Omar, at 10 years old, was
only one of very few survivors.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.930
As he was a child, he was able
to hide under other people

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:04.390
who had already been killed,
and even was beaten on his legs

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.350
and had to remain
silent basically

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.650
to prove that he was dead before
the Interahamwe left, and had

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.320
escaped out of the church and
into the community of Nyamata.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.120
But what was amazing is I
have known Omar professionally

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.240
through the NGO world
and never really knew

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.090
about his survival story.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.990
But one day, we were
eating lunch in Kigali,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.000
and he said to me,
Samantha, I know

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.160
a lot about your work
documenting testimonies

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.570
and I'd like you to
come with me to Nyamata

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.890
and to actually walk
through the site with me

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.340
and document my story.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.990
And I thought to
myself, oh great.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.810
This is wonderful.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.190
It'll be good for my research.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.570
It will help my friend
Omar go through his story.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.870
But I didn't really
realize how incredibly

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.420
difficult and
emotional it would be,

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.860
not only returning to the site
but also returning to the site

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.030
with a survivor of the site
who was also my friend.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.390
And so these issues
of memory were

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.820
at play, not only the surface
issue where I can go in

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.650
as a researcher and document
people's memories of the place,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.830
the second element is not only
am I documenting the memories

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.400
but it was in the physical space
itself, which was very intense.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.210
And the third element
was, this is my friend.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.880
This is someone I know and
care about and work with.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.360
So those three things
were at play in my mind

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.360
as we began driving out of
Kigali toward Bugasara, where

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.550
the Nyamata Memorial Church is.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.670
And in this photo,
Omar in the church.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.360
The gray banner is
a memorial banner,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.220
and he's looking down
at the benches which

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.060
contain victims clothing.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.040
So those are clothing that
were either left in the church

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.810
or brought to the
church from victims who

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.100
had died during the genocide.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.220
And you can see he's thinking.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.930
And he's actually standing in
the place where he survived.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.950
He survived on the bench
that he is right in front of.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.850
And what was pretty
amazing about documenting

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.880
Omar's story is the
kind of liberation

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.870
it had for both me and for him.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.130
For me, I was trying
to be professional

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.460
and not to cry when my
friend was telling me

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.750
about his experiences,
which included listening

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.910
to the children
and women who were

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.540
at the back side of the church
by the altar, who were crying

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.950
and screaming for God.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.060
He was hearing all of this
and was recounting this to us.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.180
And I felt like I
was causing him pain.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.050
I felt like I was poking
him with something sharp

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.820
and hurting him.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.840
And I didn't want to
cause him any more pain,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.630
but he had asked me
to do this and he

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.070
wanted to document
the story and continue

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.360
to take us throughout
the church and tell us

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.620
about these experiences.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.910
And there I was, trying to
be completely professional

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.990
for my friend but inside feeling
like I was really causing him

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.440
pain and that was really
hard to deal with.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.590
And so we ended up recording
this in a video form,

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.710
and Omar now has it to share
with his future family,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.265
future children, etc.

00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:05.730
And it ended up being a
really powerful experience

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.200
but it took me really out of
my element where I usually

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.400
interview individuals
who I haven't met before

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.330
and who I don't know and don't
have a prior relationship with,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.370
trying to understand their
relationship to memory

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.510
and justice issues in Rwanda.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.820
So this was very different.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.020
And what it showed though was
how important the memory was

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.320
to him, that he
wanted to do this

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.420
as a way to honor his own
memory but also to keep it

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.760
for the future.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.330
And so one of the themes
that I wanted to go through

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.200
with memory is that
this Nyamata Memorial

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.540
site is one of the six national
memorial sites in Rwanda,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.510
and there are also many
the local memorial sites.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.820
They're often like this,
with survivor's clothing,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:56.450
skulls of survivors, caskets,
and other things left behind.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.000
But to bring in some of these
good things and the challenges,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.790
I wanted to talk
about the purpose

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.230
of having these memorial
sites and having

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.470
annual commemorations
around them.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.109
So commemoration
period begins in Rwanda

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:14.819
on April 7th every year and
lasts for about 100 days.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.230
And there are many local and
national commemorative events.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.660
And during the commemoration,
we have testimonies,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.480
poetry read, official
speakers from government

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.150
and from other communities,
often a comparative lens.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.440
And most of the
population in Rwanda

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.730
take part in these
commemorations.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.460
And so to get us
thinking, it's really

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.920
about what is the purpose
of the commemoration?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.390
At one point, it brings
survivors together

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.370
and it provides a validation
of the harms they've suffered.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.430
It can educate people.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.440
But sometimes there's also
this retraumatization.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.060
Sometimes, there are
state goals or other goals

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.610
that are at odds with
survivors' goals.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.950
And one survivor who
I spoke with last week

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.010
when I was preparing
this told me

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.540
that people can be in the same
physical commemoration spaces

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.140
and be commemorating
and remembering

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.470
different things, which I
think is something really

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.400
interesting to think
about, how people

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.710
can be experiencing
the same event

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.912
yet be remembering it and
having different reactions.

00:18:12.912 --> 00:18:14.370
So that's one of
the challenges, is

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.650
how to make
commemoration inclusive

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.846
and bring everyone in.

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:20.470
So this is, for
example, something that

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.910
happens at the commemoration.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.410
This is a photo I took of
some of the candles that

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.520
are lit as people sit in
these white plastic chairs.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.600
And you could have anywhere
between 500 to 1,000 people

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.040
at one commemoration.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.410
Sometimes, there could be 30.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.980
It depends on the
type but I just

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.890
wanted to give you
a small perspective.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.880
The next thing I want to
talk about is justice.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.760
Justice is a huge, huge subject.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.220
And part of the
benefit of justice

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.710
is that it is a large subject.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.560
So we don't have to be limited
in the ways in which we

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.540
think about justice.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.690
And I know I'm not
going to do justice

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.520
to the subject of
justice today, but I

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.480
do want to give you a
little bit of history

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.450
and take you into the spaces.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.820
So again, this Nyamata
Memorial Church.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.440
You can see those
benches and you

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.740
can see the wreaths that have
been laid on the ground there.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.430
So this is a bigger
picture of the church.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.600
So memorial sites are a
form of symbolic justice,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.710
which is one way
to bring justice,

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.380
especially to survivors.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.690
So in transitional justice,
we often think about courts.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.400
We think about international
criminal tribunals.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.860
We think about local courts.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.130
We think about the court system
when we think about justice.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.730
Automatically, when
we say justice,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.120
our mind goes to the
lawyers, and to the judges,

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.750
and to the court systems.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.010
Which is good, and there are
many, many positive benefits

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.950
from the court systems,
including holding perpetrators

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.450
accountable.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.420
One of the things,
though, that I focus on

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.400
is what happens when
the courts close

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.450
and when there is no
longer juridical justice.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.290
And that's where these symbolic
efforts, such as apology,

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.010
and memorialization,
and commemorations

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.940
come into play, which really
focus less on perpetrators

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.810
and more on survivors.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.370
I just want to go through a
story of a woman, Bernadette,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:13.220
who I met interviewing during my
fifth research trip in Rwanda.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.660
And we were sitting on the
grass at the back of the Nyamata

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.840
Memorial Church.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.420
It had been an
hour long bus ride

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.320
and we really had come,
my interpreter and I,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.780
just to interview Bernadette.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.560
Now, Bernadette was a
caretaker at the memorial,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.100
and most people didn't
pay attention to her.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.700
They didn't know
about her story.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.010
But when I met her and started
speaking a bit of Kinyarwanda

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.910
with her, I realized
she had a lot more

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:43.060
to discuss than
might have let on

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.250
with her basically
being a janitor,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.820
having a cleaning role.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.020
And I remember this day sitting
barefoot on the grass there,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.260
the three women, me, my
interpreter, and Bernadette,

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.080
asking questions about
memory and justice.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.200
And she told me,
basically, that she

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.110
had been hiding in a place that
was unfit for any human being.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.720
She was hiding in a
hole in the ground

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.920
underneath some
large banana leaves.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.580
And the Rwandan Patriotic
Front eventually found her.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.350
And she remembers them
picking her out of there

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.750
and bringing her to a safe
spot and picking the bugs out

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.430
of her clothes and hair.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.500
And she defines this as
her sense of justice, which

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.490
is the human decency
that she was treated

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.810
with in that moment
of despair, when

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.240
she thought that the world
had forgotten about her.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.860
And so it's from
that perspective

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.720
that I take an
understanding of justice,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.520
that justice can have
multiple meanings

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.630
for people in the aftermath
of genocide and conflict.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.500
In addition to those
legal forms of justice,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.060
we also have many
other forms of justice

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.410
that we may not even know about
or may not even know to ask.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.270
And one of the things
I do in my research

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.240
is try to get at those other
forms and other definitions

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.440
of justice that may provide
more meaning for policy

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.730
and reconciliation programs
than the traditional forms

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.350
of justice.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.130
So just something for us
to think about, again.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.640
These are children at the
Nyamata Memorial Church, who

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.870
are going on an
official commemoration,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.670
bringing their wreath,
which is really

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.820
a common thing in Rwanda.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.320
The next theme I want to talk
about is youth and education.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.500
So this has Gakire,
Dieudonne Gakire.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.780
And I met Dieudonne
Gakire through a friend.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.970
Gakire is the author of
"A Dreaming Child," which

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.760
is this phenomenal book about
young people's experiences

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.660
during the genocide in Rwanda.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.010
And I bring up
Gakire because he is

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.130
quite representative
of the roles

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.670
that young people had to take in
the aftermath of the genocide.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.070
Now, not every young person
is interested in the history

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.750
of genocide.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.330
And that's normal.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.000
But there are many people
in Rwanda, especially young

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.880
people, who are truly
interested in trying

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.190
to make sense and have
this psychological process

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.370
of meaning making of the
experiences they had,

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.404
whether they were two years old,
four years old, 10 years old,

00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:17.820
they're still
trying to make sense

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.490
of what happened
to their families

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.760
and also educate others.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.990
And they really take
this as a personal goal.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.290
And Gakire's curious book
is an example of that.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.790
Gakire was actually
invited to Bogota, Colombia

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.897
to attend the international
book fair there.

00:23:32.897 --> 00:23:34.980
And I had been working
with him on getting grants.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.320
And thanks to a
number of sponsors,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.080
he was able to fly for the first
time out of Rwanda to Bogota.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.997
And I remember being
on Facebook Messenger,

00:23:43.997 --> 00:23:45.080
and I said, how did it go?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.760
How was the lecture?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.480
And he said, there
were 400 people there.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.150
And I thought to myself,
400 people from Colombia

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.660
and other places came to hear
you speak about your book?

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.990
That's pretty incredible, and
the impact is pretty amazing.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.540
And just to provide
a statistic, 60%

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.380
of Rwandans living in Rwanda
are under the age of 25,

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.010
like Gakire.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:14.060
And so we have this heavy
burden but also opportunity

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.039
put on the youth in Rwanda.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.580
And there are other
incredible things

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.910
that they're doing that I
can tell you about as well.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.370
I also want to
introduce you to Henry.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.255
Henry is one of those graduates
of Agahozo-Shalom Youth

00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:27.330
Village in Rwanda.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.510
You can see his
green cap and gown.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.680
And I met Henry on my
first visit, first weekend

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.120
in Rwanda, where I was
invited to the youth village

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.570
to attend their science fair.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.500
And Henry was
actually put in charge

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.180
of the welcoming committee,
and he welcomed me as a guest.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.200
He didn't know me.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.730
I didn't know him.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.900
Those relationships you
think, OK, they're passing.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.733
I'll meet him.

00:24:51.733 --> 00:24:52.274
I'll go back.

00:24:52.274 --> 00:24:53.610
I'll start my work.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.310
It'll be fine.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.170
It turned out that I gave
Henry my e-mail address,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.110
and he started to write to me
as he began to apply to colleges

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.290
and asked me advice.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.500
And I was very apt
to work with him.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.750
He is an incredible young man.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.450
And basically,
three years later,

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:16.100
Henry is now a second year
student at McGill University.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.980
Not only did he gain admission,
but he gained scholarships

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.500
from McGill and from
private families.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.620
And we worked together in order
to make this dream come true.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.320
And it was pretty amazing,
because I can't tell you

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.830
the amount of times
that I said "Henry, I'm

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.640
sure this is going
to happen this year."

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.582
I said, "maybe in future
years, but as you know,

00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:37.180
college in the West
is very expensive."

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.810
And coming from a background
where both of his parents

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.280
were killed during the genocide,
while his mother was actually

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.810
breastfeeding him and had
his twin brother on the back.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.110
He has a twin.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.590
And what was amazing
was, I was sitting

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.390
with these two boys on their
birthday having dinner.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.210
And his brother,
Eric, said to me,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.026
"Do you believe in miracles?"

00:25:58.026 --> 00:25:59.904
And I thought to myself,
I don't really know.

00:25:59.904 --> 00:26:01.570
I don't think about
miracles that often.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.370
And he said, "Well,
can you imagine

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.340
that a boy from this
background in Rwanda growing up

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.230
with a grandmother in a
pretty poor neighborhood

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.010
is heading off to
McGill in a few weeks

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.230
with his visa, his
scholarship, his apartment,

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.480
and everything sorted out?"

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.780
And I said, "Yeah, it's
pretty incredible."

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.480
And he looked at me and
said, "No, this is a miracle.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.860
It's not just
pretty incredible."

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.330
And so he really
changed my perspective.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.770
But Henry and I are in
touch on a weekly basis,

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.310
and I'll be working with him
throughout his entire college

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.120
experience.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.570
And I'm excited for
the opportunities

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.290
that youth have both
in Rwanda and out.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.140
The last thing I want to mention
about youth is peace education.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.480
And very, very briefly,
the organization

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.400
I used to work for, Aegis
Trust and the Kigali Genocide

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.600
Memorial, started this
educational program

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.450
around peace and critical
thinking for youth.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.690
And this is another aspect of
post-genocide and post-conflict

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.070
recovery is how to reeducate
and help youth really understand

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.870
the power of their
decisions and make sure

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.990
that they can both understand
their past in order

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.730
to go forward to the future.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.640
So this shows the
story of Eduard,

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.270
who is one of the upstanders
during the genocide.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.700
And through pictures
and this exhibit,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.720
and these graphic designs take
students through his story.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.850
And then afterward, they
sit with facilitators

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.300
and go through some of the
main themes about, as I said,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.250
critical thinking, the
power of individual choice,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.630
and the power of living together
in the aftermath of conflict.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.350
So the next thing
I want to touch on

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.330
is psychological healing
and trauma healing.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.655
And as I said, I'm not
going to tell you completely

00:27:45.655 --> 00:27:48.420
the standard stories.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.410
This is a picture I
took when I saw and met

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:58.585
the all-female drumming
group, whose name is Ingoma

00:27:58.585 --> 00:28:00.550
Nshya which means "a new drum."

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:06.450
And so drumming in Rwanda is
traditionally reserved for men

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.650
and prohibited from
women, who are usually

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.850
prohibited from even
touching drums or even

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.410
approaching the drummer who
used to perform for the king.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.140
But this drum group came
about after the genocide,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.480
with Hutu and Tutsi
women coming together

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.100
of all different ages,
of different backgrounds,

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.360
of socioeconomic backgrounds,
other backgrounds,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.860
came together to learn
this and actually

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.020
to show that they are strong,
both physically in picking up

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.050
the drums and actually
drumming, and also

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.510
that they're strong
mentally and emotionally.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.290
And this is a very
interesting example

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.665
of psychological health,
because it's not what we usually

00:28:41.665 --> 00:28:44.230
think of, where people
sit in counseling groups

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.170
for individual counseling,
which takes a long time

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.050
and is very slow and is
also costly and expensive.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.920
There are amazing things about
this kind of trauma counseling,

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.880
but in Rwanda, many
people don't access it.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.650
And so these kinds of groups
which bring people together

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.060
are pretty incredible.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.920
And after I saw
this performance,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.050
I spoke to one of the
drummers and she basically

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.110
said, "You know, the group
is like a new family."

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.140
Rwandans, a lot of them
lost family, if not

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.400
entire members of their
family during the genocide.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.440
And these newly
constructed social groups

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.860
and social networks
are incredibly

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.860
important for psychological
health and trauma healing,

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.580
because the women
also talk about what's

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.110
going on in their lives.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.560
They celebrate together,
weddings, births, deaths.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.590
Everything that you would expect
a family or a broader community

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.396
to do, these women do together.

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:34.770
And there are
others and examples

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.680
of these kinds of groups
around economic development

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.180
and other development
that have this benefit

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.450
of psychological healing.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.850
This is a photo
that was actually

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.410
taken by a very
close friend of mine

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.020
who is a professional
photographer in Rwanda.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.700
And if you look
closely, the photo

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.020
is of a scar on the stomach
of someone in Rwanda.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.220
And I interviewed this person
about a year and a half ago.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.990
And he was very shy, very quiet.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.100
The interview didn't
last very long.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.910
But one of the things
that really struck me

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.860
was this discussion of scars.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.150
And I spoke to him
and said-- he told me

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.720
he was captured Interahamwe
and had some scars.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.310
And I said to him,
can you tell me

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.670
a little bit about your scars?

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.800
And what he did was he stood
up and he lifted up his shirt

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.305
and showed me this
scar on his stomach.

00:30:31.305 --> 00:30:32.680
After meeting him
the first time,

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.230
I went back to
interview him again,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.210
but I was shocked at the
kind of vulnerability

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.500
of showing this
white woman in Rwanda

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.520
this scar on his stomach.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.800
But he wanted to
make a statement,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.590
which is that some of
the scars you can see,

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.970
both the psychological
and the physical scars,

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.462
and some you can't.

00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:55.920
Some are hidden
under your clothes.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.180
Some are hidden in your mind.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:03.180
Some are hidden until something
triggers them and comes out.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.240
But the scars are living
with these people,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.770
are living with Rwandans,
and we don't know necessarily

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.020
when they're going to manifest
themselves or in what ways.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.930
And so when working in
post-conflict societies,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.810
we have to be very,
very almost vigilant

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:22.510
to the point of respect
that we can understand,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.850
coming from non-survivor
perspectives,

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.150
how to work with
survivors and others,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.220
including perpetrators,
who have of what happened

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.730
and what they have done.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.440
Now, I personally
believe that all of us

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.590
have suffered some form of
trauma or some negative thing.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.530
And it's not about comparing
hierarchies of suffering.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.610
What happened to me is
not necessarily as bad

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.120
or doesn't feel as bad
as what happened to you

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.290
or what happened to a
survivor, but the point

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.260
is figuring out what is the
human level that we can connect

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.740
on to show the most
basic level of respect

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.550
for someone who's been
through these experiences.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:04.250
And I've been very lucky to
have had the opportunity to see

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.980
scars like these, which
definitely make you

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.940
uncomfortable to have
them photographed and used

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.480
for educational
purposes, for teaching,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.710
and also to understand that,
again, the scars don't always

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.610
come at the same time.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.700
And so one thing I wanted
to mention about scars

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.210
as well is during
the 1994-- I'm sorry,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:26.160
during the commemoration
period that starts on April 7th

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.320
every year, I often get texts
on WhatsApp or on text message

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.645
and say, "You know, Samantha,
I'm not doing well."

00:32:34.645 --> 00:32:36.770
And I get a little concerned
and I think to myself,

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.810
"Well, I'm not a counselor,
and I've met people in Rwanda

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.590
and they're telling me that all
of a sudden something happened

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.210
and they're not doing well."

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.520
And so it's very
surprising the ways

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.350
in which people will
reach out to their friends

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:51.129
and other people
who they've met.

00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:53.420
And sometimes you feel I
don't have a strong connection

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.430
with that person
but for some reason

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.150
they felt they could
trust me or maybe I

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.514
was the only one online, right?

00:32:58.514 --> 00:33:00.430
Maybe I was the only one
online in that moment

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.320
and they wanted to
speak to someone.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.680
But letting them know
I'm not a counselor

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.730
but I'm here as a friend.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.450
I can advise you
in that capacity.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:10.520
But it's amazing the amount
of text messages and messages

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.680
I get during this period.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.290
And the emotional stress both
on the individual and myself,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.140
just being very completely
honest and vulnerable with you,

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:25.400
but that's the responsibility
of working in this sector,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.410
is to accept these
relationships as they are

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:33.150
and to try your best
to do what you can do.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:39.000
And none of us is perfect
but even just being there

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.690
for someone is sometimes enough.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.360
I had someone write to
me very late at night

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.940
and in the morning
wrote back and said, "I

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.362
was thinking of overdrinking.

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:52.070
And after I spoke to
you, I went to sleep

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.596
and I realized that I would
wake up tomorrow and feel maybe

00:33:54.596 --> 00:33:55.470
a little bit better."

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.760
And all I did was take a
minute to communicate with him.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.764
And I didn't know about any
of these thoughts in his mind,

00:34:01.764 --> 00:34:04.180
but what was pretty incredible
was just taking that moment

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.138
to say, "Yes, I'm here.

00:34:05.138 --> 00:34:05.975
Tell me what's up.

00:34:05.975 --> 00:34:07.310
I'm going t have to
go in a couple minutes

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.185
to get back to work."

00:34:08.185 --> 00:34:10.400
But whatever it
is, sometimes you

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.070
don't know the impact
of the people who

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.989
you are interacting with.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.750
So the last point I want to
touch on is an uplifting point

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.150
and is definitely
appropriate for those

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:23.219
of you working at Google
and working in this sector,

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.820
is technology and research.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.460
And one of the things that
has been happening in Rwanda

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.139
is the startup
company of Safe Motos.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.370
So Safe Motos has helped
Rwanda separate good drivers

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.550
from what they call
the crazy ones.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:41.370
Motorbikes are a very
common way to get around

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.250
in Rwanda, especially in
the capital city of Kigali.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.489
And most of the motorbikes
are unregistered

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.380
and most accidents also
happen on motorbikes.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.889
And so Safe Motos
has an app that's

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.610
very similar to Uber that
encourages motorbike taxi

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.920
riders to contact Safe Motos,
whose moto drivers are trained

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.770
in safety, and
there's also a record

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.610
given on how many
accidents they've had

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.950
and what kind of driving
record they have.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.130
So not only are you able to
be picked up in a safe place,

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.730
but you're also able to know
the rating of your driver,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.000
again, very similar to Uber.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.440
The two founders, Peter
Kariuki and Barrett Nash.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.480
Peter is actually a
close friend of mine,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.250
and they're doing
amazing, amazing work.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:30.030
And they also are interested
because belonging to Safe Motos

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.090
not only helps the rider but
actually helps the driver.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.120
And moto drivers are
one of these segments

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.899
of the population that you don't
really know a lot about them.

00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:40.440
You don't know if
they're a survivor.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.730
You have no idea if they
were a former perpetrator.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.060
Oftentimes, they don't
speak English or French.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.800
It's hard for Westerners
to communicate with them

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.330
but they are a huge
segment of the population.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.990
Many of them are coming from
villages or other places

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.910
to the capital city of
Kigali to drive a motorbike

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:57.150
and make money.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.514
And so they're one of
the people that we really

00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:01.180
don't know a lot
about, groups of people

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.930
that we really don't
know a lot about

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:06.190
but are heavily prevalent
in society in Kigali.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.020
And so one of the amazing things
is that authorities are often

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.030
ambivalent towards moto
drivers, as they associate them

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.710
with crime and disorder.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.430
But becoming part
of Safe Motos helps

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.880
them show that they're
legitimate people just trying

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.680
to make an income
and really helps

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.910
them gain legitimacy in
the eyes of authorities,

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:28.010
in the eyes of the
rest of society.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.680
So it actually
has a dual purpose

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.450
in helping people ride
safely and reduce accidents

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.550
but also helping in
societal recovery,

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:37.550
showing that these moto drivers
are not young men coming

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.720
to create problems in the
city but they're actually

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.761
just trying to make a living
in the best way that they can.

00:36:42.761 --> 00:36:46.630
And you can even see this is a
free concert, an advertisement

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.710
that says ride with
Safe Motos there.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.160
So they're doing
their advertising

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.681
and saying, "You want
to come to this concert?

00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:53.180
Great.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.100
Ride with Safe Motos.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.830
Be safe on your way."

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.130
It's an amazing initiative.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.070
There's been a lot of
press on Safe Motos

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.700
and they've become a
pretty incredible startup.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.060
But I think what's
amazing about them

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.470
is their commitment to
developing the sector of moto

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.590
drivers within the
post-conflict society

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:15.310
to get rid of this concept of
the young men trying to cause

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.380
problems in this city, which
is a theoretical concept

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.620
in post-conflict societies,
that the young men come

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.800
to the cities and they
want to cause problems

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.930
and they don't have
homes or education.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.730
And this is combating
that stereotype.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.680
And the last thing
I want to mention,

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:36.670
bringing it back to
memory and technology,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.840
is the Genocide Archive
of Rwanda's new web page.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.900
And so the Genocide
Archive of Rwanda

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.090
is able to bring access and
knowledge to individuals

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.030
around the world.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:53.150
They have prescanned and
prescreened all of their data

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:55.810
that they put online, where
people can watch videos.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.050
They can watch propaganda videos
of the Hutu hardline regimes

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.660
before 1994.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.200
They can find documents.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.120
They can take a virtual tour
of the memorial sites, which

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.682
is pretty incredible.

00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:10.390
And these are some of
the positive things

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.040
about this website.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.780
And some of the questions
also exists, which is how

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.440
or in what ways can
they be meaningful

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.220
for the local community
on the ground?

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.790
They have a huge reach for
people who are international

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.409
but what about survivors,
perpetrators, ordinary citizens

00:38:26.409 --> 00:38:28.200
who are living on the
ground, who might not

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.790
have internet access,
or who might not

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.220
be interested in this
kind of education?

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.120
Who is their primary audience
and how do these issues

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.730
reconcile themselves on the
same platform, the issue

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.760
of catering to a
number of communities

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.206
and a number of individuals?

00:38:43.206 --> 00:38:45.830
And so that's one of the things
that I think about when looking

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.000
at these online platforms or
these virtual tours of sites is

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.999
that, yes, a lot of people
cannot travel to Rwanda and see

00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:55.040
these sites firsthand or
understand what happened

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.680
firsthand.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:57.270
So they're getting
wonderful education

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.772
through a platform like the
Genocide Archive of Rwanda.

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:02.230
But at the same
time, we don't want

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.560
to do that at the expense
of understanding and making

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:10.190
memorials and other archives
meaningful for survivors

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.290
and former perpetrators.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.060
So I'm going to end
there for a minute.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.370
And I know I've given
you a lot of information,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.090
a lot of stories, a lot
of food for thought.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.040
But what I'm hoping is
that this has given you

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.120
an understanding of
Rwanda as an example

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.690
for post-conflict
societies writ large.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:32.930
And one of my main, core
tenets of my research

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:37.460
is that we have to go deep,
and we have to go broad.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.470
So we have to go deep to
understand that each context is

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.920
different, and that Rwanda,
what works in Rwanda, what

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.390
doesn't work in Rwanda, might
be different from another place.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.040
But at the same time,
there are themes

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.370
that cut across
post-conflict societies

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:56.194
and can help us rethink
wherever we are.

00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:58.110
And so I want you to
think back about what you

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.810
knew and believed about
post-genocide Rwanda

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.240
or post-conflict
societies writ large,

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.620
and what you've learned that
might complicate or complement

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:07.550
your initial thoughts.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.450
This was not meant to be a talk
that will clarify everything

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.520
for you, rather a talk
to get you thinking

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.020
about these issues, about
the range of issues,

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.420
and about how you might
be able to fit in.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:24.140
So I want to close with a
quote from one of my idols

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.340
in the world,
Desmond Tutu, which

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.040
is "Do your little bit
of good where you're at.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.770
It's those little bits
of good put together

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.640
that overwhelm the world."

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.920
And so it's not our
responsibly to do it all,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.390
but I hope that
today this compels

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.810
you to think about where you fit
into the post-conflict society,

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.100
even if you are sitting at
your office here in Cambridge,

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.039
or even if you travel a
little bit to some places that

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:51.830
might be considered
post-conflict, to delve

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:55.160
into their history and look
and think about what you can do

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.400
in that very, very small way,
just as I said, staying up

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.130
at night for five minutes,
WhatsApp conversation

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:05.450
kept a friend from overdrinking
and kept him waking up

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.400
the next morning and I'm glad
to say he's doing really well.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.830
What are those things that
you can bring to the table?

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.250
With that, I want
to say thank you.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.600
I want to say thank you
to the Google office

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.760
at Cambridge, to
everyone who came today.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.740
I'm happy to take
questions and comments,

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.960
but again, I really hope this
opened your eyes to a subject

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.290
that I really care about, and
that I'm passionate about,

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.650
and that I want to
share with people

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:36.250
who are hopefully also
interested in these kinds

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.340
of issues.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.880
So once again, thank you
to all of you, to Google,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.810
and I hope you enjoyed
the talk and I am very

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.541
happy to entertain questions.

00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:50.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:54.002 --> 00:41:57.380
NADAV: Hi, can you
talk a little bit more

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.590
about transitional justice and
in the context of the Rwandan

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:04.560
Genocide, maybe just
give us more details

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.554
of what happened with tribunals
and the historical facts?

00:42:09.554 --> 00:42:11.010
SAMANTHA LAKIN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.820
So as I mentioned, I'll give you
the transitional justice 101,

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.790
which we do have a Clark
seminar on transitional justice

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:20.630
at Clark University.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.360
I'm actually going to give
it to you in a minute.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.299
Don't tell any
professor who teaches

00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:26.590
that class that I've done this.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:27.700
No, I'm just kidding.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.590
They're my advisor.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.930
So basically, transitional
justice, as I mentioned,

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.550
is a type of justice
that accompanies

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:38.890
states and societies
from conflict to peace.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.580
It's employed in the case
of extraordinary crimes

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.440
and extraordinary grievances--
mass violence, mass atrocities.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.300
That doesn't only mean
in number but it also

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.680
means in scale of
participation and of targeting.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.140
So basically the concept is that
ordinary justice or ordinary

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.110
legal courts cannot really
provide justice for these

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.430
extraordinary crimes
like genocide,

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.560
crimes against humanity,
war crimes etc.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.970
And so transitional justice has
been this array of mechanisms,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.850
founded and used by the
international community since

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.240
the 1970s or '80s to address
some of these issues that

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.080
ordinary legal justice
cannot address.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.430
So in Rwanda, we
see the two forms.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:30.350
We see legal justice,
which I said, again,

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.380
focuses mostly on
perpetrators and punishment,

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.330
and what we call
symbolic justice, which

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.320
focuses more on
victims and survivors

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.450
and is more future-looking.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.090
Both are important
and both must be

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.680
there in a post-conflict
society for transitional justice

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.260
to do its job.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.620
In Rwanda, we have three
main cases that I'll mention.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.040
One is the establishment of the
International Criminal Tribunal

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.800
for Rwanda, the ICTR, which
was established by the United

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.780
Nations Security
Council in 1995.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.390
And this basically
was implemented

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.200
like the International Criminal
Tribunal for former Yugoslavia

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.460
and in the legacy and tradition
of the Nuremberg Tribunals

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.650
after World War II to try
the perpetrators, but not

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.660
only the perpetrators but
the big fish, the ones who

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.860
were the organizers,
the masterminds who

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:28.010
were instrumental in planning
and carrying out in the 1994

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.320
genocide in Rwanda.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.880
And so the ICTR, I think, was
in operation for 20 years.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.140
It closed in 2015.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.310
I do have statistics on
how many people they tried,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.570
but it wasn't too, too many.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.320
And it was also very
difficult, because it

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.520
operates with the
bureaucracy of a tribunal.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.750
So you have trials.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:46.730
You have appeals.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.210
You have a whole
mechanism dedicated.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.630
The court was also
in Arusha, Tanzania.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.660
It was not in Rwanda.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.320
So there was outreach
about the happenings

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.310
of the court in Arusha.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:03.110
There was outreach into Rwanda
but reviews are pretty mixed.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:07.120
So it goes for the big
fish and it closed in 2015.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.266
And there were some
very well-known trials

00:45:09.266 --> 00:45:11.140
that came out of there,
including the Akayesu

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:16.860
case, which proved that
rape is a form of genocide,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.260
rape is a systematic
form of genocide.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.580
And it was the first
person convicted of rape

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.690
during genocide, Akayesu.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.880
So in addition to
the ICTR, are we

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.910
have a form of local justice
called the Gacaca tribunals.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:35.530
Now, Gacaca were typically
tribunals employed in Rwanda

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:38.020
for land disputes, where
people would come together

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.040
and elders or trusted
members of society

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.730
would decide what would
happen in a dispute

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:49.920
and in 2002, I think, or 2005,
this was re-adopte in Rwanda,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.600
where there was a local
selection of judges,

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.850
and local individuals
would come together

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:58.710
in their communities,
literally on the grass.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.860
Perpetrators would confess
what they had done,

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.710
and survivors would
forgive them or would then

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.480
have more knowledge.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.090
One thing came out of Gacaca
was where people were buried,

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.840
which was a huge deal.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.430
And so these Gacaca courts were
localized forms of justice.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.220
They also have their critiques
in which the judges were not

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:19.970
trained judges.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.940
There were no lawyers
or representations.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.523
So there are questions
of due process,

00:46:23.523 --> 00:46:26.312
but basically the
purpose was that the ICTR

00:46:26.312 --> 00:46:28.520
and the national courts
couldn't try the large number

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.607
of perpetrators.

00:46:29.607 --> 00:46:31.190
The prisons were
overflowing and there

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:34.260
had to be some practical
form of transitional justice.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.450
And so the Gacaca courts
were formed in order

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.020
to try the lower
level perpetrators--

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.410
people involved in
property theft, people

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:45.310
involved in assisted killing
and murder, things like that.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:48.710
So those were the Gacaca
courts, which closed in 2012.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.980
And then we have
this third section,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:54.200
which is the symbolic justice,
which are more what I discuss

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.130
and absolutely
more what I study,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.930
which are memorializations,
commemorations, creation

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:06.780
of memorial sites, burial,
creation of families,

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.370
artificial families in the
aftermath of the genocide,

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.560
official apologies, security.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.150
These are all the things I would
put under symbolic justice.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.740
So that's the range that
transitional justice

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.648
takes specifically in Rwanda.

00:47:20.648 --> 00:47:23.090
AUDIENCE: How do you
think our understanding

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.260
of post-conflict
societies in recovery

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.184
affects how we look
at ongoing conflicts?

00:47:28.184 --> 00:47:29.850
SAMANTHA LAKIN: That's
a great question.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:30.670
Thank you so much.

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.460
So I think it's interesting
because I was actually

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.570
speaking to my father
yesterday, who's here.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:39.817
And he said, "Haven't
we learned anything?"

00:47:39.817 --> 00:47:41.900
And I think a lot of people
ask that-- "Haven't we

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.740
learned anything?"

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:46.480
The 20th century is known
as the age of genocide,

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.040
the age of conflict.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.800
Haven't we learned anything
in how we have seen and viewed

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.071
post-conflict societies and
the challenges they have?

00:47:56.071 --> 00:47:57.320
Don't we want to prevent that?

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.670
And of course we do.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.480
I think the difficulty,
though, is that there are so

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.760
many factors at play that when
a new conflict arises, what

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.700
worked or didn't work, for
example, in Rwanda in 1994,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:12.730
in terms of intervention, may
or may not work in Syria today.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.030
It may or may not backfire.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:18.130
And that's why those local,
specialized analysts are just

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.390
as important as the ones
working at the broad level.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:24.580
I think, though,
what's particularly

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.390
important is fact-finding
in post-conflict

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.160
when the conflict has subsided.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.140
Now, of course, conflict doesn't
end when the fighting ends.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.330
There's elements of
protracted conflict

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.160
that continue long, long after
a ceasefire agreement is signed

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.790
or fighting physically ends.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.000
And so I think looking at
the complexities and also

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.710
the fact-finding, understanding
what really happened,

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.930
what were the patterns
of violence, what

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.160
were some of the triggers,
and analyzing these things,

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.690
analyzing propaganda
and dehumanization

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:01.780
tactics, groupthink and group
mentality, masculinities

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.200
and initiation into
masculizing groups,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.940
economic problems-- all
these factors at play

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.640
help us gain a really good
understanding in hindsight

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.540
of what happened post-conflict.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.580
How do we now apply
that to what's

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.762
going on in active conflict?

00:49:19.762 --> 00:49:21.720
And I think that's the
million dollar question.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.303
So I don't have a
great answer for you

00:49:23.303 --> 00:49:25.750
but I do think that
understanding the patterns

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.260
and accurately
understanding what's

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.430
happening in current
conflicts is really important,

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.220
and doing more documentation
as the conflict's going on.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.270
One very quick
example is Burundi.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.160
So we have an ongoing
conflict in Burundi,

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.080
the country next to Rwanda.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.734
And some analysts from the
State Department and elsewhere

00:49:43.734 --> 00:49:45.150
are basically
trying to figure out

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.090
what's happening
on the ground now

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.540
and to correctly identify
what kind of violence this is

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.390
and what factors are happening.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:54.580
So that when they
are deciding how

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.130
to intervene, which has been
taking a long time but I'm

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.880
hoping will happen
soon, when UN and others

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.940
Western states and other
African states and AU

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.690
are deciding what to do, if
they correctly, more or less,

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.020
identify the elements
of the problem,

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.760
they can create
better solutions.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.259
And so that's where
I'm hoping we're

00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:16.030
going, which is being able to
disaggregate and then build it

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.420
back, disaggregate into
themes and build it back up

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.000
to prevent.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.680
But unfortunately, what
works in one place might not

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.550
work in other place.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:23.633
And we've seen that a lot.

00:50:23.633 --> 00:50:25.480
So I'm not trying
to be pessimistic.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.750
I'm just trying to say
that it's a lot of work

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.992
and we have to do it well.

00:50:32.992 --> 00:50:34.450
AUDIENCE: I like
your presentation.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:43.970
As a north Rwandan who
went deep into the subject,

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.660
not only you read the
books like any other person

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:52.220
could read the book
but you made an impact

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.260
and will make an impact
because we have met those

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.501
you have shown us who were
victimized during the genocide.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.040
In your experience,
it's really sad

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.100
to get to the point of
justice, as you have explained,

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.320
transitional and
the other phases,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.730
three phases, what do you think
of bringing in justice when

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:27.560
we hear, the whole
world, hear people

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:31.830
who deny the existence
of this genocide?

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:36.160
And mostly, let's say we live
here in the United States

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.280
and elsewhere in Europe,
some of the perpetrators

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.220
have fled the country and
they are all over the world.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.280
And they have come
about this denial

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.410
that the genocide
has not taken place.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:56.070
Others will come
to say, "Well, we

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.710
accept that the genocide
has taken place,

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.390
but there was a
double genocide."

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.915
Another group will come
and say, well, this

00:52:05.915 --> 00:52:09.520
is a group of the
deniers of genocide

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.590
yet they're not Rwandans.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.300
They're not a group of
Rwandan perpetrators,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.010
and they have not been
even in the country.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:21.990
They go ahead and if I could
use the world "preach" here

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.715
and tehre about
that kind of denial.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:34.170
How will you bring that
into being or bringing

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:37.370
a sort of justice to
these kinds of stories

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.290
around the denial of justice?

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:40.810
Thank you.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.920
SAMANTHA LAKIN: Thank
you, Professor Bayingana.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.130
Professor Bayingana brings
up a really great point,

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.880
which is what forms
does denial take

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.820
and what do we do about it?

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.692
Denial is a problem.

00:52:50.692 --> 00:52:51.650
And it's not a new one.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.280
We've seen it with Armenia.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.110
We've seen it after
the Holocaust.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:57.470
After almost every
major conflict,

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.172
we have people who
for some reason,

00:53:00.172 --> 00:53:01.630
whether it's
political or personal,

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:06.760
cannot handle the truth of
what happened and try to give

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.960
another example.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.030
So one way this happens
is by completely denying.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.040
One way is by
manipulating the facts

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.030
and saying it was not a
genocide, it was a civil war.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:21.160
Or, yes, Tutsi were killed in
1994 but also there were crimes

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:29.450
against Hutu in 1995, "96, '97.

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:31.860
That concept of double
genocide, that it was not only

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.040
Tutsi who were killed but after
that Hutu were killed as they

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.816
were exiting the country
and were targeted,

00:53:37.816 --> 00:53:40.350
that's the theory
of double genocide.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.590
And to that I would
say two things

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.420
about dealing with deniers.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.110
One way we can deal with
deniers is to ignore them,

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:49.640
is not to give them
a platform to speak.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.940
Because when deniers are
interviewed on television

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:56.420
or they have a chance
to write in media.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.920
And of course,
there is free speech

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.295
in these countries
you mentioned.

00:53:59.295 --> 00:54:01.100
People can publish
anywhere they want.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.160
But if they're known denialists,
and if they are causing harm

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.992
to people, there are ways is
to choose someone else, someone

00:54:07.992 --> 00:54:09.700
who maybe has a more
balanced perspective

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:14.100
and is not considered an
outright denialist when

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.830
any news outlet
interviews people.

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.100
One survivor told me that denial
feels like the genocide is

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.580
happening over again.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.560
Because basically
their family were

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.369
killed during the genocide.

00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:27.910
And then when someone
denies it, they

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.290
deny your right
of acknowledgment.

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.810
They deny your right to grieve.

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:35.790
They deny your right to
feel how you want to feel.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.417
They deny what happened to
you, and they're harming

00:54:38.417 --> 00:54:40.500
your ability to move forward
because you cannot be

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.050
recognized.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:42.800
And we see this kind
of in-limbo situation

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.880
in Armenia, where
people are very

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.130
hurt because their
situation and their reality

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.800
is not being recognized.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.310
And so I think besides
this is ignoring and not

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.030
engaging, because
denialists will keep,

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:57.940
as you said,
preaching, regardless

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.510
of what factual evidence comes.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:05.050
I think the second point is
this categorization that's

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:05.940
really helpful.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.540
I think the legal crime category
is genocide, war crimes, crimes

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.860
against humanity,
and all that has

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:18.110
been put into developing these
very thorough categories is

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.000
helpful.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.690
So when the UN deemed that
Rwanda was a genocide,

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:25.980
there are facts and evidence in
terms of fact-finding missions,

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.340
in terms of intent,
intent to destroy

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.100
a group in whole or in part,
intent to destroy the Tutsi

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.790
people.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.750
These were present and
proven in the case of Rwanda.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.360
And so it is a
genocide, according

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.490
to international legal order,
if that's what you respect.

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:44.180
And most people, I
think most countries do.

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:46.360
And so sticking to
those definitions

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.560
and the facts is where
you can't go wrong.

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.200
At a certain point, if you
start getting into the emotion

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.050
and trying to convince
people, it can get very messy,

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.170
but the facts of the matter
are the ones that stick there.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.460
And the ones that are
grounded in international law,

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.170
international theory,
that's where I think we

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:07.870
can really keep continuing
with helping to fight denial.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.970
But denial is very
harmful for everyone,

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.970
and it's a big, big issue
in Rwanda right now.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:15.820
So thank you so much.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.920
Thank you, everyone.
