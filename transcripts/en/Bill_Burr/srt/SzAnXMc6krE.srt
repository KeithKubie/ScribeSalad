1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,400
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,650
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,650
Uh,

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,870
just checking in on you,

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,240
just seeing how you weeks ago and how
things are shaking out. Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,460
If I get one more fucking tweak on pill,

7
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:28,990
what do you think is the carrier
Irving for fucking Isaiah Thomas Trade?

8
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,121
What do I think?

9
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:35,200
I think Danny Ainge is known what
the fuck he's doing up until now.

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,360
I think it's the trickle down effect to
the Kevin Duran trade where you for some

11
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:44,350
reason can just not have enough fucking
stars regardless of what your players

12
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,950
are doing.
Do you think they gave up too much?

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,380
Only time will tell. Only
time will tell. I will tell.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,170
I would say that I
love, uh, Isaiah Thomas.

15
00:00:56,171 --> 00:01:00,160
And what sucks about that trade was he
was on his way to being like the fucking

16
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:04,120
big Papi of, um, of the Celtics.

17
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:07,450
Like he was going to have a
fricking street named after
him the way he was going.

18
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,860
So it's a,
it's a real shame and a,

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,730
it was just a great dude.
And, uh, I, you know,

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,140
I, I dunno, I just thought he was a,
he fit in real well with our city.

21
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,720
You know, he was on his way to be
in a great Celtic I thought. And um,

22
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,990
we gave a bunch of fucking people to
get another guy who basically does the

23
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,320
exact same thing, has the same
amount of stuff. I don't know.

24
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,100
He's a little bit bigger.
I don't know who the fuck knows.

25
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:41,101
All I know is the team that Isaiah
succeeded with last year no longer exists

26
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:44,080
here. So, you know, I don't know
what the F I don't fucking know.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,420
I hate all of this shit.
They gave up a first read

28
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,070
[inaudible] [inaudible] league.

29
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,070
Like how the fuck you get into the NBA
to that level or any sport you need to

30
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,170
get a fucking life when you start knowing
what people fucking make and all of

31
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:05,260
that shit. Like I, I don't, I, that's
where I tap out. It's just like, oh,

32
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,300
we traded that guy for that guy.
I will see what happens.

33
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,270
When does the season start
in a couple of months. Yeah.

34
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:15,271
I fucking think about it then either it's
going to work or it's not gonna work.

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,210
Um, there's a couple of
expensive fucking so stupid.

36
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:22,000
They burned their Isaiah Thomas Jerseys.

37
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,310
Like he left the Celtics, like he was
doing some sort of free agent. Fuck,

38
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:30,520
he got traded. You'd dumb fucks. Um,

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,450
then of course everybody on Twitter tweets
it to me and acts like this is every

40
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:38,890
Celtic fan and it isn't,
it isn't this always these fucking morons,

41
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,110
which is why I have been saying,

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,833
you know,

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,010
I would fucking,
I'm telling you right now,

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,050
this fucking Mayweather McGregor fight,

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,600
if he ever wanted to solve
the population problem,

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,230
the amount of mouth breathers
that are showing up, okay.

47
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,160
You send a fucking signal through the
fucking boss, whoever orders the fight,

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,130
that's it.
You're done.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,271
Something happens.

50
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:05,450
You know when he needs to play in those
old spy movies where they would play

51
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:09,830
that really high pitch fucking noise and
people would just grab their ears like,

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,950
and then they would die.
Yeah. Do some star Trek Shit.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,233
MMM.

54
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,530
That's going to go down is one of the
biggest fucking rip offs of all fucking

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,970
time. Mayweather. Mcgregor.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,723
MMM.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,680
That's my prediction.
And if it doesn't,

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,140
I'll just say I was wrong and
then I'll order the fight,

59
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:32,340
but there is no fucking way I'm going to
sit there on Saturday night and watch a

60
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:37,341
guy who used to fucking box 1520 fucking
years ago fight a guy who fucking

61
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:43,590
retired two years ago who's in his forties
and everybody's asking me acting like

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,160
it's going to be his first fucking law.
The guy's in his forties

63
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,690
he's been retired for two years.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,750
You remember when Jordan came
back on the fucking wizards?

65
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,783
Okay.

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
Taking two, three fucking years
off. You know that was basketball.

67
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,700
Forget about boxing.
This is like the dumbest thing ever.

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,330
You know what it really is? It's a bunch
of fucking losers that want the know,

69
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,210
that are unhappy with their own lives,

70
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:12,540
that want to see a guy that's been
shooting his mouth off saying is life is

71
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,320
fucking great and they want to see him
getting knocked on his ass and I'm so

72
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:20,110
sick of people go there. Just
spectacle it. Just spectacle. I'm just,

73
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,660
I'm tuning in for this spectacle.
Why are you using that word spectacle?

74
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:25,650
You fucking moron.

75
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:30,651
Because everybody on in sports has been
saying this since the amount of fucking

76
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,440
mouth breathing dopes that I've
known, you know, and I'm one of them.

77
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,160
I've never heard him use the,
the,

78
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,660
the expression spectacle in my life
now it's like, yeah, just watch.

79
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:43,230
I'm watching it for the spectacle.
It's a spectacle. The sport.

80
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,230
What does that mean exactly?
A spectacle. You mean?

81
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,200
Is that like a fancy word for,
it's a fucking rip off.

82
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,590
These are the same people that would
have paid fucking $60 you know,

83
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:01,130
the equivalent of $60 30
fucking years ago, 40 years ago,

84
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:04,100
to watch Lyle Zeto fight
fucking Mohammed Ali,

85
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:08,630
which actually happened if he never
looked it up. Alright, spectacle.

86
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,860
Let's look up the definition of spectacle.
Spectacle number one.

87
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,400
Something to stare at. Number
two, a paper view. Rip Off. No.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,660
A visually striking performance or display

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,770
and invent or seen.
Regarded in terms of its visual impact.

90
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,353
I Dunno,

91
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,810
I dunno what's going on with sports right
now or that fucking league where they

92
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,590
just take three people who used to be
superstars in played three other people

93
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,920
that used to be superstars and a,

94
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,570
what do you get out of watching that half
court basketball confirmation that yes,

95
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,460
we are all going to die a slow death.

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm sorry, I'm really just being a
scrooge. Enjoy your fucking fight.

97
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,410
I will not be watching it.

98
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:58,220
I'm going to get out on the highway and
drive like 80 miles an out here in la,

99
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,750
you know,

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,530
and enjoy this city at the population
that should be during that fucking fight.

101
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,120
There's so many more constructive
things that I can fucking do. And um,

102
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,220
this,
you know what it is?

103
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:16,221
Is it just doing this clearly
for the fucking money and uh,

104
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,630
that's it. So, you know, in a way it's,

105
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:21,250
I'm actually happy for them because they
both get in their brains knocked out in

106
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,860
every fucking fight and God knows what's,

107
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:27,630
what their quality of life will be
in their fifties so good for them.

108
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,780
Go out and get your fucking money. But
I've given may, whether it at least,

109
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:34,560
I don't know, but his last
seven fights times 6,420 bucks,

110
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,320
that he should return at
least a portion of it.

111
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,530
He hasn't knocked anybody out since said,
was it Ricky Hatton?

112
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,210
He fights fucking packy out 10 years
after he should have the guy shows up with

113
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,970
the fucking injured shoulder. His singing
voice is gone and he just fucking edit.

114
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,250
It's just, I dunno. All right.
I've, I've said my piece.

115
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,590
You guys enjoy the fucking fight and uh,
you,

116
00:06:55,591 --> 00:07:00,270
you texted me your oh shits
and whatnot. Um, afterwards,

117
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,630
first he was saying that bill, it's just
spectacle. It's a spectacle. It's fine.

118
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,250
It's like, dude, I've known you for
10 years. You've never said that word.

119
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,910
Um, like they're above it.
Like they're above it. I'm
just watching you. I, you know,

120
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:19,320
I know it's bullshit. I know. It's
like, no, dude, you can't look away.

121
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,850
That's what's your fucking problem is
people who are getting it just because,

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,121
oh we,

123
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:28,620
it's going to be so fucking ridiculous
are the same fucking cons in front of you

124
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,090
causing a traffic jam because somebody
changing their tire on the side of the

125
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:37,350
fucking road because they can't look
away and they will write behind all those

126
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,110
other cons screaming at him,
go on, go, go, go drive.

127
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,100
And then the second they come up to it,
they sit in their fucking rubber neck.

128
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,420
All right there,
I'm telling you,

129
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,950
you wrote the human population is like
the human population is like a fucking a,

130
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,170
you know, you know those fucking
movies that Hollywood always makes,

131
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,640
you know with a white person goes into
like the fucking inner city and then goes

132
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:07,440
in and turns everybody's fucking life
around and everybody become successful in

133
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:12,180
all of those. Nobody fucks it up, right?
That's what the world population is like.

134
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:14,160
It's like that teacher is running shit,

135
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,893
you know,

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,630
can't make the cuts that he needs to
make to get down to the fucking real NFL

137
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:26,500
roster.
Does it make any fucking sense?

138
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,170
I'm just saying it's just too big a heart.

139
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,630
I hate those fucking feels fucking
movies, by the way, you know,

140
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
with a white person goes into the area
with his no white people and then save

141
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:40,490
Shit. And they never addressed the fact
that white people caused the situation.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,000
You know?
And then we turn ourselves into the hero

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,830
so that white people can go
see the movie and be like,

144
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,220
that's the white person Ip
in that scenario. Well Buddy,

145
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,660
you could go fucking do it.

146
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,630
There's plenty of schools that a fucking
hero white guy to go down to to try to

147
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:01,730
help out.
You know what it is right now.

148
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm fucking on a rant right now
just because they fucking, you know,

149
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,830
Neil Neil loves those goddamn awards shows
and all of these fucking liberal cons

150
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:13,250
that go up on there. And they
talk about dolphins, you know,

151
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,030
and they blah blah blah.

152
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,360
And they use their celebrity is shine a
light on it before they go back to their

153
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:21,890
fucking gated community. It's like, why
don't you get your hands dirty? You know,

154
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,850
get your hands dirty or shut the fuck up.

155
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,050
And you're fucking Louis Vuitton Tuxedo,
whatever the hell it is you're doing.

156
00:09:30,051 --> 00:09:34,160
Why am I in such a mood? You know what it
is. I didn't sleep well last night and,

157
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,233
uh,
these fucking,

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,590
I don't know why this army of bugs
beat the shit out of my left ankle.

159
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,330
Um, and it's on fire. I don't
know if it was a spider.

160
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,390
I don't know what the hell it was,
but my whole fucking foot turn red,

161
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,690
you know, and it's something back
in the day before I had a kid,

162
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:56,290
my wife would help me out with,
but now we have a kid. So you know,

163
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,590
I've gone down on the depth
chart it, I'm like, damn,

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,860
let's look at my fucking foot.
She's like, Jesus Christ, I've got,

165
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,890
do we have anything for that? And
she's like, yeah, I think we do.

166
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah,

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,240
that's it. I'm like, uh,
do you know what it is? Ah,

168
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:15,350
some aloe fucken Moose.

169
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,590
You put some Mousse on it.
I don't know.

170
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,720
So I've been dealing with, she
claims that, you know, as you know,

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,990
the doctor that she isn't claims
that it's getting better. I Dunno.

172
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,630
All I know is a,
you know,

173
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,090
I'm talking to you guys with
a really fucking itchy foot,

174
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,890
so maybe that's what it is. Um, oh man,
that's going to be fucking exciting.

175
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm going to actually get to
experience what people experience.

176
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,630
You don't give a shit about
sports on the super bowl.

177
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,670
You get to fucking cruise around the city,
get a bunch of errands done, you know,

178
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,460
ride a bicycle right down the
middle of the street. Yeah,

179
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,090
this is a bad podcast, everybody, if
you're not really not really aware of it.

180
00:10:56,091 --> 00:11:00,920
At this point, I started off negative
and I want even more negative. Um,

181
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,540
is anybody else sick of that fucking guy
in the Lakers, dad already? Jesus Christ.

182
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,150
It's like he made it to the NBA. You're
going to get your money. All right,

183
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,920
enough with the fucking carnival barking.

184
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,540
I would make Michael Jordan
cry if I played him one on one.

185
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,730
Was that the weirdest interview?

186
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:21,660
I just saw a clip of it and Jimmy Kimmel
is literally talking over the guy who

187
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,890
was actually going to go into the NBA
to talk to the guy who never made it to

188
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:25,690
the NBA,

189
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,970
who's sitting there is talking about how
he's going to beat Michael Jordan and

190
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,820
the other guys sitting there like a
scolded child that looks like a fucking

191
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,180
parents teacher meeting.
[inaudible] um,

192
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,000
tell me that isn't a 30 for 30.

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,500
When he goes to finally make his
break from his overbearing father. Um,

194
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,800
all right. There's another negative
thing. All right, where else?

195
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:52,240
Where else can we go with negativity? You
got anything positive to say? Ah, yes.

196
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,270
I finally have to not drinking
after false advertising of Billy.

197
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:02,950
No fun months ago. I can
only go three, four days.

198
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:07,780
I have now put together a run of
seven days of come back up from AAA.

199
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,620
I'm on a little bit of a heat
hitting streak right now and uh,

200
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,960
I've gone seven days and um,

201
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,670
I love it in the morning, not drinking
in the morning is the greatest at night.

202
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:23,840
It's been, uh, it's been a
little bit of a, uh, you know,

203
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:26,480
it's a fucking habit I have to
break, but I think, you know,

204
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,730
once I get it for like seven to 10 days,
then I'm like,

205
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:32,570
it literally go for a year. It's
weird. It's just getting to that,

206
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,430
you know, starting to drop some weight.
I've been jumping on the ellipticals,

207
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,780
uh, been fucking working
out my uh, rotate a cup,

208
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,400
feels a little bit better and a,

209
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,540
what I do at night is I just got to go
play drums and then I go do a stand up

210
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,850
set to a couple of sets last night.
Played some fucking drums and uh,

211
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,650
it's weird above playing drums are
an instrument is the more you learn,

212
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:59,180
the more you realize you suck and it's
just really frustrating. You know,

213
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,390
it's almost like he's just
learn everything you can
to learn, stop learning,

214
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:05,480
get all that shit down. Considering
I'm never going to play in a band.

215
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm not going to pursue
this professionally.

216
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:08,750
Then I could actually sit
behind the kit and be like,

217
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:12,890
happy with what I'm fucking doing.
I have learned how to tune up a snare.

218
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,740
I can get it sound really good,
but my bass drum sounds like shit,

219
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,920
there's always something.
So he's fucking something.

220
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:21,410
Let's read some advertising here.
Maybe if I read advertising,

221
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,350
this will get me out of this negative
vortex and I fucking gone into

222
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,150
Jesus and 13 and a half minutes.

223
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,480
Okay.

224
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,240
Just negative. You know what's
funny is what I should really be,

225
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,740
I should really be rooting for this
McGregor Mayweather fight to be a great

226
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,790
thing. Cause then I can,
I can rent it and then,

227
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,850
and I'll get to watch
something interesting,

228
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,650
but I'm s I so want to be
right about this, you know,

229
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,860
you're not going to get me right.
I'm the Guy Walking, you know,

230
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,270
driving by who wants to look,

231
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:56,350
but I'm not going to look to prove some
sort of point that nobody in front of me

232
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,600
behind me or next to me.
He's going to give a shit about.

233
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,910
That's basically what I'm
doing with this. Um, anyways,

234
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,130
prediction on the fight. Yes. Uh, I
want to say Mcgregor's not going to be,

235
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,820
and you know, I dunno, it's two years ago,

236
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,790
if he's anything like he used to be
Mcgregor's not gonna be able to lay a

237
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,750
fucking hand on them.

238
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Why anybody would think that McGregor
could lay a fucking glove on.

239
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:24,010
Mayweather is fucking beyond me
unless these,

240
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,650
unless he got really old
in the last two years,

241
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:30,670
unless it's Jordan from the Bulls to the
wizards. And if it's that type of leap,

242
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,970
yes, Mcgregor has a fucking
shot, but then who gives a shit?

243
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,260
He beats up a fucking guy, you
know, two years after he retired,

244
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,720
you know, imagine not going to the gym
for two years. Okay. Then fucking chick,

245
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,340
you know, racing somebody down the
street for a fucking mile. All right,

246
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,430
me undies are,

247
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
but it'll doe doe B and beyond these
old bill is a negative con Boudou too.

248
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,870
To me on the shut 'em up
if you want, I'm sorry. Ah,

249
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:03,320
you too can look good in your
underwear and be comfortable, right?

250
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,410
No, you want to look good in your
underwear and be comfortable. Right.

251
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:11,250

it's time to let me on these change.
Yours.

285
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,800
Go to [inaudible] dot
com slash bar right now.

286
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,510
Yeah.

287
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,170
Oh, we only have two reeds. Oh my
God. I love it. Legal Zoom, everybody.

288
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,670
It's national.

289
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:18,671
Make a will month at legal zoom and that
means it's time to take control of your

290
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,210
family and assets.

291
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,600
Preparing your family's future is the most
important thing you'll do this summer.

292
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:28,580
It's the most fucking important thing you
could ever do. All right? All the time.

293
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:32,150
People die in car accidents.
They drop a heart attacks a fucking piano,

294
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,940
falls in that Goddamn head.
All these young guys,

295
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,570
their wife fucking nags him to death
through an early fucking grave and they do

296
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,210
not have a will or a
trust or any of that shit.

297
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,210
And then all the fucking
evil people show up.

298
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,610
Yeah.

299
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,690
Start claiming that they were your best
friend and they tried to take all your

300
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:52,080
shit and the money away from your kids.
You have to fucking do it.

301
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,860
It's something that guys don't like to do.
Dealing with their own mortality,

302
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,680
which is probably why I'm not
going to watch Mayweather come in.

303
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,240
The fact that I could actually watch a
guy who does not box for a fucking living

304
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
possibly beat the best boxer of all time.

305
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:09,270
All that's going to mean is that yet bill,
everybody dies.

306
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't need to watch that.
I don't need to watch the big three,

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,110
the big three coming out there and then
fucking walkers playing each other and

308
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:19,680
nobody can dunk anymore. I'm sure somebody
can dunk their fucking nine feet tall,

309
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:24,540
but I'm just saying, all right, man,
do not like to deal with that shit.

310
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,120
All right? But uh, this is, you've
got to fame. You got a family man.

311
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,880
You've got to fucking deal
with this stuff, right?

312
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,540

That's the guy I did all of this shit.

324
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,060
Okay.

325
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,060
And I didn't want to do it cause I didn't
want to deal with me dying and all of

326
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,610
this shit. What do you want to do when
you die? Do you want to be cremated?

327
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,190
Put in the ground and all this shit? I
gotta tell you, when I was done with it,

328
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,490
it was like a weight was off my
shoulders and my chest. I mean,

329
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,190
cause every time I'd get on a flight,
you know,

330
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,420
I always think of this fucking
thing goes down right now.

331
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,690
What's going to happen to my wife and kid?
You know what I mean?

legalzoom.com/prepare. All right,

335
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,080
now it's time to talk about
my real feelings about

336
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
the Mayweather McGregor fight. I
am curious. I do want to watch,

337
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,050
but I've just been burned
too many fucking times.

338
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,620
So what I'm doing is I'm letting
you guys take the beach. All right?

339
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,190
And if you tweet at me, Oh my God, that
was fucking amazing on [inaudible].

340
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,220
He is going to lie to me.
I'll,

341
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,150
I'll go on the internet and if everybody
said that was amazing and it was worth

342
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:17,380
the fucking money, I will then rent the
fight. That's what I'm doing from now on.

343
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,620
Cause I've just, I've just been
burned too many fucking times. Um,

344
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:24,190
I think it will be devastating
for boxing if Mayweather loses,

345
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,610
even though he's been retired
for two fucking years. Um,

346
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,200
basically it's all about
the first couple of rounds.

347
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,880
If Mcgregor's going to do it, if he
doesn't do within fucking three rounds,

348
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,810
he's fucked. That's it. Okay.
There's my brilliant insight.

349
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,440
I know what everybody else
knows. I've watched too many
of Mcgregor's fights. Any,

350
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,320
when he fought Nate, he get into the
fourth round and he would be winded.

351
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,440
So they fight five minutes round.
So I don't know. I don't know.

352
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,570
I think even though they only fight
one, how many I'm, how many minutes?

353
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,490
Or there's a three minute rounds,
right?

354
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,433
So

355
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,940
logically you'd be like,
well, five minutes in then,

356
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,510
then that's the equivalent to go in
five rounds. I mean, three rounds,

357
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,570
five minute rounds in the fucking UFC.
Jesus Christ belt. But here's the thing,

358
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,150
he's going to be using different muscles.
You know,

359
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,780
he's going to waste a lot of fucking
energy trying to hit somebody that nobody

360
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,950
could fucking hit.
And um,

361
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,270
I dunno.
I Dunno what it is,

362
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,530
but they're both brilliant fucking
fighters that both amazing. And uh,

363
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,150
they're also, you know, they're
as good at selling a fight,

364
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:34,630
which is why everybody showing up and
all of that shit cause two big shit.

365
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:36,280
Talkers,
you know,

366
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,430
there's nothing people like better than
seeing a shit talker lose and one of

367
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,830
them's going to lose. So I guess
that's why everybody's going to watch,

368
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,050
but I cannot fucking resist.

369
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,593
Okay.

370
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,850
D a the euphoria of not doing what
everybody else is doing and getting to do

371
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,720
other shit.

372
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,290
It's something I learned when I would
watch the super bowl and I would just take

373
00:21:55,291 --> 00:22:00,200
the fucking thing and just do other shit
for the first 90 minutes of the game.

374
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:04,640
So I can fast forward through all of the
commercials and the absolutely fucking

375
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:09,140
horrific halftime show and the opening
ceremonies and all of that other bullshit.

376
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,350
I could just watch the Goddamn game. I
remember when I would drive around and go,

377
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,663
you know,

378
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,440
okay,

379
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,830
get something to eat or some shit and
they'd just be nobody on the fucking road.

380
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,950
And you just get to experience
what you city was like,

381
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,220
okay.

382
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,750
Back before there were automobiles,

383
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,790
except you're in a car and
there's paved roads. I don't know,

384
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,840
there's this sort of a,
uh, I kind of understand

385
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,140
a little bit

386
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,680
like why people don't watch sports.
I actually get it now.

387
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,220
Like the amount of free
time and if you to put it,

388
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,290
the thing is you've got to fill that
free time up with like some healthy shit.

389
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,650
Oh this is like a nice ying and Yang.
Total negative. Nominal go positive.

390
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:51,700
Just do some magic.

391
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,140
Yeah.

392
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,180
First of all,
a the food you wouldn't eat.

393
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,013
All right.

394
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,470
All the extra time you'd have to work out.
You know,

395
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:02,930
if you always wanted to learn how to
play guitar and learn how to speak a

396
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:07,330
language, the amount of
time you spend, you know,

397
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,260
I can't say wasting your time because
you enjoy it. I fucking enjoy it. Right.

398
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:14,860
If you're a sports fan, but just think
of everything that you could accomplish.

399
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,810
I remember like one of the first times
the NFL went on strike in my life

400
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,950
and then when it, when it
would come back, you know,

401
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:27,560
they showed a couple people on the news
and I don't know if they were lying or

402
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:29,920
whatever and they were just like,
yeah man, you know, I'm Kinda,

403
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,650
it was Kinda cool to have like Saturday
and Sunday in the fall to myself.

404
00:23:36,621 --> 00:23:39,170
I can hang out with my kids.
I can go do some shit.

405
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,680
I just don't give a fuck anymore.
Um,

406
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,213
okay.

407
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,110
I don't,
there's this weird part of me.

408
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,780
I can't stop watching it then.
This is part of me that I wish,

409
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:52,110
I wish I could do it, but they need you
just fill it up with something else dumb.

410
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,740
Then I become one of those ones,
comic con people

411
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,050
that knows the actor's name that crushed
down in that r two d two fucking thing.

412
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,820
Little fucking trash compactor
that he was riding around in.

413
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,780
I Dunno. Do you know what all of
this shit, it's, it's bigger than me.

414
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,440
I have no idea what any of these fucking
shit means. Enjoy you God damn fight.

415
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:17,800
Don't, let's do a crappy freckled
bald like me telling you that.

416
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,060
It's a fucking rip off you go and joy you
goddamn spectacle. Yeah. You deserve it.

417
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,100
It's a spectacle. Donald Trump
isn't enough of a fucking spectacle.

418
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,470
That's not enough for you,
Jesus Christ.

419
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,880
Do you know I don't even, I don't even
fuck I that. That's something like,

420
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,910
I pay attention to that.
I don't pay attention to that.

421
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:46,000
The way somebody does who doesn't give a
fuck about sports pays attention to it.

422
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,210
Um, the fact that our president tweets
and reads is his Twitter account.

423
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,220
It's just, I don't, I don't even know.
Like it's like, dude, you're above that.

424
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,363
You go above it,

425
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,120
fucking respond. I don't, you don't meet
people shit on me. I don't even, I feel,

426
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,610
I don't even need to respond to people
shitting on me. I, first of all,

427
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:09,870
I feel it's par for the course.

428
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,220
Not Everybody's gonna like you fact
that this fucking guy's got to go on and

429
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,713
responsive.
What are you doing?

430
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,250
But then again, he did win it.
He Won. He won the whole fuck it.

431
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,780
I love people who think he's dumb.

432
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,420
It's like if he's that fucking stupid,

433
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:29,330
how did all those smart
people lose to him?

434
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,120
That was like back in the day when that,
that Woman Jessica Simpson,

435
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:37,630
when she would be like chicken of the sea.
Is that like chicken or is it tuna?

436
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,640
Which to be honest, looking back
was a legit question. I mean,

437
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,410
it is a food and he wrote chicken on it.

438
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,600
That's like chicken fried steak for years.
I'll say, is it chicken is at stake.

439
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:54,440
What the fuck is it? Hey,
take a ride in my truck car.

440
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,760
What the fuck is it? Why would you
call it something else? What is this?

441
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,760
Um, everybody thought she was
dumb. It's like, yeah. Yeah.

442
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:08,170
She's a fucking moron with hit
albums in our own TV shows. Like,

443
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:13,110
I would love to be that stupid.
You. No, she married Nicholas.

444
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,190
Shay's a good looking fella,
right guys? Guys in a boy band.

445
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,830
He plays golf on the fucking weekend.
She was crushing it.

446
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,680
Date and Tony Romo. Robo
Robo. Did she marry him?

447
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,833
Yeah,

448
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,360
I don't know. I felt bad for
one day. Like, I think it
was her. She, her little dog,

449
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,590
you know, like last seen in the
mouth of a coyote. It's like, yeah,

450
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:36,424
it's fucking dead.

451
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,663
MMM.

452
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,280
What do you think the coyotes have like
some sort of terrorist group and they're

453
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,020
going to fucking, you abduct your
dog and change it's fucking mindset.

454
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,420
It's going to be like the patty Hearst
to fucking chihuahuas. No, it's, it's,

455
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,290
it's dead.
Um,

456
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,690
that's why you got to
get a big dog out here.

457
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,170
You got to have a big dog that liked the
other Kyries are like, you know what,

458
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:02,340
it's not fucking worth it. You know
what I mean? Like for dogs out here,

459
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:05,370
this is like going to fucking
Rikers island. All right.

460
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,690
Will you need a big need to be a
big fucking muscular goddamn dog.

461
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:13,830
You need to be more of a fucking problem.
Then these little fellows out there,

462
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,980
these little dogs like,
I don't know what people do.

463
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:20,100
Like they fucking leave them in their
backyards and shit and they just,

464
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,950
they just did gone dead.
Gone.

465
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,490
Okay.

466
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,490
It's like lights, like literally like
one of those creepy fucking movies,

467
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,800
you know, where they would, you know,

468
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,340
the people would go to an island and
they were just living with some sort of

469
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:38,341
dragon or some sort of gorilla and they
would just sacrifice somebody like King

470
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,740
Kong and that type of shit. So this
fucking thing, but leave him alone.

471
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,510
That's such a weird beginning,
Huh?

472
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,630
To the King Kong movie that poor woman's
like tied up at those fucking vines and

473
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:51,960
I just don't get like,
okay,

474
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,210
you got a 60 foot God damn gorilla
he's going to eat that fucking won

475
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,410
one person and then be like filled up.
That's going to be like Doritos,

476
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:06,730
right by not Doritos because we're mostly
fucking, you know, protein and shit.

477
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,880
We're kind of a protein snack, Ali, right?

478
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,420
So that's like Kim,
you have on like a Clif bar.

479
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,170
Goddamn 60 foot gorilla is going to eat
one clif bar every couple of months and

480
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:22,260
then be fine. First of all,
I didn't think gorillas,

481
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,630
I thought they were vegetarians,
right?

482
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,890
I thought they sat around just fucking
eaten. I don't know what the hell eat.

483
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,270
There's always some fucking person got
to go try and live with them and get a

484
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,070
little closer and a little closer

485
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,100
and then eventually get
the shit kicked out of them

486
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,490
by the God damn gorilla.
I gotta tell you, man,

487
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,320
the amount of shit that a gorilla we'll
put up with it because it's as big as it

488
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,154
is.

489
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,480
I wonder if a gorilla has
ever fought like a tiger.

490
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,930
And for that we need to go to Asia.
You know,

491
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,950
you want to talk about spectacles where
you have a boxer against an MMA guy like

492
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,210
Asians. I'm telling you,
if you want to go see any,

493
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:12,710
anytime you start looking at like
this versus this, this versus that,

494
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,480
you will find black and white footage
where they put a fucking bear and a tiger

495
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,040
in the same cage to see what our alliance
against the tiger just to see what the

496
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:26,060
fuck would happen. Um, they did it.

497
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,460
That's their thing

498
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,360
where we experimented with human beings.
They experimented with animals, it seems,

499
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,220
I know, fuck. What am I even
talking about? You know,

500
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:39,700
this is one of these podcasts where it
just started off on the wrong foot head.

501
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:43,690
Now I'm just desperately trying fill the
last 18 seconds of this thing so I can

502
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:48,670
get up to fucking my contractually
obligated 30 minutes.

503
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:51,190
How about those red sox aren't taken.
Two out of three out of

504
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,970
Teray Terry Francona is fucking a
team there. The Cleveland Indians,

505
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,600
um, piling up the fucking numbers there.
I haven't been keeping up on what the, uh,

506
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:07,630
the Yankees are doing. So why don't I
try to end this thing on something plaza.

507
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,190
If you guys enjoy your fight, your
sports spectacle, this, this weekend,

508
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:15,670
I hope you don't get fucked over. And
I'm, I'm being honest. You know something.

509
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:18,850
I'm going to be a bigger man here rather
than being the guy that said I told you

510
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:22,450
so. I hope on Monday you guys can all come
back and I can read a bunch of fucking

511
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:26,500
letters of like bill,
you negative cont you've never been wrong.

512
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,970
More wrong in your freckled
pathetic life and a,

513
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,880
I really hope that you guys are able to
send those to me. I hope you make it.

514
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,510
I hope you get your money's
worth. Um, like I said,

515
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:42,220
I will not be watching the fucking
thing. Um, I'm too God damn stubborn.

516
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,480
All right. I, you know
something, I'm actually, this
is, this is actually from me.

517
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,690
This pay per view is about being able to
walk away because I have jumped on the

518
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:56,140
fucking, you know, the UFC has
done that to me. You have three.

519
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:59,260
I've ordered the fucking shit and then
find out somebody tested positive for

520
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:03,580
steroids. You know, UFC is
also doing that shit now.

521
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,360
Now that they got bought out by
other fucking people. You know,

522
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,640
Dana White's like the
figurehead now. However, the,

523
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,240
how the the fuck it works that doing that
shit now where like every three pounds

524
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:17,110
is a new way class. So now they
have all these air quote champions.

525
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,330
So then everything's a
fucking championship fight.

526
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:23,800
That's like what fucking killed boxing
aside from the fact that they had like 50

527
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,040
different goddamn leagues or whatever,

528
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,050
the WBA, WBC, the IBF, the,

529
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,810
it was like three heavyweight
champions all at the same time.

530
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,990
And then somebody had to try to
come in and unify the titles.

531
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,353
MMM.

532
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,610
Yeah. And like then, like every,

533
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,530
like eight pounds became like a
fucking weight class or whatever. I'll,

534
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,940
I know is everything was like a
title fight and they were, they did,

535
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,970
they weren't as good. So I hope to,
UFC doesn't go that route because, um,

536
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,800
what was great when they had the
monopoly was the best fought the best.

537
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:57,060
So I hope that continues.

538
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,820
Yeah.

539
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,740
I apologize for this podcast everybody.

540
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:04,410
I don't know why I'm shitting
on everything. That's just fun,

541
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:08,730
simple goddamn fun in this miserable
world. Why would I do that? All right.

542
00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:10,560
Come on bill.
Pull it out of the mud.

543
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,000
This fight is going to be the
greatest spectacle of all time.

544
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,630
If you do not put $60 down on that,
you are going to miss out,

545
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,143
right?

546
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,840
There you go. That was positive. Ah,
what do you want from me? I tried.

547
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,910
I tried. I got an Itchy foot and my
fucking body is like reacting to the fact,

548
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,460
you know, you know what else is,
um, a couple of my friends, uh,

549
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,690
yeah,

550
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,210
became parents,
right?

551
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,750
So I always do my gift than I
do is I go out and I buy a nice,

552
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,040
cute, cool pair of fucking sneakers,
right? Little Jordans, all uptown's,

553
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:53,420
whatever the fuck you want, right?
That's what I get for the kid. Okay?

554
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:58,220
And then I get to sick bottles of
fucking booze for the parents. You know,

555
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,720
because here's the deal.
Everybody's,

556
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,470
I think I already told you
that everybody's going to
go out and go buy a stuffed

557
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:05,750
fucking animal,
this fucking thing.

558
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,700
And it's just going to be
this thing that the parents,

559
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,830
the kid can't fucking use it.

560
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,060
It's a baby to Goddamn blob that you
carry around for fucking three months.

561
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,160
All right? And then when we
finally can move around it,

562
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,990
it doesn't give a shit about toys.
All right?

563
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,130
It likes extension cords.
It likes pots and pans.

564
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,780
It likes, see if just any fucking
thing that it shouldn't be touching.

565
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,040
That's what it wants. And it could
give off. Fuck about the Goddamn toys.

566
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Buying a toy for a baby is the biggest,

567
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,920
it's a bigger waste of money than buying
this Conor McGregor Mayweather fight

568
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:48,530
this weekend. I just can't
get out of it. People. Um,

569
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,010
I feel like the libertarian this weekend,
you know,

570
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,970
who is actually addressing the problem
where the Democrat and the Republican

571
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:59,090
would back one of the two candidates and
act like it's going to change your life

572
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:00,770
and that this was going to
be a good thing for you.

573
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:05,120
And I'm the fucking the fucking Green
party guy going, hey man, he's bankers

574
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,720
fucking you over man.
Everybody's button pay for me.

575
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,550
MMM.

576
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,300
You want a Brussel Sprout
nava account of sandwich man.

577
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,543
Um,

578
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,280
but the parents, everybody
fee immediately, immediately.

579
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:25,640
Now that you have a kid like you,
you go down on the depth chart,

580
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,570
nobody gives a shit about you.
Everybody cares about the kit. Right?

581
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,000
Which is great.
That's the way it should be.

582
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,140
But if you actually do
something for the parents, okay.

583
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,380
And actually acknowledged that they are
individuals with hopes and dreams that

584
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:47,000
have now been dashed because all of
their focus is now going on the baby,

585
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,140
which is the way it should be.

586
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:53,060
But every once in a while you got to
throw him a fucking little ginger snap

587
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:56,180
there. Right? So that's
what I do. I go out,

588
00:34:56,181 --> 00:35:01,181
I buy a sick ass bottle of booze in a
nice bottle for the guy in a fucking nice

589
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:06,290
bottle of Rozay for the lady. And then
I just get the kid a pair of shoes,

590
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,251
sneakers,

591
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:10,910
cool sneakers for when the kids walk in
and they can actually use those things,

592
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,890
you know, and it's supposed to some
stupid fucking thing. You know,

593
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:18,200
that they're supposed to reach up
and grab whatever the fuck it is.

594
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:22,560
That's what I do. Okay, there you go. Um,

595
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,940
anyways, fucking, I got the hiccups.

596
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:28,610
My Foot itches and I'm off the sauce.

597
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm after sauce and I'm going back to
Boston this week and I'm staying off the

598
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:36,170
sauce. I'd been working out and
I'm staying off the fucking sauce.

599
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,410
Um, I already, I already had
the conversations in my head.

600
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,060
I'm not fucking doing it.
I'm going to go on a nice nash run here.

601
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,350
I am a committed to it. I'm dropping
some fucking pounds. So that's it. Um,

602
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,530
enjoy your guys' fight this weekend.
I hope you get your money's worth.

603
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I've said that 50 times trying to make
up for the fucking previous negative 30

604
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:03,120
minutes. Uh, that's the podcast for this
Thursday afternoon. Have a great weekend.

605
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:06,940
You constant joy,
this music and a,

606
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,680
and then we got to throw back
podcasts. Mothers' Thursday, I dunno,

607
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,380
from last year or the year before.
Maybe a couple of weeks ago. Who knows?

608
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,214
All right,

609
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,463
I'll see you later.

610
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,890
[inaudible] [inaudible] this mine,
we're watching the whites of your eyes to

611
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,790
the
wall.

612
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,640
You been reading some odor

613
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,980
is how much you change all the money

614
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,250
and buy back those days. Yep. Oh

615
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,293
[inaudible]

616
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,740
all right. Girlfriend in fantasy
league. Hey, bill loved the podcast.

617
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,040
Thank you. I've been in a fantasy
football league for 10 years.

618
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,840
It was started by one of my best friends
and it's been the same 12 guys for a

619
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,930
decade. I don't even
know how bands put, uh,

620
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,340
I don't even know bands that
have been together that long.

621
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:20,330
So this year my buddy who started the
league decided to boot out to lifelong

622
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,500
members in favor of his
girlfriend and the girlfriend

623
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,150
of a friend of ours.

624
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,860
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

625
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,740
Did those other two guys who got booted,
did they anything,

626
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,820
I mean if he was going to add the ladies,

627
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,620
why did those other
two guys have to leave?

628
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,800
Wow. All right. Okay, well I'm
sucked into this story. He said,

629
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,390
I immediately called bullshit and said
point blank to his face is she wasn't

630
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:55,840
sucking your Dick then she
wouldn't be in the league. Ah Dude.

631
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,760
That right there is a game change. You
can't say what if he marries this woman?

632
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,790
Always.
There's a rule for you guys.

633
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,930
Always be careful what you say
about the woman you're guy is with.

634
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,960
Cause you never fucking know.
You never know.

635
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,900
And I'm sure there's some listeners
that have stories and if you'd like to

636
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,960
contribute them to the podcast where,
uh,

637
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,720
you know it's even fucking worse is when

638
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,670
your body,
he says fucked up shit about the girl.

639
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,680
You know about what a whore she is in bed
and she's fucking brains out but blah,

640
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:33,910
blah blah, blah, Blah and tells
you all these these details.

641
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,350
And then the jackass ends up falling for
her and then he has to fucking break up

642
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:41,110
with you because he's not going to break
up with her because every time he looks

643
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:45,460
at you, he thinks out. You
know, he knows how this girl,

644
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,470
my future wife Sucks my Dick,
you know? Anyways, plowing ahead.

645
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,260
He's trying to defend this decision by
saying she at least knows a little about

646
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,080
sports,
so this is awful.

647
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,050
This guy wasn't raised right, man, this is
just, this is fucking terrible. He said,

648
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:09,040
the fact of the matter is that she is
from New York and knows who the jets are.

649
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,820
That's the extent of her football
knowledge. He thinks I'm overreacting.

650
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,050
You're not overreacting.

651
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,070
He didn't ask anybody else.

652
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:23,050
You've had 12 for the last 10 years and
he just removed two of the original band

653
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:27,160
members
do.

654
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,920
This isn't even funny. This is right.
This is really upsetting to me.

655
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,930
He thinks I'm overreacting, but I think
of it the same scenario. If you had,

656
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,130
if you have one night a year to have a
guy's night with your buddies and then

657
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,911
you get to the bar,

658
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:44,110
you see that your friends has invited
his girlfriend to guys night. Exactly.

659
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,040
Even told me that she,
she's the one who asked if she could join,

660
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,150
which obviously to me means he
had no intentions of inviting her,

661
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,860
but when he was backed into the corner,

662
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,910
his ball shot up into his throat
and he couldn't say no exactly.

663
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,790
It's not just the fantasy league,

664
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,390
but a clear indication that she's
going to slowly start chipping away at

665
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,540
everything else in the rest of
his life. Exactly. In summation,

666
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,900
his girlfriend wanted in and
he crumbled and said, yes.

667
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,930
Am I reading too much into this?
Am I overreacting?

668
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,050
I'd like to know because he's getting
pissed at me for being pissed at him.

669
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,230
Absolutely not, sir. Everything
that I was going to tell you,

670
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,240
you already know and you wrote in this
email. Okay? You ran down the mats.

671
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,560
You went off the little
fucking springy board.

672
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,140
Do you hit the fucking hobby horse?

673
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:33,070
You did your little fucking Mary Lou
Leighton. Flip and you stuck the landing,

674
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,490
you get a perfect 10 on that
one, sir. You are 100% right.

675
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,050
You know what you want. My move would
be, I would start my own fantasy league.

676
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,510
All right. And I would invite everybody
else in that fucking leak. Well,

677
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:51,980
I wouldn't do that because not that,
that's a chick move. Make people decide,

678
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,920
oh, this is what I, I wouldn't be as
harsh with them and just be like, no,

679
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:00,290
do what you did was absolute
bullshit and I guarantee you,

680
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,200
I would tell him that she's going to start
chipping away with you and your life.

681
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,910
Your balls are up in your throat.
Um,

682
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,840
but that's going to end your friendship
with them. But here's the deal, dude.

683
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,010
There are other fantasy
football leagues did join.

684
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,350
All right? And uh, that, that's
one of those ugly things about

685
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:28,160
that chapter of guys
lives after, um, college.

686
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,511
You know,

687
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,990
when you went to grade school together
or you met him and call up guys in

688
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:35,840
college or whatever,
but you guys have this unbelievable bond.

689
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,300
Like you went to fucking war together.

690
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:40,903
MMM.

691
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,650
If one of your friends is a pussy,

692
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,730
you know,
he has a,

693
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,530
he has a chance of meeting somebody who's
going to splinter the group. You know,

694
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,880
and this isn't an anti woman thing,

695
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:58,560
this is more like an anti pussy guy
kind of thing where uh, you know,

696
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,090
there are controlling, suffocating
people on both sides. Men and women.

697
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,940
And I know that this
women listening and Dave,

698
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,540
one of their best girlfriend started
dating some fucking over bearing

699
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,750
insecure Douche bag guy in.

700
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:16,260
The first thing they do is they cut them
off from their friends and then it's

701
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,750
the coworkers,
then the friends and then their family,

702
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,390
they stick them under a fucking
little glass or something.

703
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:29,240
So, uh, yeah, you know what
dude? You're the worst.

704
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,660
The sad thing is is you're going
to lose a couple of friends.

705
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,560
Sometimes that happens and a, you
just have to be content about it. And

706
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,910
you know,

707
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,430
when I think it's really important for
men and women to have men only and women

708
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:48,431
only social events that they can go to
once a week or a couple of times a month

709
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:56,170
and just hang out with the fellows a hang
out with the ladies and just whatever.

710
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,220
I think it's really, really healthy. It's
gives you something to look forward to.

711
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,630
It gives you a place where you
could just vent about your,

712
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,900
anything you fucking want in,
in a group of people.

713
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:12,350
That 100% is going to understand and
you don't have to worry about hurting

714
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:15,650
anybody's feelings or offending on
anybody. I think it's true. It's really,

715
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,980
really fucking healthy.
And this guy's fucking with that.

716
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,270
And uh, and he didn't put it to a vote.
What does he, the Grand Poobah this shit,

717
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,100
I dunno know. There's so many ways
you can go with that. Just spending,

718
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,810
depending on how much
you want to stir up the,

719
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,620
you guys should put it to the vault. This
would be great. Put it to a vote, dude.

720
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,280
Have this be like you're Arab spring,
but with a fantasy football league.

721
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:45,420
And just vote that content and then you
become the dictator and you move into

722
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:49,590
the palace. How about that?
Whatever, dude, you're 100% right.

723
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,670
I would just, I would choose my
words a little more carefully. Um,

724
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,730
don't say that you didn't have
the balls. Just say, listen,

725
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,550
this was something that we
did together for 12 years and

726
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,093
uh,

727
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,590
I'm really disappointed and shocked that
you made this big a move and remove two

728
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:12,490
other members and didn't
include anybody else in it.

729
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,840
I don't think that it was done right.
And I think we should put this to a vote.

730
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:21,250
That's what we should do.
And if he gets mad and he starts yelling,

731
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,490
don't lose your cool.
Just keep stating your opinion calmly.

732
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,390
And you know, if he's going to be a
bitch about it, let be a bitch about it.

733
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:30,640
And I would actually,
for your own health,

734
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,790
did she all they think she knows is the
jam. She's gonna be like, wait a minute.

735
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,670
Who's that? I have God, I
don't know. Dunno anything.

736
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:39,930
Had she still tried to do that?

737
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,750
You know that thing where women try to
act like they're dumb because they think

738
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:47,480
it's cute. Oh, you know
what I would do, sir?

739
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,180
I would just put you lost this
just fucking with, I don't know.

740
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:52,961
The more I think about it,

741
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,480
the more know what I'm getting at is
ruined my fucking day and I'm not even in

742
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:56,580
it.
I don't even like fantasy for that.

743
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:57,983
Well

744
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,703
[inaudible] [inaudible]

745
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,510
hey,
what's going on?

746
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:43,080
It's bill bird and this is the
Monday morning podcasts on Monday,

747
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,580
August 24th, 2009. How
the hell are you, uh,

748
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,840
another week going by? I got a big
week coming up here. Really excited.

749
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:53,440
I'm actually going to,
uh,

750
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,330
Sweden this week and um,

751
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,180
I really wanted to read
a lot about Sweden.

752
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,960
I want them to know a couple
of the phrases, you know,

753
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:05,970
the ones that you need to know.
Uh,

754
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,100
something about where can
I get something to eat,

755
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,880
how to say thank you and how
to say, dude, do me a favor.

756
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:14,100
Why don't you get the fuck away from me?
You know,

757
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,790
cause you kind of freaking me out.
I mean you need to know,

758
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,180
you need to know how to say that
in every language and your real,

759
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:28,980
that's the one that you really
need to memorize. Okay, so you can,

760
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,310
it was some feeling, you know what
I mean? You can't be like, ah Dude,

761
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:38,620
get the fuck me away.
You know you,

762
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,830
you gotta you gotta you just gotta
come out to get the fuck away from me.

763
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,830
I'm serious. I'm not kidding.
Get the fuck away from me.

764
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,430
You gotta you have to know how
to say that and I have no idea.

765
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:49,120
I'm not gonna lie to you.

766
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,480
All I know about Sweden is that
fucking puppet on the muppet show.

767
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,060
Remember that one?

768
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:58,060
Borghi Borg. The Borg.
Who RBD each mortgage.

769
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,890
Ebooks,

770
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,723
work, work, work.

771
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,770
Here we have it here. Dish, community

772
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,900
number that,
that's all I know you know is,

773
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,930
is Sweden the one where they cross
country ski to school? I know Hitler.

774
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,710
He still look at it across from
the waters. Start jerking off,

775
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,830
wishing he was blond and blue eyed.
You know,

776
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,030
if fucking poor bastard.
Not only did he not, well,

777
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:25,200
not only was he not blonde and blue eyed,
he couldn't even get a chance. He just,

778
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,600
he couldn't, his girlfriend
wasn't even blonde and blue eyed.

779
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,530
You know what I mean?
I'm going to put this out here at LACC.

780
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:34,470
I know there's been a ton of
shit out there on Hitler. Um,

781
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,680
I'm going to put this out here.
This is a theory that I have.

782
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,220
I think Hitler had no game with women.
You know,

783
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,740
women don't like angry guys. Psychos
do psychos, like hangry guys. You know,

784
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,810
I was actually talking to this broad
last night and she was saying how, uh,

785
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,850
I don't know what the fuck
her boyfriend does, but uh,

786
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,730
she was saying up until this point,
like the guy she's dating now,

787
00:48:56,731 --> 00:49:01,731
this is the first time she's a not dated
someone who's a musician and she was

788
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:05,220
just, I and I just thought,
it's like musicians,

789
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,630
they know the passion they have onstage
and that crazy and a guy and I was

790
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,120
really sitting there listening to her.
She described dating musician.

791
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:15,240
I realized that for a female that's the,

792
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,300
that's the female equivalent of a dating
a stripper is if you date a musician,

793
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,690
it's the same fucking thing.
You know, they're on stage,

794
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,740
they're sweaty, they're on
drugs, they're bad with money.

795
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,870
And in the end you have
to take care of him.

796
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,170
You got ended up being a fucking parent.
Wow. That's really fucking came together,

797
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,730
didn't it? Jesus Christ. It's not
bad. It's not bad. Right? Cleo,

798
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,890
look at her. Jesus Christ. Um, anyways,
uh, let's plow ahead here. We got,

799
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,500
we got a lot of shit. So anyways,
I had this, this, this great week.

800
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:49,110
I did this benefit. How
funny is this? Cause uh,

801
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,710
if you guys listen to my podcast last
week I had that incident with that woman

802
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:55,230
from the humane society,
right?

803
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:57,900
So this week talk about irony.

804
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,790
I actually had a gig where
I was doing a benefit for a,

805
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,440
for rescue dogs and it was kind of the
usual thing where I'm sitting in my head

806
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:11,760
going, fuck, I hate doing benefits.
I can't stand to a benefits. My Act,

807
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:15,450
I don't ever, I don't have any jokes
that do well at benefits. I just don't,

808
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,321
there's always like,

809
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:20,190
they always put me on and there's a
bunch of Nice comics in front of me,

810
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,800
or even if they're not nice,
they're being nice.

811
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:26,880
And then I go up there and I try to be
nice and you guys all know I'm a cunt,

812
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,300
so, you know, you can't,

813
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,980
I can't get that cunty tone out of my
voice and I just always end up feeling

814
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,510
crass and ignorant. I just,
I hate doing them right.

815
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,280
But fortunately, this was
actually a great gig. And the, uh,

816
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:47,600
the dude hosts in the show, you know,
he was bringing up all these, uh,

817
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:53,060
these celebrity people. And, uh, I
dunno if I should tell this story,

818
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:56,900
but I'm gonna just cause I don't think
that many people listen to this podcast.

819
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,740
One of the people who went up there was a,

820
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,050
was Priscilla Presley, you
know, uh, Elvis's girlfriend,

821
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,300
wife or whatever and all
that type of stuff. So she's
up there talking about how,

822
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,680
uh, some ridiculous amount of
puppies every year get killed,

823
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,210
you know,

824
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,860
at shelters and get put down like over
a million puppies every year above.

825
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,650
There's really serious moment
and you know, she was dressed,

826
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,870
she looked beautiful and everything.
And uh,

827
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,350
I'm standing back there with
another couple of people and

828
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,000
ah, Jeez, I really shouldn't tell this
story because it involves at the pee pee.

829
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:42,280
Okay, fuck it. This is what comics do
in that situation as everyone else,

830
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:46,450
all you normal people who can get married
and fucking have emotions and shit.

831
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,070
You know when you're getting all welled
up is this icon is talking about dead

832
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:55,150
puppies. And we were
in the back going, ah,

833
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,810
a dude,
she sucked Elvis's dead.

834
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,813
Okay.

835
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,410
That started it.

836
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:09,310
And then what happens with comedians
and then everybody has to top it.

837
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,660
So I'm not going to say where it
went from there, but believe me,

838
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,170
20 seconds into that conversation,
I could barely stand up.

839
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,880
So we're crying. Laughing. Is everyone
else? I can't even say in the room.

840
00:52:21,881 --> 00:52:24,640
It was outside in the parking lot.
It's a long fucking story

841
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,420
and uh, but whatever, and ended up
being this awesome fucking Gig. And, uh,

842
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,110
cause the guy who hosted the show, he
did a real solid, he went up there,

843
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:33,890
first of all,

844
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:38,360
he's the guy who's got to switch it over
from people talking about dead puppies

845
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,440
to a, you know, hey, you know
what's up with a, you know,

846
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:44,480
what's up with these fucking hybrids,
you know,

847
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,730
and you just feel like this asshole.
He had to do that. All right.

848
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,650
And not only does he do it,

849
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,900
he drops the f bomb in his first sentence,

850
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,580
which is just,

851
00:52:58,581 --> 00:53:02,660
I can't even tell you what a classy thing
that is to do as a comedian because it

852
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:06,110
just totally, it just
breaks down. It just,

853
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,730
it just blows the thing wide open.
And He, and he really has to take the,

854
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:16,220
uh, just that reaction from people. I
can't, it's like a kick to the chest.

855
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:19,760
I can't explain it, but, and he totally
took it. And I remember standing,

856
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,980
I was standing offstage going,
you don't want a fucking great guy.

857
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,370
You know what I mean? It's like, that's
like a guy you at, you like that guy,

858
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:29,100
he wouldn't rat on you if the
cops will looking for you.

859
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,720
He wouldn't cock block you.

860
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,990
He wouldn't steal your joke just
to fucking total stand up dude.

861
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,320
You know what I mean? And I already
loved the guy, but as always,

862
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:41,630
I never name names on this fucking
thing. All right. So, uh, so anyway,

863
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:45,270
so that's what we're doing.
So I ended up going up last and um,

864
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:46,861
they just,

865
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:50,700
they were a great crowd and I made fun
of people who say I've rescued a dog and

866
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:52,170
they rolled with everything.

867
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,670
I did all my stuff about having a pit
bull and I just had a great time and I was

868
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:57,570
like,
isn't this great?

869
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,550
This really makes up for that fucking
Twat the week before being such a fucking

870
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:06,830
Twat. Right? So I get off stage and
people are coming out to, oh my God,

871
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:07,531
it's so funny.

872
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:12,060
We were dying laughing Bababababa bar
where you 17 years in your career and

873
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:14,790
you're still playing parking
lots. Who Cares? You're hilarious.

874
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,260
I'm having a great time.
Right?

875
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:21,270
And then all of a sudden this fucking
chick comes up, right? She's got her,

876
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,850
first of all, she's got a hair
in a ponytail in the front part,

877
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:27,030
look like Cameron Diaz, his
hair, when she put the ges,

878
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,690
Ben Stiller's Jizan her hair.
That's what she looked like.

879
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,360
And she comes up to me and I
was talking about, you know,

880
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:36,240
having a pit bull and how
everybody crosses the street
when I come up the street.

881
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,570
And she just goes like, yeah, you know,
I really thought you were finding,

882
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,140
but I have to admit I'm really, I'm really
scared. I'm really scared of pit bulls.

883
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,260
And we start having this conversation.
And I was just like, wow, you know,

884
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,740
I've had one now, you know, four months.
I really think it comes down to the owner,

885
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,640
you know, and basically the dog's
background. She goes, yeah, but you know,

886
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:57,210
you never really hear about a
poodle mauling somebody to death.

887
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:02,430
You never hear that on the news. It's
like, yeah, because they can't, okay.

888
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:08,270
That's the difference between owning a
pit bull and owning a poodle, you know,

889
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,420
is stick to capability of the
animals that you have. Therefore,

890
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,370
if you're a bad owner,

891
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,180
your fuck ups get magnified tenfold.

892
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:23,160
And rather than some mailman wrapping
some gauze around his ankle, you know,

893
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:27,510
they're trying to reattach his
fucking juggler. So, I mean, I'm real,

894
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:31,650
I really believe that. You know what I
mean? Like, I mean this, but granted,

895
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,740
I don't know shit. Okay. And I've only
on this thing for fucking four months,

896
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:39,660
so I have no idea. But that's
what my gut is telling me. Um,

897
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,420
but people have like this
thing. No, I think they just,

898
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,490
they just have this
thing and they just snap.

899
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:48,750
One day they just snap like they're
fucking crazy. And uh, I dunno.

900
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,050
Maybe I'm blinded by the love
I have for this fucking dog,

901
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:55,170
but I don't believe it. So we just keep
going back and forth and she goes, I go,

902
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:59,550
no, it's a pit pole has the
ability to mall somebody to death.

903
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,600
Okay. A poodle is thinking the
same shit. A pit bull is thinking,

904
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,090
I'm going to rip your fucking face off.
It just can't do it.

905
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,860
But when it's going at your ankle, it's
trained to mile you to death. It is.

906
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,640
It just can't. First of all, it's
fucking Afro gets in the way, you know?

907
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,040
You know like when you're fighting your
little brother and you just stick your

908
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,200
hand on your, on his forehead
and he's swinging and wind.

909
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,240
That's what happens to a portal.
You know,

910
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:24,250
if they come in with the crown of their
head, which if they played in the NFL,

911
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:27,070
they get fined for it. All right?
Nobody ever talks about that.

912
00:56:27,071 --> 00:56:31,030
How fucking dirty those goddamn poodles
are always coming in leading with their

913
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:34,660
fucking heads, right? What happens?

914
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:37,480
That little poofy thing and and
and on the top gets in the way.

915
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:41,200
It's a little cushion. So you kind of feel
that first year, Ooh, is that a Koozie?

916
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,870
Oh no, that's a poodle
trying to maul me to death.

917
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,640
And then you just boot it right in.

918
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,500
It's little fucking pathetic excuse for
a chest and then it's over. You know?

919
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,281
Isn't that funny?

920
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:53,380
When you kick a little dog off you
when they're trying to bite Ya.

921
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,660
And then they do that shit where
they still want to be tough,

922
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,080
but they're sort of walking away
as they're still growing, you know?

923
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,970
But they don't totally
commit to walking away,

924
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:03,250
but they also don't totally
commit to attacking you again.

925
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,520
And then you just look at him like,
yeah, that's what I thought. You know?

926
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,890
That's what I thought. Couldn't
take a cooker. So anyways,

927
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:12,910
so we're going back and forth,
so I'm not agreeing with this woman.

928
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,090
She's not making any good points.
And then right in the middle of it,

929
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:20,650
she just goes, yeah, well
I'm actually, I'm an animal
expert. I'm an animal expert.

930
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:23,920
Like you know, I don't know
where she just says that. I go,

931
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:27,040
you're an animal expert. She goes,
yeah. And then she just goes, whatever.

932
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,020
And then she walks away.
This is that a benefit. Okay.

933
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:35,410
I just donated my time for fucking free.
Okay.

934
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:39,190
I had to figure out how to do
well standing in a parking lot.

935
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,420
Okay. I went through all
of that bullshit, you know,

936
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:45,730
me and all my friends had to
go on after people, you know,

937
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:50,410
talking about dead puppies and then this
fucking twat comes up and hits me with

938
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:54,850
that. And it was, uh, his
Sumpter for you guys. Okay.

939
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:57,340
Anytime anybody has to break out credits

940
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,740
to support their argument,
they, they lost the argument.

941
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:07,150
Okay. Who the fuck says that? First
of all, I'm, I'm uh, I'm actually,

942
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:11,620
I'm an expert on animals.
Really, really in,

943
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:15,520
you're afraid of dogs, you know,
as a fucking expert on animals.

944
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:18,640
Is that Goddamn Cesar Milan,
the dog whisperer.

945
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,530
He's not afraid of fucking dogs.

946
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,700
He'll walk into a whole bunch of them
that hit 42 of them that some old lady was

947
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,630
adopted and they turned themselves
into a fucking wild pack.

948
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,170
He walks into a middle of them and goes,
and everybody shuts the fuck up.

949
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:36,100
That guy is an expert and I have never
heard him once say, I am an expert.

950
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:41,050
He's never said that shit. Okay?
I got to tell you this right now.

951
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:44,830
If I was an expert on animals and I
was debating with a moron like me,

952
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,020
I would never have to
bring out that credit.

953
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:50,680
What I would be doing was just
throwing out all my expert knowledge.

954
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,510
First of all, what I do, I was,

955
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:56,770
I would feign stupidity and let me
Wade right into the fucking, you know,

956
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,770
you know let's shit where you think the
water is only two feet deep and all of a

957
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:02,590
sudden it just drops off a hundred feet.
That's what the fuck I would do.

958
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,080
I let you come walking in with all your,
Ooh,

959
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:07,690
I watch discovery channel for 15 minutes.
Bullshit,

960
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,730
and then I'd hit you over the head with
such fucking knowledge about pit bulls

961
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:16,920
and dogs that, that, that you would
come up with the conclusion of, Goddamn,

962
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,490
this person's a fucking expert.

963
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:24,740
But if you're standing with your fucking
just in hair and you don't make one

964
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:28,310
point and then you just go,
I'm an expert and animal expert,

965
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,520
and then you go whatever, like a
fucking seventh grade and you walk away.

966
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:33,860
You know what?
I'm a little biased here,

967
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:38,000
but I'm going to claim
victory on that one. Whatever.

968
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,530
Looking at how I did it. Who gives a fuck?
You know, what the fuck is it about me?

969
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:45,380
I don't understand. I really
don't understand you fucking Twat.

970
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,680
I did the exact fucking thing that
you guys are trying to do here.

971
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,640
Try to get people to fucking rescue dogs.
Okay.

972
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:57,110
And I did it and I got the biggest psycho
of them all. I went for the pit bull.

973
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:57,680
Okay?

974
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,480
Anybody can go down and rescue a fucking
Chihuahua and go take them down to Taco

975
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,090
Bell and laugh with your friends as your
dress him up in a little fucking midget

976
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,600
fur coat. You know? And you get
the same fucking credit I do.

977
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:14,330
Fucking animal expert. Go
Fuck Yourself. How about debt?

978
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:19,370
Go Fuck yourself and go rinse out
your hair. All right, so anyways,

979
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:27,110
let's plow ahead here. Um, Oh, before
we get going here, there's something,

980
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:30,620
I guess I remember last week when I
basically grovelled for you people to come

981
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:34,910
to Ontario, the Improv
in Ontario. I jinxed it.

982
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:39,590
Okay? I literally did that. That, you
know, begging you guys to come out.

983
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:42,470
Like I was doing a fucking
telethon and then what happens?

984
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:47,270
Like two days later my guy calls me, oh,
we got to move the day. Distinct came in,

985
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,680
you got to do this day. But bubba,
so now the Ontario Improv Gig is off.

986
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,930
It's not totally off. It
is being rescheduled. Um,

987
01:00:56,931 --> 01:01:00,350
I'm actually doing a college gig.
It's a long,

988
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,120
long fucking story,

989
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,500
but I apologize because I got
probably a half a dozen dozen emails,

990
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:08,810
which is a lot for me
of people telling me.

991
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,300
I went out and I bought tickets
so psyched to see us a site.

992
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:15,770
You're going to be in California. I'm here
to support your bill. You know, you're,

993
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:20,510
you rang the bell and I answered
the call. Okay, and what do I get?

994
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,790
Four I get a fucking slap in the face.

995
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,830
I apologize to all you guys
went out and bought tickets.

996
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:29,340
I feel like an asshole and I'm a,

997
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,700
I don't know what to tell you because
I'm going to be ringing the bell again

998
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:36,440
when that fucking thing comes around
because I don't know, southern California,

999
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,360
this is like the fucking matrix out here.

1000
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,460
I don't even know if that's the rain
analogy. I don't know what it is.

1001
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:41,294
It's kind of,
you know,

1002
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,230
I've got to get on one of those Latino
stations out here that'll get a white guy

1003
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:48,590
on there,
learned some Spanish for some shit.

1004
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,970
I gotta do something because it ain't
happening for me out here. Um, anyways,

1005
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:57,620
let's plow ahead here. Uh, all right,
here's a story that somebody sent me.

1006
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:01,610
Here's the story that somebody
sent me that I found interesting.

1007
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,560
I really thought it interesting.
Um, there's, you know,

1008
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:11,780
you've got these bloggers here on the,
uh, you know, bloggers. Sure. We all do.

1009
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:12,860
Hell,

1010
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,700
I even blog for a while till I found
out that my space owned them and can do

1011
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:21,460
whatever the fuck they wanted to
with them. Um, but anyways, you know,

1012
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,550
all these bloggers, they, they
make fun of what celebrities,

1013
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,700
where they say a bunch of stuff,
they draw cum on their face,

1014
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,180
they do all that hilarious
shit or whatever.

1015
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,240
So evidently one of them at something
called I think skanks of New York and I

1016
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,700
fucking know what it was. But, uh,

1017
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:43,020
they basically trashed this supermodel.

1018
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,770
I can't call her a supermodel cause
I never heard of her. Her name is

1019
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,390
Liz Kula Cohen Cohen,
let's cool. Let's Schoola

1020
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,870
to live quietly.

1021
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,460
It's like me trying to say that rapper's
name and I already forgot how to say

1022
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,890
quickly. I don't give a fuck what
I'm telling you that right now.

1023
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:05,280
You guys send me all that hip hop
shit and uh, I'm really liking that,

1024
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:09,600
that most deaf Alma from 1999 was
that the one black on both sides?

1025
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,200
I Dunno. I've actually listened
to two of the tracks on it.

1026
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:17,160
And at first it was
beyond me. Yeah, it was,

1027
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:20,130
it was beyond what my
year's could fucking handle.

1028
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:23,850
And now I have slowly caught up and
now I'm really starting to love it.

1029
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:25,290
And I only downloaded two of the songs.

1030
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:29,310
Now I'm going to go back and download the
rest of the fucking album, uh, legally,

1031
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,410
by the way. So anyways, uh,
this list Cooler Cohen, who, uh,

1032
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,080
does not look like a supermodel, I gotta
be honest with you. She looks like, um,

1033
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,570
some hot mom who settled for less and is
now sitting there going, you know what?

1034
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,710
I could've been a model,

1035
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,240
but instead I married the Douche bag and
accounting and I have two kids and I'm

1036
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:53,490
going to call the SAC.
And it's not exciting.

1037
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,590
We have macaroni and cheese
with toast every Wednesday.

1038
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:03,150
I just don't like my life. And you
know, you know where it goes from there.

1039
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,350
Then she ends up,
you know,

1040
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,960
she ends up blowing that guy who
hangs out in the fucking local borrow,

1041
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,330
has the cool car, goes right back to
high school, you know what I mean?

1042
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:16,260
She just looks for the biggest swinging
dick she can find within our area,

1043
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,680
you know? And then, yeah, that's
what she looks like to me.

1044
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,260
I wonder if she's gonna Fuck
Whoa. I, she can't fucking out me.

1045
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:27,800
She knows who the fuck I am. The Monday
morning podcast. Conti. Alright. Uh,

1046
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,090
so this is what happens is
a vogue cover girl has one,

1047
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:34,740
a precedent setting court battle to unmask
an anonymous blogger who called her a

1048
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:39,690
skank on the Internet. I mean,
they basically paraphrase what uh,

1049
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,490
what the person said.
They both would have to say,

1050
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:45,750
I want to have to say the first place
award for this Skanky iest in New York

1051
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:49,500
City would have to go to lists.
Schoola Genteel Cohen,

1052
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,340
the blogger anonymous wrote in one posting
the blog sense remove sense removed,

1053
01:04:55,771 --> 01:05:00,771
ridiculed the former Australian vogue
cover girl as a 40 something who may have

1054
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:05,580
been hot 10 years ago when
she was actually a 36.

1055
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,680
So evidently,

1056
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:10,770
I guess they had been going off on her
for awhile and she got tired of it.

1057
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:14,920
So she went to Google and
she sued to have the, uh,

1058
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,440
she wanted to know who this person was.
Who was her.

1059
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,220
So somebody sent me an email and was like,
can you believe this?

1060
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:24,730
Fucking so-and-so does in
this come with being famous.

1061
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:28,120
Why don't you go cry with all
your money and blah, blah,

1062
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,280
the usual shit that they
say about celebrity.

1063
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:34,600
And I have to be honest with you guys,
I can see both sides of this story.

1064
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,730
Okay?
First and foremost,

1065
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:42,150
the fact that she was able to
get Google to cave in and to uh,

1066
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:47,610
give her the name of the blogger is kind
of a dangerous thing where once cases

1067
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:52,270
like this happen, you know, it's
this little fucking whatever case,

1068
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,030
a bunch of people, you
know, you open that door,

1069
01:05:55,180 --> 01:06:00,180
fucking run through the door and a piggy
back on that case and then all of a

1070
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:05,800
sudden there'll be laws where you can
censor what people write and you can sue

1071
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:09,790
people. Um, so,

1072
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,320
cause I mean the Internet right now is
like the fucking wild west back in the

1073
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,170
day. Do you ever think about
that shit? There was no banks,

1074
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:22,210
there was no fucking credit cards.
You know, there was no mortgage.

1075
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,470
You just chopped down some trees with
your friends and your built a square with

1076
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:31,360
a roof on it. You know, shooting
Indians, there was, you know,

1077
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:35,950
hang 'em, high fucking
frontier, Justice, rape,

1078
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,300
pillage,
all that type of shit.

1079
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:40,960
That's what the Internet is
basically like right now.

1080
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:42,400
And they're essentially,

1081
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:45,970
I think with stuff like this
will eventually whittle it down.

1082
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:50,080
Um, and you know, it's
Kinda hard to, you know,

1083
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,710
some of this stuff and obviously is
horrible pornography on it. You know,

1084
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:56,620
I'm not really into that shit.
I wish I could stop fucking watching it.

1085
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,650
I wish someone would actually helped
me to stop watching it by censoring it.

1086
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,980
What a fucking pathetic
loser I am. But anyways, um,

1087
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,530
but then you can go too far with this
shit cause I was saying you guys don't let

1088
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,680
famous picture that iconic photo that,
that,

1089
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:16,270
that guy who stood in front of
the tank in Tiananmen Square, uh,

1090
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,530
back in 1990 or 89 or nine and it was
89 if you can believe it was 20 fucking

1091
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:25,090
years ago that happened. Most Chinese
young people in their twenties,

1092
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,860
if you show them that photo, they don't
even know what it is, what it refers to.

1093
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,100
Cause they basically over there with their
fucking police state is they just oh,

1094
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,600
race,
the whole existence,

1095
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:40,600
like in a style and ask kind
of way where back in the day,

1096
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:42,220
I don't know if George,
um,

1097
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,940
George Yosef Stalin would, uh,
you know, he's a paranoid psycho.

1098
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:51,760
And when he would offer you,
not only would he have you killed,

1099
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:56,600
he would have some dude like a
ratio out of all photos, like your,

1100
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,410
your existence.
You didn't even exist.

1101
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,190
There was no like documentation
of it. And that's, you know,

1102
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,540
that's the other end of this
little cases like this that uh,

1103
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:12,580
that make them scary. But having said that
on the other side, just as a performer,

1104
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,970
um, I actually love
that, that piece of Shit,

1105
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:20,480
little fucking rat got dragged
out into the sunlight. Okay.

1106
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,540
Because even at the
pathetic level that I'm on,

1107
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,300
you can't believe how bad you
get fucking trash to the point.

1108
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:30,590
I never read any reviews. I don't
read, I don't read anything.

1109
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:35,090
I never watch any clips in mind on the
Internet. I never do any of that shit,

1110
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,640
uh,
because people just,

1111
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,400
they just write the most horrific
shit that they can about you.

1112
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:44,450
And it would be hypocritical of me
because I'm a comedian and look at me,

1113
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:48,170
I trashed people all the time, so I can't
get mad at it, but I got to admit, dude,

1114
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:52,760
I don't want to read it. Um, so,

1115
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:57,710
but this, she's just a fucking
model. You know what I mean? And,

1116
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,220
um, I dunno this just like
a point where you, you know,

1117
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,650
you're in the public eye and
someone can trash you, but you know,

1118
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,920
they start writing shit that if
you actually had it in a newspaper,

1119
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:11,690
you'd get sued for slander.
You know what I mean?

1120
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:15,980
To suggest that she's 40 years old when
she's only 36 might not seem like a big

1121
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,180
deal to me or anybody else.

1122
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:21,830
But that's a huge fucking thing in the
modeling industry. And not only that,

1123
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:23,240
I gotta tell you these
fucking industry people,

1124
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,850
they don't know shit about the Internet.
They don't know how to control it,

1125
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,140
to trying to figure it out.

1126
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,910
And all it takes is one douchebag
with enough fucking people behind him.

1127
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,030
And they're like, oh, this
is what everybody's thinking.

1128
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,450
So does fucking Twat is writing this
stuff about her and she's actually

1129
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,970
potentially fucking with
her ability to get gigs.

1130
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:50,560
So I'm not saying that the person
shouldn't be able to do that,

1131
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:54,040
but if you're going to do something
that at somebody, at least, you know,

1132
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,530
have the balls to put your name out there,
you know?

1133
01:09:59,531 --> 01:10:00,340
And that's what I like,

1134
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,770
because now this person's going to get
dragged out there and hopefully people

1135
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,100
will know who the fuck she is and she'll
get to see what it feels like because

1136
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,950
then people are going to be
going off on her. You know?

1137
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,530
Cause actually it turned out that it
was, it was one of this, this, uh,

1138
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:16,240
this model's friends, which I think
is fucking hilarious. You know,

1139
01:10:16,241 --> 01:10:19,750
how awful and awkward, you
know, does she feel right now?

1140
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,940
You know what the worst thing is,
is I bet she cried.

1141
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,170
I'm so sorry.

1142
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:28,310
I just thought going through some things
and you're just so beautiful and I

1143
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:31,820
don't know I, I'm sowing bears, you know,

1144
01:10:31,821 --> 01:10:34,850
they just fucking cry their
way out of that shit. Well,

1145
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:36,140
I think that works with guys.

1146
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,530
It doesn't work with women because they
that cause this fucking supermodel chick

1147
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,850
, she probably does that
shit too. I'm sorry I do.

1148
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,230
Colgate keeps me scary.
I didn't want to,

1149
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:49,760
I look cut belly by the
fucking bikini shot, you know,

1150
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,300
so that shit doesn't work on her.
You know what I mean?

1151
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,460
That'd be like trying to
use the force against Yoda.

1152
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,920
He knows what the fuck you do.

1153
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,340
So I think it's great.

1154
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,720
I hope she just fucking stares at him
when this blubbering fucking coward,

1155
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,820
you know, cow or did I really
just use that fucking word?
Whatever. Fucking little,

1156
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,840
you know what? This is the difference
between what I do, because look at me.

1157
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:19,170
I'm going off on this girl right now,
but you know, I don't fucking know her.

1158
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:23,580
All right. This, I'm going to justify
my boat. I am so full of Shit, right?

1159
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,980
This is how I'm going to justify me.
I don't know her.

1160
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:30,300
And also my name is on this podcast,
so no need to sue me.

1161
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,480
You know who the fuck I am and then I
have shit on the Internet that she could

1162
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:38,090
then go comment on, you
know. Right. All right.

1163
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,680
I better than that fucking piece of shit.
I don't think I am.

1164
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:45,930
I think get Jesus Christ. I think
I'm the same person. Um, all right.

1165
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:48,630
So if that made any sense. I
think it's scary that, that,

1166
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:51,030
that this case could actually start,
uh,

1167
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,540
opening the door for some major
censorship in the future. And,

1168
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,730
but then on the other
side, I love that, uh,

1169
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,460
somebody who was talking
shit got caught for it.

1170
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:04,490
I really liked that and I just wish I
could have had a video of that girl trying

1171
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,520
to fight the injunction or whatever
the hell the legal term is,

1172
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,410
realizing that Google was going to give
up her name and just her freaking the

1173
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:16,530
fuck out, realizing, you know,

1174
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,950
trying to get off that track when you
know it's headed right towards a brick

1175
01:12:19,951 --> 01:12:21,000
wall and she can't.

1176
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,360
And then that fucking moment when she
realizes that our friend knows that she's

1177
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,760
the fucking Twat who's been
writing all that shit about her.

1178
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,590
And then she sits there going, what
do I do? What do I do? Do I call her?

1179
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:40,200
What do I say? And as she's trying
to work all of that bullshit out,

1180
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:44,310
her home phone rings and
who's on the caller id?

1181
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,380
But this chick who she called a fucking
skank. You know what I bet our friend, uh,

1182
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:54,030
this this fucking list Cooler Cohen was
actually talking to the girl looking for

1183
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:58,380
some comfort. They're writing all
these horrible things about me.

1184
01:12:58,381 --> 01:13:02,760
Why do people write the thing? And that
fucking Twat kept a straight face going.

1185
01:13:02,761 --> 01:13:03,750
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1186
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:08,700
And then like silently getting like
some joy out of the fact that she's

1187
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:13,050
torturing her and she probably,
you know, as she comforted her,

1188
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,110
tried to figure out what
part of it hurt her most.

1189
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:20,360
I know it's just terrible
that she called you as skank.

1190
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:25,290
I think that's way worse than questioning.
If you're 40 years old,

1191
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:29,700
don't you? Or do you think the age thing
hurts more? They're, they're there,

1192
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,610
you know, and basically figuring
out how to attack her even more.

1193
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:37,440
I love that she got caught. I
love it. That's fucking great.

1194
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,680
All right, let's move on. And
this is, this is basically,

1195
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:44,460
and I went on a couple of
these, these bloggers sites.
Um, and I got to met. Dude, I,

1196
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:48,840
I've gone on these, these, um,
some of these blogger things, uh,

1197
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:53,760
actually has bullshit. I have on my,
uh, my girlfriend looks at some of them.

1198
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,670
She's into that guy, uh, uh,

1199
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:59,520
Perez Hilton and he's a due to drugs the
g has on people's face. And I got it.

1200
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:03,540
That's just fucking funny.
Alright. It's childish.

1201
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,480
It's, it's, it's not mature.

1202
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:11,040
It's everything that makes
something fucking hilarious. And uh,

1203
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,760
and you know who the guy is, you know
his name, you know he's out there.

1204
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,550
There's pictures of him on the Internet,
so people trash and back.

1205
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:20,290
I think it's a little tit for tat there,

1206
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,750
but if you're going to write all
that bullshit and go under anonymous,

1207
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:25,010
I don't know. I think
there's a, all right, well,

1208
01:14:25,011 --> 01:14:28,180
why don't you say the same thing 58
fucking times? We got it. All right.

1209
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:30,070
So anyways, so I went on one
of these these blogger things,

1210
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:34,210
and this is the type of
shit that people, right? Um,

1211
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:37,090
they were going off on Ringo Starr.
There was basically,

1212
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:41,500
why is Ringo Starr such a jerk? And
I just, I already love where this,

1213
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,440
the jumping off point of this, you know,
none of these people I've ever met him.

1214
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,500
I thought somebody would have met him
in an airport and they asked them,

1215
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:51,750
they said, hey, uh, hey
Ringo, uh, can you sign, uh,

1216
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,660
can you sign my fucking tee shirt and
can you also answer me why you've been

1217
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:58,150
wearing the same earring
for the last 40 years?

1218
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,840
That long one that's hanging down like
Kurt Russel in big trouble in little

1219
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:08,740
China. Okay. That look was out in the 80s.

1220
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,110
That fucking long dangling earring.

1221
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,590
You like the bad guy in some
fucking a Mel Gibson movie,

1222
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,490
or at least you have the jewelry of
the bad guy. All right. Uh, Sony was,

1223
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:23,530
it says a Beatles member. Ringo Starr
posted a video to today to his fans,

1224
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:28,090
telling them that he will no longer be
accepting any fan mail after October 20th

1225
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:33,190
because he has too much to
do. Uh, and then it says what?

1226
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:35,140
Like counting your piles of money,

1227
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:40,590
sliding down a solid gold
waterslide making origami hunting.

1228
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,820
What the fuck that is,
or a famous said that right.

1229
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:46,630
Origami out of hundred dollar
bills. And then it says, Huh,

1230
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:51,400
here's the video fucking Moron people,
right?

1231
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:56,500
Like, because he's rich and famous, like
he's got nothing better to do. And just,

1232
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:58,510
I mean,
the guy's like 70 years old.

1233
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:02,770
Maybe his fucking wrist hurts
from writing back to people.

1234
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:05,320
Okay.
Maybe you know,

1235
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:10,540
he sick and he knows he's gonna die and
he wants to go fucking drive a Harley

1236
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,260
Davidson across the [inaudible].

1237
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,950
You have no fucking idea what's going on
in this guy's life. So somebody writes,

1238
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,230
I've lost all respect for this man.

1239
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,560
How rude and disrespectful
to all his fans.

1240
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,900
He should be kissing the
fans ass since, uh, acids.

1241
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:29,650
Since us fans are the ones who
made him who he is today. I,

1242
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:34,651
there's nothing I fucking hate more than
when fans take credit for the fucking

1243
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:38,610
unbelievable talent of a fucking,
of ring of,

1244
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,210
of a star like that.

1245
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:45,100
Really the fans made the Beatles
the greatest fucking band ever.

1246
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,260
You know,
like,

1247
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,790
like any of the fans could fucking
ignore what a juggernaut that bandwidth,

1248
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,360
oh yeah, sergeant pepper's.
Yeah. Fuck that. That had
nothing to do with anything.

1249
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:59,260
If it wasn't for those fans
screaming at their shows,

1250
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:03,790
you know, that's, you don't
make them who they are.

1251
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,080
They make who they are.

1252
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:09,230
It's not like they're sitting there and
then you guys all walk up to them and go,

1253
01:17:09,231 --> 01:17:11,810
hey, you want to be
famous? Get up on stage,

1254
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:14,990
play whatever you want and we're
going to scream and go nuts. No,

1255
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:18,740
they have to fucking go into bars and
they have to get booed and they have to

1256
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:19,850
have shit thrown at him.

1257
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:22,640
That whole blues brothers scene with
a beer bottles get thrown at you or

1258
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:25,610
whatever. You got to go through
fucking 20 years of that shit.

1259
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,970
Actually those cuts they made
when they were like 25 whatever,

1260
01:17:28,971 --> 01:17:32,030
10 15 fucking years of that crap.
All right?

1261
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:38,630
You have to have the balls to walk away
from the safe life of going to college

1262
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,690
and getting a fucking job and no one,
you're going to have a paycheck.

1263
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,030
You have to step off
into the fucking abyss.

1264
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:49,160
Knowing that 99.9% a year never even
make enough to get out of that stinky,

1265
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:53,300
sweaty fucking van that you're
driving around in you gotta,

1266
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,650
you gotta you basically,

1267
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:59,750
you take your life savings and you bet
on the fucking 90 to one dog, you know,

1268
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,260
that's what the fuck you do, all
right? And then you have to come with,

1269
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,920
you have to create something that's so
fucking great that that amount of people

1270
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:09,440
will pay attention to it.
All right?

1271
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:14,330
You fucking arrogant assholes.
This guy's probably, they say,

1272
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,690
this guy's probably been answer in fan
mails and sign an og or autographs for

1273
01:18:17,691 --> 01:18:21,200
half a fucking century.
He wants to put the pen down.

1274
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:25,310
Can he do that in his
seventies you're fucking twats

1275
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:30,320
Jesus Christ.
And having said all that,

1276
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:34,190
I will be signing my DVDs and
kissing babies after all of my shows.

1277
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:42,020
Ah, you know what? I would love to get
to that level where I could just be like,

1278
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:46,370
yeah, listen, yeah, I'm not interacting
with you motherfuckers anymore. You know,

1279
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,780
and I'm so fucking, it's almost like
he can live off the interest. You know,

1280
01:18:50,781 --> 01:18:52,970
when you have so much money, you can
live off the interest of your money.

1281
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:57,971
He can live off the interest of the fan
base that he has an amount of how much

1282
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:01,850
it drops off because he's
not going to sell, you know,

1283
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,500
sign eight by tens from that fucking
Bangladesh concert he did with George

1284
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:10,220
Harrison. You know? That's another
reason why I wouldn't want to be him.

1285
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:12,920
Sign a fucking autographs.
You know what I mean?

1286
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:17,120
It's really depressing to look at
a headshot of myself 10 years ago.

1287
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:21,890
Forget about one 40 fucking years
ago. You know what I mean? You know,

1288
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:26,080
no one ever comes up with a head shot of
Ringo fucking 70 years old putting Ben

1289
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:29,150
gay on his fucking Bass Drum foot.
You know,

1290
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:33,610
they always got on when he's young and
in his prime and he probably sits today

1291
01:19:33,611 --> 01:19:35,570
like, what's the matter
mate? You know like me now.

1292
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:40,160
How about when I'm all wrinkled up?
What a terrible fucking does that ring go?

1293
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:43,370
Who the fuck was that? I don't know who
that was. All I know is that was horrible.

1294
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,880
And if you had a fucking
shred of self esteem,

1295
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:49,550
you'd fucking stop this podcast right now.
All right,

1296
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:53,750
let's get onto some are videos here.
Um, this is in a funny youtube video.

1297
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:57,230
This is a fucking amazing
video. Okay. And I go,

1298
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:02,030
I want you guys right now to take out a
pen if you're in your cubicle slide over

1299
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:05,270
your little yellow sticky things
because this is a long link.

1300
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:10,690
And this is a guy who basically explains
the banking crisis and how we're moving

1301
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:15,180
into like the little robot age where,
uh,

1302
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,520
you know, some of the stuff that
they're coming up with like their,

1303
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,880
they can like grow an ear in a petri dish.

1304
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:25,881
Now they're talking about some lady who
had like an owl cancer of her esophagus

1305
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:30,480
and they scraped off from
some cells from her esophagus,

1306
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:34,020
put it in a dish and they grew
her a new fucking esophagus.

1307
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:40,590
And then it goes all into like if you're
into the bionic man and hybrid cars and

1308
01:20:41,081 --> 01:20:44,710
Cyborgs, it's, they got a
fucking clip on this thing.

1309
01:20:44,711 --> 01:20:49,600
This is the trailer for it where this
showing this robot that basically looks

1310
01:20:49,601 --> 01:20:52,840
like a turtle with midget giraffe legs,

1311
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,260
a turtle on stilts,

1312
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:03,290
like deer legs and it is running sort of
trotting along and the scientists walks

1313
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:08,280
up and just fucking gives it a front
kick as hard as you possibly could to the

1314
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:12,180
side, which would have
tipped over any other robot.

1315
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,270
And this thing just sort of does,
just goes with it like a living,

1316
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:18,540
breathing thing. Like whoa.
Kind of like goes to the side.

1317
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:22,200
Like you know like when a running back
is doing a sweep and that guy dies and he

1318
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:25,230
hits him in his hip and it just
knocked some five feet sideways.

1319
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:27,780
But he's able to regain his balance
and continue moving forward.

1320
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,910
That's what the fuck
this robot thing does.

1321
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:35,130
So this dude starts with the banks and
he ends with these robots and he starts

1322
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:39,450
talking about how all the different
versions of man have overlapped each other

1323
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:43,680
like uh, uh, like neanderthals,

1324
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:45,970
Homo sapiens and that type
of whatever they, they,

1325
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:51,260
they at one point we both exist existed
on the earth at the same time before

1326
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:52,920
homo sapiens took over.

1327
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,090
I know I'm using the wrong fucking cro
magnums Nariana falls or whatever they

1328
01:21:57,091 --> 01:21:58,410
overlapped and that type of shit.

1329
01:21:58,411 --> 01:22:03,411
So what this guy is trying to suggest is
that the half robot and person is going

1330
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,720
to overlap the 100% human thing.
It is. It's the fucking shit.

1331
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:14,310
And it's not boring either guys. Actually
he keeps it funny. So here is the link.

1332
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,280
Okay. Would that really long
trailer, I wanted to do that.

1333
01:22:17,281 --> 01:22:19,650
So you guys have time to jot this
down cause you really should watch it.

1334
01:22:19,651 --> 01:22:24,630
It's fucking fascinating.
It's www dot ted.

1335
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:25,531
Like the name Ted,

1336
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:30,531
t e d.com/talks/one_and as e n r I Q,

1337
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:40,620
u e z underscore shares,

1338
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:46,100
s h a r e s underscores
underscore mind boggling,

1339
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,790
underscore, knew half of you don't
even give a fuck at this point. I know,

1340
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:55,590
but some of you do underscore
science. Dot. H T m L.

1341
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:01,350
Alright. And if you got lost in all that,
just go to ted.com and just, you know,

1342
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,930
go around the web sets.
What I gave you was a direct link,

1343
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:06,850
but you can go around the website and
I'm sure you can find a cause. It's a,

1344
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,260
you know,
as dumb as I sounded the other day.

1345
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:16,600
Jesus Christ. Nia. Um, sorry.

1346
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,340
What, what you're looking good.
You're looking really good.

1347
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:29,490
All right, well I didn't know you
were in the room. Okay. Anyways, uh,

1348
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,640
so anyways, um, what do you mean is
wrong with me? What's wrong with you?

1349
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,680
I'm doing a podcast here.

1350
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:42,550
Didn't you see the red light on outside
the fucking bedroom door that said on

1351
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:45,760
air? I love what you just
laugh at me when I do these.

1352
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,290
See, she is the advantage
of seeing how crazy I look.

1353
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:52,160
I'm basically sitting here in my boxers,
my t shirt and my little headphones,

1354
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,800
like I'm doing some sort of pirate
radio and she literally walks in as,

1355
01:23:55,801 --> 01:23:59,900
I'm like a ted underscore slash backspace.

1356
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:04,550
What's going on with the
world underscore.com. Hotmail.

1357
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:07,850
You're really dating a fucking loser.
How does that feel?

1358
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,900
You were going to this way.
They wouldn't let him do this number.

1359
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,930
Maybe upset. They think like that. Yeah.

1360
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,880
Right. This is, this thing is for me
to trash people not to get trashed.

1361
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:27,410
Why don't you fucking get Outta here?
Get outta here. All right. Thank you.

1362
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:33,020
I want to sweetheart now beat
it. All right. All right,

1363
01:24:33,021 --> 01:24:37,460
let's, let's fucking get this. Uh,
let's get this back together here.

1364
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:42,620
All right. She's stumbling out of the
room laughing at me. See, you hear that.

1365
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:44,760
You're laughing.
All right.

1366
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:49,020
Here's a, here's a really good email
that I got. Um, somebody said, Bill,

1367
01:24:49,021 --> 01:24:52,020
if you're looking for a
sport, a new sport, um,

1368
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,460
I'm gradually getting back
into baseball by the way. Uh,

1369
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:56,520
I've got to support my red sox because,
uh,

1370
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:02,160
they're either going through the dog
days right now. All right. And, uh,

1371
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:06,180
you know, be one thing at the red sox
were doing good. And I was just like,

1372
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:09,510
all right, I, I need to take a
break from baseball, you know,

1373
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:12,480
then I could actually do it. But the fact
that they're not doing well right now,

1374
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:17,470
now, now, you know, this is when the real
fans show who the fuck they are. So I'm,

1375
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,920
I'm coming back,
I'm gradually coming back,

1376
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:23,010
but this guy was giving me a suggestion
on a sports that I should watch. It said,

1377
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:26,700
Bill, if you're looking for a sport,
you really need to delve into MMA,

1378
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:29,940
UFC and make an effort
to become a serious fan.

1379
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:34,410
I really got into it for awhile and,
uh, um, I still really like it. I just,

1380
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:39,210
I get busy and on the road
and I, I try to, um, I mean,

1381
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:41,700
my favorite reality show is the
ultimate fighter. You know what I mean?

1382
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,880
Every other fucking show
you make a bad sloppy Joe.

1383
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:47,950
When you get kicked off the show and
this one you get your fucking ask.

1384
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,690
He literally get beaten off the show.
So I really enjoy that. But anyways, um,

1385
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:56,280
said I know you're a casual fan,
but the sport really is exciting,

1386
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:57,300
highly technical in its,

1387
01:25:57,301 --> 01:26:01,410
satisfies a primal urge with men
to compete and beat on one another.

1388
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:06,710
But in s and a somewhat state, uh,
safe and sanctioned environment,

1389
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:10,910
I know that 50 to 75% of the
fans are meatheads and strippers

1390
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,060
a while.
That's annoying.

1391
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:18,720
You just have to block that out
and focus on the sport itself. It,

1392
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,340
it,
uh,

1393
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,450
it really is the future because it's so
natural and basic and doesn't require

1394
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:27,650
any super fluid. I don't want to say it
supply. How do you say that? Nea Supply.

1395
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:29,243
So peripherals,

1396
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:34,200
there's no fucking I in that
he wrote super and then f you.

1397
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:39,140
F L U O. U. S Super, Huh. Oh good.

1398
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,090
You had dumped to,
let's have a dumb kid

1399
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:47,660
and then we'll be those parents
who show up when they go. Yeah.

1400
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,700
Basically your kids are more
annuity. Is it cute? Smart.

1401
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,850
Um, all right. Anyways, it says a,

1402
01:26:55,851 --> 01:27:00,470
it really is the future because it's
so natural and basically and basic.

1403
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,330
It doesn't require any.
All my God,

1404
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:05,360
I thought I went past the sentence where
this word is and I'm back to it again.

1405
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,480
And he superfluous rules and equipment.

1406
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,450
It's just mad verse man with nothing
but physical fighting skills.

1407
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:16,460
Strategic Acumen. Is this guy trying
to fuck me up and courage. Beautiful.

1408
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,710
All right guys, you find a new
thing that you can do to me.

1409
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,140
Send emails with big words that
I can't pronounce. Pronounce.

1410
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,110
I'm just as just fucking unraveling.
All right,

1411
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:29,150
let's get to the fucking youtube videos.
Um,

1412
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:34,100
this is a great quick youtube video
that will give you a laugh, uh,

1413
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,280
is called a girl gets answer very wrong.

1414
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,110
Please watch this girl gets answer very
wrong. That's what you search on Youtube.

1415
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,260
Um, this next one, somebody
sent me this and I,

1416
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,830
I can't believe I forgot about this one
cause I stumbled upon this one before.

1417
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:51,800
These ones are fucking hilarious.
Um,

1418
01:27:51,801 --> 01:27:56,801
there's one called Eddie van Halen
shreds and there's another one Santana

1419
01:27:56,901 --> 01:28:01,220
shreds. And basically what it is is,
you know, there's a bunch of, you know,

1420
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:02,570
musicians go on,
you know,

1421
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:06,950
up and coming guitarists and they watch
all these great guitar gods and they

1422
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:10,460
watch their clips and then they
rate them. You know, that socks,

1423
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:12,830
I give that five out of
10 stars or whatever.

1424
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:15,560
But there's certain guys like Eddie
van Halen, he's just the shit.

1425
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,940
You just can't fuck with them. So
what this guy does, he actually plays,

1426
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,520
he plays guitar,
he gets rid of the audio,

1427
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:25,340
he keeps the clip of Eddie
van Halen in concert.

1428
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:29,570
And then he plays the worst
fucking guitar ever underneath it.

1429
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:34,870
But he does it perfectly where if
Eddie's fingers are moving up the neck,

1430
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,350
the guy moves up the neck
playing horrifically.

1431
01:28:39,351 --> 01:28:43,100
So it really sounds like Eddie
is playing the guitar horribly,

1432
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,050
but he puts it under Eddie van Halen
shred. So all these guys, you know,

1433
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,130
they want to see at a shred and then they
just get this horrific video that not

1434
01:28:52,131 --> 01:28:54,770
only is not Eddie shredding,
but it makes him look like an asshole.

1435
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:58,430
And then people get all mad. Dude,
you should do is kill yourself,

1436
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,820
would fucking loser. He's a god. Why
you do that? You know, it's usual shit.

1437
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,280
You know, he's somebody. That's
funny. Um, here's another one.

1438
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:10,310
Another one funny used car
ad ad is spelled a d not a d.

1439
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:15,960
D. Um, now there's another good
one. Harrison Ford, my wife,

1440
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:18,150
my family compilation.

1441
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:20,370
MMM.

1442
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:23,640
Then here's another one. This is an
Arnold Schwarzenegger one. That's great.

1443
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:28,080
It's called [inaudible].
Arnold is funny. Um,

1444
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:31,140
and here's the last one.
I saved the best one for last.

1445
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:34,800
This guy has some sort of speech
impediment. He gets blocked.

1446
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:41,310
I can't, I don't know. I've never even
heard of it. It's called Tono Tonow, t.

1447
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:45,120
O N. O. T. O. N. O. And A.

1448
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:47,430
I'm actually gonna call in
the EOP and Anthony Show,

1449
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:51,360
or if you're an opiate Anthony Fan, can
you please tell them to watch this video?

1450
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:56,250
Because this is just right
up there fucking alley. Um,

1451
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,380
this is one of those
videos that I wish I could,

1452
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,620
I could see Jim Norton Watch
for the first fucking time.

1453
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,690
Just just to hear what the
fuck he would say. All right.

1454
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:10,730
Tonio Tonio t o n o t o n o

1455
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:14,450
yeah and if you are overseas, cause I
got a cup of people, England or whatever.

1456
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:16,820
Sweden shit who listen to this thing.

1457
01:30:16,821 --> 01:30:19,700
Check out the opening
Anthony show on a online,

1458
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,370
I think it's [inaudible] dot
com I don't eat well. You know,

1459
01:30:22,371 --> 01:30:24,680
wouldn't it be great if I had the
fucking thing? Just, just look for them.

1460
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,290
They're fucking hilarious. And they got
clips. They have clips up on Youtube.

1461
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,580
Opie and Anthony Show. They are hilarious.
Look for, look for the baby bird.

1462
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:35,600
That's a nice simple one to get you in
on, into the show. All right, questions.

1463
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:37,790
These are the questions that I'm
going to wrap this up. Question. Bill,

1464
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:40,460
where was your first Gig?
My first stand up.

1465
01:30:40,461 --> 01:30:44,240
These are all gonna be stand up questions
where it was my first standup Gig.

1466
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:48,590
I played Nick's comedy. Stop in Boston,
Massachusetts on Warrington Street.

1467
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,200
I was in a competition called a fine
Boston's funniest college student

1468
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:59,330
and a every night, each college had
a different night and I went on,

1469
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:03,470
I went up on my night and I did okay.
I didn't do great,

1470
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:08,090
but I did okay. And uh, and that's
it. That's basically the story.

1471
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,370
Um, cause I know I've told
it a million fucking times,

1472
01:31:10,371 --> 01:31:11,590
but I was at Nick's comedy stop.

1473
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:14,370
MMM.

1474
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:19,290
Hang on, I just got a note. All right. Ah,

1475
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:23,270
Jesus Christ. All right, let's move
on here. This is, I'm sorry guys.

1476
01:31:23,271 --> 01:31:24,470
I'm really killing the momentum here.
Bill,

1477
01:31:24,471 --> 01:31:27,380
did you have to play coffee shops
and bars before you could get up,

1478
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:30,970
get to the comedy clubs?
Uh, yes, yes I did.

1479
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,660
It's always been a grind
to become a comedian.

1480
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:35,570
I know you comedians nowadays you have
it way worse where we didn't have bringer

1481
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:38,780
shows. Some of these dudes, what they
have to do here in La, in New York,

1482
01:31:38,781 --> 01:31:41,360
God bless him man,
cause it was not that fucking difficult.

1483
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:46,160
It just keeps getting harder. But uh,
the cream will rise to the top. Um,

1484
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:49,670
did I have to play coffee shops?
Yes. Coffee, coffee shops, bars.

1485
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:55,640
Um, I know I've told that story where I
played the second story Clia laid out,

1486
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:56,270
Cleo,

1487
01:31:56,270 --> 01:32:00,340
lay down, lay down. Um,

1488
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,200
I know I played that.
Uh,

1489
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:05,730
I told that story where I
actually did a Gig at a,

1490
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:11,040
a two story bar where I was performing
on the second floor of this bar that had

1491
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:18,700
screens for windows and right across the
street was a carnival and you know that

1492
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:21,820
ride with that Viking ship
just rocks back and forth.

1493
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:26,420
It literally looked like a
cock going into, you know,

1494
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:29,830
like didn't they do that horrific porno
shot where they do the underneath shot

1495
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,050
of doggy style?
That's what it looked like.

1496
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:37,051
And it was coming right to the window and
I was bombing so hard that all I could

1497
01:32:38,591 --> 01:32:43,090
hear was the people screaming on
that ride. All right, there you go.

1498
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,180
There's one for you. And you know what
was great was the guy who hosted the show,

1499
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,850
he actually had a lazy eye and you know,

1500
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:53,530
he was really self conscious about it
and he went on stage first and he was

1501
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:57,910
bombing and these two people are sitting
in the front row and they just didn't

1502
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:02,140
give a fuck. This guy just goes, dude.
And he pointed right at his face. He goes,

1503
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,270
the fuck is wrong with your eye.
And it literally just,

1504
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:11,800
it was really painful to watch. I mean,
that guy's lazy. I was part of the,

1505
01:33:11,801 --> 01:33:16,801
probably part of the low self esteem
that made him become a comedian.

1506
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,290
Okay. And then he's like, I'm
going to become a comedian.

1507
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,260
I'm going to get on stage.

1508
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:24,400
People are going to like me
and everything's going in
this guy just fucking Bam.

1509
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:28,090
And a, and the dude had nothing.
He was just like, I can't,

1510
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,310
I can't believe you just said that.
I think it was bad.

1511
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:33,640
And then I went on after that
and I somehow had even a,

1512
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:37,570
I had worst moments than that. Jesus
heals a lot of bad stories this week.

1513
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,270
All right. Uh, Bill, when
did you first opened?

1514
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:44,080
When did I first move up
to the opening spot? Um,

1515
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:47,800
while I was getting through college.
So my first year was kind of a wash 92.

1516
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:51,430
I started in March of [inaudible] 92
and Ireland probably only got on stage a

1517
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:54,400
half dozen times,
maybe eight times 12 at the most.

1518
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:59,710
And it probably was by mid,

1519
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,860
mid 93.

1520
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:07,890
WBCN used to have this to sing
called the comedy riot and I want it,

1521
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:13,060
you know, it was for the up and
coming guy. And after I won that, um,

1522
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:17,080
I remember that was the first time I got
a real spot on a Tuesday night show on

1523
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:20,560
Jim will let us show. I got a spot. Um,

1524
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:25,240
and I remember I was all fucking nervous.
Like, cause it wasn't an open mic show.

1525
01:34:25,241 --> 01:34:28,990
I was like, Oh fuck, you know, when
I'm gonna open up on an open mic show,

1526
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,380
they know him and open miker but now
they're expecting a professional.

1527
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:37,060
I was fucking unbelievably
nervous. And, uh, that was a huge,

1528
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:41,980
huge fucking night for me
when I, you know, just doing
a spot on a Tuesday. It's,

1529
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:45,820
it's like that incremental shit. That's
why I flipped out when I was saying,

1530
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:48,760
you know, when they say, oh the fans
made Ringo Starr's you have no idea.

1531
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:54,240
Like incrementally the baby steps that
you take to get to a higher fucking level

1532
01:34:55,451 --> 01:35:00,451
and how huge little things that like the
first time I got $5 gas money you have

1533
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:04,670
to doing it for a year and a
half. I actually got, you know,

1534
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:08,750
a piece of paper that used to represent
gold that really has no fucking value,

1535
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:10,490
but I didn't know that then.
So I was like,

1536
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:15,440
I can actually go out with this $5
and get the number three at subway.

1537
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:19,250
This is fucking awesome. And, you know,

1538
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,100
I love doing stand up so
much that I, I, you know,

1539
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:27,130
I would drive to Maine from Boston for
free just to get stage time and we'd be

1540
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:28,700
driving all the way back,

1541
01:35:28,701 --> 01:35:31,970
almost falling asleep at the wheel to go
to work at eight o'clock in the fucking

1542
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:33,320
morning to go unload trucks.

1543
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,700
And a was just loving life and a, it's one
of the greatest things about, you know,

1544
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:42,710
doing this job as I fucking love
it. So anyways, um, next one, uh,

1545
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:45,800
is the worth of your career starting.

1546
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:49,610
Can you guys hear that fucking
weed wacker? I apologize. Um,

1547
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:54,380
is the worth of your career starting
to weigh out the 20 years struggle of

1548
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:58,940
making it to the top? Uh,
well dude, I haven't made it
to the top, but yeah, dude,

1549
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,860
um, it was worth it. Uh,
the day I got five bucks,

1550
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:07,940
the day I started doing it, it was with
the first fucking day when I drove home.

1551
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:09,310
Excited that I actually got to,

1552
01:36:09,311 --> 01:36:14,311
had the balls to get onstage and I drove
home and I was listening to doctor,

1553
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,090
not doctor fee.
I was listening to kickstart my heart,

1554
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,940
what a child of the 80s,

1555
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:25,420
screaming the song fucking ridiculously
pumped up in my little piece of shit

1556
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:28,490
truck driving home.
I couldn't believe it.

1557
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:31,310
I've failed at everything else and
I always thought I was, you know,

1558
01:36:31,311 --> 01:36:33,710
I always said I was going to do this
and I was going to do that and I never

1559
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:36,770
followed through and I finally followed
through with something and actually went

1560
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:38,750
great.
And uh,

1561
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:44,330
from the second I went up on
stage and did it, you know,

1562
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:48,320
it was worth it and it actually helped me,
you know,

1563
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,250
in other areas like, um, like
last night, you know I was,

1564
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,280
I went down to go do stand up and these
guys were playing afterwards you're like,

1565
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:56,990
Oh I heard you play drums,
you want to sit in.

1566
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,140
And I got all fucking
nervous cause you know,

1567
01:37:00,141 --> 01:37:04,730
I don't do that for a living.
And then I just, I do,

1568
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:07,760
what I always do is I just think,
okay, what's going to feel worse?

1569
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,610
I'm going up there and bombing and
sucking and making an ass out of yourself,

1570
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:17,030
or going home, laying in bed,
not being able to go to sleep,

1571
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:20,900
knowing that you are a pussy in that
moment when you could have gone up there.

1572
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:25,370
So I said, fuck it. And I went up there
and it fucking went great. You know?

1573
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:27,020
And plus when you get up
there, there's like, you know,

1574
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:28,880
there's always other people
who are really good. In fact,

1575
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:32,690
everybody else was really good,
so you can kind of hide behind that fact,

1576
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:36,170
which is another thing that makes
stand up so scary is because everyone's

1577
01:37:36,171 --> 01:37:37,580
looking at you the entire time.

1578
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,560
You can't blame it on
the stool. Um, all right,

1579
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:46,400
here's the last question and then I'm
going to start packing to go to Sweden and

1580
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:47,570
I'll tell you guys all about it.
