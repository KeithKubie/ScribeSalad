00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.390
Sometimes you want to give
a lot of drugs to a person.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.680
And the most sensitive
tissue is the bone marrow.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
So if you remove the bone
marrow before the treatment,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.888
you protect it
from the treatment,

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:13.680
then you can give it
back again afterwards,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.660
you can give a more
severe treatment,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.800
and that helps the cure.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.460
But the
bone marrow they have in it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.680
cancer cells.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.350
So if you give it
back again, you

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.290
re-infecting the person
with their own cancer.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.590
So what we want to do is
remove those cancer cells

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.340
from the bone marrow
before we put it back.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.050
So let's have a look at
a demonstration of how

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
we do that using our
monoclonal antibodies.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.320
Let's have another volunteer.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.150
And you in the blue there,
well, yes, come down.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.530
Why don't you come?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.352
Thank you.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:45.060
What's your name?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.810
Naomi.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.330
Naomi.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.800
All right, Naomi is going to
do this experiment for us.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.780
It's a very simple one.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.580
So what we've got here is
in here are cancer cells.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.585
The red ones are
the cancer cells.

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.210
And the white ones
are the normal cells

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.860
in the bone marrow.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.850
And the cancer cells
have had a little magnet

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.230
stuck on them using a
monoclonal antibody that

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.450
goes only to the cancer cells.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.995
And you're going
to use this magnet

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:09.370
to get rid of
those cancer cells.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.347
So just have a go.

00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.180
Put the magnet on there
and see if you can

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.170
get out the cancer cells.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.760
Keep going until you've
got rid of them all.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.140
Take them all the way out.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.940
OK, let's see it.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.840
Take them out.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.110
Get the other one.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.750
I'll hang onto those.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.880
See if you can get them all out.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.960
There we are.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.020
There we are.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.980
There's still one left there.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.220
Got rid of it all?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.600
See how we can use the magnet
to get rid of all those cancer

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.620
cells?

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.670
Thanks very much, Naomi.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.230
Now, how can we do that?

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.860
How can we do that
with our cells?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700
Well, we can use little
magnetic beads that are actually

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.143
smaller than a cell.

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:58.560
Just to show you
they're magnetic,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.480
I've got a magnet here.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.990
And when I put this
magnet here, you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.940
see the beads going to where the
magnet is clearing from there?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.580
See that?

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.080
They've all gone
down the side there.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.650
Now supposing we can put
a monoclonal antibody

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.960
onto those beads that just
attacks our cancer cell.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.860
And we've got the magnetic
beads on the cancer cell.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.280
And we should remove the
cancer cell with our magnet.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.470
Well, there you see it
up on the screen there.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.230
You see the blue things,
they're the cancer cells.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.300
And the little brown things are
the magnetic beads around them.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.300
So now they're just stuck to the
cancer cells with the antibody,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.480
we can remove them.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.760
So we've got a
demonstration of that here.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.340
Here's the bag with
the sample before we've

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.780
remove the cancer cells.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.660
And we're pumping it through,
pumping it through here.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.040
Is it going around
the right way?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.820
Pumping the blood through,
it's coming through down here.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.400
And it's going
over these magnets

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.120
here, two lots of
magnets to be sure.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.200
And as it goes over, it
pulls out the cancer cells

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.880
with the magnetic
beads around them.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.280
So we'll collect--
you can just see

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.870
it starting to come up there.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.070
We'll collect into this bag,
we'll collect the cleaned up,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.820
the purged bone marrow that no
longer has the cancer cells,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.920
which we can give
back to the patient

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.400
after they've been treated.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.760
So that's one way that we
can use the magnetic beads

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.720
and monoclonal antibodies
to remove cancer

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.200
cells from the bone marrow.
