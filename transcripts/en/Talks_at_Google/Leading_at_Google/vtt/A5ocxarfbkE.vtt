[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.870
SPEAKER 1: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.674
Thanks for this
intimate gathering.

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:12.090
So for those of you who don't
know me, I'm Kendra Donahue,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
and I am a sales
manager in LCS, looking

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.310
after Africa and Israel.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.810
I also work very closely with
the Africa Googler Network,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.580
so absolutely delighted to have
Andrew Fairbairn joining us

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.350
today.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.180
So he's the founder of Sponsors
for Educational Opportunity,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.260
which is a charity
that helps students,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.830
top talented students,
from ethnic backgrounds

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.070
and underprivileged backgrounds
get into great careers

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.420
both in business, and
technology, et cetera,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.890
so places like Google ideally.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.980
And he's been with
them for 17 years,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.270
having gone through the program
himself and worked with a SEO

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.350
in the US.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.737
So he's now based
in the UK, and we're

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:53.820
delighted to have him here
talking to us about how

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.690
we can make inclusion real.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.690
So over to you, Andrew.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.127
Thank you for coming.

00:00:58.127 --> 00:00:59.564
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: So
thank you for having me.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.900
I like to talk.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.980
I talk a lot.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.230
I put this together sort of
specifically for you guys.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.850
It's a bit of a cobbling
together of a variety

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.683
of different themes.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:16.440
So I may not be as practiced
with this particular slide deck

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.740
as I might be.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.280
But my name is, again,
Andrew Fairbairn.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.710
I'm blessed really
to be the founder

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.230
of this organization in London.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.182
I went through an earlier
iteration of it in 1995.

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:34.015
I got my first exposure
to the high end sort

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:37.260
of professional services
world, with an internship

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.470
through SEO at Lehman
Brothers way back then.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.970
It opened my eyes to what was
possible for me personally,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
and it essentially changed
my life in that sense.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.430
I wasn't coming down some
terrible path where I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.760
was on my way to rack and ruin.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.310
But it was one of those things
where nobody in my family

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
had ever been a banker, or
a consultant, or a lawyer,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.460
or any of those sorts
of hot shot professions,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.850
never mind software programmer,
but this remember is 1995,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.880
so it was a different
era in software too.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.210
I am-- you know,
I came to London

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.730
a few years after that
experience and started it here.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.230
So I'll get into
some of the history

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.826
of the program along the way.

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:22.950
The number one thing, I'm
really pleased to be here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.660
and really glad to have interest
in what we're talking about.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.320
So here we go.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.440
I don't have a clicker.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.120
AUDIENCE: Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.680
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN:
You'll be my man.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.221
All right, beautiful,
thank you, sir.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.130
So SEO London is,
as you say, it's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.890
an organization dedicated to
trying to find opportunities

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.275
for people who have all
the potential and all

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.350
of the ability, but don't by
virtue of their circumstance

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.150
necessarily have all the access.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.620
It's kind of that simple.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.140
And so, you know, there are
a variety of different areas

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.700
where we focus on,
but predominantly

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700
we're looking for people
who are historically

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.780
under-represented
in a given industry.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.540
We're looking for people who
are coming up the hard way.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.870
And that can be
really any ethnicity

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.320
at the end of the day.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.850
If someone's really
needs a leg up,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.380
we want to be there for them.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.540
And the way we sort have
grown over the years,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.960
we have programs for secondary
schoolers, years 11 to 13.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.670
So if you're a
15-year-old, and you know,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.430
you're not sure up from down,
which most 15-year-olds don't,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.070
certainly I didn't,
you need some guidance.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.410
And so we provide a
multi-industry work experience,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.810
where you imagine a
15-year-old going and doing

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.740
a work experience at an ad
agency, and then an investment

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.240
bank, and then a corporate law
firm, and then an engineering

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.480
firm, and perhaps
even Google, they then

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.130
come out of that
experience by the time

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.952
you're 13 knowing a lot
about a lot of stuff

00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:48.660
and knowing why they
might want to follow

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.821
a particular path or not.

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.320
And we layer that with all sorts
of mentoring, and training,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.190
and life skills, and so on to
ensure that the students are

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.090
actually rock stars, super
ninjas we call them by the time

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.399
they get to university.

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.690
We don't force them down a
university path to be clear.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.700
They can go on apprenticeships,
underwater basket weaving.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.200
Whatever we want
to do, that's cool.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.304
We just want to make sure
that they have awareness

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:12.720
of all the different things
they could be doing if they so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.390
chose to follow the path.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.385
The careers program is all
about university students.

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:20.310
It's simple enough to define,
but we look for talent

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.399
everywhere.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.940
So we are currently, I think
we have over 5,000 applications

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.240
in the queue right now.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.180
And we've been on
campus for just a month.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.580
For us, that's sort of a
record actually for the scale

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.431
of the operation we work with.

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.930
We've got 750 students going
through that program every year

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.710
across multiple
industries, and we'll

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.710
put up the obligatory
logo slide later so you'll

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.550
see what that's about.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.344
But you know, there again,
it's about exposure.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:46.260
It's about experience.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.570
It's about life skills on
top of the technical skills

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.140
to grow and thrive.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.840
We work with Google
in this space

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.900
right now as people are at the
end of their university career

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.400
crossing over into
sort of graduate,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.750
and so we work with the
sales marketing team there.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.030
It's been a great
little relationship.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.090
SEO Connect is our museum store
within the museum in so far

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.410
as that's actually a
for-profit entity that we--

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.680
it's a tiny piece of our overall
operation, to be to be clear.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.719
But it is where we try and-- we
have a jobs board for instance,

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.510
where we have people
coming on board there,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.020
and it looks, and smells, and
feels like any old jobs board

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.450
that you might imagine.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.940
But we also, through
that program,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.540
run a lot of different events.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.080
So I was just
mentioning earlier we're

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.155
going to be running an event on
venture capital, for instance.

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:33.030
There's a difference--
a lot of the folks who

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.946
come through our programs,
and over the years,

00:05:34.946 --> 00:05:38.160
we have thousands upon thousands
of alumni, a lot of them

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.250
are sort of highly trained,
highly professional, highly

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.099
motivated type A
personalities who

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.640
are interested in
doing other things.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.620
And access to VC knowledge would
be something really interesting

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.120
for them.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.650
So we run that through the
Connect end of our work.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.066
If you could click the
button once, all of that

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.940
wouldn't really
differentiate us in many ways

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.315
from a lot of
other organizations

00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:02.690
in the world except that
this particular line is

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.340
a real-- it's an SEO mantra.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.340
It's not about you.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.070
It's about the people
who come after you.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.440
That suffuses everything we do.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.360
So no decision gets made without
that being sort of part of it.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.970
You know, I got into SEO
in '95, because of people

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.150
who came before me, sort
of broke ground and made

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.260
possible my presence in that
rarefied world of Wall Street.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.070
When people come
through our doors today,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.250
they're essentially
creating relationship space,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.610
relationship capital,
where if they're

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.360
able to prove their abilities
in a difficult, competitive work

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.140
environment in an elite setting,
that opens the doors for others

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.830
to come behind them.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.760
And an example, it
wouldn't have been

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.767
so long ago that imagine you're
in a Wall Street setting.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.350
You're on a trading
floor, and there's

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.660
a billion dollar
pound euro block

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.830
trade that's going through.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.940
The thing has to be sold.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.640
It's got to be sold
fast, and it has--

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.660
who on that desk is going to
get the bulk of that order.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.840
That's the problem to solve
for the manager of the desk.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.291
They look around and
they say, who do I trust?

00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.040
Who I do I know is
going to get this done.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.630
And boom, if that person was
black, or Muslim, or Asian not

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.760
too long ago, the
odds that they were

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.370
going to get that opportunity
to execute that black trade

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.630
would have been
smaller than otherwise.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.620
The world is changing.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.990
The world has changed.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.520
We can be very grateful for
all that's occurring around us,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.540
but we want to be able to ensure
that we have excellent people

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.370
in place well-trained--

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.500
trained to not just survive in
these environments, but thrive.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.510
And if we've done our job well,
the next time that block trade

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.910
or that big project
whatever comes up,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.150
it's going to be fair play
to everyone in the room,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.470
because everyone is shown to
have proven their worth, proven

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.070
their ability, and if
we've done our job well,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.540
we'll have been a part of that
success and that training.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.260
You want jump in here?

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.270
We have a virtuous cycle.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.330
We go out and take
sponsorship donations

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.732
from large corporates
like a Google.

00:08:13.732 --> 00:08:15.440
And we go into the
world and we go to all

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.700
the different universities.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.260
We bring together
an applicant pool.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.950
We screen them.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.430
We scrub them.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.055
They sort them.

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:20.870
We sift system.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.970
We decide who do we think
in this group can most

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.370
benefit from our help,
but also, if we help them,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.110
will go really, really far?

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.699
And those are sort
of the two drivers.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:33.860
And who do we think
if we assist will

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.630
be able to then draw a
community behind them to sort

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.980
of really embed through their
hard work, dedication, success,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:48.800
and applied talent you know,
a change for all concerned,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.450
the firms that are
sponsoring them,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.450
the people coming
in behind them.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.030
So we find folks.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.940
We try and create
lasting outcomes.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.340
And again, it's not about you.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.310
It's about the people
coming after you.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.880
We want people to
be giving back.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.505
I have no interest,
frankly, in working

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:06.796
with someone who thinks that
they're going to make it--

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:07.740
it's all about them.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.380
It's all about
their own success,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.270
and they're master
of their own domain.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.410
Useless.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.900
That is not someone who's
going to help our organization

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.964
and our social mission.

00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:17.630
If I was a recruiting
agency, and I just

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.060
wanted to get bums in seats
and take a commission,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.600
maybe I would do that.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.660
But I have no time
for that in my world.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.134
That permits the potential
of a virtuous cycle to occur.

00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:31.925
We just had a milestone
last year actually,

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:34.740
a really, really
cool milestone, where

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.300
a woman from our very
first class in 2000

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.870
made partner of Goldman
Sachs, and I mean,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.150
that's the top-- she's
at the top of her game.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.940
And she's on our board now,
and she she's giving back,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.280
and she's sort of-- she's
leading the way for others.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.140
I got a call from
a guy, who said,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.230
hey, do you know
Nishi over at Goldman,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.730
I used to work with
her, and she had

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.711
a great relationship with SEO.

00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:59.210
I'd like to bring
an SEO in my firm.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.280
Can we talk?

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:09.760
And if I can advance a
couple more points, one more.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.780
"I heard about you from."

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.470
It happens all the time.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.650
Most of those 5,000
applications we had

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.980
came in before we got to
campus, word of mouth,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.260
brothers, sisters, cousins,
nephews, relations.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.440
We heard-- I interviewed
this fantastic candidate

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.460
the other day, who heard about
us from someone in Canada,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.654
who heard about us from
someone in Nigeria, who

00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:36.820
heard about us from someone.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.900
It was sort of this global
network was all over the place.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.520
We love that.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.610
That is lifeblood, because that
means that we're actually--

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.990
the thesis that relationships
matter and getting in one

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.635
person--

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:52.930
we'll call it a spear
point of diversity,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:58.730
if you like, permits, you know,
the thin end of the wedge.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.420
It permits the fat end
of the wedge to actually

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.370
be embedded in an organization.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.070
Likewise, it facilitates the
sort of alumni-driven network,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.369
whether it's that alumni at
Goldman Sachs or other people

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.660
came right after her, you
know, if you go for instance,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.010
to a Citibank right now, from
managing director level all

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.810
the way to entry
level analysts, we've

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.890
got dozens of people
who all understand this,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.599
all understand when you're a
new person entering that sphere

00:11:26.599 --> 00:11:28.140
that you have a
network to join into.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.110
And that's really cool.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.660
And that's really-- that
allows more pervasive culture

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.600
of diversity.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.800
And I'll get to that
as we go further.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.150
So this is the history lesson.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:45.190
I enter the fray somewhere
about here just before 2000.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.430
Way back in 1963,
this saint of a guy,

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.130
Mike Auschwitz set up
a program, you know,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.080
the spirit of the '60s.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.690
Kennedy I think was
still president,

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.250
to help kids from tough
high school backgrounds

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.350
get into universities,
focus on New York City.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.070
Over the years, it was a very
successful program, but sort

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.775
of looking at the results a
number of years later in 1980,

00:12:11.775 --> 00:12:13.150
it was determined
that these kids

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.358
were getting into university.

00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:15.940
They were getting
great training.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.460
But they weren't
getting the jobs.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.670
They were getting jobs.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.440
But we all know
there is a difference

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.090
between the jobs and just jobs.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.344
And so a careers
program was founded,

00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.760
and that's what I
participated in.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.490
That was my ticket when
came out of university

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.794
and ended up at Lehman Brothers,
and that opened my eyes.

00:12:36.794 --> 00:12:39.460
The scales fell, and I could see
the world in a whole new light,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.626
and it was like, oh, my
gosh, if I do this and that,

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:43.270
I could accomplish a few things.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.187
I ended up working at
UBS, then Deutsche Bank

00:12:45.187 --> 00:12:47.270
in a variety of different
functions, transactional

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.800
and strategy jobs.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.200
And I was here--

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.982
here, I was in London, sorry--

00:12:52.982 --> 00:12:54.190
this morning I was in London.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.880
Looking out on the trading
floor of the equity sales team

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.460
could have used some
diversity shall we say.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.610
The corporate finance
equity research departments

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.390
could have used some diversity.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.090
So I approached the head
of training and development

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.560
said, hey, can we do
this, this SEO thing?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.920
I mean, it's pretty good.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.840
I was smiled at, but
ultimately supported.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.120
I had one awkward
conversation with a fellow

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.230
who ran a recruiting for
a major investment bank.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.570
He sort of essentially
metaphorically

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.153
patted me on the
head and said, that's

00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:30.020
a really nice American concept
that you're bringing to the UK.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.680
You know, we don't have a
race problem in this country.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.910
We have a class
problem, which anyway--

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.420
anyway, so we took off
on the back of a pilot,

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.620
on my credit card.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.980
We were able to get a
successful pilot program going,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.100
and then dotbomb occurred.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.290
I was doing sort
of, at that point,

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.100
sort of fintech 1.0
venture investing

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.100
on the bank's balance sheet
as Pets.com was crashing.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.000
It was a messy time.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.850
I ended up going
back to New York,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.400
and much of the rest of
my involvement over time

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.030
has been on the board.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.160
I've only recently come back
in the last year to assist.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.040
But while I was doing my
two or three other careers,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.660
alumni from The New York
program launched in China--

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.036
Hong Kong and Shanghai,
then in Saigon, Ho Chi Minh,

00:14:22.036 --> 00:14:24.310
we have a SEO Vietnam.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.660
We launched a scholars program.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.730
Just as in New
York, they started

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.174
with secondary schoolers and
went to sort of university,

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:33.590
we started with the university,
and we were doing so well.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.217
We were seeing such great growth
and such a robust response

00:14:36.217 --> 00:14:38.550
from the community that we
started our scholars program.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.090
We were backwards.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.970
And we've since then launched
our Connect Program, which

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.220
I described earlier, and
we have a program in Accra,

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.510
in Ghana, which is actively
looking at Lagos in Nigeria

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.000
as a potential expansion point.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.660
It goes on.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.180
I've been involved in
discussions about SEO Bogota.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.690
I've been involved in
SEO Rio and Sao Paolo.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.150
And one of our staffers
is from Afghanistan.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.410
He was going back to Kabul.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.620
I was only half
joking when I said,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.369
we should be talking
about SEO Kabul, man,

00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:08.520
because it's a universal
concept that there

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.230
are those who have access and
those that do not have access.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.280
And it is, to my mind,
is a clear statement

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.890
to say that there is money
being left on the table

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.400
with everyone's not involved.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.870
And so my sense is that we have
an opportunity to do more here.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.870
Can we flip?

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.470
Back here, it's
important to note,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:33.100
like, you couldn't find
a diversity officer

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.620
in the city of London in 2000.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.590
Maybe someone cared about
it, a few management

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.990
consultants floating
around talking about it.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.677
There's maybe one organization
that I could identify back

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:47.260
then called the Windsor Fellows
that was doing some work on it

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.094
in a serious capacity.

00:15:50.094 --> 00:15:51.010
Now, it's an industry.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.530
There are dozens
of organizations

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.470
that attempt to
promote diversity

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.740
in some way, shape, or form.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.740
And in many ways, you
could call it a golden age

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.780
for diversity and inclusion.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.940
The phones are ringing
off-- every week,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.160
I get one or two calls from
some organization looking

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.900
to learn more about what
we do because they're

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.970
trying to embed more
diversity and inclusiveness

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.780
in their culture.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.390
That's fantastic.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.611
That's absolutely fantastic.

00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.110
I'm here.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.360
You guys are talking about it.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.832
We're in a really
interesting place.

00:16:19.832 --> 00:16:21.790
I just sort of sit back
and do a little victory

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.290
dance every time I hear about
some new program that's coming

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.020
up, because we're a charity.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.390
No one is getting
rich off of this.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.100
What we care about
is the social change,

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.314
the long term impact of this.

00:16:31.314 --> 00:16:32.980
And we see that
happening all around us.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.552
The city of London today, and
we should talk about Dublin,

00:16:35.552 --> 00:16:37.510
because I don't know much
about what's going on

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.512
in Dublin in diversity.

00:16:38.512 --> 00:16:40.720
The city of London is
radically different, completely

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.459
different than
what it was before.

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.500
There's still lots of
people trying to clambering

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.680
and getting into jobs.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.150
Lots of ground
still yet to cover.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.620
But let me tell you, 2000,
this wasn't even a thing.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.330
So shall we?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.190
So the obligatory logo slide.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.880
And here you guys are.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.740
And you should know in banking
and corporate finance Wall

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.619
Street terms, up
and to the left is

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:12.670
the premier spot where you could
possibly be on any slide deck.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.630
So if I'm presenting to
a corporate law firm,

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.839
there may be some adjustment
of slides and logos.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.069
But you are in the
prime spot today, guys.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.867
So we started with banking.

00:17:26.867 --> 00:17:29.200
We've seen a surge of interest
in asset management firms

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.600
in the last year.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.044
I mean, like it's night and day.

00:17:32.044 --> 00:17:34.210
It's really remarkable to
see what's been occurring.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.790
Law firms have been focused
on this for a number of years.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.370
And we have sort of
a hodgepodge of firms

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.890
that come in and out
of our consulting

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.470
corporate and technology world.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.330
These programs
are deeply mature.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.500
They are deeply at scale.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.830
We've been doing it
for a very long time.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.170
Corporate technology firms
tend to be very different one

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:56.712
to the other.

00:17:56.712 --> 00:17:58.544
And so you have different
sort of strategies

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.600
for dealing with them.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.058
The engineering program is a
fantastic program at the Royal

00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:06.010
Academy, where we're training
up young people from typically

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.470
less-sought-after universities.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.470
In the UK, you describe them
as the post '92 universities,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:15.550
polytechnics that became
universities not so long ago.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.410
And that's just driving
some great results as well.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.830
So anyway, lots of flashy logos.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.090
You're in the top left.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.250
That's the take away.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.390
All right, so we can
shift gears a little bit.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:33.500
So diversity as a whole,
it's a lot of things.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.950
We tend to focus on these three.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.220
I sort of refer to
ethnicity, ethnic diversity,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.490
gender diversity, and
social mobility diversity

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.690
as the big three.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.170
Disability, LGBT, we
are deep supporters

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.670
and in love with
anyone who is going

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.480
to sort of work on that front.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.860
We have all the
empathy in the world.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.590
We just don't have scale.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.390
And I think at Google
you know about scale.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.019
To be effective, we
want to be able to help

00:19:01.019 --> 00:19:03.560
as many people as possible, and
we need the systems to do it.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.720
We have the systems here.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.601
So that being said, I was
going to throw the question

00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:10.100
to you guys.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.820
I mean, I don't
know what, you know,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:19.520
not so long ago, I
became 39 forever.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.524
You know, there's a--

00:19:21.524 --> 00:19:22.940
I had an interest
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.590
We were at a consulting
firm, and we're

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.640
having sort of a
lunch and learn.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.098
We sat in this kind
of a discussion

00:19:27.098 --> 00:19:32.120
about what is difference
in that context?

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.070
And this woman raised her hand.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.700
She said, you know, I don't
fit into the classic diversity

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.730
categories that you
were searching for.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.660
But I feel really left
out in a lot of instances,

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.400
because I'm not--

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.320
I didn't come in with
that original class.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.180
Certain firms, you
come in, you're marked.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.400
You started as a
graduate, as a first year,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.233
and you work your way
up through the system.

00:19:54.233 --> 00:19:57.350
You have a certain set of common
attributes and experiences

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.640
that come from that.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.080
If you come as an
experienced hire,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.710
you're coming in as you
don't have that network.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.470
You don't have-- you
don't have that stamp.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.490
And so lateral hires then.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.390
That's an interest-- I mean,
it's something to consider.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.320
We're talking about
difference here.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.190
Refugees.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.930
We're meeting with
a group that focuses

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.170
on this issue in particular,
they have a different approach.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.976
They need to have a
different approach.

00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:24.350
And I don't feel
anybody can help

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.910
the people who like Marmite.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.930
But that's another
thing entirely.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.090
So can I ask, what is-- is
there a diversity officer

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.000
in the room or someone who's
deeply embedded in that world

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.550
here?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.050
OK.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.627
Do these categories
resonate here?

00:20:45.627 --> 00:20:46.210
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.450
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: Yeah.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.040
Does this one
resonate particularly?

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.160
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN:
So great moment,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.310
the value of diversity at work.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.730
I was going to bring a
PowerPoint presentation

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.846
before I was laughed at.

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:02.602
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:04.560
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: And
now I have to know-- now,

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.210
I clearly have to learn how
to port all of my PowerPoint,

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.820
which I've built my whole life
and career into Google Sheets

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.130
or slides.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:13.630
There it is.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.919
Anyway, so you should
discriminate against me,

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:17.960
or train me, or teach me.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.330
It would be better yet, right?

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.700
Can I see one more
slide up here?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.409
So that's sort of the
meta-picture, if you like.

00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:28.700
But you know, it's interesting.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.520
We have conversations
about diversity

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.490
in all sorts of different
places, and it shifts it moves.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.980
You know, I had Switzerland.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.780
What does diversity
mean in Switzerland?

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.150
Does anyone have any idea what
diversity means in Switzerland?

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.335
What would you
expect it to mean?

00:21:47.335 --> 00:21:48.550
AUDIENCE: To be
a Swiss national.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.410
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: To
be a Swiss national.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.090
I mean, isn't that--

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.870
I wouldn't have-- that would
not have been my first answer

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.520
upon going after it.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.770
In Brazil, whole
other set of dynamics.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.680
There's north, there's
south, there is urban, rural,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.830
there's any manner
of things going on.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:11.909
In China, SEO staff leading
that effort, who are all

00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:13.450
doing this on a
volunteer basis, were

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.490
challenged by Chinese
students saying,

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.900
is this some sort of CIA thing?

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.320
Because this is free, and
you're giving us this access.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.020
You're American.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.880
What's going on here?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.630
It's really a program for
sort of aspiring young Chinese

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.790
students who don't
have the access

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.160
to get into these top jobs.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.690
It's a 95% Han
Chinese community.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:41.069
It's not like ethnicity
was the driver.

00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:42.610
And yet you have
this whole other set

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.068
of issues where
people are worrying

00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:48.100
about political
intrigue instead of just

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.370
getting the opportunity.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:53.680
It's OK.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.996
We can go ahead.

00:22:55.996 --> 00:22:58.120
Actually, why don't we--
why don't we push one more

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.650
one more button and
see what happens.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.910
One more time.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.730
So you know, one of
the interesting things

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.740
about the conversations
on diversity

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:12.750
is that when we started,
most of our focus

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.060
was on ethnic diversity.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.984
Over time, that fellow who was
sort of patting me on the head

00:23:17.984 --> 00:23:20.400
and said, you know, we have a
class issue in this country.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.430
You know, a report came
out not so long ago

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.060
in the UK, Social
Mobility Commission, one

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.640
or two grantees
attached to it I'm sure,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.070
saying that for the
first time in the history

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.280
of-- in the measured
history of race relations

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:44.190
and social mobility in the
UK, poor, white, working class

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.940
males were the number one
sort of disadvantaged group

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.560
in the UK.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.500
And we live in an age of, you
know, stay away from politics,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.780
but when you think about
the rise of a Trump,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.750
the rise of a Brexit
focus, a lot of folks

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.540
have been left behind in
the UK, who are white,

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.870
working class, and
in a ethnic diversity

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.200
definition of diversity,
are being ignored.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.750
And so at SEO, we spend
a ton of time on Fariha,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.120
and we spend a ton of
time on Billy as well,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.460
because it's just necessary
to reflect in the community.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.270
Essentially, they
are great people

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.190
with great talent, great
performance, but you know,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.940
they're up against
different challenges.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.440
You know, Fariha,
maybe she's Muslim,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.482
and you know, by virtue
of that is culturally not

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:44.940
permitted to shake
someone's hand--

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.490
a man's hand, who is not
in her immediate family.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:55.830
I mean, maybe she wants
to pray five times a day

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.610
in the middle of a training
program to get into a law firm.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.650
That's very-- if you're
not expecting it,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.150
you're not looking
for it, you don't

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.240
know what it is to
observe her doing this,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.390
that can throw you for a loop.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.360
Billy may have the wrong accent.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.300
Billy may have the
wrong references.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.479
Billy may support the
wrong football team.

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:19.020
There's a whole
range of other things

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.500
that can get in
the way of a Billy,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.880
just as they might
with a Fariha.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.750
They have different challenges,
but conceptually, we're

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.810
talking about difference.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.101
We're talking about acceptance.

00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:35.310
We're talking about
maximizing the pool of talent

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.570
available to a given firm.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.200
And in that case, we
see a need for what

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.120
we do all across the map.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.700
So every firm we work
with is really focused

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.120
on entry-level
graduate recruitment,

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.440
because it's obvious.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.590
It's like we need, we can find.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:03.400
And it's essentially recruitment
in the talent attraction

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.270
and selection business as such.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.850
It has really
become a commodity.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.670
There are lots of organizations
out there seeking to do that.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.880
We had one-- one huge
investment bank come to us

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.254
and say, we don't need
you guys for attraction,

00:26:18.254 --> 00:26:20.420
because we get hundreds of
thousands of applications

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.370
every year from all
sorts of people.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.650
But no one trains
them like you do.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:30.500
And so we see this as the sort
of kind of the easy part of it.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.860
Getting out to universities,
getting people to apply,

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.590
screening people,
straightforward

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.990
manipulation of a spreadsheet
much of the time--

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.360
a deeper assessment
about personal traits,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.082
qualifications, and so on.

00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:47.540
And finally, this
is the easy part.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.830
And one more, please.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.700
Retention is really
where I see the future

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.080
of all of this working out.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.406
If you've gone out and
recruited, you know,

00:27:00.406 --> 00:27:02.780
year after year there is this
great, wonderful recruiting

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.821
budget, a whole bunch of
new and different faces,

00:27:04.821 --> 00:27:05.780
that's wonderful.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.465
But if they're all sort
of veering off one,

00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:12.080
to two, to three years into the
mix, it wastes a lot of money,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.150
frankly.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.170
Now, we can talk about
the millennial generation

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.670
and people who want to be in a
place for two or three years,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.170
and they want to move on, and
that's just the new, you know,

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.940
gig culture inside corporates.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.970
But fundamentally, I
would like to think

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.900
that a Googler, if they spend
a little more time at Google,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.780
retain more and more
institutional memory,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.570
are able to sort of
scale their own networks

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.970
and their own social capital
with benefit to others

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:38.470
internally.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.344
If you've got a bunch
of people who have only

00:27:40.344 --> 00:27:41.870
been there for
two years, where's

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:42.800
the institutional knowledge?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.216
Where is the
institutional memory?

00:27:44.216 --> 00:27:45.534
Where is the scalability?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.790
And so a couple of
observations here.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.640
Maybe we need to
be measuring this.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.660
How do you measure it?

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.430
Very few people
are measuring it.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.130
It's like this-- it's like
the next obvious point.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.660
But I don't know
anyone, frankly,

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.600
any firm that we work with that
is aggressively measuring this,

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.240
because it's sensitive.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.010
It's politically
fraught with peril,

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.650
if you're going to ask
people to be tracking people.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:16.670
In Europe, in some
jurisdictions, it's illegal.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.000
In France, you know, they prefer
to stick their head in the sand

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.860
and not deal with the
issue, and have it

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.720
bubble up all around them, then
actually deal with it head on.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.370
And I think a lot of
places are like that.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.180
So another element of this
is promotion, which is,

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.490
who gets promoted?

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.820
I used that example earlier,
sort of the billion dollar

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.550
pound euro block trade.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.780
Who's getting the opportunity
to do the cool work?

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.861
I don't know what that
would be in this context.

00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.235
But who's getting
the opportunity

00:28:49.235 --> 00:28:51.950
to actually make a difference
such that they can get

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:52.790
promoted.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.820
There was a recent--

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.750
I chatted with a guy who's
at a law firm, major, major,

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.380
law firm, who had gone through
a restructuring, a fairly

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.810
dramatic restructuring, and a
lot of people were laid off.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.217
And this individual, who
is a black man, said to me,

00:29:08.217 --> 00:29:09.800
you know, he didn't
believe that there

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.870
was racism or discrimination
going on as such in the fact

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.169
that seven out of eight sort of
black associates were laid off.

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:19.960
He said he didn't think
that was the issue.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.330
He said, they were generally
less qualified, less important

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.500
to the business.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.530
But the question was,
who was staffing them

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.140
so they actually could
become important to business?

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.840
And that resonates
with me, because I

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.600
think a lot of what
we find around us

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.270
and a lot of the issues that we
see, and we'll get to it in one

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:44.630
of the last pages, is around
this notion of giving people

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.430
an opportunity to
succeed and promotion,

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.350
build that internal, social,
professional capital.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.930
Commitment.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:02.650
So two simple observations, I
don't know how many of you--

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.891
if there is a lot of turnover
in organizations at large, HR

00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:07.890
departments, especially
the graduate recruitment

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.620
departments, they flip
like nobody's business.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.080
It's unbelievable how fast--
how many times we have to change

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.580
our--

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.910
we'll come back and
communicate, and recommunicate,

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.680
and overcommunicate what we
do to a new generation of HR

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.260
professionals.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.624
So people are always moving, and
that's sort of a fact of life.

00:30:28.624 --> 00:30:30.540
But that's not just for
the recruitment folks.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.206
That's all up and
down the organization.

00:30:32.206 --> 00:30:34.424
So people who you have
support for this premise

00:30:34.424 --> 00:30:36.090
in the organization
will know, and who's

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.270
going to replace them?

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.470
So the firm has to be
committed, and if you

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.260
don't have people in the
executive suite on board,

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.280
forget about it.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.590
Frankly, it's just
window dressing.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.400
You need to have people occupied
at the very senior levels.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.299
I'm really pleased to say
at a place like, you know,

00:30:55.299 --> 00:30:57.340
Aberdeen Asset Management,
obviously has recently

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.850
gone through a merger,
their CEO came and spoke

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.140
to our candidates.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.630
That's a big deal.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.434
That's a big deal.

00:31:03.434 --> 00:31:05.100
And one of the
interesting things that's

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.780
occurred over time
is that way back

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.630
in the day, 2000 in my
case, you had a situation

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.250
where diversity was new.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.000
People didn't know
what to do with it.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.640
And so it became
in terms of dealing

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.032
with it as a strategic
priority of an organization,

00:31:23.032 --> 00:31:24.990
it went all the way to
the top, because there's

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.900
no one in the middle to sort of
figure out what to do with it.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.704
And over time, the
bigger firms have really

00:31:30.704 --> 00:31:33.120
embedded diversity into what
they're trying to accomplish.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.190
But it means that the
eye is off the ball

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.689
in many respects
for many big firms

00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:38.730
from what's happening in
sort of diversity intake

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.660
and management, because it's
been pushed down so many levels

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.350
where we see--

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.470
so what I'm trying to say
is without that support,

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.435
you start to get drift.

00:31:53.435 --> 00:31:55.560
You start to have conversations,
really unfortunate

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.220
conversations.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.690
I had this one.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.340
I'm paraphrasing slightly,
but major consulting firm

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.850
who shall not be
named called and said,

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:10.320
you know, essentially, Andrew,
we need five black people.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.150
I need them in the
next two months,

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.300
and I'll pay you 2,000 a head.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.800
That's the conversation
that you get

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.200
when the senior folks
aren't paying attention,

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.870
because it's been devolved
so far down the chain

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.480
it's just somebody who's got
a bums on seats mentality,

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.540
and that's all they're
trying to accomplish.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.410
So my response was, no, we
can't do that, by the way.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.460
We could, but we
don't want to do that.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.750
That's not the discussion that
we want to get engaged in.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:44.985
OK, so-- a series of
tiles will pop up,

00:32:44.985 --> 00:32:46.610
and each one sort of
leads to the other

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:52.460
and sort of tracks the
evolution of what we've seen

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.960
in London in the last 17 years.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.840
So I'm going to be
nudging you a little bit.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:05.630
So does anyone at Google
feel there isn't a diversity

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.530
problem?

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.170
Is sort of acknowledged that--

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.699
AUDIENCE: People exist.

00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:11.990
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: People exist.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.662
People exist.

00:33:12.662 --> 00:33:14.870
Well, I think that's-- and
that's hat you tend to see

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.130
as you go forward
through the tiles.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.260
There's always someone
who is one, or two,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.320
or three tiles behind, always.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.560
So we get from
denial to acceptance,

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.400
and then eventually you get a
sense across the industry, what

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.532
we've seen occurs, a lot
of different, underfunded

00:33:34.532 --> 00:33:35.990
groups sort of pop
up saying, we've

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.560
got to do something about this.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.100
And you know, but
it's my part-time job,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.630
and I have 10
other things to do,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.630
and my budget is 1,200 pounds.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.920
Can you help me?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.200
So you get this sort of--

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.490
a lot of underweight efforts.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.500
Through all that,
a handful of firms

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.570
emerge as being really
committed and really

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.230
sort of showing they know
what needs to get done.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.060
And that's an exciting
moment, because you

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.420
start to see sort of
people taking ahead--

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.850
leading the pack.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:12.320
And soon enough,
because HR folks

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.275
have all sorts of
conferences that they go to,

00:34:14.275 --> 00:34:15.650
and they start
talking about what

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.770
they're doing at this firm,
what they're doing at that firm.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.436
No one admits that
anyone has a problem,

00:34:19.436 --> 00:34:22.639
but there's the cool
things they're doing.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:26.060
We see best practices in
air quotes coming along,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.302
because that's--

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.980
it's the solidification of some
of the early experiments that

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.110
starts to occur.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.670
Can we go ahead?

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.540
And suddenly, and it's
really-- it's really-- like,

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.570
I'm on LinkedIn, and I've just--

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.138
there's like
diversity awards this,

00:34:44.138 --> 00:34:46.179
and there's diversity
expert this, and everyone's

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.389
a diversity speaker or not.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:49.320
And so it's really--

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.350
it's fun to watch.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.280
I mean, it's everywhere.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.639
And these are folks who
are now at the cutting

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:58.850
edge of sort of some of
the early experiments.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.430
And like I said, there's always
someone who's still back here

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.570
and someone who's
like, yeah, OK,

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.010
but I don't what to do about it.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.400
Yeah, well, I don't have a
lot of time or money for this.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.040
But we're certainly at
a point in many places

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:15.330
today where there's
experts everywhere.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.220
And so I think
right now, diversity

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.837
has become very
mainstream, and as I said,

00:35:21.837 --> 00:35:23.670
there are people still
at the very beginning

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.490
of the first tile.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.060
But it's an exciting
time, because there are--

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.660
another firm we worked,
they hired a slate of--

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.470
I think it was six new
entrants into their firm

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.930
for a particular division
in a particular role,

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.080
all white, male from Oxbridge.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.109
I'm sure they're all
perfectly well talented,

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:46.400
but one of the leaders on
that team was a senior woman,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.387
and she was furious
that you know,

00:35:50.387 --> 00:35:52.220
her business, which was
built around working

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.080
with female
entrepreneurs was not

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.820
going to be supported
by-- if that

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.160
was going to be the status
quo, that was not helping her

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.610
in her business.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.310
So you have people all up
and down sort of a spectrum

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.420
that you see movement.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.570
And so that firm will then come
to an SEO London or some group

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.420
that might be something like us
and say, how can we help that?

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.770
The next year, by the
way, apparently there

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:13.920
was six women who were hired.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.211
So it was yin and yang came
on, and hopefully, now it's

00:36:16.211 --> 00:36:20.031
more three and three, and
fours, and twos at this stage.

00:36:20.031 --> 00:36:20.530
Keep going.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.620
And so, yeah, some industries
are back here-- certainly

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.690
in a few industries
we see, particularly

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.220
the law firms and
the investment banks,

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.130
it used to be that you'd
blindly go out in April

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.890
and try and recruit for
September of the same year,

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:41.770
and that was what was done.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:45.680
Now, you know, we have a
secondary school program,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.170
where firms are looking
to draw in pipeline talent

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:51.410
from that early on to
ensure that they have

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.020
the numbers in gross
form so by the time

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.180
it's whittled down to
their recruiting class,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.070
that they have the people
they need and want.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.680
So you know, we've
been living the war

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.931
for talent for a long time.

00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:04.430
You guys, the
Googlers of the world,

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.002
are absolutely putting pressure
on all the big banks, and law

00:37:08.002 --> 00:37:09.710
firms, and consulting
firms, because what

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.251
you do has a certain
je ne sais quoi,

00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:15.140
it's so much more interesting
than prospectuses.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.870
But you'll tell
me if that's true.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.620
Maybe they've got it all wrong.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.820
I don't know.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.039
If you go to the next--

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:24.080
I talked about retention.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.660
I think this is the next front.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.429
I think people are starting
to wake up to this as they've

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:28.970
gone through.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.110
They've done a bunch
of experiments.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.250
They're trying to figure
out what's going on.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.050
There are people who
can talk the talk.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.019
Some people are
walking the walk.

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:36.560
And now they're
saying, well, sort of

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.860
like what occurred back with
Mike Auschwitz in New York,

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.677
you know, you're getting
kids into university, but not

00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:43.760
necessarily into the jobs.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:50.060
We're getting a lot of folks
in, but are they staying?

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.700
And that's the next evolutionary
step, one more step.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.870
And so, yeah, this is--

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.580
I think of the whole
diversity and inclusion

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.740
agenda as something
that's totally solvable.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.440
I mean, it just requires will.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.080
It requires focus,
and the reality

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.040
is that big firms have a lot
of other things to focus on.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:18.840
And I genuinely believe
that the people,

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.270
you know, our counterparts
at many of these firms

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.070
sincerely believe
in love and want

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.460
to sort of embrace and advance
the cause of diversity.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.720
I really believe that.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.210
There'll be a few exceptions
that you see come and go.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.915
But I think most
of the people we

00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:35.040
deal with on the other side
of the table sponsoring

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.240
our activities really
believe that they're

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.520
doing what they want to--

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.965
trying to accomplish
these goals.

00:38:39.965 --> 00:38:41.090
But they're under budgeted.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.690
They're understaffed.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.170
And so they're forced into
this world where they're

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.630
being shouted out from above
to hit numbers, do this,

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.630
do that, the other, and they're
given a tiny budget to do it.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:56.600
And so is the answer just
throw more money at it?

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.290
I don't know.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.860
I think it's a
cultural question.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.860
I don't think it
necessarily requires that.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.574
If you start to figure this--

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:04.240
the firms start to
figure out retention.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.950
A lot of the upfront
investment and experiments,

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.970
it solves itself.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.310
And some firms have
figured it out,

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.780
but most are figuring it out.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:20.920
OK, so each one of these topics
could be a book, an HBO mini

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.090
series, you name it.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.792
But I figured I'd close on this.

00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:27.250
As we go through this, we can
open up and have a little bit

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.764
more dialogue back and forth.

00:39:29.764 --> 00:39:31.180
I think I know the
answer to this,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.140
but how many people have heard
of the topic unconscious bias?

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.660
Everyone's heard of-- right.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.775
It's everywhere.

00:39:40.775 --> 00:39:41.900
I don't need to go into it.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.560
I think the point
is that this is

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.160
on the lips of every
diversity inclusion group.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.870
This is about as
mainstream as things get.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:58.330
But you know, it's not
just I think about the bias

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.610
that we all face.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.690
Try being a Rohingya Muslim
in Myanmar right about now.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.646
Try being a South
Korean in Japan.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.930
In Singapore, a
highly modern society,

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.370
is a lot of tribalism between
Chinese, Malay, and Indian

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.650
populations.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.620
A lot of those
lines don't cross.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:28.270
This is a global issue
I think in the West,

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.430
call it the US and
Western Europe,

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.790
there's a lot of very
positive work going on.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.951
We should, I think,
as a society,

00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:38.200
sort to be patting ourselves
on the back at some level

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.866
but just knowing
there's a hell of a lot

00:40:39.866 --> 00:40:42.370
more work to be done, the
fact that there's movement

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.730
in the right direction.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:49.260
It's really-- you get
racism, or sexism, or ageism,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.770
and everything is just prejudice
gone wrong in a situation

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.970
where there's uneven power.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:55.795
And power flips.

00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:06.780
You know, my father,
who is a white guy,

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.900
was in Jamaica for many years.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.040
And it was where I was raised
for much of my childhood.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:16.720
And you know, a super
well-qualified guy,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.950
PhD in this and that,
in his specialty,

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.320
experienced a lot of racism.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.370
It's just he was in a
black dominant country

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.990
with a power base that
was not favoring him.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.805
So it works both
ways is the reality.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.010
My mother, who is
black, then, you

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.310
know, from Jamaica coming up
to Boston, experienced sort

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.765
of the flip side, it right?

00:41:43.765 --> 00:41:44.640
So it goes both ways.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.181
It's really where
is there imbalance.

00:41:46.181 --> 00:41:48.760
So much of our work, whether
we want to call it unconscious

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.460
bias is dealing with power
dynamics, just making sure

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.810
there's as much
evenness as possible.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.270
And you're never
going to get rid--

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.940
I mean, this whole Harvey
Weinstein thing in Hollywood

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.610
right now is all about power.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.490
It's that simple.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.450
It's going to happen.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:07.784
It's never going away as long as
there are humans in the world,

00:42:07.784 --> 00:42:09.700
but we can at least start
to address the power

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.080
dynamics and the opportunities.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.387
So good enough expediency.

00:42:15.387 --> 00:42:16.970
I think a lot of the
challenge we face

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:17.810
is just because
people are dealing

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.100
with what's good enough.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:26.540
The story of C. I just want
to name my dear friend C.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.740
You know, coming up at
Deutsche Bank years ago,

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:31.850
our team was growing fast.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:33.540
And we needed to hire
someone really fast.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.120
We needed someone really
good and really qualified,

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.745
so we went to the HR department
and said, we need someone fast,

00:42:37.745 --> 00:42:39.890
and they sent over C.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.200
And he was awesome.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.080
He was so good.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.890
He was like, the best
thing we could have had.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.580
And then we went back, and the
team kept growing, and we said,

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.630
we need another person.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:55.390
We need-- like, C,
who do you know?

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:00.800
And C went and found G.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.110
And G came on board,
and he was fantastic.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:04.920
He did everything.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.054
He was a superstar.

00:43:06.054 --> 00:43:07.470
He did everything
we needed to do.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.400
Life was good.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.840
We kept growing.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.600
We went C, G, who'd you know?

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.180
They gave us T. And
then the thing about it

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.020
was, they were all Oxford
blues, sports players, you know,

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.960
white guys who are
super well-trained like.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.580
They all did an amazing job.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.220
And so, you know,
this is where I

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.890
think good enough really
drives a lot of things.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.430
If you can hire the kid out of
Imperial, or Stanford, or MIT,

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.740
or whatever, and
they've this fit

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:40.770
the mold in a generic, quick
hit sense, why search harder?

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:44.040
Why expend the extra effort to--

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.080
if what you've got
is good enough.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.550
I know, aging myself, there
was a Fatboy Slim album

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:54.840
a bunch of years ago that had
this big sort of lumpy guy

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.130
with a brown T-shirt said, I'm
number one, so why try harder?

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:05.580
You know, this is sort
of a lot of people--

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.620
you've got what you
need, so why try harder?

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.266
And so I think there's a
really interesting opportunity

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:11.640
for the firms that
really embrace

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.860
the notion of diversity,
to see the market

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.780
opportunity while you can--

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.540
finance jargon,
arbitrage opportunity,

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.310
to figure out what's
the best way to attract

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.720
more diverse talents.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.867
You have more qualified
voices in the room.

00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:28.200
So you're actually a step ahead.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:35.970
I think this is why I sort
of-- you know, a lot of--

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.650
a lot of firms have
an opportunity,

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:44.130
a strategic opportunity,
to improve their labor pool

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.950
by just being more open
minded about who fits in

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.490
and just spending
the extra time.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.611
Could we have found someone
better than C, G, and T?

00:44:51.611 --> 00:44:52.110
Maybe.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.650
They really good.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.010
They're really good.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.900
But I'll tell you,
the team fleshed out,

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.880
we had a Pakistani
guy join the team,

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.250
an Indian guy joined the
team, an Israeli woman

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.550
joined the team, and it was
a much more diverse group

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:09.870
very quickly on that basis.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.470
We had a lot of other
things going on.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:16.890
But I think a lot of what
we deal with in this space

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.760
is that people say--

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.700
all the firms we work with
were making a lot of money

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.490
before they started
focusing on diversity.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:33.430
If you took away all the
storm, and fury, and fun

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:38.067
of diversity inclusion, most
these firms are making money.

00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:40.150
The firms that actually
choose to go over the hump

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.764
and actually develop that talent
are doing one of two things.

00:45:43.764 --> 00:45:46.180
They're paying lip service to
some issue that's out there,

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.270
or they've generally
said, this is good for us.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:50.925
There's a business case here.

00:45:50.925 --> 00:45:52.300
And I think-- I
generally believe

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.360
that there is a very clear
business case for it.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.870
There are a lot of other things
going on behind the scenes.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.609
Yes?

00:46:03.609 --> 00:46:06.150
SPEAKER 1: Sorry to interrupt,
but we have five minutes left,

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:09.130
and I do want people to get
some time to ask questions.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:09.655
So if that's OK with you, yeah.

00:46:09.655 --> 00:46:11.380
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: Yeah, so
the idea of this laundry list

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.640
was that we could
break at any time.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640
So by all means, please.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.720
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.335
So yeah, so like I said, we
have about five minutes for you

00:46:17.335 --> 00:46:18.720
guys to ask any questions.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.070
Thanks a lot for
the presentation.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.716
I found it really interesting.

00:46:23.716 --> 00:46:27.030
My one kicking off
question is you mentioned

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.730
law firms, investment
banking, traditional banking

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:33.190
are much further ahead than
tech companies and other,

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:36.134
so what lessons would
you say like a Google

00:46:36.134 --> 00:46:38.860
or other companies that are at
the beginning of the journey

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.657
could take for the for
the more established ones?

00:46:41.657 --> 00:46:43.240
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN:
The number one thing

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.570
I think is run
towards difference.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.060
If you see something
that's different,

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.830
don't run at it
with a pitchfork.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:51.940
Run at it with--

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.860
you know, run towards it.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.470
Open yourself to it.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:47:04.270
You know, I had an irascible
Turkish cab driver on the way

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.990
out to Heathrow this morning.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.896
And he was-- he had a
lot of strong opinions

00:47:07.896 --> 00:47:08.770
about a lot of stuff.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.900
I didn't agree with a lot of it.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:11.830
But I was really glad to have
that conversation, because I

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.930
learned a whole bunch
of stuff about Turkey,

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.480
and the situation there, and--

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.280
and he was he was a
little bit out there,

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.080
but I was ready to have
that conversation, because I

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.480
was going to learn something.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.660
So you know, I
don't know how that

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.834
works in sort of
tech world per se,

00:47:30.834 --> 00:47:32.500
because you have so
many different parts

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.010
of your business.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.600
But I would say run
towards diversity.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.100
Run towards difference,
and that's at all levels.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.300
Internally, you know--

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.400
I think I was--

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.370
I had my eyes open
in particular.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.330
I live in the space.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.170
I work in the space.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.170
I breathe and sleep
this, but I was still

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.910
myself you know, taken aback
the first time I met, you know,

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.470
a transgender person.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:06.770
That was just different,
really different for me.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.999
But how cool is that?

00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:11.540
And I think if you sort of reach
out and sort of bring people

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.560
into the fold, you're
going to learn.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.360
An institutional will
only learn from that,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.390
and you're bringing in people
from other sectors that

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.420
are only going to add value.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.190
It used to be in the
US Midwest years ago,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.110
it used to be Swedes
versus Norwegians.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:28.910
All right?

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:29.660
I mean this is--

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.330
there's all manner
of talent out there.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:38.040
You just need to open
your minds to it.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.070
And I think Google
is well on the way

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.901
from all the conversations
I have, frankly.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.580
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.840
I have a question
regarding your operations.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.816
So if you started
like in the US,

00:48:51.816 --> 00:48:53.190
and and then you
moved to the UK,

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.690
those two markets are
very much developed

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.770
because of apprenticeships
and graduate schemes.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.580
So it's kind of--

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.056
I am not going to say it's easy.

00:49:01.056 --> 00:49:02.680
But it's easy compared
to other markets

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.889
to you know, just get the
talent to recruit you know,

00:49:04.889 --> 00:49:06.888
talented young people
from different backgrounds

00:49:06.888 --> 00:49:09.130
and then get them into
the right companies.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.649
Now, if you are now, you
know, expanding scale

00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:13.190
throughout the
markets, you mentioned

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.960
Bogota, Kabul, I
don't know any others,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.210
how do you want to start that?

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.960
How do you want to
shape it, because a lot

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.010
of those companies are not
prepared to get young guys

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.440
that, let's say, don't have
all the skills that need to be

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.060
trained in investment training.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.670
How do you want
to approach this?

00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:33.890
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN:
It's kind of-- it's

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.500
very straightforward in my mind.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.690
You've defined-- the
victory conditions are

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:42.320
you need a small set
of sponsors, who are

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.940
willing to buy into the notion.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.320
You don't need everybody.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.400
Here it was five firms in 2000.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:56.420
Now, it's 60 plus, a small
number of firms that get it

00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:01.910
and a talent pool that you feel
you can access readily enough

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:06.830
and assemble enough paid
or volunteer support

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.170
to train them enough such
that your training makes

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.240
a difference.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:19.260
So much of what is required to
succeed in a corporation has

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.920
to do with showing
up on time, you know,

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.180
dealing with feedback
as it comes, and not--

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.250
things that don't require a
huge amount of intervention.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.910
And if you're able to
put together a training

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.427
program around
that particularly,

00:50:35.427 --> 00:50:37.260
and you have a few
people who buy into that,

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.760
you've got a program.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.550
I mean, the question of
sustainability and scale

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:42.735
comes in.

00:50:42.735 --> 00:50:44.610
That's where you set
your victory conditions.

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.068
Do you want 10
firms or five firms?

00:50:46.068 --> 00:50:49.470
Do you want them
contributing 1,000 euros

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.340
or 25,000 euros each?

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.390
I think just doing
the raw numbers,

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.960
our average sponsorship
across all of our firms

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:03.120
is just under 20,000 pounds.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.280
I wouldn't expect that to be the
situation in day one in Kabul,

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:14.940
but certainly, in our Accra
program in Africa in Ghana,

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:18.741
that is operating in a much
smaller scale than we operate.

00:51:18.741 --> 00:51:21.240
But they've got 60-something
kids going through that program

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.320
every year.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.160
It's fantastic.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.090
It's really fantastic.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:30.390
So totally doable in
almost any market,

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.366
but it does have to be
modified to the country.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.120
AUDIENCE: From one Jamaican
to another, you're welcome.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.870
I have a question.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.350
So just in relation to
countries like Jamaica where

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:50.740
your problem is education
is at the further end

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.580
of the spectrum.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.490
You're thinking about basic
things like food and survival.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.260
How do you then get countries
such as Jamaica and others

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.380
to that level
where they can even

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.605
see the importance of
education and moving

00:52:05.605 --> 00:52:07.697
up the ladder in terms of
their career and so on?

00:52:07.697 --> 00:52:10.280
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: OK, so there's
actually two answers to that.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.760
One of them has to do with this
question of de-risking at risk.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.210
This is not--

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.730
Google, it's not
clear to me, is going

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.860
to be institutionally
equipped, and I'm

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.110
happy to be told
otherwise, to take someone

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:28.582
on who has a long criminal
record with multiple drug

00:52:28.582 --> 00:52:30.290
offenses or this, or
that, and the other.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.330
Someone is not going
to make it no matter

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.954
how much you intervene, because
the resources to get someone up

00:52:34.954 --> 00:52:37.190
that curve, to get
into that position,

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.390
it's just not effective.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.430
And we're dealing with
profit-based companies

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:41.346
at the end of the day.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:48.770
So there's sort of an 80-20
rule, and can you get--

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:52.070
with that 20% of effort, can
you get that 80% of impact.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.160
And if you're going for people
who are generally struggling

00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:01.250
at the ends of the Earth, that's
just a really hard problem

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:02.060
to solve.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.700
And I'll be perfectly honest
and say SEO London doesn't

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.020
have the resources to do that.

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.510
We're not funded to do that.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.050
That being said, I did try
and start up SEO in Jamaica

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.420
not too long ago,
probably about 2004.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.840
We managed to get
Queenie, sorry,

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.330
we managed to get Q from a
really rough part of Kingston

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:25.730
to get a job at UBS in
New York, transforming

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:27.434
her potential at some point.

00:53:27.434 --> 00:53:28.850
Ultimately, it
wasn't sustainable,

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:31.010
because the structure of
that-- that program had

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.490
structural issues, overly
reliant on the US visa

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.677
situation, as a first point.

00:53:36.677 --> 00:53:37.760
But we had another effort.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.240
We tried to make it an
indigenous effort, and we had--

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.429
and I'm forgetting
the gentleman's name.

00:53:42.429 --> 00:53:43.220
He's a billionaire.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.180
I should remember
billionaire's names.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:50.990
But we had a Jamaican born
guy who lives in Canada,

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:54.830
and he owns a couple of the
banks and a few other things.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.170
He came down, and
we sat in a room

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:00.164
with myself, him, and a
few other young Jamaican

00:54:00.164 --> 00:54:01.580
entrepreneurs and
said, how can we

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.660
make this-- use this SEO model
and deploy it in Kingston.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.850
And this guy said, I'll
give you half the money.

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.555
You guys got to go to the
rest of the world to fund it,

00:54:10.555 --> 00:54:12.680
and I was living in London
at the time, and I was--

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.840
I wasn't going to be
doing this full time.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.587
He was supplying half the funds.

00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:18.920
I had to look at the rest of
the folks around the table.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.878
They had to be willing.

00:54:19.878 --> 00:54:23.270
They weren't willing by virtue
of they had other stuff to do.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.000
It wasn't their
problem in their mind.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.130
You know, it takes will.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.662
This is a concept
whose time has come.

00:54:33.662 --> 00:54:35.120
It's not hard to
copy and paste it.

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.180
The barriers to entry in that
sense are low as anything.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.772
Anybody can set up a program.

00:54:39.772 --> 00:54:41.480
You can even set up
a sustainable program

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.800
if your maintenance
levels are humble enough.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.634
But it takes will, you know.

00:54:47.634 --> 00:54:50.300
The only way we're able to do it
in London in the first instance

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.480
was I was willing.

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.900
I had a little bit of resource.

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.210
I had some credibility
in my profession,

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.720
and I had a list of about
20 American ex-pats running

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:03.090
around London who were bored
and looking for something to do

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.751
and were ultimately
were committed

00:55:04.751 --> 00:55:07.250
to what we were doing, and we
were able to that back up that

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:08.250
effort.

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:13.190
So to do it in Jamaica, or
Puerto Rico, or wherever,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.005
it's all doable.

00:55:16.005 --> 00:55:18.111
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:55:18.111 --> 00:55:18.610
Thank you.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.318
I've been told this
is the last question,

00:55:20.318 --> 00:55:21.402
so I hope it's a good one.

00:55:21.402 --> 00:55:22.943
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN:
Maybe the best one.

00:55:22.943 --> 00:55:24.460
AUDIENCE: Maybe
the best, exactly.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.760
Thank you again for
your talk, brilliant.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.340
You have talked about will
just there, and earlier,

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.740
you talked about how diversity
wasn't a theme back in 2000.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.430
Maybe [INAUDIBLE]
and there is a lot

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.555
of different teams between them.

00:55:38.555 --> 00:55:40.930
And so it's definitely something
that I've seen a Google.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:42.659
Perhaps others
have seen at Google

00:55:42.659 --> 00:55:43.700
in their different roles.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.004
But how do you get will--

00:55:46.004 --> 00:55:47.420
or how do you
inspire will, or get

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.650
people who are in the middle,
who are not in HR, for example,

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:53.950
but perhaps actually
high managers, leaders

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.210
within the business?

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.930
They are not C level.

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.716
They are not junior
high up, for example.

00:55:59.716 --> 00:56:02.533
But they have the
potential to be--

00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:03.750
make an impact on diversity.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:07.730
But because there are
other priorities, targets,

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:09.620
business goals, and
so forth, it seems

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.750
like diversity or
inclusion gets pushed out.

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.500
But how do you get will
from the middle teams,

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.500
because from my
perspective, that's

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.280
where you can have
the biggest impact?

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.330
So if they make it, [INAUDIBLE]
it kind of cascades down.

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:25.395
So I'd be interested to get
you perspective on that.

00:56:25.395 --> 00:56:26.664
ANDREW FAIRBAIRN: Yeah.

00:56:26.664 --> 00:56:28.330
If I can rephrase the
question slightly,

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:33.220
it's how can folks who are sort
of mid-tier, in mid-career,

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.900
make impact and sort of drive
change in the organization

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.850
by raising attention to it?

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:42.990
It takes a tiny bit of courage.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:49.810
I know so many people who are
in positions of influence that

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:54.370
are mid-career folks, who have
been able to walk into a room

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.980
and say, why can't
we do more of this?

00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.820
Why can't we have--

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.770
if the topic is diversity,
or if the topic is Marmite,

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:04.060
why can't we do more of this?

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.750
It takes an ounce of political
courage inside the organization

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:08.800
to say--

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.740
to feel like, you're not going
to get kicked out the room

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:15.790
and lose your bonus check at
the end of the year for having--

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.662
trying to advance your
own agenda of this sort.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.336
The firms that get
it right are the ones

00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:25.960
that are open to those kinds of
conversations, where you're not

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:31.270
penalized for asking for some
sort of change around you.

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:33.510
But I tell you,
when people do it,

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:40.090
I know a fellow in
Boston, who he was-- he

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:41.224
had a role in recruiting.

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:42.640
He just-- he said,
listen, we need

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.244
to get more diversity
in this firm.

00:57:44.244 --> 00:57:45.410
I'm going to make it happen.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.260
He just went out
and just created

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.140
a cohort of diversity
in that organization

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:53.692
just by virtue of his
deliberate action and effort.

00:57:53.692 --> 00:57:55.150
And he didn't get
penalized for it.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:56.525
So he kept doing
it, and he said,

00:57:56.525 --> 00:57:59.170
I'm going to keep doing it
until you tell me not to do it.

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:01.270
And now, there is
a whole, as I said,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.540
cohort of talent that's
been given access

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.880
to that corporate world,
which are now splintered off

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.660
and gone to into 100 different
things over the years.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.993
I mean, this is a long time ago.

00:58:09.993 --> 00:58:15.100
But he had to have
the wherewithal

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.290
to just do that in
terms of inspiring it,

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.290
as opposed to putting
your own neck on the line,

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:25.900
because it's always clever to
have it be someone else's idea.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:30.310
There are people all around
who are coming up the hard way,

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.810
many of them are invisible.

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.600
But many of them, if you
just probe just a little bit,

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.600
you'll find that they are
your strongest allies.

00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:42.850
We were at a firm
not too long ago

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:48.090
and a senior partner in
real estate practice there--

00:58:48.090 --> 00:58:50.290
I mean, real estate is
like tough as nails.

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:51.730
You guy think tech is hard.

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:54.550
Real estate, I mean,
that's a brutal business.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:59.410
This guy is a partner at a major
law firm running that practice.

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.570
He broke down in
tears when talking

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.240
about how he had come up.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:09.425
And what a great ally
to find and tap into.

00:59:09.425 --> 00:59:11.300
If you start to know
the people-- the stories

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.100
of the people around
you, you're going

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.683
to find that not
everyone had it easy.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.850
And if you can get
their stories out,

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:22.790
that's a way to have
the empathy and sympathy

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.980
that you need to them when
you bring your business

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.990
case forward and say
why this is a good idea.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.830
You have support behind you, and
you don't bring just yourself

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.290
and your own neck on the
line, but you bring, you know,

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.998
a little bit more than
that to the table.

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:42.350
So yeah, I thought
it wasn't too random.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:46.020
But I'm grateful for
the opportunity to talk.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.580
SPEAKER 1: Thanks, Andrew.

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.330
[APPLAUSE]
