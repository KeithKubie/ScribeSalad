00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
C'mon ref!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.120
ARE YOU BLIND?

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.140
The officiating in the match, amirite?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.649
Are referee's even fair?

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:06.879
Short answer: NOPE.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:07.879
RED CARD.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:16.300
YOU'RE OUT REF.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.630
Referees are some of the most hated people
in the world; there are times when I feel

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.750
like the bad guys you see on the news experience
less vitriol than some sports officials.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.650
The thing is, they don't have an easy job!

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.390
I was a volunteer soccer ref in high school
in a small town; parents are not friendly.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.199
But science says I was being biased against
the out-of-towners!

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.440
Three economists looked at 1,000 pro sports
matches and determined the home-team advantage

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.739
isn't just how loud the crowd cheers against
the visitors.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.739
No!

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.700
But, in fact, supposedly impartial referees
showed a bias toward the home team, even when

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.030
they WEREN'T FROM THERE.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.039
The economists studied cricket -- which for
our American audience is like baseball combined

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.559
with bowling, but slower than both -- and
the rules were adjusted to require neutral

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.989
referees, which DID eliminate the bias…

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.970
But if there wasn't neutrality, referees showed
a 10 to 16 percent bias in favor of the home

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.970
teams!

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.550
Cricket isn't the only sport in the world
obviously, but this isn't the only study to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.640
spot bias.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.390
A 2012 book about American Football found
a 57.3 percent ref bias toward the home team;

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.610
though they estimate it has to do with "crowd-pleasing."

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.620
Which doesn't necessarily vogue, because in
the cricket study, most of the bad officiation

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.670
happened as the audience shrank.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.360
But maybe it's not about the audience, or
the refs at all, but simply the color of the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
uniforms?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.330
Sounds weird, but a 2005 study in Nature looked
at athletes in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.410
Funnily enough, athletes wearing red consistently
outperformed those in blue!

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.640
The researchers believed athletes who wear
red are motivated to perform at a higher level,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.410
because psychologically red inspires dominance
and aggression -- which can be very valuable

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.640
in sport.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.539
That being said, a critic of the study believes
it wasn't the athletes, but the referees!

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.659
So, obviously the ref isn't blind, because
according to psychologists from the University

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.471
of Münster, the officiant was influencing
the results by subconsciously favoring the

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.150
players in red.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.480
This was especially important in individual
sports like tae kwon do, or wrestling, where

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.020
competitors wear only red or blue and an umpire
or judge has a lot of power.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.970
It doesn't seem to apply to team sports….

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.739
But lest you think maybe officiating is ALWAYS
BAD; it's important to remember WHY sports

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.739
exist.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.610
They're games, they're human.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.760
If robots scored everything, it wouldn't be
any fun at all.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.940
There are still people who think instant REPLAY
has ruined the game.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.120
The calls of the referee really bring the
audience's viewpoints and opinions into the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.230
game.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.299
We shouldn't expect our sports adjudicators
to be robots; sure mistakes are made.

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.829
But officiants are doing their best, and things
aren't always equal in the real world.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.670
If it was a perfectly accurate robot, what
would you talk about the next day?!?

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.950
What's the worst time refs have screwed up
the game?
