00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.240
Armed with our list of 1 million SNVs, we're

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.250
ready to compare genomes all over the world. Now, for

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.330
example, we can take this genome of person 1.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.680
And we can go SNV by SNV, and match them

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.630
to the SNVs that we find in the genome

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.320
of person 2. For example, let's say we look at

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.570
an SNV on chromosome three, I've marked the location of

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.690
the SNV here in red, in the genomes of person

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.920
1 and person 2. For example, person 1 may

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.800
have two alleles for SNV one just like person 2.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.540
Because person 1 and person 2 are identical at

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.280
the site, we give them a score of 1. Now

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.040
let's take a look at a different SNV on

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.950
chromosome seven, here I've marked it on the actual chromosome

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.820
seven for person 1 and person 2. Now, for

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.970
the second SNV, person 1 is homozygous for the C

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.900
allele, but person two is heterozygous, with a C and a G allele. So they would

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.270
be assigned a matching score of 0.5. Right?

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.190
It's a half match. Out of the two possible

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.740
letters that they could match, only the C's

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.118
match. And now let's look at this last

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:12.450
SNV. SNV three here, on chromosome 16. In

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.025
this case, person 1 is homozygous T for SNV

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.980
three, but person 2 is homozygous G. There is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.530
no match at all. So the matching score in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.200
this case would be 0. So in each case,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.340
we can look at each individual SNV, and make

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.330
a comparison from Person 1 to Person 2 and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.060
assign a score, of either 1, 0.5, or 0.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.690
Or we could look at multiple SNVs at once

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.130
and take the average. The average here, we had 1

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.080
plus 0.5 plus 0 is 1.5 divided by 3 is 0.5. Our overall matching

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.343
score for all three SNVs together is half. This means that between person 1 and

00:01:55.343 --> 00:02:01.150
person 2 for these SNV's, half of the alleles they have match. This matching

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.100
score is also referred to as an IBS score, or an identity by state score.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.675
Identity by state is just the coincidental possession

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:12.910
of alleles that appear identical. It's your identity

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.010
by an individual state, or SNV. We can also write this score from 0 to 1

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.680
as a 0% to 100%. Where 100% is a perfect match, 50% is a half match, and 0%

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.490
is no match at all. So let's take an individual that has an allele composition

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.680
for four SNV's like this. The first SNV is CC. The second one

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.740
is TG. The third one is AG. And the fourth one is AA. Which

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.420
of the following options would this individual share an IBS score of 50%, on

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.370
average for all four SNV's? Be sure to check any and all that apply.
