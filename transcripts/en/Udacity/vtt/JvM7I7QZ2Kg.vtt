00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.143
One day I woke up and
they called my co-founder and

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:08.735
I told him this is not going anywhere.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:12.089
We can't work like that.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.362
We have full time jobs,
he was working in an advertising agency.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:18.672
I was working.

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:20.670
I had actually two jobs.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.070
I was working as an analyst,
as a QA engineer.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.590
And I told them we can't do it.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.650
We were doing our full time jobs.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.650
And then on the nights we're
starting this start up.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.070
And we had just one guy
doing the programming.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.970
And we expect him to do all that work.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.920
And this is not going anywhere.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.670
We're just entrepreneurs.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.400
We just want to be there but
we need to commit.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.460
We need to burn the bridges behind us.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.940
And not really have Plan B.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.160
We need to have only Plan A.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.610
We're doing this, and no matter what.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.430
And we both gave notice the same day and

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.850
56 days later we got our first investor.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.570
So that was really the moment
that switched everything and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.870
probably if we didn't just quit
our jobs and just go for it.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.980
We probably never
completed the first version

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.738
because we would just like
postponing it forever.

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:34.550
And that fuel,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.590
that like fire that gets you going,
that what really made a change for us.
