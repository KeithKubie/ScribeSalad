And it is amazing.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.170
I grew up in the
Syriac tradition

St. Thomas Christians.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.930
Our forefathers traced
the origin of their faith

to Thomas the apostle.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.870

tradition came there.

of the churches,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.050
And, when I was a small boy,
I served mass in Syriac.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.690
It was still in Syriac.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.960
And we would write the
text in Malayalam script.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.800

the mass saying.

what was happening,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.390
And in 1962, the liturgy was
translated into the vernacular.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.940
But early on there was an
interesting phenomenon.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.010
The people who translated the
chants kept the original melody.

Very much.

And answer to one of your
earlier questions before

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.300
the interview.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.380
I, he was a source
of inspiration

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.610
for me to become a priest.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.050
Because my father adored him
and venerated him as a saint.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.510
And I used to hear all
these stories about him.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.110
So I wanted to become a priest.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.420
And guess what?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.960
I became a member of the
religious congregation

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.390
within Syro-Malabar
Church, which he founded.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.270
So look at the design of things.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.890
And then for some
reason I took up studies

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.910
in Syriac music, Syriac chant.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.750
And now that has
become my life mission.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.680
It was just his life mission.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.830
So there is a design that
was beyond my calculation.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.130
It just happened.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.720
But that, I want to add one more
curious information about me.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.020
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: My
baptismal name is Ouseph.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.970
Ouseph.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.250

do you spell that?

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
O-u-s-e-p-h, Ouseph.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:02.410
Which is the Malayalam
Kerala version of Joseph.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.840
Yoseph, the Hebrew Aramaic
Yoseph becomes Ouseph.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.300
So that's how I was baptized.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.880
Because it was still
a Syriac tradition.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.920
And the priest who baptized me,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.530

record during my daughter

Found that Joseph [inaudible]
was the priest who baptized me.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.130
He signed his name in the Syriac
script Ouseph [inaudible].

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.430
What a coincidence.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.740
And here we are sitting
in America at the Library

about Syriac chants.

you always musical?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.520
I started singing at the church.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.440
Interestingly, my debut singing.

So the local sacrist will select
talented boys and train them

to sing at a function.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.680
And he, when I was eight or
nine, he selected me to sing.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.510
And I sang the chant that we
heard in the video earlier.

So that was my first,
it so happened

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.110
that was my first debut.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.710
I still remember the
tension with standing

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.820
in the back in the sacristy.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.010
Your knees jerk whether you
will sing it correct or not.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.390
And the sacrist is waiting to,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.890
watching you whether you are
singing the melody correct

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.480
and so on.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.570
And then left that tradition.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.070

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.440
I learned Malayalam songs.

and continued that.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.010
And became a professional singer
of Christian devotional songs

No, not in Syriac.

Not in Syriac.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.970

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.850

And the songs were composed,
I didn't compose the song.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.010
The song was composed

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.510
Semi-classic.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.190
By the time I got interested in
the Indian classical tradition,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:21.070
there was a move toward
indigenizing Christian worship,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.400
making it Indian.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.690
So I learned that kind of music.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.510

&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
So, yeah, yeah.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.650
So from childhood onwards I
am listening to these stories.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.020
I mean, I'm inundated
with, from my father

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.080
who was a great believer.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
was your father's name?

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Joseph again.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, yes, okay.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: I
am glad he has that name.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.550
It was given by mistake.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.270
I should not have been Joseph.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Why?

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Because I am the firstborn male.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.680
And I should have got the son

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.820
of my grandfather,
which is [inaudible].

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.760
My aunt and her husband
took the baby for baptism.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.000
In those days the mother didn't
go to, she waited for 40.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Forty
days to the church.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Yes, yes.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.740
So my aunt went, took me
to, the baby to the baptism.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.240
And the baptism was
in Syriac, Aramaic.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.100
All the rituals were in Aramaic.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.310
So during the service,
the priest,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.460
in those days they
looked up to priests as.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: As we still do.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.090
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: So in
between the priest turned around

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.460
and asked my aunt, what's
the name of the baby?

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.020
In her fright, in her,
so she said Ouseph.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.620
That is my father's name.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.200
So the priest baptized
me Ouseph.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.650
Only later when they
came home and they said,

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.040
she said baptism name is Ouseph,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.650
there was a big commotion
in the family.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.180
The grandfather is
unhappy definitely.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Is it, in
some traditions naming a child

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.940
after a living person is
considered very bad luck.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.240
Is that not there?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Not at all.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Just your
grandfather felt left out.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.140
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.440
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: His
name should have come to me.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.040
And then family waited

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.340
for another few years
for my brother.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.420
I have a brother [inaudible].

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.200
Who, in fact, is
closely associated

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.640
with this Aramaic project.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.670
He's in charge of
the project in India.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.570
So he got the name
that I should have got.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.110
Mix up. Yeah.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.350
So that is, somehow
I feel a kind

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.270
of divine ordination
in all this.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.990
And, finally, Syriac becomes my,
this project becomes my life.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.740
And for the rest of my active
years, I'll be working on this

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.100
and building up materials.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.390
And creating awareness.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.530
And I'm happy that
the youngsters

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.150
in America are picking on it.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.740
So eventually the
history of this language

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.990
and music will be
American story,

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.640
but it will be part
of their story.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, talk a
little bit about your teaching.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.200
Because you're teaching people
in this country Aramaic.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.800
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, so.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.100
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.400
Mostly young people.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.730
I, when I go for mass, I make
sure that they also sing one

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.360
or two Aramaic chants as they
did, Falls Church, Virginia.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you
have your own parish?

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
I have my own parish.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
how big is it?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.050
And where is it?

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.650
It's a small parish
in Maspeth, New York.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.950
Queens, New York.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.250
So that is a Roman rite parish.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.550
So I stay there.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.320
I work as a priest,
associate pastor there.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.020
So with the resources and the
time I get, I use for this.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.940
So when I go to Syro-Malabar
Indian expatriate

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.960
in Indian communities, I teach
them these Syriac chants.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.950
I teach them easy to
sing Syriac chants.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.640
So one song, one
chant that I teach,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.190
one the youngsters are
familiar is the [foreign word].

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:10.010
Holy God, holy mighty one, holy
mortal one have mercy on us.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.310
Can I sing that?

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes, please.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.910
[ Singing ]

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
[foreign word], holy God.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:51.520
[ Singing ]

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.520
That performance, that is
something that I added to this.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.040
Three times saying holy,
holy, holy [foreign word].

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.610
So that is now catching up.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:07.030
So it's creating for the
editor that short thing has

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.330
to be done once again.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: So
maybe I'll sing it once again.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, okay.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:24:00.570
[ Singing ]

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.870
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's lovely.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.550
It has a Middle Eastern flavor.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.420
At the same time, probably
it was composed in Kerala.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:13.410
So the concept of Middle East,
the music and the culture,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.040
that is so much a part of
this community at one point.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.290
Because there was an immigration
of Christians from Persia.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
when did that happen?

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.890
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.190
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
In the fourth century.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Fourth century.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yeah.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.090
And that brought
the Syriac liturgy.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.390
And the Syriac tradition
continued.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.690
Bishops came from
the Middle East.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.280
We were treated like a sister
church of the Chaldean church.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.910
So that's why we have a Chaldean
Syriac, which is East Syriac.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.290
So in the song that I sang,
you will hear [foreign word].

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.420
Whereas in the wester
Syriac [foreign words].

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.530
So we preserve the east
Syriac pronunciation.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.530
Which some scholars say
probably was the original way

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.130
of saying those things.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.760
In the [inaudible],
you heard one scholar,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.070
Dr. Thomas Quinnamark
[assumed spelling].

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.250
And he said the way we,
the Syriac Christians,

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.550
the Chaldean Christians
pronounce words probably

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.270
that in the pre-Christian
pronunciation inherited

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.690
from the Jewish people.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.870
He especially mentioned about
the word "taw," the last letter

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.440
of Hebrew Aramaic alphabet, taw.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.630
So if you put a dot under
taw, it is pronounced almost

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.930
like [phonetic sound].

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.290
That's why he said [foreign
word], but you say Assyrians.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.950
Yeah, a subtle, so it
is a creative thing

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.790
that these people
are still preserving

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.940
that ancient pronunciation.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:43.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So when the
Middle East was basically,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.960
it become under the
influence of Islam,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.590
it would be the 7th century.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.190
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Then
that change,

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.840
so in some ways you were.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.140
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.440
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.740
The pronunciation changed.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Even
the language was suppressed.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.070
So the scenario in
the Middle East

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.080
and [inaudible] are
totally different.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.800
In the Middle East
they were suppressed.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.290
The, so they had to change.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.640
The daily conversation
became Arabic.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.950
So they lost that Syriac, quite
a bit of original pronunciation.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.210
They, those churches,
the Chaldean churches,

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.180
they still preserve
Syriac liturgy.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.480
They still chant.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.780
But the melodies
are very different

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.830
from what we have in Kerala.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.250
So if they watch this interview

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.290
and if they watch the way
I sang, they would say,

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.540
this doesn't sound right.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.920
This sounds very different.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Is there
any relations that you found

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.730
as a scholar between
Hebrew liturgy

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:48.550
and the melodies you're
using, the Hebrew?

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.850
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Not yet.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.920
I haven't delved, I haven't
given attention to that.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.220
There may be.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:57.820
In fact, it's interesting
that you asked that question.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.510
In the CD that I "Qambel Maran"
the second track is sung.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:12.040
[ Singing ]

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.330
I have been asking
some people to see if,

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.070
first of all, it is a song.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.940
It's a Syriac translation
of a song

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.870
which was originally in Hebrew.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.810
So, and the word, the opening
words are [foreign words],

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.460
which is the same as in Hebrew.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.980
Same as for the Jewish people.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.280

&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Praise, praise.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.190
So I'm still inquiring if
that melody has a Jewish root.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:42.680
If one day, if somebody finds it
out, that will be fascinating.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.000
Because, I'm glad you
brought this issue.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.310
Because there are many
Jewish customs that,

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.730
in the Syro-Malabar Christians.

until 40 days after childbirth.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.380
Then offering the first
fruits to the church.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.200
If you planted a coconut
tree, and the first coconut

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.690
that you plucked, you will
bring it to the church.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.990
You planted a mango tree,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.810
you will bring those
fruits to the church.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:20.610
And then, most important,
we have a Passover meal.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.910
Yes.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
do you call it?

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Pesaha.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Pesaha.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
On holy Thursday.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:34.010
On holy Thursday we prepare
a special kind of bread

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:35.790
and a concoction of milk.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.320
And then we have a
religious service at home.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.730
And who presides the service?

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.470
The oldest male member.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.350
And then we children, we all
stand there with great devotion

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.910
as if this father
is like a priest.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.960
And he makes prayers.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.290
And then he cuts this
bread and gives to you.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.730
And he wouldn't just go
and take it like that.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.880
He will go with reverence as if
you were receiving communion.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.480
So I still remember
that experience of it

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.600
as a boy standing in our home
and getting this from my father.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.810
And you look at your father from
a very different perspective.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.640
As if you look at
him as a priest.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.980
So he was a priest,
truly a Jewish tradition.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.820
And there's unleavened bread.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.930
And so probably the Jewish
Christian immigrants brought

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.280
that tradition here.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.560
And that tradition continues.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.820
This tradition still continues
in some of the families.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.340
Yeah. That's fascinating how.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.280
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was
there any songs,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.910
any music that was
not liturgical?

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.850
Were there any popular songs or
children's songs or lullabies

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.770
that continued in Syriac
outside the church?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.190
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Oh, I don't know.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:02.480
I don't know if music melodies
were used outside the liturgy.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.580
Outside the official liturgy,
there are paraliturgical songs.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.310
But still, it is on the border.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: On the border.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: But at
home, I never thought like that

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.140
at home for a mother to
put a child to sleep,

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.250
would you sing in Syriac.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Maybe
you should ask.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.200
It might be all around you.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.800
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Sometimes
those are older.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.100
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Yeah, that's right.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.700
I never thought along
those lines.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.000
I should ask next time
when I see old people.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.850
Did you ever sing Syriac
chants to your baby.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.150
Was [inaudible].

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.450
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Or
even secular songs.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.050
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Secular songs.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.220
Yeah, that never occurred to me.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.280
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay,
I'd be interested.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.950
If you find out, I'd
be very interested.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.250
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Definitely.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.250
You put a fire in my brain.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.760
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What else
should we know about your work,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.490
what you're doing now?

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: I'm
trying to create awareness

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.860
of all this music relation.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.000
Because not only music
tradition, language.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.810
The languages [inaudible].

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:02.750
The sound of the language.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.510
The phonemes of language.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.500
And thought process that is,

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.470
each language has its
own way of thinking.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.800
So that treasure
that is associated

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.390
with the language,
the thought process.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.060
The sound has, have
to be preserved.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.950
So that's what I
am trying to do.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.080
So there's significance
beyond my religion.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:32.520
Beyond, it is an intangible
world cultural heritage.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:39.570
Imagine if we knew the sound
of hieroglyphics from Egypt.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.880
We waited so long to
[inaudible] set our table

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.860
to know how to read that.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.440
But imagine if somebody
had documented the sound.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.710
So that's what I am doing
now, documenting the sound.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.020
200 years, 500 years from
now, if someone wanted

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.160
to know how did this
language sound in India

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.780
or the Middle East or in
different parts of India?

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.850
Then we have documentation.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:12.950
So I'm excited to contribute
to the treasures of humanities.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.400
This is a treasure of humanity,
and we shouldn't let it go.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.750
And I truly appreciate,
Nancy, because of our meeting

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.050
at the society

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.090
of ethnomusicology
conference, you can know me.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.390
Then we had a discussion.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.860
You decided to connect me
with the Library of Congress.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.210
Connect me to Harvey

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.750
And it is going to,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.580
the discussion is
going to come here.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.040
So those, the sounds, the
melodies the memories,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.840
the interviews are
going to be housed

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.530
in this great institution.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.660
So I'm happy that you came
into my life in this case.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.350
And we made all this.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.970
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And we're
delighted to have you.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.390
But what's next?

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.290
So you're continuing
to collect; right?

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.590
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you start,
did you start collecting Syriac

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.390
for your dissertations?

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:59.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Specifically?

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Yes, yes.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:02.590
And during, while
doing the dissertation

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.890
at the Graduate Center of the
city university of New York,

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.020
I thought I should
do a recording.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.780
So I consulted with
Professor Blum.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.260
So I took like two
years spent on that.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.260
That was the Syriac,
"Qambel Maran,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.240
Syriac Chants From South India."

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.800
That was, we have a copy here.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.680
And you have cataloged it.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.400
So that, look at that, most
of the priests who sang

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.270
in that CD are already gone.

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:33.970
And we got examples
of vocal inflection.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.610
Because the vocal inflection
of the senior priests who sang

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.800
in that CD is different
than the vocal inflection

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.100
of the younger priests.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Palackal: Really?

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.000
So the younger priests,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.910
the older priests were
groomed in that tradition.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.210
They grew up in that tradition.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.510
They used the language.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.350
So the tongue, the vocal cords
became comfortable with it.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.650
Whereas, the younger priests,

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.240
my generation didn't
get that chance.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.450
We didn't read the liturgy
of the hours in Syriac.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.550
So we just sang a few melodies.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.090
So our vocal inflection
is very different.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.710
My vocal inflection
is very different

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.770
from the inflection
of a senior priest.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.020
So that's CD is a treasure.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.810
Because we have captured,
most important that CD is,

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:18.920
the priest who translated
the chants from Syriac

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.580
to Malayalam is one
of the singers.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.300
And the title of the CD
is "Qambel Maran" based

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:30.970
on the track, that
particular song which I sang.

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:32.270
[ Singing ]

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.280
And he sang that
song in that CD.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.080
It is such a precious treasure.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.900
And I cannot sing as well as him

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.500
because he vocal
inflection's different.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.790
Because he's used to
singing it every day.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.980
Whereas, I sing it occasionally.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: In the lyrics,
the liturgy is written down.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.380
But the music is
not written down?

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: No, no.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.460
You learn it by hearing.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:04.720
Yeah. And this is like
Hindustani classical music.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.590
You can write, writing
it successfully

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.120
to a certain extent.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.420
You can write the notations.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.940
But the particular
inflections you need to hear.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And are those
inflections, those nuances and,

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.830
when you're singing in Syriac.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:25.880
Are they related to any of the
surrounding Indian traditions?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
I don't think so.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.750
There are certain examples.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.530
For example, there's a
melody that is appropriate

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.930
from the Syriac melody.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.730
I'm singing in Malayalam.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:56.040
[ Singing ]

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.840
I'll sing it again.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:14.180
[ Singing ]

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:21.370
I will say the people who sang
that, model after Syriac melody.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:29.160
But that's pretty much, I cannot
find anymore direct relation

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.020
with that tradition here.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.580
Now, whether the
vocal inflection

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.710
and melodic formula is going
into the Syriac chant or whether

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.650
that was the implication
that your question.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
Yeah, I don't know yet.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.260
I don't know.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.760
No. Okay, good.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.840
There's one chant,
there are some chants,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.770
from the Portuguese era

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.240
where you translate
Latin, chant into Syriac.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.510
One example is they
used local rhythm.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:14.390
[ Singing ]

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.170
So this has a local flavor.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.950
Especially the [inaudible].

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.450
One, two, three.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.750
Relaxing on one, three.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.050
And one, two, three.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.350
One, two, three, four.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.650
Seven beats into three units.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.510
Yeah. So that rhythm is
definitely local, and.

[ Singing ]

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.340
See the progression of notes.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.290
It's not much Middle Eastern.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.510
It is more that [inaudible].

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.010
[ Singing ]

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.810
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:37:50.810 --> 00:38:02.320
[ Singing ]

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.590
So that is probably local
flavor coming into Syriac text.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.100
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Interesting.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yeah.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.540
There are, now that you're
asking, there are other examples

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.510
that were composed in India.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:27.130
[ Singing ]

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.430
This is the credo.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.590
I believe in one God.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.210
So those melodies that
were created in Kerala,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.780
they used local idioms
for singing Syriac texts.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.990
But this is a topic of
a doctoral dissertation

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.830
for the next generation.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.220
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well, I
could go on, and I just,

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.460
we'll have to continue
this at some other time.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal: Yes.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.060
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What's
your next,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.360
where is your research
taking you now?

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Joseph Palackal:
The next step is I want

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:59.350
to create an album
of select chants

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.710
from the East Syriac tradition.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:06.270
And put it out there for the
world to critique or listen.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:07.570
That's one project.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.580
Then do much more recordings.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.230
And document as much
as possible,

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.630
as long as I have active years.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.330
I started late.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.020
But it was God's wish.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.410
So I hope, my sincere hope is
that someone will take up this

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.450
as a topic for doctoral
dissertation

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.320
and start where I ended.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.100
And it will go on.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.440
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well,
thank you so much

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.950

collaboration.

thank you for asking questions

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.880
on areas which I haven't
given much thought.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.240

which will be continued.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.960
