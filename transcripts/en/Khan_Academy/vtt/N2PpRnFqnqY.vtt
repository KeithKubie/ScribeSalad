00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:02.793
- [Instructor] You are likely
already familiar with the idea

00:00:02.793 --> 00:00:04.355
of a slope of a line.

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:07.667
If you're not, I encourage you
to review it on Khan Academy,

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.481
but all it is, it's
describing the rate of change

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.661
of a vertical variable

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:14.137
with respect to a horizontal variable,

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:17.324
so for example, here I
have our classic y axis

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.132
in the vertical direction and x axis

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:20.732
in the horizontal direction,

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:23.184
and if I wanted to figure
out the slope of this line,

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:24.876
I could pick two points,

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:27.496
say that point and that point.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:29.368
I could say, "Okay, from
this point to this point,

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:31.036
what is my change in x?"

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:34.868
Well, my change in x would be
this distance right over here,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.868
change in x,

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:39.162
the Greek letter delta,
this triangle here.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.858
It's just shorthand for
"change," so change in x,

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:46.687
and I could also
calculate the change in y,

00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:50.718
so this point going up to
that point, our change in y,

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:54.718
would be this, right over
here, our change in y,

00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.337
and then, we would define
slope, or we have defined slope

00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:03.143
as change in y over change in x,

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:06.444
so slope is equal to the rate of change

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:08.243
of our vertical variable

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.955
over the rate of change of
our horizontal variable,

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:14.038
sometimes described as rise over run,

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.765
and for any line, it's
associated with a slope

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:22.041
because it has a constant rate of change.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:24.632
If you took any two points on this line,

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:27.582
no matter how far apart or
no matter how close together,

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:29.073
anywhere they sit on the line,

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.216
if you were to do this calculation,

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.622
you would get the same slope.

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:36.057
That's what makes it a line,

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:37.086
but what's fascinating

00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:40.055
about calculus is we're
going to build the tools

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.152
so that we can think about
the rate of change not just

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.784
of a line, which we've
called "slope" in the past,

00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:47.637
we can think about the rate of change,

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:52.058
the instantaneous rate
of change of a curve,

00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:53.364
of something whose rate

00:01:53.364 --> 00:01:56.525
of change is possibly constantly changing.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:00.692
So for example, here's a curve
where the rate of change of y

00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:05.322
with respect to x is constantly changing,

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:08.228
even if we wanted to use
our traditional tools.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.490
If we said, "Okay, we can
calculate the average rate

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.686
of change," let's say between
this point and this point.

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:15.867
Well, what would it be?

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.224
Well, the average rate of
change between this point and

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:19.729
this point would be the slope of the line

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.189
that connects them,

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.131
so it would be the slope of
this line of the secant line,

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.378
but if we picked two different points,

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:28.535
we pick this point and this point,

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:29.428
the average rate of change

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.319
between those points all of a
sudden looks quite different.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.935
It looks like it has a higher slope.

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:38.424
So even when we take the
slopes between two points

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.761
on the line, the secant lines,

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.578
you can see that those
slopes are changing,

00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:45.435
but what if we wanted to ask ourselves

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:47.768
an even more interesting question.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:52.184
What is the instantaneous
rate of change at a point?

00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:55.941
So for example, how fast is y changing

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:58.584
with respect to x exactly at that point,

00:02:58.584 --> 00:03:01.711
exactly when x is equal to that value.

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:03.781
Let's call it x one.

00:03:03.781 --> 00:03:05.908
Well, one way you could think about it is

00:03:05.908 --> 00:03:09.389
what if we could draw a
tangent line to this point,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.405
a line that just touches
the graph right over there,

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.162
and we can calculate
the slope of that line?

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:19.069
Well, that should be the
rate of change at that point,

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.445
the instantaneous rate of change.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.645
So in this case,

00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:27.113
the tangent line might
look something like that.

00:03:27.113 --> 00:03:30.354
If we know the slope of this,

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:31.187
well then we could say that

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:34.512
that's the instantaneous
rate of change at that point.

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:37.601
Why do I say instantaneous rate of change?

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.204
Well, think about the
video on these sprinters,

00:03:40.204 --> 00:03:42.014
Usain Bolt example.

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:44.589
If we wanted to figure out
the speed of Usain Bolt

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.950
at a given instant, well maybe
this describes his position

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.776
with respect to time if y
was position and x is time.

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.547
Usually, you would see t as
time, but let's say x is time,

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:58.683
so then, if were talking
about right at this time,

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:02.129
we're talking about
the instantaneous rate,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.606
and this idea is the central
idea of differential calculus,

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:09.289
and it's known as a derivative,

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:13.017
the slope of the tangent line,
which you could also view

00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:15.603
as the instantaneous rate of change.

00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:17.043
I'm putting an exclamation mark

00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:20.160
because it's so
conceptually important here.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.368
So how can we denote a derivative?

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:26.240
One way is known as Leibniz's notation,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.713
and Leibniz is one of
the fathers of calculus

00:04:28.713 --> 00:04:30.371
along with Isaac Newton,

00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.078
and his notation, you
would denote the slope

00:04:33.078 --> 00:04:34.463
of the tangent line

00:04:34.463 --> 00:04:36.380
as equaling dy over dx.

00:04:39.993 --> 00:04:42.139
Now why do I like this notation?

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.375
Because it really comes
from this idea of a slope,

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.993
which is change in y over change in x.

00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:50.087
As you'll see in future videos,

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:51.558
one way to think about the slope

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.372
of the tangent line is, well,

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.722
let's calculate the slope of secant lines.

00:04:55.722 --> 00:04:57.839
Let's say between that
point and that point,

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.722
but then let's get even closer,

00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:00.011
say that point and that point,

00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:00.844
and then let's get even closer

00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:01.916
and that point and that point,

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:03.209
and then let's get even closer,

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:06.063
and let's see what happens as the change

00:05:06.063 --> 00:05:08.063
in x approaches zero,

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:12.124
and so using these d's instead of deltas,

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:14.004
this was Leibniz's way of saying,

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:16.590
"Hey, what happens if my changes

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.023
in, say, x become close to zero?"

00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:20.856
So this idea,

00:05:20.856 --> 00:05:23.280
this is known as sometimes
differential notation,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.908
Leibniz's notation, is
instead of just change

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:29.926
in y over change in x,
super small changes in y

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:32.630
for a super small change in x,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.213
especially as the change
in x approaches zero,

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:37.046
and as you will see,

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:39.679
that is how we will
calculate the derivative.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.366
Now, there's other notations.

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:46.533
If this curve is described
as y is equal to f of x.

00:05:47.694 --> 00:05:49.102
The slope of the tangent line

00:05:49.102 --> 00:05:51.066
at that point could be denoted

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:53.733
as equaling f prime of x one.

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:59.703
So this notation takes a little
bit of time getting used to,

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:01.429
the Lagrange notation.

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.068
It's saying f prime is
representing the derivative.

00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:07.815
It's telling us the
slope of the tangent line

00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:09.467
for a given point,

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:13.458
so if you input an x into
this function into f,

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.309
you're getting the corresponding y value.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.881
If you input an x into f prime,

00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.048
you're getting the slope of
the tangent line at that point.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.919
Now, another notation that
you'll see less likely

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.452
in a calculus class but you
might see in a physics class

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:35.173
is the notation y with a dot over it,

00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:38.719
so you could write this
is y with a dot over it,

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.835
which also denotes the derivative.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.053
You might also see y prime.

00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:46.261
This would be more common in a math class.

00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:49.489
Now as we march forward
in our calculus adventure,

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:52.940
we will build the tools to
actually calculate these things,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.538
and if you're already
familiar with limits,

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:56.462
they will be very useful,
as you could imagine,

00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:58.196
'cause we're really going
to be taking the limit

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:02.020
of our change in y over
change in x as our change

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.020
in x approaches zero,

00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:06.346
and we're not just going
to be able to figure it out

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:07.476
for a point.

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.730
We're going to be able to
figure out general equations

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.770
that described the derivative
for any given point,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.853
so be very, very excited.
