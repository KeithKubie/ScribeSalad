00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:03.618
- [Instructor] We are asked,
which of the following

00:00:03.618 --> 00:00:05.797
correctly identifies the areas of

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:08.663
consumer surplus, producer surplus,

00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:11.330
tax revenue, and deadweight loss

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.781
in this market after the tax?

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:17.650
So pause this video, have a go at it.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.916
Even if you struggle with it

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:20.803
it will make your brain more attuned

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:22.826
to when we work through it together.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:24.698
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:26.149
And I just want to sort of understand

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.631
what's going on here before I even try

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.790
to answer their questions.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.981
So let's first take a look

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:32.747
at what's going on before the tax.

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:35.011
So before the tax, I have

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.548
this supply curve

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:38.692
right over here in blue.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:40.582
And I have this demand curve.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.632
Where they intersect gives us our

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:44.319
equilibrium price.

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:45.997
Right over here.

00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:48.568
And our equilibrium quantity

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.605
right over there.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:52.853
And if we wanted to look at the

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.340
consumer surplus

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.913
it would be the area above

00:00:56.913 --> 00:00:58.609
this horizontal line.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.442
And, below

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:01.306
the demand curve.

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:04.343
So that is our original consumer surplus.

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:06.600
And our original producer surplus is above

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.810
the supply curve

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.957
and below this price horizontal line.

00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:13.589
And so, the total surplus would be

00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:15.509
this entire triangle

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.670
right over here.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.233
All before the tax.

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.986
But they're not asking us before the tax

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:21.916
they want us to figure out everything

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:23.222
after the tax.

00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:25.655
So what happens to the tax?

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.202
Well, if we assume it's

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:28.410
a tax on

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.561
each unit

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.462
that is being supplied.

00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:33.549
The effect it has, and we see it here,

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.568
they've drew it for us.

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.692
Is it shifts the
effective supply curve up.

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:39.307
And I say the effective one because

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.409
that's the one that's going to affect

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.405
the equilibrium price, or
the new equilibrium price.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.158
But as we'll see there's some nuances

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:49.619
in terms of considering the surplus.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.365
So first, let's think about the consumer.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.108
Well, actually let me label

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:54.716
the now price with the taxes.

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:56.988
So, this is now the R equilibrium price

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:58.315
where we have the taxes.

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:00.596
It's where our demand
curve hasn't shifted.

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:02.953
That's where the existing demand curve

00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:05.568
intersects with this new shifted

00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:08.015
supply with tax curve.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.753
And similarly, that point of intersection

00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:11.814
also tells us our quantity

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:13.164
with the taxes.

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:15.319
Now, now that we've understood everything,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.437
or hopefully we have,

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:18.563
let's think about the various surpluses

00:02:18.563 --> 00:02:20.306
and the deadly weight losses

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.828
and the tax revenues.

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:25.279
So first, let's think
about the consumer surplus.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.537
Well, the consumer surplus is going to be

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.428
the region above our new

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:30.838
horizontal price.

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:32.951
And below the demand curve.

00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:34.951
So that is this region R

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.059
right over here.

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.842
That still, you have this
consumer right over here

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:41.761
who was willing to pay a lot

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.205
but still has to pay less than that

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.224
even with the taxes.

00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:45.888
So they're getting this benefit

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:48.481
more than they would have needed

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:50.716
in order, it would have
been willing to pay more

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:52.317
than the tax, and so they're getting

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:53.402
this surplus.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.433
And so if you look at the
entire market right now

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.822
the total consumer surplus after the tax

00:02:57.822 --> 00:02:58.819
is R.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.199
R is equal to

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.391
consumer surplus.

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:02.875
And this is all after

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:03.910
the taxes.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.365
Consumer surplus.

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:08.535
Now, what about the producer surplus?

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:10.876
Well, if we weren't dealing with the tax

00:03:10.876 --> 00:03:12.887
we would just look above the supply curve

00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:15.875
and below this equilibrium
price line and say

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.320
hey, maybe it's that area.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.040
But remember what's happening from the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.232
producers point of view.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.127
The producer does not see

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:25.280
this new increased price at this quantity.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.219
The producer, remember,
they don't get to keep

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.340
the tax revenue.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.003
That, they have to give to the government.

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:31.087
So the producer

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:32.400
actually this is the price

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.663
that the producer sees.

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:34.942
So you can see this is

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.673
this is what

00:03:36.673 --> 00:03:37.840
what producers

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:41.355
what producers get

00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:42.890
after taxes.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.393
After

00:03:44.393 --> 00:03:46.305
taxes, or I say net of taxes.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:47.572
May be a better way

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:48.578
to think about it.

00:03:48.578 --> 00:03:49.696
Net

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.069
of taxes.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.319
And so the producer surplus

00:03:54.914 --> 00:03:57.358
is going to be the area

00:03:57.358 --> 00:03:59.413
below what they're getting

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:01.207
from the market, net of taxes.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.291
And above

00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.320
what they

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.716
the price is at which

00:04:04.716 --> 00:04:06.488
they were willing to
produce various quantities.

00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:08.245
And so the producer surplus is

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:09.789
this area of V over here.

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.471
So, V is equal to the producer.

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:13.956
Producer

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:15.012
surplus.

00:04:15.012 --> 00:04:17.018
And now, what about

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:18.412
the tax revenue?

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:21.693
Well, the tax revenue is, is essentially

00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:23.897
going to be all of this other part

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:24.919
of the total surplus.

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.077
This is what goes to the government.

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:29.108
The difference between these two.

00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:30.441
If the producers

00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:33.514
did not have to give that
tax to the government

00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:35.806
then they wouldn't have been
able to keep all of this.

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:37.079
But this, right over here.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.834
Let me do this in a different color.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:41.385
So this region, right over here,

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:45.323
is what the government is able to keep.

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:46.869
Notice, it's this quantity

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.457
and they get this much
tax per unit quantity.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.884
And so this area

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:55.662
is the government, is the
revenue to the government.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.662
So, S plus U is equal to

00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:00.388
tax revenue.

00:05:00.388 --> 00:05:01.391
Tax

00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.541
revenue.

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:04.292
And then last but not least,

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:06.985
what about the deadweight loss?

00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:08.895
Well remember, the deadweight loss

00:05:08.895 --> 00:05:11.505
is the difference between the original

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:12.835
the total surplus.

00:05:12.835 --> 00:05:15.393
When we just let things
naturally go to equilibrium.

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:16.811
The difference between that

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:18.784
and now our new total surplus,

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.228
which is now lower because

00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:21.576
we have not allowed the market

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:23.361
to function in a very natural way

00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:25.099
because of this tax on it.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.557
Well, as we said before,

00:05:26.557 --> 00:05:27.897
the original total surplus was

00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:29.472
this entire triangle.

00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:31.812
Now the total surplus is this trapezoid

00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:34.019
that's the sum of all of these areas.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:35.452
And so what we lost

00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.522
is this area right over here.

00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:39.833
So that is the deadweight loss.

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:40.750
So T plus W

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:43.236
is equal to the

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:44.569
deadweight loss.

00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:46.600
And we're done.
