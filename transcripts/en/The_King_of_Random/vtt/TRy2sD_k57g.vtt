00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
A couple years ago,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.280
I was surfing around the internet

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.820
and I came across a cool article

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.220
about a small company in Russia

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.780
who would recycle 2-liter plastic bottles

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.400
and turn them into brooms.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.480
Crazy idea, right?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.320
They take the plastic bottles and set them up into a machine

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.880
that they've created that extracts small thin strips of plastic rope

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.520
which then they can bundle up and turn them into heads of brooms

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.360
This blew my mind, and ever since then I've wanted to try it for myself

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.900
Now over the years I've seen a lot of different tutorials pop up and a lot of different inventions made

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.700
on how to do this very thing.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.820
The problem is, the cost of the equipment materials range anywhere from about $5 to $30.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.080
The purpose of this video today is to see if we can make plastic soda bottle string at home

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.880
By making a simple little device that costs absolutely nothing to make.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.520
Now the only tools you're going to need to make this work are some kind of a knife, a block of wood, and a saw.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.820
Now the only reason you're using the saw is to cut the block of wood.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.520
If you have some kind of a knife like this with the serrated teeth, you might be able to get with just the knife and the wood itself.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.460
You can also make this work with just a basic kitchen knife and I'll put that to the test later on.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.760
Now to make device today, I'm using a block of two-by-two that I cut 5 inches long.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.380
You dont have to use the same thing.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.740
You can get away with a thicker tree branch or any other kind of wood as well.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.200
Now since I have a bench-vice, I am going to use that, but that isn't required.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.680
In any case, this is how it works.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.340
Go ahead and clam your piece of wood an inch from the top is showing, and we're going to cut this with the grain.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.480
You can look down at the top of your piece of wood and see which ways the lines are running

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.340
We're going to be cutting with those lines.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.180
With our block in place we can begin cutting, so grab your saw and start cutting exactly down the middle until we make a cut one inch deep.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.940
Once the saw is bottomed out at one inch, we can turn the blade around and cut horizontally until it cuts half way through the block from the front side

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.760
Now, all that's left to do is take your knife blade or something like a chisel and position it half way down the right side of the block and give it a little tap

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.880
This will knock the little wedge out of the bottom-right corner and as easy as that, our machine is pretty much ready for use.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.720
The only thing left to do now is add the blade.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.680
Now with this system, you can make a thickness of rope just about as wide as you want, but I want mine to be on the thinner side, so I'm using the but end of an 8 inch drill bit as a guide.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.280
Place your spacer down into the corner of the block and then take the tip of your knife and push it into the corner as well.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.080
Now move your fingers out of the way and apply a little pressure to the tip of the knife until it sinks into the wood.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.760
Once the tip of your blade is in about half an inch, push the rest of your blade into the side piece of wood until it grabs on and holds firmly in place.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.640
So, update guys.  Our simple machine is finished and its completely ready to start making plastic string.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.360
and now there's just one small modification we need to make to these bottles before they're ready to run through it.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.500
Now if you look down here at the bottom of the bottles, you'll see this little ridge line that you can use as a guide for cutting it off.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.520
We want to make the smoothest, cleanest cut possible because that will give the most plastic string we can get.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.220
Bonus hack: we get a little plastic bowl out of it.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.180
Now if you feel like you did a bit of hack job with the end of your bottle, dont feel bad, you can easily clean it up with a pair of scissors.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.560
Alright guys, the moment of truth.  We've got our bottle prepped and ready.  We've got our machine standing by and all we have to do now is take the bottom edge of our bottle, feed it through the gap in the wood,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.540
and help it make one full rotation.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.480
Perfect.  Now its ready.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.300
So, I've helped the bottle do one full rotation.  What's that done is cleaned up any jagged edges on the bottom, and you can so how on the back here, we've got a piece of string sticking out now,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.080
And if we give this thing a tug, we can see the bottle start spinning, giving us loads of extremely strong plastic string.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.520
So you can see now its as easy as tugging on this string and the whole bottle unwinds and gives us a nice bundle of strong, plastic rope.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.020
This is really about as thin as you can get this stuff. If you go any thinner, its going to start breaking on you.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.900
But that is really thin.  I'm loving it.  You can use that for fishing line.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.420
Now just for convenience, I turned this thing over sideways because it relieves the pressure on the bottle so its not rubbing up on the knife.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.300
It also allows me to grab the string and pull it out at a more comfortable angle so I can do this all day.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.260
Pretty sweet isn't it?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.580
It just keeps going, and going, and going.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.020
Now you might be wondering what kind of uses there are for plastic string, and the answer is probably as many uses as there are for normal string.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.040
You can use it as improvised fishing line, you can use to rig a snare or hold up your tent when you're out in the woods.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.340
or if you're using something like my rope-making machine, you might be able to wind it into an actual length of rope.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.540
Now there really are so many ways that you can approach this guys.  You can use kitchen knives, you can use hunting knives, you can use wooding knives.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.560
You can even use razor blades out of your utility knife and shove that up in there as well.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.420
As for as the thickness of the rope goes, your can make anything, almost as thin as fishing line, to about as thick of any cable as you'd want to make.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.900
And for as thin as this chord is, it really is pretty strong stuff.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.820
Of course you can break it.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.260
But the thicker you go.....

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.220
The much more difficult it is to break.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.540
That's as hard as I could do it.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.200
So would you look at that.  Our home made machine that costs absolutely nothing to make is working and its working very well.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.300
So lets move on to all these plastic bottles and try and transform them into string.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.260
Sweet!

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.160
If you run your string in a line across the room, it'll help relieve the tension, and if you wind it around a water bottle, it'll organize it into a neat little bundle.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.520
So update guys.  We recycled 12 two liter bottles and made nearly twelve hundred feet of plastic string.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.520
We did measure our results and found that one two liter bottle makes nearly 100 feet of 8th inch plastic string by itself.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.320
So it looks like this idea works guys, and it works great.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.740
Using nothing but extremely simple materials you can probably find in the woods and definitely around your house.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.100
You can turn your old two liter bottle into a piece of plastic cordage.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.020
And I have to give credit where credit's due.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.360
The simplicity of this project came from an idea I got from Creek Stewart in his book "Survival Hacks".

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.720
And I'll put an Amazon link to that down in the description.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.620
And as always, thanks for joining for this project.  I'll be looking for you in the next one.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620
Talk to you then.
