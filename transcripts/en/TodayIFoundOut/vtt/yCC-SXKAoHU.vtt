00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.939
In the video today, we're looking at whether
anyone has actually ever poisoned or put razor

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.350
blades or needles into Halloween candy.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.039
Remember your mom sorting through your Halloween
candy as a kid, looking for signs of ‘tainted’

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.220
candy laced with poison, needles or razor
blades?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.470
It turns out, unless she was just using it
as an excuse to steal the good candy before

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.960
you got it, she was wasting her time.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.710
You are more likely to get attacked by a samurai
sword wielding bear while trick or treating

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.329
than be poisoned by a stranger.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.210
Further, it's more likely that your Halloween
candy will be poisoned or otherwise tampered

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.700
with by one of your parents or family members
than a stranger.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.470
Think about that while your mom is "checking
out" your candy before letting you eat it.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.810
So why all the worry?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.719
Because the news media needs something to
talk about and there's nothing better for

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.920
ratings than saying something like "Is your
child's Halloween candy poisoned?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.570
Find out the deadly truth at 11!"

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.840
Further, while many children die directly
after Halloween from non-candy related things

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.710
(after all, people die every day), if there
isn't an apparent cause the week following

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.080
Halloween, many-a-sensationalized story gets
widely publicized with poisoned Halloween

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.770
candy generally being blamed.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.430
(There are numerous instances of this happening.)

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.510
This isn't all bad in theory.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.040
I mean, if there is even a chance that some
child's death was poisoned-candy related,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
the police (rightly) encourage the news media
to tell parents in the area to get rid of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
their children's Halloween candy because it
might be poisoned.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.540
But when it turns out the death had nothing
to do with Halloween candy, most media outlets

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.130
tend to have moved on from Halloween stories,
so either don't report a retraction or don't

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.060
make it the headline like when they claimed
the death was from candy.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.300
Thus, the perception that poisoned Halloween
candy is a rampant problem embeds itself in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.450
the popular psyche, going all the way back
to at least 1970 when the New York Times reported

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.640
"Halloween goodies that children collect this
weekend... may bring them more horror than

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
happiness," which proceeded to tell parents
all about how the candy could potentially

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.150
be tampered with, even though there had never
been an instance of this actually happening

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.150
at the time.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.350
So what about more recently?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
According to the author of Halloween Sadism:
The Evidence, professor of sociology Joel

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.560
Best from the University of Delaware who's
been studying this since 1985, he hasn't yet

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.360
been able to find one single instance of a
child dying as a result of candy given them

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.980
by a stranger on Halloween.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840
Certainly, such reports pop up every now and
again (since 1958, he's found about 78 such

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.140
instances, including being connected to 5
deaths), but they were all debunked once the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.100
matter was investigated by police in each
case, and most of them were simple hoaxes.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.670
For instance, one child, Best says, "brought
a half-eaten candy bar to his parents and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.110
said, 'I think there's ant poison on this.'

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.180
They had it checked and, sure enough, there
was ant poison on it.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.860
Of course, the youngster had applied the poison
himself."

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.690
If you were paying close attention, you perhaps
notice I said "dying as a result of candy

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.510
given them by a stranger".

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.880
It has happened once before that someone poisoned
candy and gave it out to children with one

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880
child dying.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.650
In 1974, eight-year-old Timothy O’Bryan
of Texas died after eating a Pixy Stix laced

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.650
with cyanide after trick-or-treating.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.490
Clearly trick or treating is unsafe now, right?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240
I mean, he trick or treated, then died from
candy someone gave him.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
Case closed.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.670
Except, it wasn't candy a stranger gave him.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.000
O'Bryan's dad, Ronald, was trying to kill
his kids, so put the cyanide laced candy in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.190
their bags.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.190
The senior O’Bryan was about $100K in debt
and close to having his car repossessed.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.190
His solution?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.819
Suddenly take out about $60,000 worth of life
insurance policies on his two children, then

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.700
given them both the poison candy to try to
collect on the policies.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
What could go wrong?

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.700
I mean, there's nothing at all suspicious
there...

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.900
Needless to say, the police had him as prime
suspect number one as soon as they learned

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.310
these details.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.240
After the investigation and trial, the dad
was convicted of murdering his son.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.170
His daughter survived the ordeal thanks to
the fact that she simply didn't eat hers.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.920
Timothy wasn't so lucky as Ronald had made
sure he ate the tainted candy just before

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.320
tucking him into bed.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.760
But this wasn't quite the end of it.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.959
In order to divert suspicion from himself,
O'Bryan had also slipped the poisoned candy

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.920
in a few other children's Halloween bags without
them knowing.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.470
(It's thought four others received the poisoned
Pixie Stix), presumably hoping that if several

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.240
children died, it wouldn't look nearly as
fishy.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.190
Like his daughter, the other children also
didn't eat their Pixy Stix.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.580
Upon investigation, none of the kids could
remember any place they went giving out Pixie

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.760
Stix, but did have contact with O'Bryan, so
the evidence further pointed to him being

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.040
the poisoner.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.680
Needless to say, being a resident of Texas,
where the state policy for any extreme crime

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.530
is essentially, "Kill 'em all and let God
sort 'em out", despite the fact that all the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.250
evidence against him was circumstantial- though
very compelling- O'Bryan was executed a decade

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.460
later via lethal injection: the poisoner was
poisoned.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.460
While not the outcome he’d originally hoped
for, I guess he did at least get out of having

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.460
to pay off his debts…

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.370
Before O’Bryan’s tragic Halloween exploits,
in 1970, there was a case of a family that

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.430
tampered with candy after a child died, to
cover for a family member.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.480
The 5-year-old in question was a Detroit boy
who ate a large amount of heroin his uncle

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
had hidden.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.389
The boy died four days later.

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.100
The media at the time, of course, reported
it was a case of Halloween candy poisoning.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.060
In the media's defense, in an attempt to divert
attention away from the uncle, the family

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.160
had sprinkled some heroin on some of the child's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.300
Halloween candy and claimed that's how the
boy wound up ingesting the drug.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.490
Upon investigation, the truth came out.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.640
As far as other illegal substances go, in
2000, kids in a San Francisco neighborhood

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.800
got a trick mixed in with their treats when
they found Snickers candy bar wrappers stuffed

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.200
with marijuana.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.790
Needless to say, depending on their age, I'm
guessing some of the kids weren't too upset

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.790
about this.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.790
;-)

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.790
But was this intentional?

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.130
Police traced the pot to a homeowner who was
confounded by the accusations.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.230
It turns out the man worked in the “dead
letter office” at a local postal facility,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.620
and when he found a bag of Snickers in a lost
package, he brought them home to give out

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.620
as treats.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.580
He hadn’t realized that someone had gone
to a lot of trouble to put pot in the packages

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.030
and reseal them in an attempt at smuggling
pot through the mail.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.020
So as far as the actual non-hoax instances
of poisoned candy given out on Halloween,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.120
that mostly sums it up.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.580
We have one instance of someone actually doing
this, though mostly just trying to kill his

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.480
own kids and the other kids not actually getting
the poison from trick or treating, but via

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.750
the man slipping it into their bags without
them noticing; one accidental giveaway of

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.740
some pot; and one kid who simply ate a stash
of his uncle's heroin.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.850
So that's poisoning.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.620
What about razors and needles?

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.330
There are verified reports of sharp objects
being placed in random trick-or-treaters’

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.990
candy, although these incidents are exceptionally
rare (under 100, even including the hoaxes

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.990
and pranks).

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.139
In nearly all of these cases, the sharp objects
were found to have been placed in the food

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.290
item by a relative or friend, usually as a
prank.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.610
From the poisoning and this, it would appear
kids should be fearing what their families

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.130
and friends are doing to their candy more
than strangers on Halloween.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.130
;-)

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.590
In fact, despite the fact that this has been
reported as a widespread problem since the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.340
late 1960s, the first known confirmed case
of a person intentionally giving out candy

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.850
with sharp objects embedded to random children
didn't happen until the year 2000.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.640
49 year old James Joseph Smith did stick needles
into Snickers candy bars as a prank and give

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.790
them out to kids.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.560
While several children bit into the candy,
the only injury was to a teenager who was

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.610
pricked by one of the needles, but did not
require any medical attention.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.490
Smith was charged with "adulterating a substance
with intent to cause death, harm or illness".

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.120
In another non-family related poking- in 2008,
candy from a Florida dollar store was found

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.480
to have metal shavings and metal blades embedded
in it.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.130
An investigation revealed that the candy (Pokémon
Valentine's Day lollipops) was manufactured

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.250
in China and the foreign objects are believed
to have gotten into the candy at the factory

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.260
accidentally.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.460
So while the instances of both the poisoning
and embedded needles are not zero, they are

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.290
virtually zero when you consider the many
millions of kids that have trick or treated

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.120
since the early 20th century.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.009
So- faith in humanity restored.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.690
In the end, there has only been one death
as a result of either of these things and

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.590
a stranger wasn't involved.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.000
On the flip-side, statistically- and not surprisingly-
children are four times more likely to be

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.919
struck by a car on Halloween than any other
day of the year.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:45.180
Yet another instance where we humans tend
to obsessively worry about extremely unlikely

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.919
things, while conveniently ignoring the fact
that for most of us the most dangerous thing

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.229
we do in our lives, we do just about every
day without worrying about it at all- ride

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.400
in automobiles or on bikes and cross or walk
along streets on foot.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
Bonus Fact:

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.000
While your children's Halloween candy probably
doesn't contain poison, the apples you likely

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.280
have in your kitchen do.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:20.800
You see, apple seeds contain cyanide.
