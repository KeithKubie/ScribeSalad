00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.210
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: Welcome, my name
is Ryan Moore, I'm a specialist

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.740
in the Geography and Map Division.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.000
And today's event is sponsored by
the Philip Lee Phillips Map Society

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.710
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.300
The Map Society was
established in 1995 to enhance

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.000
and promote the collections of
the Geography and Map Division.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.190
Thank you.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.210
The society is free to join, but
donations are greatly appreciated.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.060
Donations are used to help purchase
rare maps, sponsor publications

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.400
and lectures like today's event.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350
In May we're going to have an event
on the 13th here at the Library

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.650
of Congress, 300 Years of Map in
Cuba by Professor Perez Hernandez

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.100
who lived in Cuba and he has
lectured at places such as Harvard

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.990
on the topic of Cuban history
and Cuban architecture.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.220
It should be a very
interesting event.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.850
Presently, the society has
published its latest journal known

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.600
as the Occasional Papers, they're
free to pick up in the back.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.510
It looks like this if you can see
through all the bright lights.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.500
It's by Louis De Vorsey, it's
on the history of a Gulfstream

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.110
and the thesis of this work is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.650
that Benjamin Franklin
was credited too hastily

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.660
with discovering the Gulfstream.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.070
And there was another scientist
who actually preceded him

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.650
in the discovery of that.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.000
Very interesting work, please
pick one up it's in the back.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.690
So before we begin with talking
about crowd source mapping Curtis

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.490
and I had a little
conversation and we wanted

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.830
to establish some historical and
cultural context for this event.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.520
Why is it relevant to
crowd source North Korea.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000
Why should that happen, what is
important about that practice?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.140
So what I want to do is highlight
a few things concerning the history

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.820
and culture of the Korean
Peninsula in North Korea.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:02.580 position:56%
So premodern Korea had
isolationist policies often referred

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.980
to as the hermit kingdom and that
phrase actually has been attached

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.790
to North Korea today.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.670 position:56%
The Peninsula itself was a singular
entity until the end of World War 2.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.580
The Japanese through establishing
treaties, a protectorate

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.890
and then formally annexing
Korea from 1910

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.110
to 1945 were present
on the peninsula.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.700
At the end of World War
2 they were forced out.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.610
We see the beginnings
of the Cold War.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.030
The Soviet Union occupied the
northern half of the country,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.180
American forces were
stationed in the South.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.770
Both sides and this was along,
roughly along the 30th parallel

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.990
where the country is divided today.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.970
Both sides talked about
reunification, they couldn't agree

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.670
on a system of government.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:12.060
In 1949, the US and the
USSR withdraw their forces,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.430
North Korea is arming heavily

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.020
at this time receiving
state-of-the-art technology

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.600
from the Soviet Union.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.120
South Korea is not
receiving much in the way

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.290
of weapons from the United States.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:37.740
In 1950 in June, North Korea
launches a blitzkrieg attack

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.530
into the south and nearly
overruns the country.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:51.150
The last line of defense is in
[inaudible] the United Nations led

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.850
by the United States and
Great Britain come to the aid

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.070
of South Korea and turn
the situation around.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.320
They actually roll back the North
Koreans across the 38th parallel

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.080
and as they close on the Alou
River, the Chinese border,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.450
the People's Republic
of China enters the war.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.750
And we have then a situation of
stalemates along the 38th parallel.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.610
Finally, a cease-fire
is signed, however,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.350
there is no formal
peace treaty in place.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.940
The countries are technically
still at war.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.390
And we see here a map by the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.770
of the DMZ created in 1969.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.660
This is part of the
geography and map collection.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.020
Koreans call this Hu Jun sun, the
cease-fire line and it stretches

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.470
across the entire peninsula
150 miles.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.320
And everywhere along this line

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:16.900
on both sides are military
installations, artillery, tanks.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.030 position:56%
They call it the demilitarized zone,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.770
probably the biggest misnomer
you can apply to the situation.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.380
It is one of the most
militarized places on earth.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:41.310
And if you see the waters to the
left those areas are in dispute

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.250
between the two countries and
there has been live shooting,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:53.090
people have died in contesting
where the northern limit is

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.910
of those waters, where
the southern limit is

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.450
of those waters, has
a right to be there.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.480
I would like to touch a little bit

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.210
about North Korean
geography and place names.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.970
The North Koreans in sort of
every day common language refer

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.900
to themselves as Choson
referring to the Choson dynasty.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.780 position:56%
They see South Korea as an extension

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.280
of their country they call it
Nam Choson, Nam meaning south.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.580
Mind you, South Korea also
has their own place names.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.180
The common name of Korea Hangul.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.090
You're referring to North
Korea as an extension

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.970
of their country Phuket
Kong, Phuket meaning north.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.710
So you would often hear about in
Korean news Nam Phuket relations,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.210
so north and south.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:01.010
The capital city of
North Korea, Pyongyang.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.230
North Korea shares
borders with China,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.220
Russia and also South
Korea along the DMZ.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.530
It's a larger country than
its neighbor in the south,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.940
neighbor is maybe not
the right word,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.080
but they're brothers,
it's a house divided.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.780
The climate of North Korea is hot,
humid summers, very cold winters.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.240 position:56%
Most of the land is very mountainous
and I'm going to illustrate

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.620
that with some maps
from the division.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.280
Numerous deep, narrow valleys,
most of the people live

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.460
in valleys on the coastal plains.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.160
And despite this massive area
of real estate only some 18%

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:54.760
of that land is arable and
you'll see why with this map.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.740
This map was drawn in 1944

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.820
by a cartographer named
Richard Eades Harrison.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.480
He worked for Fortune
Magazine, Time Life Magazine.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.180
He came into popularity
because he presented cartography

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.480
from a different perspective.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.570
He said why do we always
show the map top-down,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.330
show the map that highlights
the information

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.080
that you want the viewer to see.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.380
So in this map if you look

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.220
at the Korean peninsula you can see
how absolutely mountainous it is,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.520
in particular North Korea.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.670
And then you see the coastal
plains where Pyongyang sits.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:40.000
And that's where the farming, the
breadbasket of North Korea lies.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.740
Important to understanding
some of psychology and thinking

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.680
of North Korea, as
well as appreciating

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.950
that of South Korea was
the Japanese occupation.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.980
They call it the Iljay
Shide [assumed spelling],

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.660
the time of the Japanese Empire.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.920
Here we have a map of Pyongyang
made by the Japanese in 1921.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.590
And as you can see, the name
Pyongyang does not appear

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.910
on the map.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:25.080
This is the idea of
cultural erasure,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.380
colonialism where the Japanese
have appropriated the place

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.370
and the name of the place.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:40.670
And in the pictures that ring this
map, it's a tourist map by the way,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:47.340
in the bottom corner you see a
Mitsubishi factory the Japanese are

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.740
highlighting that we've
modernized the city,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.110
we are bringing industry
to this peninsula.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.380
And as you look through the
pictures you see a Buddhist temple,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.990
an old Korean ship.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.200
So they're saying well this is the
old way we're the new way and we're

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.740
in harmony with all these
lovely flowers ringing,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.830
winding through the photographs.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:20.750
And there is resentment in
North Korea and South Korea

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.920
to this day about this time period.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.230
This is a map made by the
North Koreans themselves

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.730
and I chose it precisely because
it has the sort of the same the map

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.800 position:56%
of the city ringed by illustrations.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.650
This was created for the 13th
international youth festival held

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.360
in 1989.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.130
This map was actually produced a
year before that in preparation.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.400
The North Korean government spared
no expense spending a fourth

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.580
of their budget, millions
of dollars,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.490
to put on a big international show.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:05.770
And now we see in the top left
corner there they're highlighting

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.350
their strength as a nation, their
Juche Tower, something I'll talk

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.700
about a little bit later.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.750
And in the lower right-hand corner
their metro system, which they tout

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.860
as one of the best in the world
and anyone who visits Pyongyang

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.970
and I have not they take
them to these metro centers

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.990
that are very ornate stations
with murals on the walls

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.430 position:56%
and they're very ornately decorated.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:37.220
In this map as well like the
other is available to view

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.710
and be researched here at
the Library of Congress.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:49.920
The North Korean government is a
hereditary dictatorship supported

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.520
by a single party.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.920
The Kim family, the Kim
Dynasty has absolute power.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:05.560
These titles here in quotes
these are things required

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.240
of the North Korean people to say

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.650
when they reference
one of these leaders.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:17.110 position:56%
It is an extreme insult and
probably trouble with the government

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.750
to address one of these
leaders without the title.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.000
The eternal president, the
eternal general, the marshal.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:40.700
Incidentally, Kim Il-sung
was a partisan fighter

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:49.340
against the Japanese known for
extreme brutality in his tactics

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.850
against the Japanese

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.820
and the Japanese themselves were
a very fierce opponent in war.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:04.780
And he idolized Joseph Stalin
in many ways and thought

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:10.470
to model North Korea
off the Soviet Union,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.340
but with his own personal spin.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.740
And that's what we're
talking about here Juche,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.210
this concept of self-reliance.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.330
This ideology is very hard

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.970
to explain what I'm telling you
here is a very distilled simplified

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.460
version, but it's a
mixture of communism,

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.160
nationalism and Confucianism.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.350
The leadership holds a place that's
nearly religious in the country.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:54.690
And they are governing
24.7 million people,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.320
in the South 48.9 million people.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.060
They have a greater area in
the north, smaller population.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:10.820 position:56%
They tout the fact that they provide
healthcare, education, housing,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:17.170
food, etcetera for their
population with a caveat.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:25.620
The quality of life depends
on a person's loyalty ranking.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:31.290 position:56%
North Korea begins a file on anyone
over the age of 17 you're classified

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.670
as loyal to the regime,
wavering to the regime

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.710
or on the outs with the regime.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.110
And if you're on the outs with the
regime almost three generations it

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.330
takes to be rehabilitated to
be brought back into the fold.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.750
So if someone commits an
offense they, their children

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.880
and their children's
children are ostracized.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.000
And this is a political
cast system known

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.800
as sung-boon meaning constituents.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:10.150
And as we know, for many defectors
North Korea there's limited civil

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:15.770
liberties, state-controlled
press and internet.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.640
There is restrictions on
travel to and from North Korea.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.680
Our guests, Mr. Melvin, he
can't visit North Korean

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.030
as you can imagine he's revealing
too much information about them.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:36.280
A great tragedy is happening in
North Korea is chronic shortages

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.970
of food, energy and medicine.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:46.360
And this coincides with
the end of the Soviet Union

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.740
who are bankrolling the
North Koreans in many ways

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.610
like they were bankrolling the
Cubans and the East Germans

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.920
and all these other countries.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.010
This cash flow has stopped.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:02.580
And the North Korean priorities,
which I'll get to in a minute,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.860
are military not treating
their people.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.020
And so they're relying on foreign
aid and has gone back and forth

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.260 position:56%
where the United Nations, the United
States, South Korea is sending food

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.080
and medicine to them and
they're turning around

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.270 position:56%
and they're still arming themselves.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:30.690
And that has to do with this
second ideology of North Korea.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:36.670
Sun-goon army first, sun from the
Chinese character primary first,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.700
goon as Yuk goon army, military.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.420
It's like a modern day Sparta.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.040
They have the world's
fourth largest military

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.610 position:56%
and while they have dated technology

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:56.170
in the right hands
it's very lethal stuff.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.950
And most of their equipment would
have been considered modern during

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:05.570
the Vietnam era, that's the highest
level of technology they have

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:11.560
in terms of fighters and
tanks dating back to the 70's.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.920
Why does it stop there because the
Russians are no longer sending them

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.800
the latest stuff?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.360
And this we'll get to our last
point here before we bring

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.910 position:56%
up Mr. Melvin about nuclear weapons.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.410
They're spending an
outrageously high amount

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:32.100
of money on defense 8.2 billion.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:41.150
They have an active military
of 1.1 million people.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:48.010
Ten years of mandatory
service in the military,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.920
it's an incredibly long period
of time to have the young men

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.780
of your nation to committed
to military service instead

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.080
of developing their minds

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.570
and developing the
economy of the nation.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:10.410
They are preoccupied with training
for war and they use incidentally

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.460
for pet projects of
the regime to build,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.710
to act as construction workers,
to help in harvest time.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:25.380 position:56%
And their special forces, which is
numbers around some 200,000 soldiers

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.650
and I don't want to say men
because women are under arms

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.600
in North Korea too, it's
15 years of service.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.280
That's an incredibly long
period of time as well.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:47.630
This contrasts with South Korea
some 655,000 soldiers and depending

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.110
on the branch of service
22 to 24 months.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:59.130
There's two different
mentalities towards defense

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.790
and defense preparation
as you can see.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.550
Total militarized population

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:11.310
of North Korea is an
astounding 7.6 million people.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:17.430
You remember we said there's
24 some million people living

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.730
in North Korea.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.450
Close to a third of their
people are under arms.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:32.350
The capital of South Korea Seoul
is in a precarious position,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:41.090
it's not far some 30 some miles
from the DMZ and it is in range

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.330
of North Korean artillery.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.760
It's projected that there's
some 13,000 artillery pieces

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.060
in that sector of the DMZ that are
ready to shoot should a war begin.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:01.560
And let me tell you Seoul is
a beautiful massive sprawling

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.230
metropolis and if you have a chance

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.480
to go there I encourage
you to do so.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.880
But like any big city,
especially Seoul is divided

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.470
by a river, the Han River.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:20.000
Traffic is a nightmare and should
an emergency happen it would be

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.160
absolute pandemonium and panic
should the North Koreans start

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.460
shooting on Seoul.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:33.340
Korea, North Korea also has
chemical and nuclear weapons

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.170
and they are developing
a long-range missile

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.510
if you've been watching the news.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.140
That they are keen on being able

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:48.090
to shoot the West Coast
of the United States.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:56.190
They are pushing an envelope
and it's a game of chess

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.510
and Russian roulette
at the same time.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:04.290
The resolution of that I
don't know I can't predict,

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:10.040
but with the way things are going
it can't continue this way I'm

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.430
sure this.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:17.020
And this is my last point
before we bring up our guest.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.630
Is that we also have to talk about
people when we talk about politics

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.010
and maps because that's
what this is all about

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.410
and how this stuff impacts
the lives of everyday people.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:37.100
There's this concept on the
Korean peninsula of isan gajog,

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.890
the separated families who
were divided by the Korean War.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.910 position:56%
The Korean War as I briefly
mentioned earlier, had a lot of push

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.510
and pull back across the peninsula.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:54.030
Brothers and sisters, husband
and wife, families were separated

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.270
because of this and they never
saw one another again often.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:03.580
We were talking about from the
war civilian deaths some 5 million

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.940
people killed, wounded
or missing and more

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.930
than half of them are civilians.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:15.160
And it left some 10 million people
separated from their families,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.290
that's a huge amount of their
population that is divided

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.720
by this experience and it
cuts very deep in their soul.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.040
They talk about the wounding
or the scarring of the soul,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.460
sung cho [assumed spelling] and the
resentment that follows that, Han,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.850
different Han from Han
Guk, Han Guk means Koreas.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.830
Han here means anger,
hate, resentment.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:44.360
The South Korean government
stepped up in the 80's to try

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.050
to reunite people both
in South Korea,

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.530
those living abroad
and with North Korea.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:56.330
And the sad fact is that with the
attempt to reunite families North

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:02.600
and South they often are only given
three days with people who are

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.310
at the very end of their life.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:09.690
Go see your sister in North
Korea it's okay for three days

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.330
and haven't seen each
other in so long.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:20.500
And there was a very famous
song in Korea that symbolizes

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.520
or typifies the feelings that
people have for not seeing

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.420
in one another since
childhood perhaps.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.780
Patty Kim is a very
famous Korean singer

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.620
and she has this lyric
here [foreign language],

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.140
don't you know this person, you
haven't seen them your whole life

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.890
and you're looking at somebody.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:48.590
It's very tragic and it's why
this crowdsourcing work is very

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.650
important, we want to open
the doors and know more.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.840
And hopefully that can
affect positive policy.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.830
And so I say here, you know,
North Korea [foreign language],

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.520
this country I don't
know, none of us know,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:14.130
we're trying to understand better,
we're trying to see what is inside

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.950
to effect and change
things for the better.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.250
And with that being said,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:24.950
I would like to bring
up our guest Mr. Melvin.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:29.290
He is a researcher at
the US Korean Institute,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.710
excuse me John Hopkins University.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:37.170
He is a contributor to the
website 38 North and editor

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.120
of the blog North Korean
Economy Watch.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.720
He's been studying and writing
about North Korea since 2006

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.590
and he actually visited there as
I mentioned and has been banned

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.810
for the next point being a creator
of the North Korea Uncovered

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:01.630
in DPRK Digital Atlas, which
he'll be addressing today.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.610
He received his master's degree
in economics from George Mason

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.250 position:56%
and a bachelor's degree in economics
from the University of Georgia.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.510
Please welcome Mr. Melvin.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:21.180
[ Applause ]

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.420
&gt;&gt; Curtis Melvin: Good afternoon
everyone, thanks for coming out.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.180
My name's Curtis Melvin.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.210
As was mentioned, I'm a researcher

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.160
at the US Korean Institute
at Johns Hopkins.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.670
This talk is a little different
than the one I normally do.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:38.490
Normally, I'm asked to talk about
what satellite imagery shows us

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.590
about North Korea's
changing economic landscape.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:47.090
But today I'm focusing more
on actual mapping issues.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:53.000
So it was fun to put this project
together and share some of the kind

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.690
of nerdy mapping issues
that I deal with at home

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.990
that nobody really
gets to address much.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.020
I started this project

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.070
after visiting North
Korea in 2004 and 2005.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:14.550
This is me, a younger,
skinnier single version of me

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.760
in Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.680
The country has changed
tremendously since then.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.730
But anyway when I visited at this
time I didn't know any Korean

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.240
and a lot of map information

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.170
on the country was very
difficult to come by.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.430
So I would visit places and
not have any idea where I was.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.380
And this was one of the first
things I tried to address

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.770
after getting out of the country.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.500
The last nap we saw of Pyongyang
from 1988 for the World Festival

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.740
of Youth and Students I had
never seen that one before.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.010
The first map I got of Pyongyang
was the one they gave me

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.560
when I visited, it
was produced in 1997.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.770
This tourist map shows a lot of
the places that you might visit

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:14.740
or you could have visited at
the time in central Pyongyang.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.040
But it's not very engaging,
you can't interact with this,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.670 position:56%
the information is limited in scope.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:29.680 position:56%
And it's not to scale and it's
missing a lot of key important areas

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.500
that as a visitor you
might like to know about.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.830
For instance, this
area right here is

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.000
where the [inaudible]
party headquarters is

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.310
and it' snot even labeled
on there in any way.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:49.000
And so it's very lacking in
telling you what you can learn

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.300
about the city.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.780
This is the project I'm working
on it's kind of a mess [inaudible]

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.940
on purpose to show how much
more information we can collect

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.960
on North Korea.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.610
This is using Google Earth,
which is satellite information

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:12.090 position:56%
where I've literally by hand labeled
buildings and infrastructure.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:16.680
So this exists on my computer
right now and I'll speak

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.320
about where it's going in the
future, but no detail is too small.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.970
You know, we know where
the photo studios are,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.030
we know where the grocery
stores are.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.280
We have all of the buildings in
the worker's party complex labeled.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.320
We even know about some
tunnels under them.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:38.250
Kin Chong-in's residency is in
the complex shopping centers,

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.820 position:56%
other government buildings, schools.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.970
The blue line here is
the railway system.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:50.460
We also have the tram and trolley
lines, so no detail is too small

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.760
and we can choose which
kind of data we want to look

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.620
at to spatially compare them
and learn about how they relate

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.600
to each other through geography.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.350
And this is something
that's very difficult to do

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.840
with an actual paper map.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:15.460
And as an aside, the previous map I
just showed you this one from 1997,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.890
up until last fall when I went to
Seoul this was the most recent map

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:23.860
that I could ever find that the
North Koreans made of Pyongyang.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:29.600
And last summer or last fall I went
to Seoul and a colleague had been

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.200
in Pyongyang in 2012
and got this map.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.710 position:56%
This is still the only one I've ever
seen and people who go in and out

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:43.330
of North Korea check for this
stuff to obtain it for me.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.480
And so this one hasn't even
been widely circulated,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.730
but it's a vast improvement
over the old 1997 map.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:55.700
It's kind of hard to tell here, but
the different parts of the city,

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.540 position:56%
the different districts, the gu yok,
in South Korea they're called gu.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.900
But they've actually
delineated them in this map,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.810
so you can see the different
districts in different colors.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.610
And the [inaudible], the blocks,

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:12.640
the subunits of the district
are more specifically identified

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.490
and also some of the new
construction projects

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:22.190
that have taken place between
the 1997 map and 2012 map appear.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.800
But also again, very limited

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.350
and the purpose is not really tell
you much about the city right.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.170 position:56%
You can't go to Pyongyang and wander

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.790
around to your favorite
new restaurant.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.840
You're going to go on a preapproved
itinerary and you're going to eat

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.270
at the restaurants you're your
travel company has been approved

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.940
to take you to.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.120
Another interesting aside from
that map is on the flipside,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.500
on the back of it, it's the
only North Korean map I've seen

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.680
that shows the new
borders of Pyongyang.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:03.190
Sometime before 2012 Pyongyang was
shrunk and this area of [inaudible]

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:08.530
in the county of [inaudible],
which were previously part

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.660
of Pyongyang were removed
and made part

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.240
of the neighboring
[inaudible] province.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.350
And I was able to verify
this using data published

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.080
for the last supreme
people's assembly election,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.240
but this is the first map I
had seen that actually showed

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.890 position:56%
that it was produced in North Korea.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.820 position:56%
So I've been working on two kinds of
mapping projects with North Korea,

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.990
an administrative mapping and
an infrastructure mapping.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.890
One thing that was frustrating
for me as if you look

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.930
at I learned Korean from
watching North Korean television

00:32:53.930 --> 00:33:01.360
and in North Korean sources,
that's how I came into Korean,

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.580
I never really learned much
about South Korea ever.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:12.060 position:56%
But when South Koreans publish North
Korean mapping data they use South

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.820
Korean spellings, which in
some cases are different.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.080
So for instance in North Korea
they have the Pyongyang province,

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.820
which they spell with, you know,

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:29.430
they spell it differently
than South Koreans.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.180
And in Rason City, a
special economic zone

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.990
in the Northeast the North
Koreans spell that differently

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.920
in Korean and in English.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.200
But if you look at
Google for instance,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.940
they use only the South
Korean spelling.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:47.790
Also, if you look at
Gazetteer data it hurts --

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.760
the Gazetteer data hurts my eyes.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:57.760
It has not much in common with
North Korean sources at all and so

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.980 position:56%
for instance if I was
interviewing a North Korean defector

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.870
about where they were from

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.100
and I showed this person the
Gazetteer data they wouldn't

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.640
recognize the names,
particularly the small villages.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.970
Those have all changed I think
since that data was compiled.

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:19.910
And so everything that I've done on
the administrative side is entirely

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:23.010
from North Korean sources.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:28.390
Several published atlases
that came out of North Korea,

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:34.310
including Atlas software and an
encyclopedia that someone got

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.180
in Pyongyang and gave to me.

00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:43.790 position:56%
And those have maps purely published
in North Korea and only in Korean.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:48.170
I also use the North Korean
standard for romanizing the names,

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.870
so that if you wanted to
search the North Korean media

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:54.730
for those names you would find it.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:35:01.830
And if you search for North
Korean places using South Korean

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.600 position:56%
Romanization you won't find anything

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.370
because generally they
spell things --

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:10.060
they use a different standard
for translating in English.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.260
The second project has been
infrastructure mapping.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:20.180
This has been a labor of
love, but it has been a labor

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:25.280
of a very loving wife who
tolerates me doing this.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:31.430
But no detail is too small,
we're interested in every aspect

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:35.460
of the geography that
can be identified on maps

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.030
and satellite imagery and
I work on this every day.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:48.030
Anyway, there's the list of
things, just a sampling of things.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:54.990
But literally if I made a
column of different kinds

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.080
of places we've identified,
I mean it would probably go

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.870
from the ceiling to
the floor in this room.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.580 position:56%
And this is a simple visualization
of the administrative mapping that's

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.560
on Google Earth, it's also
been published in other places,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.550
but just to give you a sampling.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.890
So this is [inaudible] city here
in yellow and this is [inaudible]

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.230
in blue to the north,
this is the produced area

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.040
of Pyongyang in green it's updated.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.080
And then Pyongyang is [inaudible]
down to the different [inaudible].

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:34.940
And in here are the borders
of the [inaudible] and some

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.840
of the other villages
further out here.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.170
And again, from all North
Korean sources at least four

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.710
of them, sometimes five or six.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:50.380
And then to give you
a sampling of the kind

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.030 position:56%
of infrastructure we're doing I've
been working on the electricity grid

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.480
for years, so you can that's
what these green lines are.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.510
We can literally trace like which
facilities get their electricity

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:06.470
from which power plants
or don't in many cases.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:14.790
But this is just an example where
I trace the power line from one

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.510
of the power plants to Kangdong
leadership, it was Kangdong

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.950
at the time's leadership
compound in Kangdong.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.520
But that's the kind of fine
little details you can get

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.220
when you overlay different
data types together.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.520
Also watching the railway
network has been fun.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.960
North Korea's railway network until
recently was the primary means

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.700
of conveyance for getting
around the country.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.580
The rail system was supplemental.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.650
So watching changes to the railway
network is always interesting.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.030
They haven't made any huge
changes recently except

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:53.060
to abandon several projects

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.160
that probably weren't
economically viable,

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.630
but they've also done
some fun things

00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.840
like building special railway lines
for Kim Jong-Il in his last days

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.790
and linking up new mines mostly
for exporting raw materials.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:12.620
This is the road network, again
I've drawn all this out by hand

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.860
on the satellite imagery
and it takes a long time.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.060
I have the roads split up based
on whether they're level one, two,

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.650
three, four, five or six roads and
main road construction projects.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.030
But we keep track of
all these changes

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.890
as new satellite imagery comes out.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.280
The future of the project here --

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.190
so everything I've shown
you is basically a KMZ file

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.610
on the computer.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:41.420
What we've done is the
administrative data we've published

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.890
it as the 38 North Digital Atlas
that's on our webpage, 38north.org.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:51.060
And then the infrastructure
mapping we're trying to move

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:57.080
to a web-based system so that
researchers can use it more easily.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.970
And it's such an enormous
and complex file,

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.870
it's taking a long
time to get this done.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:10.090
But the end goal is to
build a web-based platform

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.690
where everybody can access this
data and to have a team of people

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:18.010
who are constantly monitoring
our various sources for updates

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:22.740
of that information and so
that it can always be updated

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.590
and made available to the public.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.800
Why is this important, well
by combining satellite imagery

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.260
with the largest non-classified
database we can more easily monitor

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.240
changes across the country
and get a better sense

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.060
of what's happening there.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:47.540 position:56%
And to communicate these findings
to various North Korea stakeholders.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:56.360
So information sources, this is a
lot of research and verification.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.450
I lean very heavily on North
Korea's efficient, they're helpful

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.110
and they each have
their own drawbacks.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.440
So official publications,
North Korean television KCTV,

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.340
Naenara is a North Korean web
portal it's updated every day.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:18.100
Uriminzokkiri is a North Korean
organization that targets contents

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:25.780 position:56%
to overseas Koreans and Choson Sinbo
is run by Koreans who are loyal

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:32.040
to North Korean who live in Japan.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.120
Any books and software that the
North Koreans publish the Library

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.900
of Congress has a tremendous
collection of these items

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:45.180
as does the Seoul National
Library in South Korea.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.370
Although the Library of Congress
ones are easier to access.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:56.500
The drawbacks for these official
publications, you get a wealth

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.430
of information, you probably
get the most timely information

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.850
if a new factory has been built

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.640
or something has changed names
you're most likely only going

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.570
to find out about it through
official publications.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:16.160
But these only cover places that
the North Korean government wants

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.460
to highlight.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.150
So if you're interested
in, you know,

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:27.920
developments at a military site or
a prison camp they're never going

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.440
to be updated on the North
Korean official publications,

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.640
you can only get information
about that from satellite imagery

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.070
or from interviewing defectors.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:42.350
Declassified documents are
really helpful, you know,

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.850
the intelligence community has
been researching a lot of places

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.210
in North Korea for decades.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:53.640
You can get declassified documents
on North Korea up till the 1980's,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.520
I think I haven't seen
anything from the 90's yet.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.020
And these are really helpful,
they generally have maps

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.400
and some old satellite
images in them.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:11.600
They have a lot of coordinates
which still work if you want

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.010
to copy those coordinates
into Google Earth.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.450
The problem with declassified
documents is

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.970
in this case you're
getting they're very old,

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.740
so the 1980's is a long
time ago in North Korea.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.270
Even North Korea has changed
significantly since then.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:31.140
There are also sort
of targets things

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.730
that we might be interested
in blowing up one day.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:38.000
So if you're interested
in a new paper factory

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.140
or fishing station it's
probably not going to be in them.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:48.780
The other thing that's frustrating
is the declassified documents refer

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.810
to the places -- generally refer
to the places they've identified

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.460
by what the intelligence community
calls them or what they used

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.820
to be called not what the North
Koreans actually call them.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:04.460
And so there are a
number of times I found

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.990
out where I would identify a
factory from a North Korean source

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:14.490 position:56%
and describe a name to it and then I
would see a name that was unfamiliar

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.310
in a declassified document and
I would punch in the coordinates

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.540
and find out that they were
the same thing it's just

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:25.080
that the intelligence community
had a different name for this place

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.580
than the North Koreans did.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:31.690
And so as far as I know I'm the
only one who is in the business

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.510
of putting this data together.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:40.920
Defector interviews is
another source of information.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.370
I interviewed a North
Korean defector yesterday.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:53.640
Defector interviews can be really
rewarding and really frustrating.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.680
There's a little over
27,000 North Koreans

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.120
who have entered South Korea now.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:05.160
The numbers have been going down
since Kim Jong-Il came to office

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.040
and the South Korean government
hasn't published the 2015 numbers

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.340
as far as I'm aware.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.880 position:56%
But most North Korean defectors come

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.330
from the northern provinces
along the Chinese border

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.520
from small villages.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.290
Sometimes they're from the
provincial capital cities,

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.990
but in general a lot of --
there's not many, you know,

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:33.000
there's just several, most North
Korean defectors really don't know

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.820
much more than what's going on
in their personal lives even

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.310
if they're from a large city.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:43.510
They have a hard time
looking at satellite imagery

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:47.310
and rectifying satellites or a map

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:53.290
with the maps that
are in their heads.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:59.710
And a lot of times they
just don't know much more

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:03.490
than where they lived, where they
went to school, where they worked

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.940
or where they went shopping.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.090
And then you also have
additional problems

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:19.660
where I've had defectors
not tell the truth.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.060
They have fabricated and
one woman I'm thinking

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:28.570
of in particular fabricated
an entire story of her life

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.980
in Pyongyang and where she
worked and where she lived.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:36.470
And you know she picked a very --
a well-known factory as her place

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:42.260
of employment and as I
asked her specific details

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:47.600 position:56%
about the neighborhood she lived in,
about which I already had some data,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.580
she confessed and said if
you want to know this kind

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.460
of information I have to tell
you it from a different town

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:59.260
because I don't know it here.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.550
And so anyway and that's
happened several times.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.910
So you have to be really careful
when interviewing defectors

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:12.160
because sometimes they'll
also pass off information

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.220
of what they think something is
instead of what they know it is.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:22.460
And so I have a separate
file for defector information

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.670
that I'm not sure about
that doesn't make it

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:30.970
into the actual infrastructure
mapping.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:34.550
But one thing that the
defectors have been

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:40.330 position:56%
and this is the case yesterday the
lady didn't know much about the city

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.410
that I didn't already
have, but what she did know

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.770
that was really helpful
was she was able to help

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:47.590
on the administrative side.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:53.200
So we have maps of Pyongyang,
but some of the smaller cities

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.500
in North Korea getting
the names of the dong,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.540
the local blocks is really hard
to come by in detailed maps

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:07.450
and she was able to say like
this neighborhood is called this

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.970
and this neighborhood
is called this.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.100
And as far as I'm aware
that's not published anywhere,

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.840
I mean North Koreans don't even see
that kind of data growing up there.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.250
It might exist somewhere
in South Korea,

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:24.030
but I've never come across it.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:30.090
DPRK visitors and stakeholders,
so aid workers, business ventures,

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:34.740
tourists, diplomats, surprisingly
tourists have been really helpful.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.620
You know, some are pretty
daring and they take pictures

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.480
of stuff I don't even know what
it is and I can go through it

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.430
and match it up with
satellite imagery and find

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:49.120
out it's a meat shop or some
new restaurant that's gone up.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.280
The aid workers, the
business people and people

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:57.390
from the diplomatic community those
contacts take a little harder --

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:02.110
a little more work to develop
because obviously people are shy

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:10.740
about letting information out or
jeopardizing their work there.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:18.950
I also wanted to point out that
I'm not sure what the definition

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:23.310
of crowdsourcing is, but if it's
getting tips from strangers,

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.300
that's not what I've done.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:30.710 position:56%
Nearly every piece of data that I've
put in this project has a citation

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:36.610
and you can visually see where I
got the data from and verify it.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.850
I even have links to North Korean
television in it, so you can see

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.880
for yourself that the data

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.630
that I published matches
the North Korean source.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:52.460
This was an example of
finding something fun.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.070
This is sort of what we
go through all the time.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.560
But this is a number of
years ago Kim Jong-Il

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.880
when he was still alive
visited KPA unit number 586,

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.130
which is also the Reconnaissance
Bureau, which is responsible

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:14.060
for operations in South Korea.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.640
And using the official footage

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:21.660
from his visit there we found
the location in Pyongyang.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.040
And I'm not saying this is the
only Reconnaissance Bureau compound

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.500
in Pyongyang, it's obviously
one of them and, you know,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.080
we matched the buildings and
the monuments with what we saw

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.900
in the satellite imagery.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.680
And I actually didn't find this
one of my colleagues found this,

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.050
but we can still cite the
source for it because it was

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.420
in North Korean publications.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:53.160
And this one was fun, it was a
secret Burmese military delegation

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.930
visited North Korea in 2009.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:57.800
It wasn't reported in
the official media.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.740
They went there to go buy
some military equipment.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.440
Someone from that delegation
released their photos

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.600
and so I was able to look at
these photos and find just

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.470
about everywhere that
they went in North Korea.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:17.140
And this was someplace where
they went to look at some --

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.640
I think it was some
antiaircraft equipment

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.420 position:56%
or something software demonstration.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.570
And so I saw a picture of this
building and I was looking all

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:31.610
over Pyongyang for it and then I
found this picture and it looked

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:34.940
like it matched the
ground-level photo.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:41.480
And I was able to task someone in
Pyongyang to drive by this and see

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.300
if that was the building and
so I was able to verify it

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.220
with someone on the ground.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.470
And this was defector
testimony where I used

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.080
for a publication a number of
years ago for the Committee

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.290
for Human Rights in North
Korea on Japanese defectees.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:03.500
Anh-Young Jin [assumed
spelling] was a defector.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:07.870
They did this hand-drawn map
of where the [inaudible] go,

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:11.710
the Red Army hijackers were living
in the outskirts of Pyongyang.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:18.420
And when I was given the map they
didn't include the key to it,

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.720
so this [inaudible] upside

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:26.010
down because they gave me the
map with south at the top.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.570
And so I was looking around for
that I couldn't find it anywhere

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:31.940
and when I turned it upside down

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.530 position:56%
and then I found the thing it's very
important to put the key in there.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:46.070
But anyway, that was much
harder than it should have been.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.720
And in here this is the
Mirae Scientist's Street

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.030
in Pyongyang it was just completed.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:52:00.010
It's sort of maybe the fifth large
residential contract to take place

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:06.790
in Pyongyang since 2012 or
maybe 2010 and it's on the.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:12.170
Anyway, I've already got photos
of all of these buildings

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:16.660 position:56%
from the ground, so I'm just waiting
to get a new satellite picture

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.360
and then I can label where
all the shops and restaurants

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.410
and buildings are along there.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:27.550
And that's using person
sources and North Korean sources

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.610
because North Koreans have
shown many of these places

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.880
in their official outlets as well.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.400
[Inaudible] is that blue
shop in the middle there.

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:46.140 position:56%
On the administrative side it's also
kind of tricky to combine the data

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.500
and figure out what the
reality is, what the truth is.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.910
Every single map that
I have of Kaesong

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:58.220
that the North Koreans have
published looks like this.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.450 position:56%
So Kaesong City, Kaesong is like
New York it's a city, it's comprised

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:07.620
of a big area called Kaesong
and a small area called Kaesong.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.950
So Kaesong City also
includes Kaesong County,

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:19.840
it did include [inaudible] County,
Kaesong City and Jhinga County.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.380
And every single map I have shows
this configuration for this area.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:32.790
And I stumbled on a story in
the KCNA, which is the outlet

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:38.830
that North Korea uses to convey
official information to outsiders.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:50.460
And KCNA said that in 2002
[inaudible], this is in setting

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.830
up the Kaesong industrial zone,

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.120
which was just closed
a few days ago.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.920
That [inaudible] County had been
dissolved and renamed into a re,

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.490
it had been downgraded
from a town an oop to a re.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:10.110
And the other villages
around it had been moved

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:14.900
into Kapong, Kaesong and Pyongyang.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:22.980
And so because the KCNA article
listed all of the re and all

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:27.600
of those re matched the ones
I had on the maps I was able

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:34.100 position:56%
to I think accurately plot, although
I haven't actually seen this map

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:38.920
anywhere from a North Korean source
the new boundaries of Kaesong.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:46.610
It's up here this Pyongyang re is
what used to be [inaudible] Town.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:51.970
And now Kaesong comes all the
way down to the new [inaudible].

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:57.180
Kapong comes all the way
down to the Han River

00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:01.880
and these areas here they
used to be part of [inaudible]

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.450
and are now part of Kapong.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.340
The Jangphung border came
down and so I just looked

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.940
for after moving the
villages in North Korea a lot

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:22.430
of the county borders are high
landmarks, so mountain ridges

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:26.630
and rivers and also railway
tracks and some other things.

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:31.320
But anyway, I just
used the high landmark

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.530
between where the villages
were supposed to be moved

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:37.420
around to figure out where the new
borders are between these areas.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.840
But I still haven't
seen a North Korean nap

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.310
that has this configuration.

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:48.050 position:56%
Another case that was frustrating is

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:52.220
in Phyonggang province North
Korea has a Phyonggang province,

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.930
I didn't realize until recently

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:57.260
that South Korea also has
a Phyonggang province,

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.230
but it was split in two.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:04.740 position:56%
And North Korea has changed a lot of
the borders in Phyonggang Province

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.470
because of a large dam projects.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.920
But anyway, this is
Phyonggang County,

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.010
this right here is [inaudible].

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:22.270 position:56%
A little [inaudible] is that all the
North Korean maps show the county

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.310
borders as if the DNZ was there.

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:30.550
And so they come into the actual
zone and they list villages

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.600
that maybe used to be there
and are still officially there.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.410
But if you look at the satellite
imagery there's nothing there.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:42.180
So on my map what I did was I
actually stopped at the DMZ.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.620
On the North Korean side
you can see where that is

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:49.800
because there's a security
infrastructure there.

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.460 position:56%
And then I just ignored the villages
that were on the North Korean maps

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.330
that were inside the DMZ.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:57:02.130 position:56%
But for the record the North Koreans
still claim villages are in there.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:07.720
So I label -- so you can see
the shape of Phyonggang County

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.150
around here and I was
able to map this

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:14.770
out on the satellite imagery
using this map published

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.440
in North Korea in 1997.

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.970
I have maps like this
for every country,

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:27.060
it's just the North Korean atlas
that's published by [inaudible]

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.860
in 1997 and this is it here.

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:36.180
And then they label the re
on there and you can look

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.760 position:56%
at the satellite imagery and confirm

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.820
that there's actually a
village where they say it is.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:53.920
And then in 2012 I got this, a
North Korean encyclopedia set,

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.500
it's a digital encyclopedia
it's not a book

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.060
that the North Korean published.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.620
And it has a [inaudible].

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.800
And this is Phyonggang
County from that map.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.100
I don't know when it was published,

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.780
I think sometime in
the early 2000's.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:15.270
But anyway, for Phyonggang
County it was different right,

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:18.310
it had added on this section

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.070
that took all the re villages
[inaudible] the county border,

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:27.750
it moved over and then up
here had been brought down.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.320
So then I had to go and
redraw all of my study.

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.840
I assumed that this was the most
accurate since it was the newest

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.540
and it was published in North
Korea, but I couldn't find anything

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.790 position:56%
that the North Koreans had published
in KCNA or read on something

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:45.790
where they said that they
changed these borders

00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:49.040
around all I have is this.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.490
But I thought well
it's the newest one,

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:56.150
so I'll accept this
as the most accurate.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:05.200
And then the North Koreans launched
a large agricultural project here,

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.000
it's called the [inaudible]
Table Land Project,

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.840
the Mongolians are helping they
gave like 10,000 heads of cattle

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.860
for the North Koreans to revive
their livestock numbers here.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.330
And so the North Koreans
have been talking

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:23.620
about all the livestock farms
they're building in this region

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:27.140
and then they showed
all of the counties

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.330
that they're building
in on television.

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:34.280
And they used the old county shape.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.380 position:56%
So I was like oh, I just changed it.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.720
So I went back and
switched it to the old one,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.820
this old one in here
actually matches the one

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.680
that was on television.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:55.180
And this is actually a giant map
right that was physically made

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.850
and [inaudible] has
been there to deal

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:01.110
with the [inaudible]
Table Land construction.

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:05.180
So I accept this as
-- it has the virtue

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.590
of being the most published
map of the county,

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:12.260
but accepted as more
accurate as well.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.860
Even though I have a North Korean
source that conflicts with it.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.300
And here's another kind of
problem that I've had to face

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.600
on the administrative side.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:29.100
This is a Hyesan City, oh yeah
this is North Koreans spell the

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.310
[inaudible] Province the South
Koreans don't spell it that way.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:39.790
But this is Hyesan City, this is a
1997 map that I used to map it out.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:45.540
So this circle right
here this is a re village

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:52.080 position:56%
and the South Koreans don't call
them res they call them [inaudible].

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.790
But anyway, they forgot to put
the name of this village here.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.760
I found it in a source
and it was [inaudible].

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:09.110
Here's [inaudible] and oops and
this is a 2005 satellite image

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.580
of these villages.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.520
I'm going to verify
they were all there.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:23.600
They were in the process of being
torn down actually, of being erased

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.390
from the map because they
were building a dam there.

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:29.900 position:56%
And so this is what it looks like 12

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.450
of these villages have
all been flooded out.

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:37.060
And you can see on
the satellite imagery

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.430
where the villages have been moved
to other, they've rebuilt them

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:47.830
in surrounding areas, but I
didn't know which one was which.

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:52.400
And you guys can't understand
how frustrating that is.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.460
But eventually North Korea

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:00.610
under [inaudible] has
announced yearly a little

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:07.770
over 20 specialty county zones,
see these [inaudible] in Hyesan.

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:13.390 position:56%
And they gave on television they
show this map they gave the location

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:16.680
of the [inaudible] one of these
Peninsulas on this reservoir.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.550
But they showed the names of
where they moved the villages.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:27.080
And so they haven't published
any maps certainly that I'm aware

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.070
of that have this updated
information, I was only able

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:34.890
to find it just by watching North
Korean television every day.

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.370
You guys should pay me for that.

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:42.550
So anyway, now I have an
updated map of Hyesan City

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:48.500 position:56%
and it has the reservoir here and it
has the villages in the proper place

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:55.560
around the outskirts of it.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.510
And so that's it, thank you.

is time for questions.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:15.010
If you have a question if you could
just raise your hand and stand up

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:19.250
and speak loudly so everyone
can hear your question.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.010
If you're in a back and you can't
hear the question I'll be happy

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:26.220
to repeat it and allow Mr.
Melvin to jump in and answer.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.520

&gt;&gt; In conjunction with the
Voice of America Mr. Melvin,

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.160
you said your end goal is
to participate [inaudible].

that could be launched?

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.200
&gt;&gt; Curtis Melvin: I'm not going
to give you a date on that

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.290
because I've already
been wrong so many times.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.400
I'm going home today to
work on it, but I don't know

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.240
when it will be finished.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.870
Hopefully in the next year.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:04:01.480
Do you want to call,
it doesn't matter.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:09.620
&gt;&gt; You talk about the
defectors [inaudible].

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:19.180
But my question is [inaudible]
defectors how far do they actually

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:30.150
move into different territories
to be able to [inaudible]?

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.450
&gt;&gt; Curtis Melvin: Yeah, almost --

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:36.860
I've met a handful of defectors
from Pyongyang not many,

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.160
less than 10 actually,
maybe about 10.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:48.520
But most North Koreans
know where they were from

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.600
and the route they took
to get out and that's it.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.960
And where they're from they
really don't know much farther

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.800
than literally like
their village so.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.550
And I ask questions like where
is the central bank branch,

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:04.850
I don't know.

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:07.790
Where's the people's
committee, I don't know.

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:11.650
You know, so it's a lot of
work to get a small amount

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:18.510
of information out of them.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:36.430
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:43.450
Yes, so I've been doing this
for too long since say 2006,

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:47.210
I've been actively working on this,
so it's coming up on 10 years.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:51.800
I've been fortunate enough to meet
a lot of people who have been in

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.240
and out of North Korea or
have the opportunity to go

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.250
in and out a lot of times.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:06:02.240
And so if there's a book out that
I want I can ask someone to get it

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.390
or someone might be thoughtful
enough to get it for me.

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:08.770
But in terms of permanent
staff who want

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:13.310 position:56%
to help me US Korean Institute gives
me interns to work on this project,

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:15.980
they help with a lot
of translation work.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.710 position:56%
There's a learning curve on it
because they're usually South Korean

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:24.520
and they don't -- they've never
homes seen any North Korean sources

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.730
and the language is
sometimes a barrier

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.700
and they use North Korean words
and they don't know anything

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.980
about North Korean geography.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:39.400
But it takes time to develop trust
in people like I have information

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.500
that I know about, but I
want to get another source

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:49.920
for it before I add it to the
collection of data and that's just

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.530
to be a good person in my opinion.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:07:01.460
I don't want to name
names or anything so.

No, no intelligence agency has ever

and media use and policymakers.

There's a tremendous amount of
ignorance of North Korean geography,

I mean I don't mean that
like people are ignorant

there's not really a big
reason for most people to know.

But as North Korea is certainly a
country that's in the news a lot

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.130
and a country of concern.

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:03.470
I prefer to give good
information on North Korea

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.000

platform for doing that.

they stopped publishing net material
product tables in the 1960's.

Net material product
tables were what we used

from other communist countries to
estimate the size of their GDP.

attempt but it's not perfect

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.570
to establish a value for
official output in North Korea.

01:08:57.570 --> 01:09:06.380
But now there's a black market in
North Korea and there's not even --

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:13.670
the government hasn't published a
budget since 2001 and, you know,

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:17.290
they only publish percent
increases and decreases in spending

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:18.810
on selected items each year.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:22.130
It's mostly an advertising
or signaling device,

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.120
it's not anything you can use

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.330
to rigorously estimate
the official budget.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:36.900
So really the big good news I guess
economically from North Korea is

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:41.780
that they've stopped
the inflation that began

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.220 position:56%
after the 2009 currency revaluation.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.410
We don't really know how
they've stopped this inflation,

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:52.640
but the black market exchange
rate has been relatively stable

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.820
for the one since 2012.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:02.650
The number of markets that exist

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:06.310
in the country have increased
a little bit under Kim Jong-Il,

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:10.290
but he's shown no propensity
like his father to clampdown

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:15.870
on market activity or
to restrict free prices

01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:19.760
of commodities in those markets.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.120
And he still hasn't visited one,

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.340
we still haven't seen any official
North Korean person involved

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:32.220
in economic matters visit
an official marketplace.

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.030
But we can see on satellite imagery
that they're continuing to grow

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:43.500
and expand, so that's
a positive development.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.130
The South Korean Bank of Korea
publishes an annual estimate

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:53.070
of the North Korean economy and
they've shown basically a plus

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:57.940
or minus 1% each year since
Kim Jong-Il took office.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:05.640
A lot of people, myself included,
think that the actual growth rate,

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.080
at least in Pyongyang has
been substantially higher

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.540
than that just based on qualitative
assessments on the amounts

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.930 position:56%
of consumer goods that are available

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:18.820
to North Koreans today
compared to say 10 years ago.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:28.190
You cannot defend that position
with any standard econometric tools

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:32.740
because the data is not
available to do that.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.590
We're really trying to
triangulate official economic news,

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:42.000
satellite information,
information from defectors,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.540
information that creeps
across the border

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.060
to put together a coherent
picture of what's happening

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:54.900
in specific industries and
that's really the best we can do.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.590
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: We have time
for one more [inaudible].

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:01.840
&gt;&gt; Yes, is the digital
atlas available online?

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.140
&gt;&gt; Curtis Melvin: Yeah,

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.790
the administrative information
is already available.

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:12.530
It's for 2012, so it's probably --
the most recent version is probably

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.310
like maybe 7 or 8% different,

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.190
but it's largely available
at 38North.org.

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:22.180
No, no it's just a web platform.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.480
Yeah you can.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.130
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:28.510
Yeah, in English and Korean you can
search it in English and Korean.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:41.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.260
I had no idea, you know, excuse
me most of the, you know,

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.510
for the [inaudible] I'm
really not a computer guy.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.260
But the RGIS database

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:59.040
that is Gazetteer data
and I don't like it so.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.430
All right, thank you.

01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:04.510
&gt;&gt; Ryan Moore: Thank
you everyone for coming.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:09.500
