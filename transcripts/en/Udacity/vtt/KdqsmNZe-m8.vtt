00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.100
Take a look at this simple exercise. The solution is somewhat straightfoward.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.220
The bind function will take the key value that we're given and map it to an

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.724
action string that we define before. The on-key down event will then need to do

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:15.215
something a little bit different too. It will actually have to look up the

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.680
action value given the key code through the binding system and then mark the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.819
action as true. If the code hasn't actually defined the action, which is

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:28.228
possible, this block of code won't be executed. Thus saving you from any sort

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.236
of weird out-of-bounds errors or code being executed that doesn't actually

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:32.320
exist.
