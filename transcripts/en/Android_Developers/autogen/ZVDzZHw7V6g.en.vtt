presentation this week which is NFC so
let's let's take a look take a look at

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
let's let's take a look take a look at
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.820
let's let's take a look take a look at
what NFC is just before we dive into the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
what NFC is just before we dive into the
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.490
what NFC is just before we dive into the
the implementation details so let's take

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
the implementation details so let's take
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.590
the implementation details so let's take
a high-level overview of what NFC is so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600
a high-level overview of what NFC is so
 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.229
a high-level overview of what NFC is so
NFC stands for near field communication

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239
NFC stands for near field communication
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.039
NFC stands for near field communication
it's really based on the RFID technology

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049
it's really based on the RFID technology
 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.630
it's really based on the RFID technology
is is a strong is a short-range

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
is is a strong is a short-range
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.120
is is a strong is a short-range
technology so usually when the device or

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
technology so usually when the device or
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.910
technology so usually when the device or
or the device to the to the to the NFC

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920
or the device to the to the to the NFC
 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.259
or the device to the to the to the NFC
tag card is between like four centimeter

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
tag card is between like four centimeter
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.289
tag card is between like four centimeter
or less communication will start

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299
or less communication will start
 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.819
or less communication will start
happening you can also share a small

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829
happening you can also share a small
 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.890

between like Android devices so the the
 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.420
between like Android devices so the the
most common data format people use for

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
most common data format people use for
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.319
most common data format people use for
NFC is the is end F so we were taught of

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329
NFC is the is end F so we were taught of
 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.780
NFC is the is end F so we were taught of
a little bit more about that in future

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790
a little bit more about that in future
 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.680
a little bit more about that in future
slides so what is NFC for actually you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690
slides so what is NFC for actually you
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.069
slides so what is NFC for actually you
can use NFC Forum couple things are the

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079
can use NFC Forum couple things are the
 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.039
can use NFC Forum couple things are the
first one is show show I mean you can

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049
first one is show show I mean you can
 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.800

later on and the third use case of NFC

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360
later on and the third use case of NFC
 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.940
later on and the third use case of NFC
is in commerce

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950
is in commerce
 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.090
is in commerce
so example like content next payment

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100
so example like content next payment
 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.440
so example like content next payment
like Google Wallet but that is a little

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450
like Google Wallet but that is a little
 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.430
like Google Wallet but that is a little
bit different

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440
bit different
 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.350
bit different
out of our topic today so because uh

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
out of our topic today so because uh
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.120
out of our topic today so because uh
Google Wallet kind of requires the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130
Google Wallet kind of requires the
 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.910
Google Wallet kind of requires the
access to the secure element and and if

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920
access to the secure element and and if
 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.910
access to the secure element and and if
you're interested in become a partner of

we're going to cover today Google Wallet

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660
we're going to cover today Google Wallet
 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.690
we're going to cover today Google Wallet
but it's a way we are going to focus on

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700
but it's a way we are going to focus on
 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.420
but it's a way we are going to focus on
the technology today so for NFC or there

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430
the technology today so for NFC or there
 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.010
the technology today so for NFC or there
are a few communication protocols so so

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020
are a few communication protocols so so
 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.070
are a few communication protocols so so
these are the protocols so I'm not going

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080
these are the protocols so I'm not going
 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.830
these are the protocols so I'm not going
to to spell out all these like ISO

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840
to to spell out all these like ISO
 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.670
to to spell out all these like ISO
standards here but the the key thing

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680
standards here but the the key thing
 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.660
standards here but the the key thing
here is we have Android classes to to

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670
here is we have Android classes to to
 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.480
here is we have Android classes to to
implement this like to talk to these

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490
implement this like to talk to these
 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.320
implement this like to talk to these
protocols so and so I kind of like

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330
protocols so and so I kind of like
 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.280
protocols so and so I kind of like
highlight that with the bullets here and

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290
highlight that with the bullets here and
 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.640
highlight that with the bullets here and
besides the protocol we have different

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650
besides the protocol we have different
 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.370
besides the protocol we have different
types of NFC tags and so the the

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380
types of NFC tags and so the the
 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.380
types of NFC tags and so the the
standard ones like kind of create us

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390
standard ones like kind of create us
 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.710
standard ones like kind of create us
defined that in the NFC Forum are there

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720
defined that in the NFC Forum are there
 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.560
defined that in the NFC Forum are there
four major types and and there are

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570
four major types and and there are
 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.750
four major types and and there are
products actually implementing these

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760
products actually implementing these
 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.820
products actually implementing these
different types so the some of the most

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830
different types so the some of the most
 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.120
different types so the some of the most
more common ones are probably you guys

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130
more common ones are probably you guys
 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.260
more common ones are probably you guys
see most of the Mifare ones and in the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270
see most of the Mifare ones and in the
 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.860
see most of the Mifare ones and in the
song the pinnacle one so there are four

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870
song the pinnacle one so there are four
 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.040
song the pinnacle one so there are four
major types of tags in in NFC and we

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050
major types of tags in in NFC and we
 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.680
major types of tags in in NFC and we
will see have actually tab that's very

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690
will see have actually tab that's very
 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.830
will see have actually tab that's very
nice table to summarize all these like

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840
nice table to summarize all these like
 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.020
nice table to summarize all these like
to put things together so stay tuned and

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030
to put things together so stay tuned and
 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.660
to put things together so stay tuned and
besides the NFC Forum standards there

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670
besides the NFC Forum standards there
 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.679
besides the NFC Forum standards there
are also other types of

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689
are also other types of
 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:48.959
are also other types of
tact so the Mifare classic one is is one

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969
tact so the Mifare classic one is is one
 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.219
tact so the Mifare classic one is is one
of them and so it's it's also very

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229
of them and so it's it's also very
 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:59.369
of them and so it's it's also very
popular as nxp is using this this time

00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.379
popular as nxp is using this this time
 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:01.949
popular as nxp is using this this time
of tech and it has additional operation

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:01.959
of tech and it has additional operation
 

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.699
of tech and it has additional operation
you can do with these tact and we have a

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:05.709
you can do with these tact and we have a
 

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:07.919
you can do with these tact and we have a
special car satchel for this also called

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:07.929
special car satchel for this also called
 

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:16.350
special car satchel for this also called
my fake classics so so what is a and f

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360
my fake classics so so what is a and f
 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.899
my fake classics so so what is a and f
so we we talked about formats of data we

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:21.909
so we we talked about formats of data we
 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:26.669
so we we talked about formats of data we
use in NFC and and I mentioned and that

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:26.679
use in NFC and and I mentioned and that
 

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:29.429
use in NFC and and I mentioned and that
is the kind of like the most common

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:29.439
is the kind of like the most common
 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:32.549
is the kind of like the most common
standards so and F actually stands for

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:32.559
standards so and F actually stands for
 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.359
standards so and F actually stands for
NFC data exchange format it's really a

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:36.369
NFC data exchange format it's really a
 

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:41.249
NFC data exchange format it's really a
lightweight binary message format and

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:41.259
lightweight binary message format and
 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.299
lightweight binary message format and
one thing about end F Lisa ma an end F

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:45.309
one thing about end F Lisa ma an end F
 

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:49.669
one thing about end F Lisa ma an end F
message can have many end F records and

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:49.679
message can have many end F records and
 

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:54.359
message can have many end F records and
and for for data with an application

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:54.369
and for for data with an application
 

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:56.839
and for for data with an application
define payload can be actually

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:56.849
define payload can be actually
 

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:00.059
define payload can be actually
encapsulate in one or more and that

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:00.069
encapsulate in one or more and that
 

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:06.869
encapsulate in one or more and that
records so let's take a look at the end

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879
records so let's take a look at the end
 

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:09.089
records so let's take a look at the end
DEP record to a comfortable bit more

00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:09.099
DEP record to a comfortable bit more
 

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.669
DEP record to a comfortable bit more
about that in detail so they and then

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:11.679
about that in detail so they and then
 

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:13.919
about that in detail so they and then
that record compose off a header and a

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:13.929
that record compose off a header and a
 

00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:18.119
that record compose off a header and a
pillow so in the header it has a three

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:18.129
pillow so in the header it has a three
 

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:18.989
pillow so in the header it has a three
bit

00:08:18.989 --> 00:08:18.999
bit
 

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:23.159
bit
type name format and it also has the

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:23.169
type name format and it also has the
 

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.709
type name format and it also has the
title itself is a is in variable length

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:25.719
title itself is a is in variable length
 

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:30.839
title itself is a is in variable length
is from 0 to 255 bytes and same thing

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:30.849
is from 0 to 255 bytes and same thing
 

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:34.319
is from 0 to 255 bytes and same thing
for the ID is kind of optional and not

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:34.329
for the ID is kind of optional and not
 

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:38.189
for the ID is kind of optional and not
very often used and then the payload or

00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:38.199
very often used and then the payload or
 

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:42.209
very often used and then the payload or
the payload can actually have data up to

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:42.219
the payload can actually have data up to
 

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:47.400
the payload can actually have data up to
2 to the power 32 minus 1 byte so so

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.410
2 to the power 32 minus 1 byte so so
 

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.049
2 to the power 32 minus 1 byte so so
that's the structure of the end of

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:49.059
that's the structure of the end of
 

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:53.970
that's the structure of the end of
record so here is the the big pictures

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:53.980
record so here is the the big pictures
 

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.949
record so here is the the big pictures
like the some kind of summary of all the

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959
like the some kind of summary of all the
 

00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:57.330
like the some kind of summary of all the
relationship between

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:57.340
relationship between
 

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.620
relationship between
like all the classes and so so if you

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.630
like all the classes and so so if you
 

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.440
like all the classes and so so if you
look at this kind of the the NFC stack

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.450
look at this kind of the the NFC stack
 

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.810
look at this kind of the the NFC stack
so you have any analog things at the

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:06.820
so you have any analog things at the
 

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.440
so you have any analog things at the
bottom and then you have the different

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.450
bottom and then you have the different
 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:15.210
bottom and then you have the different
communication protocol and and two major

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.220
communication protocol and and two major
 

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.180
communication protocol and and two major
types of applications people can build

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.190
types of applications people can build
 

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.680
types of applications people can build
and so one is using the standard and def

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.690
and so one is using the standard and def
 

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.840
and so one is using the standard and def
message for vomit and within that you

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.850
message for vomit and within that you
 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.700
message for vomit and within that you
have the NFC Forum standard type one to

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:32.710
have the NFC Forum standard type one to
 

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.990
have the NFC Forum standard type one to
type for our tag and also have the

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000
type for our tag and also have the
 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.269
type for our tag and also have the
Mifare classic tag and the stuff in blue

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279
Mifare classic tag and the stuff in blue
 

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.030
Mifare classic tag and the stuff in blue
is is actually the class of the Android

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
is is actually the class of the Android
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.680
is is actually the class of the Android
classes we have to the implementation

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:48.690
classes we have to the implementation
 

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:54.980
classes we have to the implementation
for those of particular types of tag and

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:54.990
for those of particular types of tag and
 

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:00.600
for those of particular types of tag and
and for non end F format applications we

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:00.610
and for non end F format applications we
 

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.329
and for non end F format applications we
also have the corresponding classes to

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339
also have the corresponding classes to
 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:10.829
also have the corresponding classes to
allow developer to talk directly through

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839
allow developer to talk directly through
 

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.620
allow developer to talk directly through
through the protocol so we have all

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:13.630
through the protocol so we have all
 

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.760
through the protocol so we have all
these like NFC a class which is

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:17.770
these like NFC a class which is
 

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.310
these like NFC a class which is
correspond to the iso 1 4 4 3 3 a

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320
correspond to the iso 1 4 4 3 3 a
 

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.040
correspond to the iso 1 4 4 3 3 a
protocol and and etc so it's kind of

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.050
protocol and and etc so it's kind of
 

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.900
protocol and and etc so it's kind of
mapping these raw protocol if if the

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:30.910
mapping these raw protocol if if the
 

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.120
mapping these raw protocol if if the
application is not using the end dev

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.130
application is not using the end dev
 

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.260
application is not using the end dev
data format so that's kind of a nice

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:37.270
data format so that's kind of a nice
 

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:44.750
data format so that's kind of a nice
summary of all these things together so

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760
 
 

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.300
 
so now let's start to talk about like

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.310
so now let's start to talk about like
 

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:54.990
so now let's start to talk about like
how Android actually read the Wheaties

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000
how Android actually read the Wheaties
 

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.110
how Android actually read the Wheaties
tag and then how to dispatch these tag

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120
tag and then how to dispatch these tag
 

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.790
tag and then how to dispatch these tag
to to your applications so again the

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800
to to your applications so again the
 

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.550
to to your applications so again the
tomb 2 major like category so one is the

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560
tomb 2 major like category so one is the
 

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.230
tomb 2 major like category so one is the
one is attack with it using the end F

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240
one is attack with it using the end F
 

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.190
one is attack with it using the end F
format

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200
format
 

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.820
format
another one is using the other non non

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:14.830
another one is using the other non non
 

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:21.590
another one is using the other non non
indefinite so so we have different

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600
indefinite so so we have different
 

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.050
indefinite so so we have different
action type so it's actually follow

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.060
action type so it's actually follow
 

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.800
action type so it's actually follow
following the order so we first try to

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:28.810
following the order so we first try to
 

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.820
following the order so we first try to
see whether something matched and F this

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:31.830
see whether something matched and F this
 

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.710
see whether something matched and F this
data format first so we have action go

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720
data format first so we have action go
 

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.670
data format first so we have action go
and F discomfort so if there is a an

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680
and F discomfort so if there is a an
 

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.190
and F discomfort so if there is a an
activity that match that action so we

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200
activity that match that action so we
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.850
activity that match that action so we
will we will route intend to to that

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:47.860
will we will route intend to to that
 

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.690
will we will route intend to to that
application so we will see some example

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:51.700
application so we will see some example
 

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.210
application so we will see some example
of how to set up these like intent

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.220
of how to set up these like intent
 

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.420
of how to set up these like intent
filtering in your application later and

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.430
filtering in your application later and
 

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.590
filtering in your application later and
then so back to the picture if if the

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600
then so back to the picture if if the
 

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.200
then so back to the picture if if the
end of discovery action is not is we

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.210
end of discovery action is not is we
 

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.290
end of discovery action is not is we
don't see any like and their format tag

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:07.300
don't see any like and their format tag
 

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.010
don't see any like and their format tag
we will fall fall back to the the tag

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:11.020
we will fall fall back to the the tag
 

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.190
we will fall fall back to the the tag
discover our actions and then to the

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:14.200
discover our actions and then to the
 

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.870
discover our actions and then to the
attack discover actions so so this is

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880
attack discover actions so so this is
 

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.030
attack discover actions so so this is
kind of how the Android system decision

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040
kind of how the Android system decision
 

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.120
kind of how the Android system decision
tree to to decide how to dispatch are

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.130
tree to to decide how to dispatch are
 

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.120
tree to to decide how to dispatch are
all that well or the other other data or

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.130
all that well or the other other data or
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.930
all that well or the other other data or
the NFC tag it reads from from the from

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:33.940
the NFC tag it reads from from the from
 

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:40.980
the NFC tag it reads from from the from
the film so now our how to request NFC

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:40.990
the film so now our how to request NFC
 

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.410
the film so now our how to request NFC
access in your application so as you

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.420
access in your application so as you
 

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.140
access in your application so as you
guys can probably can imagine so this

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.150
guys can probably can imagine so this
 

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.550
guys can probably can imagine so this
definitely has something to do with the

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560
definitely has something to do with the
 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.180
definitely has something to do with the
manifest

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.190
manifest
 

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.090
manifest
so first things you need to do is to add

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.100
so first things you need to do is to add
 

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.630
so first things you need to do is to add
a special permission as a Android

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:57.640
a special permission as a Android
 

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.400
a special permission as a Android
permissions on NFC and for filtering

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:01.410
permissions on NFC and for filtering
 

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.500
permissions on NFC and for filtering
application in Google Play you want to

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:04.510
application in Google Play you want to
 

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.030
application in Google Play you want to
use the feature use feature tag

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040
use the feature use feature tag
 

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.980
use the feature use feature tag
specifically specifying the hardware NFC

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:10.990
specifically specifying the hardware NFC
 

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.180
specifically specifying the hardware NFC
hardware

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.190
hardware
 

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.690
hardware
so if NFC is really an optional feature

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:15.700
so if NFC is really an optional feature
 

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.830
so if NFC is really an optional feature
in your application you can consider

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:18.840
in your application you can consider
 

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.290
in your application you can consider
setting this for this the require

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.300
setting this for this the require
 

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.109
setting this for this the require
attribute of course and

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:25.119
attribute of course and
 

00:13:25.119 --> 00:13:27.719
attribute of course and
and you can also check NFC runtime

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:27.729
and you can also check NFC runtime
 

00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:31.049
and you can also check NFC runtime
availability by I checked by using the

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:31.059
availability by I checked by using the
 

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.239
availability by I checked by using the
Cathy file adapter method if it's set if

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:33.249
Cathy file adapter method if it's set if
 

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:35.999
Cathy file adapter method if it's set if
it's equal now tell me that means NFC is

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:36.009
it's equal now tell me that means NFC is
 

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:37.769
it's equal now tell me that means NFC is
not available you know in that

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:37.779
not available you know in that
 

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:44.639
not available you know in that
particular device so um another thing is

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:44.649
particular device so um another thing is
 

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:49.049
particular device so um another thing is
you have to set the minimum SDK version

00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:49.059
you have to set the minimum SDK version
 

00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:51.869
you have to set the minimum SDK version
in your application so the minimum SDK

00:13:51.869 --> 00:13:51.879
in your application so the minimum SDK
 

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:55.529
in your application so the minimum SDK
version and that will have NFC support

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:55.539
version and that will have NFC support
 

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:57.889
version and that will have NFC support
this API level 9

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899
this API level 9
 

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:01.349
this API level 9
so in this level we have we will support

00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:01.359
so in this level we have we will support
 

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:07.769
so in this level we have we will support
action tag discover action and but we we

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:07.779
action tag discover action and but we we
 

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.609
action tag discover action and but we we
kind of recommend developers to least

00:14:11.609 --> 00:14:11.619
kind of recommend developers to least
 

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:14.069
kind of recommend developers to least
specify that level 10 because it has a

00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079
specify that level 10 because it has a
 

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:17.339
specify that level 10 because it has a
much more comprehensive retry support in

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:17.349
much more comprehensive retry support in
 

00:14:17.349 --> 00:14:19.889
much more comprehensive retry support in
level 10 and also we can do for point

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:19.899
level 10 and also we can do for point
 

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:24.539
level 10 and also we can do for point
and for program and dev pushing in API

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:24.549
and for program and dev pushing in API
 

00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:28.619
and for program and dev pushing in API
level 14 we we have Android Beam support

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:28.629
level 14 we we have Android Beam support
 

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:31.939
level 14 we we have Android Beam support
and also some other extra methods

00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:31.949
and also some other extra methods
 

00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:35.369
and also some other extra methods
convenience method to create and death

00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:35.379
convenience method to create and death
 

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:40.649
convenience method to create and death
records so I guess at least use API

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:40.659
records so I guess at least use API
 

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:47.689
records so I guess at least use API
level 10 that's our recommendation so

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699
level 10 that's our recommendation so
 

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:50.549
level 10 that's our recommendation so
filtering so let's take a look at how

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:50.559
filtering so let's take a look at how
 

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:54.599
filtering so let's take a look at how
you set up your activity to to capture

00:14:54.599 --> 00:14:54.609
you set up your activity to to capture
 

00:14:54.609 --> 00:15:00.569
you set up your activity to to capture
these NFC intense so you can so one of

00:15:00.569 --> 00:15:00.579
these NFC intense so you can so one of
 

00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:03.719
these NFC intense so you can so one of
the actions you can filter by is the NDF

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:03.729
the actions you can filter by is the NDF
 

00:15:03.729 --> 00:15:07.619
the actions you can filter by is the NDF
discover action you can in this example

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:07.629
discover action you can in this example
 

00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:10.589
discover action you can in this example
here you can filter by min type so I can

00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:10.599
here you can filter by min type so I can
 

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:13.709
here you can filter by min type so I can
specify like if the mean type is tax

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:13.719
specify like if the mean type is tax
 

00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:16.699
specify like if the mean type is tax
plain plain texts you that's how you

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:16.709
plain plain texts you that's how you
 

00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:19.589
plain plain texts you that's how you
have a data you have a data tag and

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:19.599
have a data you have a data tag and
 

00:15:19.599 --> 00:15:22.339
have a data you have a data tag and
specify the mean time that's how you

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:22.349
specify the mean time that's how you
 

00:15:22.349 --> 00:15:28.589
specify the mean time that's how you
further NFC message by min type and if

00:15:28.589 --> 00:15:28.599
further NFC message by min type and if
 

00:15:28.599 --> 00:15:32.489
further NFC message by min type and if
you want to do filtering by URI you can

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:32.499
you want to do filtering by URI you can
 

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:36.599
you want to do filtering by URI you can
also do that so it's a different it has

00:15:36.599 --> 00:15:36.609
also do that so it's a different it has
 

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.700
also do that so it's a different it has
a different data data tag

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:38.710
a different data data tag
 

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.080
a different data data tag

of discover action we will fall back to

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.030
of discover action we will fall back to
 

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.010
of discover action we will fall back to
this tack discover action and in order

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.020
this tack discover action and in order
 

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.860
this tack discover action and in order
for this to work your application have

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:10.870
for this to work your application have
 

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.250
for this to work your application have
to specify an XML resource file to

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:14.260
to specify an XML resource file to
 

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.200
to specify an XML resource file to
specify the list of technology the NFC

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.210
specify the list of technology the NFC
 

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.610
specify the list of technology the NFC
10-year reading for your application the

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:23.620
10-year reading for your application the
 

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.700
10-year reading for your application the

supporting before your application can

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:29.830
supporting before your application can
 

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.400
supporting before your application can
process that NFC tag information so so

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.410
process that NFC tag information so so
 

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.160
process that NFC tag information so so
in this case here so what you're trying

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.170
in this case here so what you're trying
 

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.620
in this case here so what you're trying
to say here is your application will

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:40.630
to say here is your application will
 

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.680
to say here is your application will
only take NFC tag that that can support

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:45.690
only take NFC tag that that can support
 

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.390
only take NFC tag that that can support
the entire list of NFC technology so

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:51.400
the entire list of NFC technology so
 

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.170
the entire list of NFC technology so
it's a pretty long list of things and I

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:55.180
it's a pretty long list of things and I
 

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.390
it's a pretty long list of things and I
think in reality you probably you only

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:57.400
think in reality you probably you only
 

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.420
think in reality you probably you only
want to specify a field because if this

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.430
want to specify a field because if this
 

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:05.310
want to specify a field because if this
is really a encases so you you're trying

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:05.320
is really a encases so you you're trying
 

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.010
is really a encases so you you're trying
to to find something that support all of

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.020
to to find something that support all of
 

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.250
to to find something that support all of
these technology is not it's not all so

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.260
these technology is not it's not all so
 

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.630
these technology is not it's not all so
so how to do all in in the in the tag

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640
so how to do all in in the in the tag
 

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.010
so how to do all in in the in the tag
list so so if you specify multiple

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020
list so so if you specify multiple
 

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.790
list so so if you specify multiple
resources like like this example here so

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:23.800
resources like like this example here so
 

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.420
resources like like this example here so
you're you're trying to filter something

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:27.430
you're you're trying to filter something
 

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.400
you're you're trying to filter something
like if the NFC tag is supporting NFC a

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:32.410
like if the NFC tag is supporting NFC a
 

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.380
like if the NFC tag is supporting NFC a
and and and deaf and all is upon NFC B

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:37.390
and and and deaf and all is upon NFC B
 

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.520
and and and deaf and all is upon NFC B
or and F if both both of them will match

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:41.530
or and F if both both of them will match
 

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.580
or and F if both both of them will match
and and your applications can surf both

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:44.590
and and your applications can surf both
 

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:49.020
and and your applications can surf both
of these NFC cards so so if you have

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.030
of these NFC cards so so if you have
 

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.500
of these NFC cards so so if you have
also need to use the all semantics this

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:52.510
also need to use the all semantics this
 

00:17:52.510 --> 00:18:00.390
also need to use the all semantics this
the way how you define the type list so

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400
the way how you define the type list so
 

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.810
the way how you define the type list so
um so the another fallback is you you

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:06.820
um so the another fallback is you you
 

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.320
um so the another fallback is you you
know using the tech discover in in your

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.330
know using the tech discover in in your
 

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.900
know using the tech discover in in your
in your activity you you pretty much

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:12.910
in your activity you you pretty much
 

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.960
in your activity you you pretty much
just filter by the the tech discover

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:15.970
just filter by the the tech discover
 

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.880
just filter by the the tech discover
that actions and and then in you have a

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:20.890
that actions and and then in you have a
 

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:25.860
that actions and and then in you have a
metadata tag specific pointing to the to

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:25.870
metadata tag specific pointing to the to
 

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.440
metadata tag specific pointing to the to
the resource XML file so this is how you

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:28.450
the resource XML file so this is how you
 

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:41.150
the resource XML file so this is how you
include the filtering in your manifest

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160
 
 

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:52.470
 
so I miss so how to obtain information

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480
so I miss so how to obtain information
 

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.010
so I miss so how to obtain information
from the intent so is is pretty

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.020
from the intent so is is pretty
 

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.200
from the intent so is is pretty
straightforward on there are two ways

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.210
straightforward on there are two ways
 

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.070
straightforward on there are two ways
you can do it

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080
you can do it
 

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.920
you can do it
so um if you want to have a raw NFC tag

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:04.930
so um if you want to have a raw NFC tag
 

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.930
so um if you want to have a raw NFC tag
you can always do the get possible

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940
you can always do the get possible
 

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.060
you can always do the get possible
parcel level data extra using are

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.070
parcel level data extra using are
 

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.480
parcel level data extra using are
calling the extra tag and it will return

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.490
calling the extra tag and it will return
 

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.750
calling the extra tag and it will return
your attack and you can just look

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760
your attack and you can just look
 

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.120
your attack and you can just look
through and getting to find out of these

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.130
through and getting to find out of these
 

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.120
through and getting to find out of these
sub technology but there's also a confer

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.130
sub technology but there's also a confer
 

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.460
sub technology but there's also a confer
convenient rate if you know like you're

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:26.470
convenient rate if you know like you're
 

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.150
convenient rate if you know like you're
only like processing NFC tag with the

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160
only like processing NFC tag with the
 

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.950
only like processing NFC tag with the
using the NDF data format you can you

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960
using the NDF data format you can you
 

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.900
using the NDF data format you can you
can use the end F messages extra to get

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:39.910
can use the end F messages extra to get
 

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:47.280
can use the end F messages extra to get
a list of end F message so so the

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.290
a list of end F message so so the
 

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.260
a list of end F message so so the
coasting that here is really an example

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:49.270
coasting that here is really an example
 

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.580
coasting that here is really an example
of how you you get the end F messages so

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:53.590
of how you you get the end F messages so
 

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.880
of how you you get the end F messages so
you pretty much you get a list of

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:56.890
you pretty much you get a list of
 

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.210
you pretty much you get a list of
possible and then we you you and then

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:00.220
possible and then we you you and then
 

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.820
possible and then we you you and then
you create and then you cast these like

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:02.830
you create and then you cast these like
 

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.220
you create and then you cast these like
raw messages to to

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.230
raw messages to to
 

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:13.289
raw messages to to
to the NDF message just look through it

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:13.299
 
 

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:17.710
 
so then the next session are anyways

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720
so then the next session are anyways
 

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.570
so then the next session are anyways
going to talk about Android Beam

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:19.580
going to talk about Android Beam
 

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.330
going to talk about Android Beam
so our past how's it to you anyway all

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:25.340
so our past how's it to you anyway all
 

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.789
so our past how's it to you anyway all
right thanks Duffy

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799
right thanks Duffy
 

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:29.860
right thanks Duffy
so to begin with what's Android Beam

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:29.870
so to begin with what's Android Beam
 

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.270
so to begin with what's Android Beam
it's something that based on something

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280
it's something that based on something
 

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.820
it's something that based on something
called NFC and F message push so this is

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.830
called NFC and F message push so this is
 

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.460
called NFC and F message push so this is
about pushing messages from an app

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:36.470
about pushing messages from an app
 

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.930
about pushing messages from an app
that's running on the foreground an

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:37.940
that's running on the foreground an
 

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.190
that's running on the foreground an
activity that's running on the

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200
activity that's running on the
 

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.409
activity that's running on the
foreground to another activity running

00:20:41.409 --> 00:20:41.419
foreground to another activity running
 

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:42.370
foreground to another activity running
on another phone

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380
on another phone
 

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.600
on another phone
so that's the pushpot aspect of um well

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:46.610
so that's the pushpot aspect of um well
 

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.120
so that's the pushpot aspect of um well
by the way can you guys see the this sly

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.130
by the way can you guys see the this sly
 

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.549
by the way can you guys see the this sly
when when any would talks I can and you

00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559
when when any would talks I can and you
 

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:57.940
when when any would talks I can and you
you can how about you and you can you

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:57.950
you can how about you and you can you
 

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:06.120
you can how about you and you can you
see the slide when any were top and you

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.130
see the slide when any were top and you
 

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:15.900
see the slide when any were top and you
can you see the slide message but he can

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:15.910
can you see the slide message but he can
 

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.720
can you see the slide message but he can
highlight it to see so it's probably not

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:19.730
highlight it to see so it's probably not
 

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.580
highlight it to see so it's probably not
getting recorded there let me do

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:21.590
getting recorded there let me do
 

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.350
getting recorded there let me do
something I will share my my desktop

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360
something I will share my my desktop
 

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:57.040
something I will share my my desktop
instead okay

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.050
 
 

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.650
 
all right I think we've got my slides on

00:21:59.650 --> 00:21:59.660
all right I think we've got my slides on
 

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.530
all right I think we've got my slides on
the screen now so right as I was

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:02.540
the screen now so right as I was
 

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.900
the screen now so right as I was
mentioning a NFC is based on n def

n def message like the only explained is
 

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.250
n def message like the only explained is
something that contains a zero or more

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.260
something that contains a zero or more
 

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.050
something that contains a zero or more
in Def regards the first record being

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.060
in Def regards the first record being
 

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.320
in Def regards the first record being
something that describes the URL other

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.330
something that describes the URL other
 

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.000
something that describes the URL other
contains the URL or the mime type of the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.010
contains the URL or the mime type of the
 

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.500
contains the URL or the mime type of the
content that your end of message

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:23.510
content that your end of message
 

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.240
content that your end of message
contains for example if it's an image

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:25.250
contains for example if it's an image
 

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.220
contains for example if it's an image
you would have something with the image

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:27.230
you would have something with the image
 

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.440
you would have something with the image
mind type or if you have text you would

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:29.450
mind type or if you have text you would
 

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.900
mind type or if you have text you would
say a sky 8 as the mime type so that's

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:31.910
say a sky 8 as the mime type so that's
 

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.660
say a sky 8 as the mime type so that's
your zero position end F record in the

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:34.670
your zero position end F record in the

these records is pushed from one device

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:39.470
these records is pushed from one device
 

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.130
these records is pushed from one device
when in close proximity and that's the

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.140
when in close proximity and that's the
 

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.350
when in close proximity and that's the
basic concept of NFC when you bring

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360
basic concept of NFC when you bring
 

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.980
basic concept of NFC when you bring
devices in close proximity ending your

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:47.990
devices in close proximity ending your
 

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.870
devices in close proximity ending your
app is running in foreground and that's

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880
app is running in foreground and that's
 

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.900
app is running in foreground and that's
when NFC beam is activated and it stripe

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:52.910
when NFC beam is activated and it stripe
 

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.550
when NFC beam is activated and it stripe
tries to push the message from one

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:54.560
tries to push the message from one
 

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.050
tries to push the message from one
device on to the another one so as a

programmer how do you how do you enable

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:00.860
programmer how do you how do you enable
 

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.160
programmer how do you how do you enable
your app or make your app Android Beam

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.170
your app or make your app Android Beam
 

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.150
your app or make your app Android Beam
capable it's quite simple there are two

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:07.160
capable it's quite simple there are two
 

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.160
capable it's quite simple there are two
options were offered how you can do that

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.170
options were offered how you can do that
 

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.650
options were offered how you can do that
the first one is you basically invoke

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:11.660
the first one is you basically invoke
 

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.280
the first one is you basically invoke
the method set end F message push so in

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.290
the method set end F message push so in
 

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.020
the method set end F message push so in
your app is running your activities in

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.030
your app is running your activities in
 

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.180
your app is running your activities in
foreground you call this method and this

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.190
foreground you call this method and this
 

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.570
foreground you call this method and this
method is usually used if you have sort

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:22.580
method is usually used if you have sort
 

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.420
method is usually used if you have sort
of a static data to be pushed for

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:25.430
of a static data to be pushed for
 

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.040
of a static data to be pushed for
example you may want to push the link of

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.050
example you may want to push the link of
 

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.410
example you may want to push the link of
your app to download and this is

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.420
your app to download and this is
 

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.420
your app to download and this is
something static and this is the method

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:31.430
something static and this is the method
 

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.310
something static and this is the method
you would use when you have to push that

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
you would use when you have to push that
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.440
you would use when you have to push that
kind of data the other option is that

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:35.450
kind of data the other option is that
 

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.810
kind of data the other option is that
you can have your activity implement

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:37.820
you can have your activity implement
 

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.240
you can have your activity implement
something called create ndepth message

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.250
something called create ndepth message
 

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.120
something called create ndepth message
callback and so as soon as your activity

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.130
callback and so as soon as your activity
 

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.090
callback and so as soon as your activity
then comes into foreground the the

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:46.100
then comes into foreground the the
 

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.520
then comes into foreground the the
system invokes this method on your calls

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:48.530
system invokes this method on your calls
 

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.320
system invokes this method on your calls
your activity back using this interface

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.330
your activity back using this interface
 

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.690
your activity back using this interface
and the only method that you have to

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:52.700
and the only method that you have to
 

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.460
and the only method that you have to
implement from this interface is the

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:54.470
implement from this interface is the
 

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.330
implement from this interface is the
create end F message method so this

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:58.340
create end F message method so this
 

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.250
create end F message method so this
method is where you have to provide the

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:00.260
method is where you have to provide the
 

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.820
method is where you have to provide the
implementation of where how you create

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:03.830
implementation of where how you create
 

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.500
implementation of where how you create
the message and return a message from

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.510
the message and return a message from
 

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.290
the message and return a message from
the method so the frame-up world invoke

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:08.300
the method so the frame-up world invoke
 

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.970
the method so the frame-up world invoke
the callback and this method is call and

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:09.980
the callback and this method is call and
 

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.570
the callback and this method is call and
at this point

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:10.580
at this point
 

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.430
at this point
you should return the created message

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440
you should return the created message
 

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.649
you should return the created message
end of message so this is more useful

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:14.659
end of message so this is more useful
 

00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:16.690
end of message so this is more useful
when you want to add some context to

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:16.700
when you want to add some context to
 

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.169
when you want to add some context to
your end F message so depending on what

00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:20.179
your end F message so depending on what
 

00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:23.320
your end F message so depending on what
state your activity is or maybe if you

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.330
state your activity is or maybe if you
 

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.180
state your activity is or maybe if you
for example if you are on YouTube and

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:25.190
for example if you are on YouTube and
 

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.370
for example if you are on YouTube and
you have some URL that you're watching

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:27.380
you have some URL that you're watching
 

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.110
you have some URL that you're watching
right now which you want to push to the

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120
right now which you want to push to the
 

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.909
right now which you want to push to the
other guy so there is some context here

00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919
other guy so there is some context here
 

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:33.610
other guy so there is some context here
and so you would use this implementation

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:33.620
and so you would use this implementation
 

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.980
and so you would use this implementation
of using a callback and create the end

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:35.990
of using a callback and create the end
 

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.380
of using a callback and create the end
of message appropriately by using the

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:38.390
of message appropriately by using the
 

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.539
of message appropriately by using the
context from your activity and embedding

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:40.549
context from your activity and embedding
 

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:43.210
context from your activity and embedding
that data onto the message and puzzling

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:43.220
that data onto the message and puzzling
 

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.509
that data onto the message and puzzling
that message through so and when this is

00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:46.519
that message through so and when this is
 

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:49.450
that message through so and when this is
done what you get is a callback called

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.460
done what you get is a callback called
 

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.789
done what you get is a callback called
set end F pushed message complete

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799
set end F pushed message complete
 

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:54.190
set end F pushed message complete
callback this is the callback that's

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200
callback this is the callback that's
 

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.930
callback this is the callback that's
invoke when the system is able to

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:55.940
invoke when the system is able to
 

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.360
invoke when the system is able to
reliably beam the message to the other

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.370
reliably beam the message to the other
 

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.379
reliably beam the message to the other
device and so what we discuss here if

00:25:02.379 --> 00:25:02.389
device and so what we discuss here if
 

00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:05.049
device and so what we discuss here if
you there's a short snippet of code on

00:25:05.049 --> 00:25:05.059
you there's a short snippet of code on
 

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:09.730
you there's a short snippet of code on
how it's implemented very simple code on

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:09.740
how it's implemented very simple code on
 

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.090
how it's implemented very simple code on
create we set the end F message push

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.100
create we set the end F message push
 

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.629
create we set the end F message push
call back and this is the the other

00:25:16.629 --> 00:25:16.639
call back and this is the the other
 

00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:18.039
call back and this is the the other
implementation which is the

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:18.049
implementation which is the
 

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.509
implementation which is the
implementation of implementing an

00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:19.519
implementation of implementing an
 

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:22.779
implementation of implementing an
interface callback so we have a method

00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:22.789
interface callback so we have a method
 

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:24.669
interface callback so we have a method
implemented here called create and F

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679
implemented here called create and F
 

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:26.680
implemented here called create and F
message which comes from the create end

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:26.690
message which comes from the create end
 

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.220
message which comes from the create end
F message callback at this point what we

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:30.230
F message callback at this point what we
 

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.279
F message callback at this point what we
do is we construct we construct a and F

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:33.289
do is we construct we construct a and F
 

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:36.730
do is we construct we construct a and F
message so like we said and F message is

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:36.740
message so like we said and F message is
 

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.169
message so like we said and F message is
basically an array of 1 on 0 or more and

00:25:41.169 --> 00:25:41.179
basically an array of 1 on 0 or more and
 

00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:43.750
basically an array of 1 on 0 or more and
F records so in this case what we do is

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760
F records so in this case what we do is
 

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.029
F records so in this case what we do is
we have this method called create mine

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039
we have this method called create mine
 

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:48.509
we have this method called create mine
record and this is a custom method so

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:48.519
record and this is a custom method so
 

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:50.889
record and this is a custom method so
what create mine record does is

00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:50.899
what create mine record does is
 

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:54.490
what create mine record does is
basically creates the first end F record

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:54.500
basically creates the first end F record
 

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.490
basically creates the first end F record
as the mime type of the data in this

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:57.500
as the mime type of the data in this
 

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.980
as the mime type of the data in this
case it's a ASCII is the mime type

00:25:59.980 --> 00:25:59.990
case it's a ASCII is the mime type
 

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.019
case it's a ASCII is the mime type
because we are sending some test text

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:02.029
because we are sending some test text
 

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:06.850
because we are sending some test text
across so it what it does is puts the

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:06.860
across so it what it does is puts the
 

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.000
across so it what it does is puts the
the mime type as the first end of record

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.010
the mime type as the first end of record
 

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.480
the mime type as the first end of record
and then uses the rest of the message in

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:13.490
and then uses the rest of the message in
 

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.279
and then uses the rest of the message in
this case it's just a text that says

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:15.289
this case it's just a text that says
 

00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:18.460
this case it's just a text that says
beam me up and it uses this to add to

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:18.470
beam me up and it uses this to add to
 

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.610
beam me up and it uses this to add to
the payload of the end F message which

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:21.620
the payload of the end F message which
 

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.400
the payload of the end F message which
is the records falling from index 1 to

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.410
is the records falling from index 1 to
 

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.670
is the records falling from index 1 to
as long as your depends so but the first

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:27.680
as long as your depends so but the first
 

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.030
as long as your depends so but the first
record is always the mimetype

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.040
record is always the mimetype
 

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.900
record is always the mimetype
and how do you receive this B message so

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:34.910
and how do you receive this B message so
 

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.660
and how do you receive this B message so
what we've done till now is we've

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:37.670
what we've done till now is we've
 

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.270
what we've done till now is we've
created the end F message and when our

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:40.280
created the end F message and when our
 

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.950
created the end F message and when our
activities in foreground the system will

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960
activities in foreground the system will
 

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.990
activities in foreground the system will
try to be in this message so on the

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000
try to be in this message so on the
 

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.930
try to be in this message so on the
other device which is in close proximity

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:45.940
other device which is in close proximity
 

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.510
other device which is in close proximity
you have the NFC you have to filter your

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520
you have the NFC you have to filter your
 

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.330
you have the NFC you have to filter your
NFC intent action in depth discovered

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:52.340
NFC intent action in depth discovered
 

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.610
NFC intent action in depth discovered
this will make sure that the system

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:54.620
this will make sure that the system
 

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.530
this will make sure that the system
knows that you are having you have a

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:56.540
knows that you are having you have a
 

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.180
knows that you are having you have a
component or you have an activity that's

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:58.190
component or you have an activity that's
 

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.590
component or you have an activity that's
interested in this intent and when you

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600
interested in this intent and when you
 

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.240
interested in this intent and when you
declare this intent you declare it with

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.250
declare this intent you declare it with
 

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.460
declare this intent you declare it with
the URL or mine type of interest to you

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:06.470
the URL or mine type of interest to you
 

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:11.080
the URL or mine type of interest to you
which means so for example our our code

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:11.090
which means so for example our our code
 

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.030
which means so for example our our code
that we just saw in the last slide was

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.040
that we just saw in the last slide was
 

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.940
that we just saw in the last slide was
trying to send you some ASCII text so

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:15.950
trying to send you some ASCII text so
 

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.400
trying to send you some ASCII text so
you may declare in this when you declare

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:18.410
you may declare in this when you declare
 

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.800
you may declare in this when you declare
this in your manifest you may say that I

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:20.810
this in your manifest you may say that I
 

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.200
this in your manifest you may say that I
am only interested in text if there is

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.210
am only interested in text if there is
 

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.000
am only interested in text if there is
an NFC intent with the message that

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.010
an NFC intent with the message that
 

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.980
an NFC intent with the message that
carrying text I am interested or if

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:26.990
carrying text I am interested or if
 

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.830
carrying text I am interested or if
there is NFC message with carrying some

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840
there is NFC message with carrying some
 

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.200
there is NFC message with carrying some
image data I am interested so you

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.210
image data I am interested so you
 

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.180
image data I am interested so you
declare also your mind type of interest

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.190
declare also your mind type of interest
 

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.700
declare also your mind type of interest
so again like you said it should be the

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:39.710
so again like you said it should be the
 

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.980
so again like you said it should be the
same as the first end of record of the

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:41.990
same as the first end of record of the
 

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.780
same as the first end of record of the
incoming message because that's where we

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:43.790
incoming message because that's where we
 

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.360
incoming message because that's where we
kept the mime type of theory of the

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.370
kept the mime type of theory of the
 

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.490
kept the mime type of theory of the
message so once you do that and let's

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:51.500
message so once you do that and let's
 

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:59.410
message so once you do that and let's
look at some simple code here it is this

00:27:59.410 --> 00:27:59.420
look at some simple code here it is this
 

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.870
look at some simple code here it is this
is the method that's invoked on on new

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880
is the method that's invoked on on new
 

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.090
is the method that's invoked on on new
intent which is what will get called

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:04.100
intent which is what will get called
 

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:12.430
intent which is what will get called
when so this method is what we are

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:12.440
when so this method is what we are
 

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.700
when so this method is what we are
invoking on our new intent and so that

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:15.710
invoking on our new intent and so that
 

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.050
invoking on our new intent and so that
means there is an incoming message now

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:17.060
means there is an incoming message now
 

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.870
means there is an incoming message now
that we are ready to process so what we

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880
that we are ready to process so what we
 

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.980
that we are ready to process so what we
do now is using the get extras of the

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:23.990
do now is using the get extras of the
 

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.620
do now is using the get extras of the
intent we try to obtain the raw message

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:26.630
intent we try to obtain the raw message
 

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.230
intent we try to obtain the raw message
which is the end F message and the end

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240
which is the end F message and the end
 

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.900
which is the end F message and the end
of messages 0 or the beginning element

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:31.910
of messages 0 or the beginning element
 

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.820
of messages 0 or the beginning element
of the wrong message array and this is

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:33.830
of the wrong message array and this is
 

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.190
of the wrong message array and this is
the only element right now so once we

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200
the only element right now so once we
 

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.810
the only element right now so once we
get the end of message what we want

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:37.820
get the end of message what we want
 

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.820
get the end of message what we want
do is the actual message because the

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:42.830
do is the actual message because the
 

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.310
do is the actual message because the
zero element is the mime type or the URL

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320
zero element is the mime type or the URL
 

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.080
zero element is the mime type or the URL
type what we want to do is get the

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.090
type what we want to do is get the
 

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.060
type what we want to do is get the
payload starting from the zeroth message

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.070
payload starting from the zeroth message
 

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.790
payload starting from the zeroth message
so we say message dot end F message dot

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:51.800
so we say message dot end F message dot
 

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.520
so we say message dot end F message dot
get records and we use a method get

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:54.530
get records and we use a method get
 

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.290
get records and we use a method get
payload which will give us the following

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.300
payload which will give us the following
 

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.050
payload which will give us the following
records from the mind type following the

00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.060
records from the mind type following the
 

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.330
records from the mind type following the
mind type record and this is basically

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:01.340
mind type record and this is basically
 

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.910
mind type record and this is basically
the text message that we had which said

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:03.920
the text message that we had which said
 

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.160
the text message that we had which said
beam me up and this is how you obtain

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.170
beam me up and this is how you obtain
 

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.050
beam me up and this is how you obtain
the message so as you can see it's just

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:08.060
the message so as you can see it's just
 

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.870
the message so as you can see it's just
ten lines of code on both sides on both

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880
ten lines of code on both sides on both
 

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.240
ten lines of code on both sides on both
devices and sending the intent as well

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.250
devices and sending the intent as well
 

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.250
devices and sending the intent as well
as receiving the intent and your app is

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.260
as receiving the intent and your app is
 

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.070
as receiving the intent and your app is
now NFC being capable you may have some

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080
now NFC being capable you may have some
 

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.440
now NFC being capable you may have some
more use cases like Tony discussed how

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:20.450
more use cases like Tony discussed how
 

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.230
more use cases like Tony discussed how
to set up a handshake for Bluetooth with

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240
to set up a handshake for Bluetooth with
 

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.000
to set up a handshake for Bluetooth with
NFC and then in this case you might want

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.010
NFC and then in this case you might want
 

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.140
NFC and then in this case you might want
to exchange some more data of different

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.150
to exchange some more data of different
 

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.870
to exchange some more data of different
mime type in the two devices if you want

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880
mime type in the two devices if you want
 

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.310
mime type in the two devices if you want
to initiate a Bluetooth connection or if

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320
to initiate a Bluetooth connection or if
 

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.920
to initiate a Bluetooth connection or if
you want to send across images or some

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:32.930
you want to send across images or some
 

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.890
you want to send across images or some
other sort of text data but in general

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:35.900
other sort of text data but in general
 

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.470
other sort of text data but in general
this is how NFC works is put the mime

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480
this is how NFC works is put the mime
 

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.750
this is how NFC works is put the mime
type onto the first record create the

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760
type onto the first record create the
 

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.580
type onto the first record create the
other records with the payload and push

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:42.590
other records with the payload and push
 

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.420
other records with the payload and push
the payload across declare the intent

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:45.430
the payload across declare the intent
 

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:51.490
the payload across declare the intent
NFC discovered and then once you have

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:51.500
NFC discovered and then once you have
 

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.860
NFC discovered and then once you have
the in turn in your activity on new

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:53.870
the in turn in your activity on new
 

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:55.450
the in turn in your activity on new
intent you try to process this message

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.460
intent you try to process this message
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.790
intent you try to process this message
by obtaining the rori card and then

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:57.800
by obtaining the rori card and then
 

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.580
by obtaining the rori card and then
getting the Paylor from the record and

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:00.590
getting the Paylor from the record and
 

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.140
getting the Paylor from the record and
all this happens on foreground and

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.150
all this happens on foreground and
 

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.880
all this happens on foreground and
that's how NFC beam works your app has

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:03.890
that's how NFC beam works your app has
 

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:08.680
that's how NFC beam works your app has
to be on foreground so just a use case

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:08.690
to be on foreground so just a use case
 

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.020
to be on foreground so just a use case
here that what may happen sometimes is

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.030
here that what may happen sometimes is
 

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.020
here that what may happen sometimes is
that there may be many there may be

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.030
that there may be many there may be
 

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.450
that there may be many there may be
multiple applications on the device that

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:16.460
multiple applications on the device that
 

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.390
multiple applications on the device that
may be interested in listening to NFC

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:19.400
may be interested in listening to NFC
 

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.700
may be interested in listening to NFC
messages incoming messages of a certain

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:21.710
messages incoming messages of a certain
 

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.070
messages incoming messages of a certain
mime type this could be very common for

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080
mime type this could be very common for
 

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.170
mime type this could be very common for
something like a contact or image or

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.180
something like a contact or image or
 

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.000
something like a contact or image or
text there will be multiple applications

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.010
text there will be multiple applications
 

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.880
text there will be multiple applications
so if your application is sending bad

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:30.890
so if your application is sending bad
 

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.880
so if your application is sending bad
message or is beaming that message and

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:33.890
message or is beaming that message and
 

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.130
message or is beaming that message and
you sort of want to guarantee the

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.140
you sort of want to guarantee the
 

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.170
you sort of want to guarantee the
delivery of the message back to your app

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.180
delivery of the message back to your app
 

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.360
delivery of the message back to your app
on the other phone what you can do is

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:40.370
on the other phone what you can do is
 

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.070
on the other phone what you can do is
use something called application record

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080
use something called application record
 

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.960
use something called application record
and this is Android application record a

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:45.970
and this is Android application record a
 

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.460
and this is Android application record a
this is very simple implementation what

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:48.470
this is very simple implementation what
 

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.980
this is very simple implementation what
it does is just puts the package name of

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:50.990
it does is just puts the package name of
 

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.760
it does is just puts the package name of
your app

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:51.770
your app
 

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.000
your app
in the end f message so which basically

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.010
in the end f message so which basically
 

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.970
in the end f message so which basically
means inside the end F message

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:57.980
means inside the end F message
 

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.410
means inside the end F message
everything is an end of record

00:30:59.410 --> 00:30:59.420
everything is an end of record
 

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.510
everything is an end of record
so this basically means that we are

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520
so this basically means that we are
 

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.640
so this basically means that we are
creating an indefinite part which

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:03.650
creating an indefinite part which
 

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.160
creating an indefinite part which
contains the package name of our app so

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.170
contains the package name of our app so
 

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.890
contains the package name of our app so
this is to specifically target er app at

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:08.900
this is to specifically target er app at
 

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.570
this is to specifically target er app at
the receiving end of the message this

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:10.580
the receiving end of the message this
 

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.120
the receiving end of the message this
increases the probability that your app

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.130
increases the probability that your app
 

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:14.500
increases the probability that your app
will be the first app to pick up the

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:14.510
will be the first app to pick up the
 

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.260
will be the first app to pick up the

mime types and once you see the data you
 

00:32:17.809 --> 00:32:20.410
mime types and once you see the data you
are able to parse it using getting the

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:20.420
are able to parse it using getting the
 

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.600
are able to parse it using getting the
raw record and then looking through the

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.610
raw record and then looking through the
 

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.590
raw record and then looking through the
record to for the payload so this pretty

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600

use the app URI like this my app colon

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:27.500
use the app URI like this my app colon
 

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.000

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:38.870
because it ignores the URI so I the so
 

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.190
because it ignores the URI so I the so
we talked about intent filter so I am I

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200
we talked about intent filter so I am I
 

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.850
we talked about intent filter so I am I
believe in in in the Gmail client I just

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:45.860

standard HTTP URI is actually is working

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:52.040
standard HTTP URI is actually is working
 

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.970
standard HTTP URI is actually is working
and so you in your you know application

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:54.980
and so you in your you know application
 

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.690
and so you in your you know application
so one suggestions I can think of is you

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:58.700
so one suggestions I can think of is you
 

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.670
so one suggestions I can think of is you
can have an intent filter actually

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:00.680
can have an intent filter actually
 

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.330
can have an intent filter actually
filter by some specific URL so if you if

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:04.340
filter by some specific URL so if you if
 

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.169
filter by some specific URL so if you if
you if you have some URL you can your

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:08.179
you if you have some URL you can your
 

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.210
you if you have some URL you can your
application only your application can

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:10.220
application only your application can
 

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.110
application only your application can
understand so you can you can and you

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.120
understand so you can you can and you
 

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.909
understand so you can you can and you
can use that to filter by that so you

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919
can use that to filter by that so you
 

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:17.500
can use that to filter by that so you
don't you don't need to use a different

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:17.510
don't you don't need to use a different
 

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.710
don't you don't need to use a different
kind of scheme so that would be my

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720
kind of scheme so that would be my
 

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.750
kind of scheme so that would be my
suggestions anyway do you have anything

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760
suggestions anyway do you have anything
 

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.020
suggestions anyway do you have anything
to add on top of that I think that's the

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.030
to add on top of that I think that's the
 

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.490
to add on top of that I think that's the
easiest ways to go through is something

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:27.500
easiest ways to go through is something
 

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.260
easiest ways to go through is something
that the framework already understands

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:29.270
that the framework already understands
 

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.730
that the framework already understands
and the Gmail app understands is the

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:30.740
and the Gmail app understands is the
 

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.340
and the Gmail app understands is the
HTTP URI the other thing I could think

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:33.350
HTTP URI the other thing I could think
 

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.889
HTTP URI the other thing I could think
of is maybe your confirmation because

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:35.899
of is maybe your confirmation because
 

00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:38.710
of is maybe your confirmation because
could come as a file which is of your

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720
could come as a file which is of your
 

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.960
could come as a file which is of your
application type and once the user

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:40.970
application type and once the user
 

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.090
application type and once the user
downloads the file maybe a patch you

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.100
downloads the file maybe a patch you
 

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.530
downloads the file maybe a patch you
know like an unlocked patch or something

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:44.540
know like an unlocked patch or something
 

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.450
know like an unlocked patch or something
from the user downloads that file your

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:46.460
from the user downloads that file your
 

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.340
from the user downloads that file your
app is registered to open the file of

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.350
app is registered to open the file of
 

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.960
app is registered to open the file of
that type that may be another way of

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:49.970
that type that may be another way of
 

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:58.270
that type that may be another way of
handling this so the second questions we

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280
handling this so the second questions we
 

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.420
handling this so the second questions we
have here is anything new about NFC in

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.430
have here is anything new about NFC in
 

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.620
have here is anything new about NFC in
4.2 API level 17 that you are not

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:05.630
4.2 API level 17 that you are not
 

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.260

about arm so
 

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.950
about arm so
I haven't seen actually uh anything I am

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960
I haven't seen actually uh anything I am
 

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.859
I haven't seen actually uh anything I am
aware of like super new on 4.2 you arm

00:35:17.859 --> 00:35:17.869
aware of like super new on 4.2 you arm
 

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:22.390
aware of like super new on 4.2 you arm
so I need to double check that and if we

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400
so I need to double check that and if we
 

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.460
so I need to double check that and if we
have something that we can we can talk

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:24.470
have something that we can we can talk
 

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.230
have something that we can we can talk
about maybe we can talk about that in

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240
about maybe we can talk about that in
 

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:34.140
about maybe we can talk about that in
the in the next or future adl+ so yeah

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.150
the in the next or future adl+ so yeah
 

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:40.180
the in the next or future adl+ so yeah
so I knew it okay why don't you take the

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:40.190
so I knew it okay why don't you take the
 

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.499
so I knew it okay why don't you take the
next question I would like to the

achieve by rooting because I'm not
 

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.940
achieve by rooting because I'm not
really familiar and not something we

you have anything so you had just add

00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:22.309
you have anything so you had just add
 

00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:24.760
you have anything so you had just add
something to it I think there are some

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:24.770
something to it I think there are some
 

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.940
something to it I think there are some
open-source projects that are catering

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:27.950
open-source projects that are catering
 

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.800
open-source projects that are catering
to these frameworks or adaptations of

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:29.810
to these frameworks or adaptations of
 

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.690
to these frameworks or adaptations of
these frameworks on Android I sure you

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:31.700
these frameworks on Android I sure you
 

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.800
these frameworks on Android I sure you
know there is something called spring

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:32.810
know there is something called spring
 

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:38.170
know there is something called spring
Android and definitely jetty right this

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.180
Android and definitely jetty right this
 

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.420
Android and definitely jetty right this
so there is a web server tiny HTTP web

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:40.430
so there is a web server tiny HTTP web
 

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:41.680
so there is a web server tiny HTTP web
server or something like that available

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:41.690
server or something like that available
 

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.450
server or something like that available
for Android and these are open source so

for Android and these are open source so
 

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.550
for Android and these are open source so
I think it would have any for you would

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560
I think it would have any for you would
 

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.320
I think it would have any for you would
be to work with these guys spring

Android is a project where you can go

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800
Android is a project where you can go
 

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.090
Android is a project where you can go
and contribute and yeah so these are

and contribute and yeah so these are
 

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.280
and contribute and yeah so these are
this is how you can look with community

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:54.290
this is how you can look with community
 

00:37:54.290 --> 00:38:00.609
this is how you can look with community
that's one idea of and they would want

00:38:00.609 --> 00:38:00.619
that's one idea of and they would want
 

00:38:00.619 --> 00:38:03.730
that's one idea of and they would want
to take a did mix one yes so the next

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:03.740
to take a did mix one yes so the next
 

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.040
to take a did mix one yes so the next
question is from Shiv Shankar Hyderabad

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.050
question is from Shiv Shankar Hyderabad
 

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.380
question is from Shiv Shankar Hyderabad
India the question is I need to process

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:08.390
India the question is I need to process
 

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:10.480
India the question is I need to process
I need the process of changing the

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:10.490
I need the process of changing the
 

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.430
I need the process of changing the
bitrate of an audio file which should be

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440
bitrate of an audio file which should be
 

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.660
bitrate of an audio file which should be
used on Android SDK so question is not

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:16.670
used on Android SDK so question is not
 

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:18.850
used on Android SDK so question is not
really clear to me as I get the first

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:18.860
really clear to me as I get the first
 

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.950
really clear to me as I get the first
part that process of changing the

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960
part that process of changing the
 

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.690
part that process of changing the
bitrate of an audio file so we have

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:22.700
bitrate of an audio file so we have
 

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.850
bitrate of an audio file so we have
media codecs where you can have an input

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:24.860
media codecs where you can have an input
 

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.370
media codecs where you can have an input
buffer and an output buffer and you can

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:27.380
buffer and an output buffer and you can
 

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.320
buffer and an output buffer and you can
specify the types or the media

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:31.330
specify the types or the media
 

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.270
specify the types or the media
properties there and but I don't get the

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280
properties there and but I don't get the
 

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.609
properties there and but I don't get the
part where you say which should be used

00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:36.619
part where you say which should be used
 

00:38:36.619 --> 00:38:40.870
part where you say which should be used
on Android SDK so I mean do you mean

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880
on Android SDK so I mean do you mean
 

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.210
on Android SDK so I mean do you mean
like what should work on the Android OS

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:43.220
like what should work on the Android OS
 

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.950
like what should work on the Android OS
or as we am not really clear maybe if

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960
or as we am not really clear maybe if
 

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.690
or as we am not really clear maybe if
you can drop us a comment on what do you

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:49.700
you can drop us a comment on what do you
 

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.180
you can drop us a comment on what do you
want to say with the second part of your

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:52.190
want to say with the second part of your
 

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.880
want to say with the second part of your
question we'll be able to answer but

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:54.890
question we'll be able to answer but
 

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:58.120
question we'll be able to answer but
just in case for handling audio and

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.130
just in case for handling audio and
 

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.020
just in case for handling audio and
video pipelines you can use you can use

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.030
video pipelines you can use you can use
 

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.390
video pipelines you can use you can use
media codec which is available on the

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400
media codec which is available on the
 

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:11.310
media codec which is available on the
SDK so the next question is from Sweden

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.320
SDK so the next question is from Sweden
 

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.780
SDK so the next question is from Sweden
from Mac Mac 10 so random users of my

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:16.790
from Mac Mac 10 so random users of my
 

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.859
from Mac Mac 10 so random users of my
apps maybe one user a day of 200,000

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:20.869
apps maybe one user a day of 200,000
 

00:39:20.869 --> 00:39:24.370
apps maybe one user a day of 200,000

few second later the power reading works

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:33.609
few second later the power reading works
 

00:39:33.609 --> 00:39:37.660
few second later the power reading works
so our Mac and I actually took a look at

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:37.670
so our Mac and I actually took a look at
 

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:38.770
so our Mac and I actually took a look at
the

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:38.780
the
 

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.940
the
the links you have and doesn't actually

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:42.950
the links you have and doesn't actually
 

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.730
the links you have and doesn't actually
give us too much information maybe we

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:45.740
give us too much information maybe we
 

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.040
give us too much information maybe we
really need to look at some code before

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.050
really need to look at some code before
 

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.980
really need to look at some code before
we can fully answer this but but one

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:50.990
we can fully answer this but but one
 

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.550
we can fully answer this but but one
like idea I can think of maybe is it

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560
like idea I can think of maybe is it
 

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.680
like idea I can think of maybe is it
possible to have some sort of raising

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:56.690
possible to have some sort of raising
 

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.510
possible to have some sort of raising
conditions like that the files actually

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520
conditions like that the files actually
 

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.270
conditions like that the files actually
really doesn't exist if in certain cases

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280
really doesn't exist if in certain cases
 

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.140
really doesn't exist if in certain cases
so that's my kind of guess how about how

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.150
so that's my kind of guess how about how
 

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.510
so that's my kind of guess how about how
about you any rate so anything you can

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520
about you any rate so anything you can
 

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.920
about you any rate so anything you can
you can think of I saw the I saw these

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:14.930
you can think of I saw the I saw these
 

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:18.940
you can think of I saw the I saw these
factories there maybe if you can obtain

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:18.950
factories there maybe if you can obtain
 

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.940
factories there maybe if you can obtain
a buck face from the device which will

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:21.950
a buck face from the device which will
 

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.170
a buck face from the device which will
capture more information on what's

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:23.180
capture more information on what's
 

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.220
capture more information on what's
happening I can see there is a

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:24.230
happening I can see there is a
 

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.710
happening I can see there is a
permission denied by the UNIX API is

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720
permission denied by the UNIX API is
 

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.710
permission denied by the UNIX API is
there but yeah I mean a buttress would

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720
there but yeah I mean a buttress would
 

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.200
there but yeah I mean a buttress would
probably help narrowing what's happening

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:32.210
probably help narrowing what's happening
 

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:39.480
probably help narrowing what's happening
so if you can grab one from your users

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.490
 
 

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.520
 
maybe even random failure of flash drive

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:42.530
maybe even random failure of flash drive
 

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:48.550
maybe even random failure of flash drive
or storage all right so how about the

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560
or storage all right so how about the
 

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.550

maybe you can just pack us to post a

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200
maybe you can just pack us to post a
 

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:43.420
maybe you can just pack us to post a
question and so let's take a look the

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:43.430
question and so let's take a look the
 

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.670
question and so let's take a look the
last question so so what what our where

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680
last question so so what what our where
 

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.680
last question so so what what our where
is our best approach is to develop

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:47.690
is our best approach is to develop
 

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.370
is our best approach is to develop
static pages each page contain our tax

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:51.380
static pages each page contain our tax
 

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.160
static pages each page contain our tax
and optional images I'm thinking to use

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.170
and optional images I'm thinking to use
 

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.280

like pages of a real boat while the user

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:00.380
like pages of a real boat while the user
 

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.410

flip left and right through pages of

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:02.420
flip left and right through pages of
 

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:12.430
flip left and right through pages of
data so I mean depending on the size of

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440
data so I mean depending on the size of
 

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.920
data so I mean depending on the size of
the book that you're talking about 200

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:14.930
the book that you're talking about 200
 

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:17.650
the book that you're talking about 200
pages maybe you don't want 200 fragments

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:17.660
pages maybe you don't want 200 fragments
 

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.329
pages maybe you don't want 200 fragments
sitting in a viewpager with

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:19.339
sitting in a viewpager with
 

00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:21.370
sitting in a viewpager with
the data flipping across so what you

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:21.380
the data flipping across so what you
 

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.109
the data flipping across so what you
probably want to do is you know

00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119
probably want to do is you know
 

00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:24.729
probably want to do is you know
instantiate something with five

00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:24.739
instantiate something with five
 

00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:27.489
instantiate something with five
fragments and try to buffer or cycle

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:27.499
fragments and try to buffer or cycle
 

00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:28.809
fragments and try to buffer or cycle
through your content of the book so

00:46:28.809 --> 00:46:28.819
through your content of the book so
 

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.939
through your content of the book so
keeping some pages in the buffer so user

00:46:30.939 --> 00:46:30.949
keeping some pages in the buffer so user
 

00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:33.519
keeping some pages in the buffer so user
can go up and back and then maybe use

00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:33.529
can go up and back and then maybe use
 

00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:36.969
can go up and back and then maybe use
just animations on a given fragment or a

00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:36.979
just animations on a given fragment or a
 

00:46:36.979 --> 00:46:40.329
just animations on a given fragment or a
view to have the the content of one page

00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:40.339
view to have the the content of one page
 

00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:42.039
view to have the the content of one page
of content of the fragment being

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:42.049
of content of the fragment being
 

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:44.140
of content of the fragment being
replaced the text and the image being

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:44.150
replaced the text and the image being
 

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:47.339
replaced the text and the image being
heat placed from your data source again

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:47.349
heat placed from your data source again
 

00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:50.829
heat placed from your data source again
yeah I mean I the the strategy of using

00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839
yeah I mean I the the strategy of using
 

00:46:50.839 --> 00:46:54.279
yeah I mean I the the strategy of using
an activity of the fragment and some

00:46:54.279 --> 00:46:54.289
an activity of the fragment and some
 

00:46:54.289 --> 00:46:59.319
an activity of the fragment and some
animations would be good so Google books

00:46:59.319 --> 00:46:59.329
animations would be good so Google books
 

00:46:59.329 --> 00:47:00.909
animations would be good so Google books
itself was written with render script

00:47:00.909 --> 00:47:00.919
itself was written with render script
 

00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:03.399
itself was written with render script
and under script is a low-level graphics

00:47:03.399 --> 00:47:03.409
and under script is a low-level graphics
 

00:47:03.409 --> 00:47:05.979
and under script is a low-level graphics
and mathematical computation library

00:47:05.979 --> 00:47:05.989
and mathematical computation library
 

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.949
and mathematical computation library
that we introduced so I'm not sure what

00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:08.959
that we introduced so I'm not sure what
 

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.929
that we introduced so I'm not sure what
the kind of development you see on it

00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:10.939
the kind of development you see on it
 

00:47:10.939 --> 00:47:13.029
the kind of development you see on it
going ahead but that's what Google Books

00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:13.039
going ahead but that's what Google Books
 

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:14.649
going ahead but that's what Google Books
was using at that point of time but

00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:14.659
was using at that point of time but
 

00:47:14.659 --> 00:47:16.919
was using at that point of time but
again you have the options using Java

00:47:16.919 --> 00:47:16.929
again you have the options using Java
 

00:47:16.929 --> 00:47:19.689
again you have the options using Java
OpenGL 3d interfaces and to give those

00:47:19.689 --> 00:47:19.699
OpenGL 3d interfaces and to give those
 

00:47:19.699 --> 00:47:22.149
OpenGL 3d interfaces and to give those
effects and animations and even the

00:47:22.149 --> 00:47:22.159
effects and animations and even the
 

00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:25.120
effects and animations and even the
framework the object animator properties

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.130
framework the object animator properties
 

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.239
framework the object animator properties
can give you sort of animation to give

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:28.249
can give you sort of animation to give
 

00:47:28.249 --> 00:47:32.019
can give you sort of animation to give
the effect there but yeah I mean I would

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:32.029
the effect there but yeah I mean I would
 

00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:34.359
the effect there but yeah I mean I would
look at a fragment with a view

00:47:34.359 --> 00:47:34.369
look at a fragment with a view
 

00:47:34.369 --> 00:47:37.959
look at a fragment with a view
containing text and images and some

00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:37.969
containing text and images and some
 

00:47:37.969 --> 00:47:43.059
containing text and images and some
animations there well I guess that's

00:47:43.059 --> 00:47:43.069
animations there well I guess that's
 

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:45.549
animations there well I guess that's
that's all we have in terms of questions

00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559
that's all we have in terms of questions
 

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:50.140
that's all we have in terms of questions
