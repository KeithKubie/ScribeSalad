00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:02.148
- [Instructor] We are told figure two

00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:04.917
is a scaled copy of figure one.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:06.712
So this is figure two here.

00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:07.895
This is figure one.

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:10.771
Looks like figure two not
only has it been scaled down,

00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.992
it's a smaller version,

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:15.875
but it also looks like it
has been rotated 180 degrees

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.909
or you can say it's been
flipped upside down.

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.892
We're asked to identify
the side in figure two

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:26.141
that corresponds to side EA in figure one.

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:29.038
So this is EA in figure one.

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.863
Pause this video and
see if you can identify

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:35.236
the side of figure two that corresponds

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.319
to side EA in figure one.

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:40.887
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:42.803
Some of you might immediately intuit

00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:45.985
or be able to spot which
side corresponds to EA

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:48.597
but I'll do it slightly more
methodically in this video

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:49.860
just so that we can see maybe all

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.462
of the corresponding sides and points.

00:00:52.462 --> 00:00:54.071
So one way to think about it

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.734
is well, it looks like the
longest side in figure one

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:58.651
is side BC.

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:03.027
So this is the longest side in figure one

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:05.586
and then the longest
side in figure two is HL

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.669
so it looks like BC corresponds to HL

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:15.473
and then touching on that longest side,

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:18.484
that longest side has two right angles.

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:21.499
It forms two right angles
with the sides next to it.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.393
So you have these two right
angles right over here

00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:26.389
and then of those two right angles,

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:30.301
you have the shorter side
connected to the longest side

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.953
and so that is BA over here

00:01:32.953 --> 00:01:36.989
and so that would correspond
to LK right over here.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.164
That is the shorter side
connected to the long side

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:42.041
that forms a right angle

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:45.739
and then if we just keep
following that side of the shape,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.152
we then go to side AE which
would correspond now to

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:53.985
and this is answering
our question to side KJ.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.010
So the side in figure two
that corresponds to EA

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.662
in figure one, that is going to be KJ

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:04.579
or we could say side JK

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:08.156
and if someone wanted to say

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:10.594
what points correspond to which point,

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:14.177
well, you can see that
BA corresponds to LK

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:18.010
and BC corresponds to LH

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.561
so we would know for example

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.005
that this point B right over here, point B

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.391
would correspond to point L
in figure two right over here

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.077
and we could use a similar
logic for the other points.

00:02:29.077 --> 00:02:31.172
So we've answered the
questions, the question,

00:02:31.172 --> 00:02:32.257
but the real thing is to see

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:34.750
well, which sides or points

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.601
have similar features on a relative basis?

00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:39.040
So I said what is the longest side?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.975
What is the longest side?

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:41.616
Where do we see right angles?

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:43.239
And sometimes your brain
might just immediately

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.743
be able to spot out the shape.

00:02:44.743 --> 00:02:47.852
If you were to rotate this
one all the way around,

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:49.567
it would jump out at
you a little bit faster

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.817
that JK and AE are corresponding sides.
