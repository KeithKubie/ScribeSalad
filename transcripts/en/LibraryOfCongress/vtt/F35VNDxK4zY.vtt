00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.620
&gt;&gt; Steven Levingston: Good
afternoon, and welcome.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.180
I'm Steve Levingston,
nonfiction book editor

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.110
of the Washington Post,
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.730
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.560
First, a couple quick
housekeeping tings.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.410
We'd like to extend
a word of thanks

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400
to the Festival's
cochairman David Rubenstein

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.900
and the other generous sponsors

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.340
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.450
If you'd like to contribute
your financial support,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.940
there's some information
about that in the program.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.900
Before we begin, I've
been asked to remind you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.120
that these events are being
recorded by the Library

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
of Congress, which may broadcast
them at some future date.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.120
After our author's presentation,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.740
there will be time
for questions.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.100
But if you don't
want to become part

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.570
of the Library's permanent
collection, it may be better

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.900
to let someone else
ask the questions.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.710
And now, also, I need to ask you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.440
if you wouldn't mind
silencing your cellphones.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.960
That also would be wonderful.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260
Thank you.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000
Most writers can only
dream of the success

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.590
that Jeffery Deaver lives
as an everyday reality.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.630
To outsiders, his life as a
writer must be as thrilling

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.650
as the books he writes.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.190
If you're here today,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.740
you probably don't
need an introduction

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530
to this master craftsman.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.330
You've probably read more than
a few of Deaver's 30 plus novels

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.280
and his scores of short stories.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.130
Once you start reading,
you can't stop.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.380
That's the amazing
talent of Jeffrey Deaver.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.390
He makes best sellerdom
[phonetic] look easy.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.660
But his sales aren't the
only measure of his success.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.470
He has collected a shelf full
of awards, the Nero Wolf Award,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.190
three Ellery Queen
Readers' Awards,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.820
the Ian Fleming Steel Dagger and
the Short Story Dagger Award.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.570
He is among that rare group of
elite writers chosen to carry

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.100
on the James Bond franchise.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.530
In its review of Carte Blanche,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.690
the Washington Post said
Deaver brilliantly captured the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.770
immortal character of James Bond

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.410
and called the tail
magnificently manic,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.200
impeccably researched,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.650
with Deaver's trademark
misdirection and twists.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.900
Deaver's best-known series
features the characters you all

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.160
know, quadriplegic
detective Lincoln Rhyme

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.780
and his partner, Amelia Sachs.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.160
His first in the series,
The Bone Collector was made

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.560
into a movie starring Denzel
Washington and Angelina Jolie.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.120
His latest, the 14th
in the series

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.670
out now, is The Cutting Edge.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.030
If you haven't read it, I
don't want to spoil it for you.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.120
I'll let the reviewers entice
you The New York Times said

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.750
Deaver is at his graciously
cruel best in this one.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.170
His flare for ghastly
irony is on full display.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.340
Publishers Weekly gave The
Cutting Edge a starred review,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.510
calling it a roller
coaster ride of a thriller.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870
Well, what more needs
to be said?

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.620
He's the best at what he does.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.510
Please join me in
welcoming Jeffery Deaver.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.080
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.380
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver:
Well thank you, Steve.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.270
And thank you to Karen who's
been wonderful, my escort today

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.100
around this amazing festival.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.390
Thank you to the Library
of Congress and especially,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.280
especially thank you, readers.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.060
You make it all worthwhile
for us.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.910
Now, as Steve said, he gave
you a bit of a background,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.280
but I'll fill in a little bit.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.540
I have written about 40
novels, 80 or so short stories,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.340
an album of country-western
songs, believe it or not.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.980
I respect you too much to sing.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.280
Don't worry.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.100
A nonfiction law book.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.580
I say nonfiction law book.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.370
I do practice fiction,
so you can make

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.650
of that what you
wish, a radio play.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.720
But there's one thing in my
long career I have not tried,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.460
and I thought I would tonight.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.760
Plagiarism.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.150
I've been writing a book about
writing fiction for some years.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.990
It's taken me a little longer.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.950
I do write quite a
bit of my own work,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.630
so it's taken me
a while to do it.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.160
But the format of this book
is where I extract quotations

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.580
from other writers who are far
more intelligent and articulate

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.600
than I and use that as kind of
a springboard to talk about,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.930
I guess what I'd say the
chronological process

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.850
of writing a novel.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.570
And that's what we're
going to do tonight.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.720
We're going to look at the
eight or nine chapter headings,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.330
and don't worry, you'll be out
of here at the allotted time.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.250
And I'll tell you a little bit

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.490
about how I approach this
crazy world of writing.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.280
First, however, I have
to give you, as I'm going

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.200
to do throughout the
evening, some quotations.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.910
But these are devil's
advocates, and we'll start

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.340
with Lillian Hellman, the great
writer from the Round Table

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.720
in the Algonquin Hotel next
to The New Yorker at the time,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.270
New Yorker Magazine at the time.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.770
And Lillian Hellman said this.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.940
If I had to give young writers
any advice about writing,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.040
I would say, never listen

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.620
to writers giving you
advice about writing.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.610
And the brilliant
Somerset Maugham said this.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.350
There are three simple rules
for writing a great novel.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.580
Sadly, no one knows
what they are.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.100
With all respect to those fine

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.910
if somewhat disparate
authors, I disagree.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.470
Given a desire to write,
given a command of whatever,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.770
I was going to say English,

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.510
but whatever language you're
comfortable composing in.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.350
And given this thing called
sweat labor, because a lot

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.340
of writing is simply sitting
down and muscling your way

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.400
through a story or book.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.400
Given those, it's a
skill like anything else.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.220
And you can learn how to do it.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.610
So we're going to begin, again,

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.250
sort of the chronological
process of creating a novel.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.510
And chapter one of
my book is why write?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.970
Why on Earth do we
do this crazy thing.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.850
William Safire said this.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.520
I write because I enjoy
expressing myself,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.410
and writing forces me
to think more coherently

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.630
than when I'm just
shooting my mouth off.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.100
There's a serious side
to why we write too.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.790
Reynolds Price, a great
North Carolinian writer.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.610
I write because it's really
the only thing I'm very good

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.910
at in the world.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.250
And I've got to stay busy
to keep from going crazy.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.490
To keep from dying
of depression.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.270
Jonathan Safran Foer,
why do I write?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.060
It's not that I want
people to think I'm a smart

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.360
or that I'm a good writer.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.100
I write because I want
to end loneliness.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.210
That before and after everything
else is what books do.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.550
They show us that communication
is possible across distance.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.660
And of course, we come
to William Burroughs,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.170
and who doesn't want this
on his or her bucket list.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.490
As a young child, I
wanted to be a writer

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.000
because writers were
rich and famous.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.550
They lounged around
Singapore where smoking opium

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.020
and wearing a yellow
pongee silk suit.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.020
They sniffed cocaine in Mayfair
and lived in the native quarter

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.300
of Tangier languidly
caressing their pet gazelle.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.330
We've all been there, right.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.170
Why do I write?

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.780
I write because I was a nerd.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.760
But I was nerd when the
word meant something.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.730
You know what a nerd is now.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.030
You have a billion dollars,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.730
some kind of social
networking company.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.050
And frankly, you appeared
before Senate subcommittees

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.840
about why you handed the US
election over to the Russians.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.600
I'm sorry.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.100
I swore I was not
going to talk politics.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.050
I was a Leave it to
Beaver kind of nerd.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.600
I said that once
at a presentation,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.900
and this young girl
came up to me.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.200
She was quite cross.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.510
She said Mr. Deaver,
Justin Bieber is not a nerd.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.270
[ Laughter ]

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.260
I was pudgy, clumsy,
socially inept,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.890
no talent for sports whatsoever.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.270
Uniformly ignored by pom-pom
girls and cheerleaders.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.670
It was for a pretty good reason

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.250
that I was the last person
picked on the sports team.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.770
Maybe some of you ladies
and gentlemen will know

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.260
that experience, that
mortifying experience.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.690
They would put me in, I
think it was right field

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.990
where statistically
fewer balls were hit

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.720
where I could do
the least damage.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.690
And understandably, because
I would be sitting there.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.520
And I had the, I'd get the
glove on the correct hand.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.750
Then I'd be looking up
saying, that cloud is cool.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.650
You know, that cloud, I could
make a story out of that cloud.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.550
But then I'd be, even then I
was writing as a young boy.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.660
And I think I can remember it.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.210
I'd write poetry.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.030
The score is tied
three boys on base.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.490
I see the batter's happy face

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.820
as he grips the bat
and looks my way.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.310
All I can do is hope and
pray that he won't hit to me.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.610
But we all know how it goes.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.910
He whacks that ball
and it breaks my nose.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.050
Well, you know, it
didn't matter,

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.640
because I had something
better than sports.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.420
I had the Glen Allen
Public Library

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.100
where I spent my
after-school hours.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.220
Where I spent many summers.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.370
I fell in love with these
things called books.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.080
They could take us
out of ourselves,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.750
out of our daily cares.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.050
They could teach us about things

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.400
that we have no other
way of learning.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.090
And they did something else.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.860
Do you remember when maybe you
were the new kid at school,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.160
and you were mortified.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.820
You didn't know a soul.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.980
And you'd look across the
playground and kind of sidle

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.920
up to somebody too
shy to say anything.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.100
But then you noticed
they were holding a copy

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.540
of Lord of the Rings.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.060
Or Laura Ingalls Wilder's
Little House on the Prairie.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.140
Or Ray Bradbury.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.660
And only then could
make eye contact.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.650
And you say, you get to the
part about the dragon yet?

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.550
Or did you meet this
character or that?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.490
And then your eyes locked, and
even though you didn't know

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.090
that person from Adam
or Eve, you really did.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.820
Why? Because of books.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.200
Books brought you together.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.280
I knew then at a young
age that I wanted

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.550
to devote my life to writing.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.330
That was chapter one.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.630
Why do we write?

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.900
Chapter two, finding a
subject to write about.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.830
Francine Matthews said
this, and actually,

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.920
I was with Francine
Matthews when I heard her say

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.370
that at the National
Book Festival.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.830
Francine said, I always
heard write what you know.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.130
I disagree.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.080
I say write about what you love.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.980
You can always research
the rest.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.210
Flannery O'Connor, anybody

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.120
who has survived childhood
has enough material about life

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.530
to last for the rest of
their days as a writer.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.320
Where do I get my ideas,
what do I write about?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.770
I was on a panel in England
a few years ago with one

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.070
of the great [inaudible]
of cozy fiction.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.370
And you're in the genre room,

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.950
so you know cozy fiction are
little softer kind of books,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.720
Agatha Christie books.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.730
And the question
was posed to her.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.030
She was the headliner.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.290
And she said, well
where do I get my ideas.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.990
I sit down in my parlor
with a cup of tea,

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.430
and I wait for my muse,
whose name was Philomena,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.460
to tap me on the head
with her magic wand

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.370
and poof, there's an idea.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.670
Well, I laughed, of course.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.970
Who wouldn't?

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.270
I chortled.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.570
It wasn't a laugh.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.870
It was like one of
those visceral chortles,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.540
and not a soul in the
audience was smiling.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.610
They were staring reverently
at this wonderful writer in awe

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.920
of her and Philomena, the muse.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.610
And you know how you try
to turn that into a cough.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.890
It doesn't work.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.720
And so then the question
went to me.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.450
And you know in this
day and age,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.470
everything you have ever
said is on the internet,

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.370
along with everything
you've done in Cabo

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.670
and should not have done.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.440
But it's all there.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.480
So, I had to tell the truth.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.540
I said well, you know,
frankly I sit down.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.170
In America we don't really
have parlors and such.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.030
We have studies or dens.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.940
I have a beverage too.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.000
It ain't tea.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.440
And I try to simply
think of a way

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.150
to scare the ever-living
hell out of you.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.920
You know, you get into a taxicab
at an airport, a strange city,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.220
and it goes the opposite way

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.860
of where you think
you should be going.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.230
And then you realize there
are no handles on the door,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.780
the beginning of
The Bone Collector.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.050
Mickey Spillane said
people don't read books

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.500
to get to the middle.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.120
We don't pick up a 500-page book
and say I cannot wait to get

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.030
to page 250 and put it down.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:40.880
So I look, I look very,
very hard at a story

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.520
that will allow me
to move very quickly.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.580
That will allow me to scare you.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.290
That will be very tense.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.590
A book to me is the most
emotionally engaging experience

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.460
we can possibly have.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.120
We love, I binge on TV.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.820
Who doesn't love, you know,
the new Get Shorty on Epix.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.470
Or Breaking Bad.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.820
We all play Candy
Crush or Crunch.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.050
I don't, so otherwise I
would know what the name is.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.160
But you know, we
have fun doing that.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.910
We look at wonderful paintings,
listen to symphony orchestras.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.580
But we participate
with the author

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.700
in the creation of the story.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.080
We see it in our head.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.890
Whether we listen to it
on audio or we read it,

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.530
we are living, breathing
partners.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.950
And so I look for something

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.620
that will create the most
engaging emotional experience

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.920
we can.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.220
You should miss bus stops.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.790
You should show up
for work late.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.560
So that's, anyway,
that's what I look for,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.650
ideas that will let me
race through the book.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.060
Chapter three, and this
is a bit controversial.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.530
I'm sure there's some
writers out there.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.650
And the world is divided
into the two groups I'm

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.210
about to talk about, and
I'll describe it in a moment.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.320
A quotation from
Joyce Carol Oates.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.690
Joyce Carol Oates.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.590
The first sentence of your
story cannot be written

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.740
until you know what
the last sentence is.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.210
Ernest Hemingway,
prose is architecture,

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.980
not interior design.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.870
Gustave Flaubert, books are
made the way pyramids are made,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.690
according to a long-pondered
plan.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.740
And then the blocks of stone
are set one atop the other.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.450
I subscribe to this theory.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.220
The world I was talking
about was divided

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.960
into plotters and pantsers.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.040
Plotters as in those of us who
outline and pantsers as in seat

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.980
of the pants, and they wing it.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.940
And I'm sorry, I'm a
bit adamant about this.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.610
I don't get on an airplane that
has not been built according

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.870
to engineering diagrams
long ahead of time.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.830
I don't go into surgery if
the doctor has not, you know,

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.140
planned out exactly
what is going to happen.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.200
Why should I read a book that
has not been crafted that way?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.340
What I do is spend eight
months on my outline.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.840
It's a full-time job.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.110
I do the research at the
same time, so it's kind

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.990
of the preparation
aspect of the book.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.860
It is so important to do.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.570
And there are two main
reasons why I believe firmly

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.870
that one should outline.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:10.130
First of all, thrillers,
and I'll even extend

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.750
that to any genre
fiction, and you know what,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.800
I'm going to extend it
to any story you tell

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.280
at all, is about structure.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.690
It is about structure
and as much as

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.790
or more so than fine prose.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.270
I would much rather
read pedestrian writing.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:33.100
I write in a very meat and
potatoes kind of style and

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.050
yet have a structured
story that follows,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.170
say a symphonic structure.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.800
And I'll tell you what
I mean about that.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.150
If Beethoven had created five
vivace movements after another,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.470
you're going to get
bored by the last two.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.540
On the same token, if
there are five adagios,

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.460
you're going to fall asleep.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.760
What does he do?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.020
He intersperses those sort of
assigned curve to the crescendo,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.260
[singing] da, da, da,
da, da, da, da, da.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.680
[Speaking] And then at
the end there's a coda,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.310
a reconciliation of the themes.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.290
And what an exciting
experience that is.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.330
And Beethoven knew how to get
us excited and get us going.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.630
A thriller should
be the same thing.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.940
And an outline let's
you do that.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.070
You can look at your post-it
notes, and you can say oh now,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.490
I've got two, I've
got two bodies,

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.790
one right next to another.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.630
We've got to change that scene.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.290
Outline lets you structure.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.810
And the second reason
to outline.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.090
You don't have to raise your
hand, but just ask yourself,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.500
have you ever read a book that
should not have been written?

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.620
How does that happen?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.900
Let's say you come up with
a beautiful set piece,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.110
and set piece in the literature

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.700
and the movie business is
simply a very exciting scene

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.200
where it doesn't
necessarily have

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.880
to be action, though
it often is.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.530
The beginning of Deadpool,
the movie, for instance,

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.090
which some of you have seen,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.430
whether you want
to admit it or not.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.960
It was a great film.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.310
But, you come up with this great
idea for your first chapter,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.530
the prologue, chapter
one, so exciting.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.750
And you sit down, and this
chapter writes itself.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.580
Five hours, six hours, bang,

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.140
you've got 30 pages
of a perfect chapter.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.150
Wow, that is so good.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.160
And the energy is up, and the
steam is up, and you just,

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160
chapter two, chapter
three, chapter four.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.290
Chapter five is kind
of a brick wall.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:31.190
But you've created 180 or so
pages of well-crafted prose.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.590
and I guarantee that everybody

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.260
in this room can write
well-crafted prose.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.180
You can do it if you know
what you want to write.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.480
You can do it.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.220
Well, you've got let's say 200
pages of this bang-up ending,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.090
and you don't know what
the middle is going

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.000
to be, that dreaded middle.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.410
And you think oh, I could
fill it with the clichés

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.030
that we see, a car chase.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.880
Or we've never seen this.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.450
The police detective has
a fight with his captain,

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.720
and the captain demands
the badge and gun.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.090
And he has to go renegade.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.390
I'll put that in.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.680
And then there's no ending,
just a Deus ex Machina ending,

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.600
and the villain comes
from out of left field.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.620
We never saw the villain
until the final scene.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.770
Well, you're confronted
with two choices now.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.710
And you're going to get
my take on it by the,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.140
some of the adjectives I use.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.800
The first take is the
morally reprehensible,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.730
intellectually dishonest,
cowardly approach.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.030
And that's to tack on that
middle, that bad middle

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.000
and do the cliché-ridden
ending and put it

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.760
out in the stream of commerce.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.060
And why is that a crime?

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.520
Because we authors owe you 100%.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.160
And that book would
be less than 100%.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.670
That's option one.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:48.000
Option two is to do the morally
courageous, uplifting, correct

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.780
and righteous thing, throw
it out, every single page.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.210
And that includes that wonderful
bang-up set piece beginning.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.430
Because if you can write a good
beginning, a good set piece

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.150
for a bad novel, think

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.060
of he wonderful set piece
beginning you can start with a,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.760
start your book with
in a good novel.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.550
Now, let's cut to the outline.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.350
You take post-it notes.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.640
You write on the first post-it
note big set piece beginning.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.940
And that's all you write.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.390
That goes in the upper left-hand
corner of your corkboard.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.320
Something you can use, something
very much like the size of that.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.710
And then you start sticking
things in the middle

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.320
and little notes to the size.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.620
Another murder here.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.160
Detective has a fight here.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.360
Three weeks go by, and you're
staring at that corkboard

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.110
and you say, you know,
there's no middle.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.520
There's just, I cannot
think of anything.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.820
There's no middle.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.120
And you look at the end.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.420
No, there's no end.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.720
It's just a cliché.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.690
You wad up 30 post-it
notes, throw it out.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.820
You've wasted a week's time, and
you start over on something new.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.500
Certainly, you can write
the prose if you want.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.490
And maybe you can kind of think
through things ahead of time.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.930
But I myself like to
get it all planned out.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.960
Okay, now we're going to jump
to chapter four, and we're going

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.290
to talk about writing
the novel itself.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:13.150
And this is putting words into,
putting words onto the page.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.120
Nathanial Hawthorne, a
writer's words should dissolve

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.080
into pure thought.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.370
A writer's words should
dissolve into pure thought.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.670
I love that.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.140
What he means by
that, of course,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.530
is that you shouldn't
fill up your story

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.520
with pyrotechnic prose.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.760
You should not put in
similes that are off the wall

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.810
so that the reader reads a
passage and says wow, that is,

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.110
that's fire cracking writing.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.960
That is so damn good.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.410
I have no clue what it means.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.040
But's just great writing.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.340
Nathanial Hawthorne's comments,

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.910
Stephen King said any
words you have to hunt

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.720
for in a thesaurus
is the wrong word.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.180
Stephen King, another
one, said the road

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.610
to hell is paved with adverbs.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.800
I love that.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.950
And since I've mentioned some
wonderful [inaudible] wise sage

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.270
literary philosophers, I'm going

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.810
to quote now my favorite,
Dr. Seuss.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.280
It has often been said
there's so much to be read.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.130
You can never keep all
those words in your head.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.100
So the writer who
breeds more words

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.920
than he needs is making a
chore for the reader who reads.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.680
That's why my belief is,
the briefer the brief is,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.580
the greater the sigh of
the reader's relief is.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.590
And that's why your books
have such power and strength

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.410
when you publish with shorth.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.990
Shorth is better than length.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.050
Less is always more.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:46.370
For my writing the
book itself, as I said,

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.690
I have a very pedestrian style.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.870
You know, our language
skills are pretty much formed

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.360
by the time we're eight
or nine years old.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.730
You expand your vocabulary
considerably.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.840
You learn things about the
dative and ablative cases.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.240
But nonetheless, at
a very young age,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.400
you kind of get your
tone and your voice.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.100
And that's what you
should listen to.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.550
Once the outline is done,
then I can sit down,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.090
and I can write the
book in any order.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.150
I can write the beginning at the
end, the end at the beginning.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.740
I have the, you know, the
chapters all planned out.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.960
I may come to a scene
of a vicious murder,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.260
and I just don't feel

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.770
like viciously murdering
somebody at that point.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.340
You know, we all have
those days, right.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.800
Some of you didn't
respond to that.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.860
Maybe you want to murder
somebody every day.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.630
I myself save those days for
when, well let me explain.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.280
I'm a writer, correct.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.010
What do we writers like most in
the world, excuses not to write.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.110
And what's the best excuse not
to write, yes, the internet

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.610
and YouTube, watching videos
of baby goats in pajamas.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.890
And enough people laugh

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.960
so you know exactly what I'm
talking about, don't you?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.900
So what happens, I
wake up one morning,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.650
and oh no, the internet is out.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:01.950
My cable is gone.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.100
So in a panic, I called the
unnamed Time Warner Cable.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.520
I wasn't going to say that.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.720
And I say, please get
somebody out here.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.770
And they say, okay, tomorrow
morning we'll get a repairman

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.070
there at 8 in the morning,

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.580
and we'll get you
all straightened out.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.750
Eight in the morning comes, nine
comes, ten comes, 11, 12, 4:00,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.370
the guy strolls in, and he
looks at my cable box and says,

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.990
that's a, I don't know, an
XK-42, but I can't work on that.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.510
Those are the days when I want
to viciously murder somebody.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.880
And guess what the name
of my next victim is

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.220
and what unnamed cable
company he works for.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.140
So, anyway.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.100
When you put the prose
together, you have an outline.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.400
You can write it in any order.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.040
Write it in a natural style.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.760
Okay, chapter five, we're going
to look at editing and revising.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.500
Ernest Hemingway said,
there are no great writers.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.780
There are only great rewriters.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.540
And I firmly, firmly
believe that.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.510
If it sounds like writing,
Elmore Leonard said, I rewrite.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.940
For my part, because I bang the
story out very, very quickly,

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.500
I will produce 130,000
words in two months.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.240
But that draft, that's my
first draft, it's two things.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.430
It's too long, and it's sloppy.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.660
Because it's easier to write
long than it is to write short.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:32.980
And it's also easier to write
more sloppily than it is

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.710
to write very concisely
and well.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.280
So, what I do is I let the
manuscript sit for as long

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.080
as I can to get kind
of a fresh take.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.100
And then I revise it.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.210
I do, I must revise 50 times.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.540
Now that's not 100% revision.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.820
Toward the end of that it's
much more finely tuned.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.840
But so, I don't know,

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.550
realistically 35
to 40 or 50 drafts.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.330
Now, if any of you are taking
notes because you think some

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.910
of these comments
might be helpful,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.510
there's one thing you do
absolutely have to do.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:11.720
The first revisions on your
computer, because it's very easy

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.110
to globally search and replace.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.980
If you want to change
names, move chapters

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.130
and paragraphs around, but
then you have to print it out.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.910
Because there may be
some psychologists,

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.160
some reading specialists
here, there may very well be,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.290
and they could tell you
far better than I could.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.560
But there's a different
psychological process

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.420
of experiencing a book on paper.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.720
I guarantee it.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.770
And I have an e-reader, and
I read books a lot, e-books.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.100
But it is a richer experience.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.320
And that means for writers,
that we then see things

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.820
that we would otherwise
have missed on the screen.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.980
And I'm not talking about typos,

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.390
that's true for those,
of course.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.440
But I'm also talking
about conceptual problems.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.640
And you know, it's
kind of artful

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.950
if an author uses the
same word in a paragraph,

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.270
kind of a distinctive word.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.240
An example would be,
this is farfetched,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.540
nobody would ever do this.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.000
But the detective walked into
the avocado-colored room,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.020
and he reached down and
searched for the gun.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.140
And his hand touched something
that was soft as an avocado.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.080
And then he said, you know,
the bad guy stared at hi

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.950
with avocado pits for eyes.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.380
If you haven't read my books,
they are better than that.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.810
Just don't panic.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.110
Don't panic.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.070
But that could, something

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.790
like that could be
missed on the screen.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.780
But when you go to
read the book on paper,

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.790
those things will
jump out for you.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:48.790
Again, then I read it
aloud, the whole book.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.090
I read it aloud.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.820
Because that helps
you find things.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.170
And you know, the
novel form is very new

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.470
in the history of civilization.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:02.330
The storytelling tradition has
always been oral, either plays

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.660
or poetry, read poetry.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.060
And so the idea of people
sitting down and opening a book,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.960
you know, only goes back
a few hundred years.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.450
So I think there should be some
magic in the sound of the words.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.760
And so I read it aloud.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.170
And you can see, you know,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.120
people might stumble two words
together, don't quite fit.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.770
Two sibilance running
into each other.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:26.590
So that's a trick that
I use quite frequently

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.730
with my stories.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.950
Okay, now we have
to talk about this.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.260
Oh my God, chapter six.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.660
Writer's block.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:39.110
I was going to give you the wise
sage literary philosopher name,

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.880
but you're going to
have to guess this one.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:51.530
It, it was, it was, it was, it
was, it was a, it was a, a dark,

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.520
it was a dark and stormy night.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.840
Oh, good writing is hard work.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.600
And who was that?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.620
Snoopy, the beagle, of course.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.090
Terry Pratchett said this.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.340
There's no such thing
as writer's block.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:12.840
It was invented by people in
California who can't write.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.140
Larry Kahaner.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.440
I don't believe in
writer's block.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.050
Do doctors have doctor's block?

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.920
Do plumbers have
plumber's block?

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.010
No, we all have days when
we don't feel like working.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.880
But why do writers turn it
into something so damn special

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.390
by giving it a faintly
romantic name?

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:32.190
Well, I subscribe to
all of the above there.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.820
There is no such thing
as writer's block.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.210
However, there is idea block.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.970
If you know what you want
to write, you can write it.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.270
I guarantee that.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.150
If you have an idea that's
viable, you can write it.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.400
But coming up with those ideas
can be extremely difficult.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.880
That's why the outlines
take me eight months to do.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.500
And that can be, that can
involve pacing back and forth

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.980
in front of that
corkboard trying to figure

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.970
out what the hell is
going to happen here?

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.670
How can I get the clue
in the middle of the book

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.030
so that the reader gets
to the end and says, oh,

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.840
I should have seen that
he was the villain.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.530
I should have figured that out.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.120
But when you do that,
then you can, again,

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.990
write the book in any order.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.650
There is a kind of
writer's block

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.320
that Larry was somewhat
referring to.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.630
You know, a surgeon
wakes up in the morning,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:27.120
and she's got an eight-hour
brain aneurism she has to repair

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.490
and just doesn't want to do it

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.380
because it's a huge
amount of work.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.950
We wake up, we have to copy
edit for eight, ten hours.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.340
Well, you know, I'm
sorry, we get paid to make

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.640
up stuff for a living.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.920
So, you know, we live
a pretty good life.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.450
So you roll up your sleeves.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.040
You get into the room where you
write, and you just do the work.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.340
That's not block.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.270
That's everybody tendency
to be a bit, you know,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.570
frankly just a bit lazy.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.350
And who isn't and who
doesn't mind that?

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.080
Chapter seven, critics
and criticism.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.210
Sebastian Younger.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.600
I wrote my first novel
in seventh grade,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.050
longhand in a green
composition notebook.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.350
My teacher read it aloud

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.920
to the entire class,
chapter by chapter.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.870
No wonder I didn't
have a single friend.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.370
Neil Gaiman.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.560
Remember, when people
tell you something's wrong

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.870
or doesn't work for them
in one of your books,

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.050
they're almost always right.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.270
When they tell you how to fix
it, they're almost always wrong.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.570
David Mitchell.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.870
This is great.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.990
When you show someone
something you've written,

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.490
you give them a sharpened
stake, you're lying

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.680
down in your coffin, and you
say, whenever you're ready.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.400
For me, I've had, you know, I've
been doing this for a long time,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.250
and I've had lots of rejection.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.560
I think one of my favorite
rejections was this.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.040
Do you all know what
self-addressed stamped

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.620
envelopes are?

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.920
Now it's a different world.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.020
You submit your book
electronically in most cases.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.510
But a self-addressed
stamped envelope was

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.860
when you had the 300-page
manuscript in an envelope.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.150
You included in that
package to the publisher

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.500
or agent an envelope addressed
back to you with enough postage

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.390
on it so they would then
send you the manuscript back

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.930
with a probably five to
ten lengthy, pithy critique

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.390
of your book, which told you
in, you know, ten lines how

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.040
to fix it and send
it back to them.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.990
And then whereupon they
would send you a contract

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.530
for the next ten books.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.170
Well, I got back my
self-addressed stamped envelope,

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.820
but I picked it up
and shook it, and no,

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.690
it didn't contain gold and,
you know, it didn't seem

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.020
to have money and lots
of contracts in it.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.110
It had my manuscript, of course.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.730
And here's the form it was in.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.320
It had clearly fallen on
the floor of the publisher,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.640
because the pages were
every which a way.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.530
Those were the days when
you could still smoke,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.040
and there was a cigarette
butt mixed in with it.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.690
And instead of this wise, very
erudite letter telling me how

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.800
to correct the manuscript, it
was my own cover letter upside

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.570
down with a shoe print on it.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.810
And I thought at the
time, well clearly,

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.240
somebody dropped it accidently.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.080
They loved it but
they didn't have time

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.380
to put the pages back together.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.190
Thought they'd send it back, and
the footprint was an accident.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.390
Now, I think they drew straws
to see who got to step on it.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.010
But, you know, I
find that comments,

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.180
that feedback is
very, very important.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.970
I was at a book signing
once in California,

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:29.210
and a woman in her 90s came up
to me afterwards and said oh,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.470
Mr. Deaver, we have a
reading club, a reader's club

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.660
in the retirement community
next to the bookstore.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.640
We read all your
books, and we love them.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.010
But this latest book, you know,
we had some trouble with it.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.300
And I got elected to
come up and, you know,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.000
express our criticism.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.800
And I said, no, no, I like that.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.420
I want to hear what doesn't
want as much as I want

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.720
to hear what does work.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.040
So the next time, I won't do it.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.270
She said well, okay, it's about
the violence in your books.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.920
I said, please tell me.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.270
She said, well, you
know, we read this book,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.820
and we think you're
going soft on us.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.510
The Bone Collector, you
scalded that couple to death

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.810
in that first chapter.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.910
And in chapter 18, you had rats
crawling all over that girl.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.960
In this book, one
guy got stabbed,

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.160
another one got shot,
and they both lived.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.250
We want you to get
back to your roots.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.690
Well, does that mean I'm
going to, you know, make the,

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.160
what are those stupid
movies, Saw, you know,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.180
these ridiculous torture movies?

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.530
No, that's ridiculous.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.080
Okay, well let's, we're going
to get to chapter eight now,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.990
and I do want to leave a
little time for questions.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.840
But chapter eight,
humorous interlude

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.660
on famous rejection letters.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.900
Lest you think this business
is sad and full of drudgery.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.280
Oh no, there's a lot
of humor out there too.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.770
Here's some real quotes
from rejection letters.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.110
I'm sorry, Mr. Kipling,
you don't know how

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.010
to use the English language.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.450
Your poems are remarkable
for their defects and devoid

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.000
of truly poetic qualities,
Emily Dickenson.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.370
It is impossible to sell animal
stories in the United States,

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:12.860
George Orwell's Animal Farm.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:18.210
This book will set publishing
back 25 years, Norman Mailer.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.830
You're welcome to John le Carré.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.600
He has no future.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.630
And my two favorites are,
you'd have a decent book

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.650
if you got rid of
that Gatsby fellow.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:38.020
And I think my all-time
favorite is this.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:43.510
My dear sir, I have to ask,
does it have to be a whale?

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:52.690
[ Laughter ]

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.200
Chapter nine, the
daily life of a writer.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.500
J. K. Rowling.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.950
Be ruthless about
protecting your writing days.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:03.200
That is, don't give in
to analysts' requests

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.140
to have essential or quote, long
overdue meetings on those days.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.730
The funny thing is that
although I've been writing

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.410
as an actual job for several
years now, I still seem to have

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.760
to find time in which to do it.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.280
People don't seem to grasp
that I still have to sit

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.730
down in peace and
write the books,

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:23.150
apparently believing they
pop up like mushrooms

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.690
without my connivance.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.730
I must, therefore,
guard the time allotted

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.230
to writing the way a
Hungarian horntail guards its

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.530
firstborn egg.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.980
Ray Bradbury.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.350
You must write every
single day of your life.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.020
You must lurk in libraries,
climb stacks like ladders

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.040
to sniff books like
perfume and wear them

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.680
like hats upon your crazy head.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.980
Lee Child.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.130
Don't get it right,
get it written.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.780
And Henry Miller.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.080
Keep human.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.380
See people.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.680
Go places.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.980
Have friends.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.280
Drink if you feel like.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.580
For me, it's a job.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.120
That's all it is,
a full-time job.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.960
I was an attorney
for some years.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.580
I was a journalist
for some years.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.980
I spend more time now at
this job than I did then,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.410
even working on Wall
Street many years ago.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:19.340
I find that it is,
it is something

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.500
that you can devote
your entire life to.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.660
You are never bored as an
author if you have your computer

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.670
with you're a pen and paper.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.970
Ideas pop up.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.270
I write them down.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.570
I may use them.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.870
I may not.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.170
But it's very consuming.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.130
And when I tell my students,
you have to ask yourself,

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:41.310
what kind of relationship
you want with writing.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.750
I write full-time, but
it's a very arduous job.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.050
It's not for everybody.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.590
I like to spend time alone.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.220
I don't play well with others.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.700
That's just the way it is.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.070
But you may not want to do that.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.670
You might want to write
a book every ten years.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.220
You might want to self-publish.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.860
That's all perfectly valid,
but to live your daily life

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.970
as a writer, you have
to kind of figure

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.510
out where you fall
in this crazy world.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.300
Well, these are just a
fraction of the thoughts

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:09.240
that writers have shared about
the craft of telling stories.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.750
How varied are the
authors I've quoted?

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.040
How varied are the
works they've created?

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.560
How separated in time, in
geography and sensibility.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:22.100
But if we step back, we see one
thing they all have in common,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.220
and that's the passionate
desire to reach into the hearts

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.530
and minds of readers
and make them laugh

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.020
or cry or scream in terror.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.260
Somehow, to better understand
this mad world we live in.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.320
And in doing that, to make our
time on Earth a little saner,

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.910
a little richer and
frankly, nothing wrong

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.140
with it, a little more fun.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.020
And you can quote
me on that last one.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.660
So what I'd like to do
now, I think we have,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.400
I am a little long-winded,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.200
but we have about five
minutes for some questions.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.110
And as you gathered, I do teach.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.500
So if nobody volunteers,
I'm going to call on people.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.530
So, and I think the protocol
is we have a microphone here.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.160
Is that right to take?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.010
If anybody would like to
come forward with a question.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.230
Or over there, someone.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.940
Okay, let me think.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.740
Hmm, oh okay, this
gentleman has saved you there.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.040
Okay, thank you.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.340
&gt;&gt; I'm really curious
about your outlines.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.180
How detailed are they?

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.480
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver:
I'm sorry, with the?

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.780
&gt;&gt; Your outlines.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.080
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: Oh how
detailed are my outlines?

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.380
They're quite detailed.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.050
They're about 150 pages,
but they're, singe-spaced,

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.840
but they only take half the,
they have very big margins.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.330
Why? Because when I
research, I have notebooks

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.040
where I transcribe all the
notes I've taken for research,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.530
and I page number those.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.410
So I put my outline in front of
me, and the outline, of course,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:52.040
8 1/2 by 11, so imagine this
part is completely blank.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.370
I open my notebook that
contains the research,

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.200
and I'll see chapter
32, Lincoln Rhyme has

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.030
to solve a clue involving
mustard.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.500
And I've done a lot of
research into mustard,

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.960
and so I look at my book.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.000
Mustard is on page 42 in the
research, so I write P42 here.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.800
And I go through
the entire outline.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.730
By the time it's finished,
so the outline is done,

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.030
all the research is there.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.540
And then I put the
outline in front of me

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.000
and just start writing.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.520
That's how it works.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.820
Any other questions?

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.720
Oh my goodness, I know we're
well past cocktail hour,

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.020
and I do appreciate your
patience coming out.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.320
But yes sir.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.620
&gt;&gt; I'd be interested
to know how you came

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.040
up with your character
Lincoln Rhyme.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.610
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: Where
did Lincoln Rhyme come from?

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:38.520
And if you're not familiar with
him, he is a forensic detective,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.950
ala CSI, although
he predated CSI.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.770
But he's a quadriplegic.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.730
He's paralyzed from the neck

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.580
down in an injury
at a crime scene.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.910
And I created him, oddly enough,
as a reaction to what I saw

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:58.610
in popular fiction that I have,
and I am guilty of it myself.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.930
You see it more in thriller
movies where the hero,

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.070
it comes down to the end, the
big climatic scene at the end.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.070
And the bad guy is
beating up the good guy.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.540
And it's always,
you know, a little,

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.840
we know what's going to happen.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.220
Is there anybody in the
world that doesn't know

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.520
that Tom Cruise and Harrison
Ford are going to prevail?

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.350
And the Jeremy Irons or Philip
Seymour Hoffman doing the star

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.060
turn as the villain
is going to go

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.620
down in a big way,
usually over a cliff.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:28.020
And I thought, there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.450
But let's get that twist in.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:31.750
I like my surprises.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.230
I always have three or four
surprise endings in my books.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.980
So wouldn't it be interesting
if instead of having a gun taped

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.730
up under the table that the
hero remembers, or he gets hit

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.760
in the head and he remembers
his father taught him

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.060
to kickbox when he was eight.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.160
But he had father issues, so
it was a repressed memory.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.260
And then it comes back and beats
the hell out of the bad guy.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.040
How about if my hero
couldn't do that?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.600
He had to outthink the villain.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.490
He had to set up
something in his mind.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:01.790
Sort of Sherlock Holmes.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.860
That's really where
he came from.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.380
And I frankly never
thought he would be

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.550
as popular as he's become.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.320
But, you know, the
comments I get from people

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.070
who many are disabled, and
many not, that you know,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:15.870
we're all our minds first.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.600
Who knows, I don't know karate.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.080
I mean my self-defense is to
look for the exit and run.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.620
That's pretty effective.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.230
But we all are, you
know, our minds

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.690
and our hearts and
our souls first.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:29.940
And I think that's what
Lincoln has embodied.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.240
And I'm working on another one.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.540
You know, I'll keep
writing them for as long

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.000
as you're interested
in reading them.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.060
Do we have time for
maybe one more?

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.360
Okay, we can get a couple more.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.800
Okay. Yes, please.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.100
&gt;&gt; Well I just wondered

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.960
if you believe there's a
book in everyone's life --

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.420
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: I'm
just going to step up here

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.720
so I can hear you a little
better if you don't mind.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.040
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:58.860
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: No, no, no.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.160
&gt;&gt; Do you believe there's a book

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.860
in everyone's life
that can be written?

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.410
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: The
question was a very good one.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.180
Is there a book in everyone's
life that needs to be written?

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.240
I'll be honest.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.540
Probably, probably not.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.320
But I'll tell you why, I'll
tell you why I say that.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.080
Because I approach
writing as a, you know,

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.680
for me it's a business.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.160
A book is a very, very
difficult thing to construct.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.480
I've learned these
techniques I've told you.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.900
I've learned them over,
well I started writing

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.220
when I was 12-years-old.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.520
So a book, no.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.990
But there is a story
that needs to be told.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:39.000
I wrote, as I mentioned,
a lot of poetry.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.830
I wrote short stories.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.570
I have no art ability.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.160
My sister, Julie Reece Deaver
is a very talented artist

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.460
and writer.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.050
She got the art.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.540
But those are ways that
we can tell our stories.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.550
And yes, we have to do that.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.680
A book, I found,
discourages people.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.980
And so the stories within us
don't get out because they start

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:08.150
out by telling a memoir that
is maybe better told in a,

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:12.170
better told in poetry or a
graphic novel or a comic book.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.340
And that's, you know, those
are very serious artforms now.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.890
So yes, tell your story.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:19.070
But just remember
that, you know,

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:24.430
a 400-page novel may be a
bit, may be a bit daunting.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.880
Could we get, yes,
another one please.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.240
&gt;&gt; I have a double question.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.350
So the first one is
related to criticism.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.060
You were talking
about criticism.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.970
I realized in The Cutting Edge

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:41.090
that these detailed
flipcharts you usually had

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.070
in your Lincoln Rhyme
novels, they have to --

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.370
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: I'm sorry,

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.670
I'm getting a lot
of feedback here.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.970
I think maybe the
others can hear you.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.270
I'm just going to step up,

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.130
because it's a little
hard for me to hear.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.280
&gt;&gt; The flipcharts,
they have disappeared

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.060
from The Cutting Edge, so
the detailed flipcharts,

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.590
was that part of a reaction to
feedback you got from readers?

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:00.890
That's the first part.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.770
And the second question
would be, what happened

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.260
to your other character,
Katryn Dance?

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.370
&gt;&gt; Jeffery Deaver: The
question was if you're familiar

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.330
with the Lincoln Rhyme books,
I had charts of evidence in all

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:17.740
of them up to The Cutting
Edge, my most recent, the 14th.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.650
And I found that I was getting
a lot of comments from readers

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.030
that they didn't read them

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.930
because it's very detailed
forensic information.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.420
And I put them in to kind
of orient the reader.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.840
But then I've gotten
feedback over the years

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.430
that they were, they
felt guilty.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.730
They didn't read them.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:38.310
Like they were skimming
over something.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.900
And so I thought I'm
going to leave them out.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.860
And another thing I've done
intentionally, and this,

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.010
you might find this
interesting if you're readers,

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.430
if you're writers, I've taken
the modern sensibilities

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:55.440
of creative, I call
them products.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.510
But we can say creative
efforts, into mind.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.380
What does that mean?

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.800
We binge on TV.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.580
It's a fast-paced life now.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.850
We don't have a lot of time.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.490
My books are a little shorter.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.900
My writing style is a
little more staccato,

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.640
shorter sentences,
shorter words.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:19.660
I will maybe come up with what
I think is an eloquent word

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.630
that might mean people
have to look it up.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:23.930
And I take that out.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.870
I took out the charts.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.090
And you know, I really
am gauging the book

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:31.850
to make it an experience
for everybody.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:33.640
And like everyone else nowadays,

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.220
we want to get the
younger readers involved.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.840
And my books are, you know,

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.820
appropriate for say
14-year-old and up.

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:44.900
So, I, you know, that was
a very conscious effort

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.790
on my part based on feedback.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.250
The other characters, yes,

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.180
Lincoln Rhyme is
the most famous.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.810
And I have to, I
write more of those.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:57.830
I have, you know, many, many
important people depended on me.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:03.090
The CEOs of American Express,
Mastercard, Visa and my bank,

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.810
Wells-Fargo that has the
mortgage on my house.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:08.080
So realistically, to be
honest, it's a business.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.090
I make more money with
the Lincoln Rhyme books.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.770
But I have a Kathryn Dance
book in the works and working

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.670
on a new series right now.

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.690
So I guess that future
plans would be a good way

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:18.990
to say thank you all for coming.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.010
Thank you for your support of
books, and go forth and read.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:24.000
