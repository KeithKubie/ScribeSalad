00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.990
Let's keep messing with our
determinants to see if we can

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.910
get more useful results.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.140
And they might not be obviously
useful right now,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.350
but maybe we'll use them later
when we are exploring other

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.060
parts of linear algebra.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.090
So let's say I have
some matrix, let's

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.420
call it matrix X.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.710
Matrix X is equal to-- I'll just
start with a 3 by 3 case

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.100
because I think the 2 by 2
case is a bit trivial.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.210
Actually, why don't I just
start with a 2 by 2 case.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.020
Let's say matrix X is a, b,
and then it has x1, x2.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.030
I could have called these c and
d, but you'll see why I

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.240
called them x1 and
x2 in a second.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.970
And I'll say I have
another matrix.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.370
Let's say matrix Y is identical
to matrix X except

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.610
for this row.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.820
So matrix Y is a, b y1 and y2.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.950
And let's say we have
a third matrix Z.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.070
That's identical to the first
two matrices on the first row.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.290
So a, b.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.790
but on the second row it's
actually the sum of the two

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.150
rows of x and y.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.070
So it's going to be, this
entry's going to be x1 plus

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:18.910
y1, and this entry right
here is x2 plus y2.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.150
Just like that.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.050
I want to be very clear,
Z is not X plus Y.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.800
All of the terms of Z are
not the sum of all the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.690
terms of X and Y.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.770
I'm only focusing on
one particular row.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.990
And this is just a general theme
that you'll see over and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.920
over again, and we saw it in
the last video and I guess

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.790
you'll see it here, is that
determinants or finding the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.530
determinants of matrices
aren't linear on matrix

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.720
operations, but they are linear
on operations that you

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.330
do just to one row.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.680
So in this case, everything else
is equal except for this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.000
row, and Z has the same first
row as these guys, but its

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.080
second row is the sum of the
second row of these guys.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.090
So let's explore how
the determinants

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.130
of these guys relate.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.270
So the determinant-- let
me do it in X's color.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.639
The determinant of X-- I'll
write it like that-- is equal

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.200
to a ax2 minus bx1.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.070
You've seen that
multiple times.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.670
The determinant of Y is equal
to ay2 minus by1.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.130
And the determinant of Z is
equal to a times x2 plus y2

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.150
minus b times x1 plus y1, which
is equal to ax2 plus

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.150
ay2-- just distributed the
a-- minus bx1 minus by1.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.710
And if we just rearrange things,
this is equal to a--

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.510
let me write it this
way-- this is equal

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.890
to ax2 minus bx1.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.740
That's that term and that term,
we switched colors.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.560
So that's those two guys.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.320
And then plus ay2 minus by1.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.190
Now what is this right here?

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.900
That is the determinant of X.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.290
And this right here is
the determinant of Y.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.190
So there you have it.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.190
If we have matrices that are
completely identical except

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.160
for one row-- and in this case
it's a 2 by 2 matrix, so it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.115
looks like half of the matrix--
and Z's, that row

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:32.080
that we're referring to that's
different, Z's is the sum of

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.530
the other two guys' rows, then
Z's determinant is the sum of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.590
the other two determinants.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.990
So this is a very
special case.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.840
I want to keep reiterating it.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.530
It only works in the case where
this row and only this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.740
row is the sum of this row and
this row, and the matrices are

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.850
identical everywhere else.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.490
Let me show you the 3 by 3 case,
and I think it'll be a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.290
little bit more general.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.420
And then we'll go to n by n.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.500
The n by n is actually, on some
level, the easiest to do,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.430
but it's kind of abstract so I
like to save that for the end.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.300
So let's redefine all those
guys into the 3 by 3 case.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.029
So let's say that X is equal
to a, b, c-- let's just do,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.019
let's make the third row the
row we're going to use to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.810
determine our determinant. a,
b, c, d, e, f-- actually let

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.230
me do the middle row, because I
don't want to make you think

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.670
it always has to be
the last row.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.260
So let's say it's x1, c2, x3,
and you have d, e, f.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.910
And what's the determinant
of X going to be?

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.200
The determinant of X is going
to be equal to-- let's say

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.380
we're going along this
row right here,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.530
that's the row in question.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.690
It's going to be equal to--
well you remember your

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.870
checkerboard pattern-- so it's
going to be-- remember, plus,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.080
minus, plus, minus, plus--
you remember all

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.250
the rest how it goes.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.910
So it's going to start with
a minus x1 times the sub

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.810
matrix-- you get rid of that
column, that row-- b, c, e, f.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.520
Then you have plus x2 times the
sub matrix-- get rid of

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.140
that column, that row--
a, c, d, f.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.200
And then finally minus x3--
you get rid of its row and

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.690
column-- you have a, b, d, e.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.190
Now let me define another matrix
Y that is identical to

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.260
matrix X, except for that row.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.340
So it's a, b, c.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.210
Then down here d, e, f.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.250
That middle row is different.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.410
It's y1, y2, and y3.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.490
What's the determinant
of Y going to be?

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.920
Determinant of Y?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.390
Well it's going to be identical
to the determinant

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.510
of X because all the
sub-matrices are going to be

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.870
the same when you cross
out this row

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.120
and each of the columns.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.660
But the coefficients are
going to be different.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.390
Instead of an x1,
you have a y1.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.460
So it's going to be equal to
minus y1 times the determinant

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:13.320
b, c, e, f plus y 2 times the
determinant of a, c, d f minus

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.210
y3 times the determinant
of a, b, d, e.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.990
I think you see where
this is going.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.330
Now I'm going to create
another matrix.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.680
I'm going to create another
matrix Z just like that that

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.290
is equal to-- it's identical to
these two guys on the first

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.590
and third rows, a,
b, c, d, e, f.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.840
Just like that.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.060
But this row just happens
to be the sum of this

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.233
row and this row.

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:46.420
And when we figured out this
determinant we went along that

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.390
row-- you can see that
right there.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.240
So this row right here is going
to be x1 plus y1, that's

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.750
its first term.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.310
x2 plus y2, and then you
have x3 plus y3.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.110
Now what's the determinant
of Z going to be?

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.010
Well, we can go down this
row right there.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:10.020
So it's going to be minus x1
plus y1 times its sub-matrix--

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.730
get rid of that row, that
column-- you get b, c, e, f.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.470
I think you definitely see
where this is going.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.950
Plus this coefficient, plus x2
plus y2 times its sub-matrix--

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.310
get rid of that row, that
column-- a, c, d, f.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.220
And then you have minus this
guy right here, x3 plus y3

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.820
times its sub matrix-- get
rid of that column and

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.130
row-- a, b, d, e.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.580
Now what do you have
right here?

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.043
This is the determinant of Z.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.790
This right here is the
determinant of Z.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.970
This thing right here.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.430
I think you can see immediately
that if you were

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.650
to add this to this you would
get this right here, right?

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.900
Because you have this
coefficient and this

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.670
coefficient on that.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.240
If you added them up you would
get minus x1 plus y1.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.080
This guy and this guy
add up to this guy.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.500
And then if I were to do
this guy and this guy,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.020
add up to that guy.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.830
Let me do another one.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.720
And then finally that
term plus that term

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.040
add up to that term.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.790
So you immediately see that the
determinant, or hopefully

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:29.580
you immediately see, that the
determinant of X plus the

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:36.095
determinant of Y is equal
to the determinant of Z.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.350
So we did it for the 2 by
2 case, we just did it

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.470
for the 3 by 3 case.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.670
Might as well do it for
the n by n case so we

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.860
know that it works.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.380
But the argument is identical
to this 3 by 3 case.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.760
So that's good to keep in your
mind because 3 by 3 is easy to

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.470
visualize, n by n is sometimes
a little bit abstract.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.240
So let me re-define
my matrices again.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.020
I'm just going to do the
same thing over again.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.660
So I'm going to have
a matrix X.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.370
But it's an n by n matrix.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.330
So let me write it this way.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.130
Let's say it is a 1, 1, a 1,
2, all the way to a 1, n.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.650
And there's some row here, let's
say that there's some

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.010
row here on row i-- let's call
this row i right here-- and

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:35.220
here it has the terms x1, x2,
all the way to xn, but

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.490
everything else is just
the regular a's.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.830
So then you have a-- let
me make this as a21,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.310
all the way to a2n.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.710
And then if you went all the way
down here you would have

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.150
an1, and you'd go all
the way to ann.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.380
So essentially you could imagine
our standard matrix

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.360
where everything is defined in
a, but I replaced row i with

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.400
certain numbers that are maybe
a little different.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.160
And I think you'll see
where I'm going.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.150
Now let me define
my other matrix.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.810
Let me define matrix Y.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.530
Let me define matrix Y to be
essentially the same thing.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.520
This is a11-- it's
the same a11.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.640
This is a12, all
the way to a1n.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.330
This is a21, we could go
all the way to a a2n.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.480
And then on row i, the same row,
this is n by n, this is

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.950
the same n by n-- if this was
10 by 10, this is 10 by 10.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.680
If this is row seven, then
this is row seven.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.210
It has different terms. It's
identical to matrix X

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.445
except for row i.

00:10:34.445 --> 00:10:39.890
In row i it is y1, y2,
all the way to yn.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.170
And if you keep going down, of
course, you have an1, all the

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.350
way to ann.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.460
Fair enough.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.860
Now let's say we have
a third matrix.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.140
Let's have a third matrix.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.840
Let me draw it right here.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.190
So you have Z, Z is equal to--
I think you could imagine

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.440
where this is going.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.460
Z is identical to these two
guys except for row i.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.160
So let me write that out.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.430
So Z looks like this.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:14.260
You have a11, a12, all
the way to a1n.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.670
And then you go down and then
row i happens to be the sum of

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.770
the row i of matrix
X and matrix Y.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:31.510
So it is x1 plus y1, x2 plus y2,
all the way to xn plus yn.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.820
And then it you keep going
down, everything else is

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.010
identical, an1 all
the way to ann.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.450
So all of these matrices are
identical except for row X has

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.100
a different row i than
matrix Y does.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.810
And row Z is identical
everywhere except its row i is

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.995
the sum of this row
i and that row i.

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:55.420
So it's a very particular case,
but we can figure out

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.870
their determinants.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.640
So what are the determinants?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.360
The determinant of X, the
determinant of matrix X-- and

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.860
hopefully you're maybe a bit
comfortable with writing sigma

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.110
notation, we did this
in the last matrix.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:15.460
We can go down this row right
there, and for each of these

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.410
guys we can say so the
determinant is going to be

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.135
equal to the sum.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.930
Let's say we start from j is
equal to 1-- j's going to be

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.100
the column, so we're going to
take the sum of each of these

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.600
terms from j is equal
to 1 to n.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.620
And then remember our
checkerboard pattern, so we

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.130
don't know if this is a
positive or negative.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.650
We can figure it out by taking
negative 1 to the i plus j--

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.350
remember, this is the ith row
that we're talking about--

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:59.550
times xj-- xj is the
coefficient, xsubj, times the

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.790
sub matrix for xsubj.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.950
So if you get rid of this
guy's row and this guy's

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.570
column, what is it
going to be?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.020
We could say that that's the
same thing as the sub matrix,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.000
if we called this guy-- let me
write it this way-- if we got

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.180
rid of this guy's row and this
guy's column, if we had just

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.370
our traditional matrix where
this wasn't replaced.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:25.570
If we just had an ai1 here, ai2,
its sub matrix would be

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.580
the same thing, because we're
crossing out this

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.330
row and this column.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.360
So it would be all of these
guys and all of

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.360
these guys down here.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.180
So it would be the sub matrix--
this is a n minus 1

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:42.530
by n minus 1 matrix-- it would
be the sub matrix for aij.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.060
That's for the first term--
sorry, the determinant.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.890
Don't want to lose the
determinant there-- times the

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.660
determinant of the
sub matrix aij.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.170
And so that's for the first
term, and then you're going to

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.520
add it to the second term, and
then you're just going to keep

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.030
doing that.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.650
That's what this sigma
notation is.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.890
That's the determinant of X.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.930
Now what's the determinant
of Y?

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:09.940
The determinant of Y is equal
to the sum-- we could do the

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.610
same thing-- j is equal to
1 to n of negative 1

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.770
to the i plus j.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.710
We're going to go along this row
right here, the ith row.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.990
So we're going to have ysubj--
right, we're going to start

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.840
with ysub1, then plus ysub2,
times the determinant of its

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.640
sub matrix, which is
the same as the

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.600
determinant of this sub matrix.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.820
So you get rid of that row and
that column for each of these

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.480
guys, that everything else on
the matrix is the same.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.870
So aij.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.840
The matrix of aij.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.040
Now what is the determinant
of Z.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.930
I'm pretty sure you know exactly
where this is going.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.455
The determinant-- this should
be a capital Y right there--

00:14:47.455 --> 00:14:52.440
the determinant of Z is equal to
the sum, from j is equal to

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.950
1 to n, of negative
1 to the i plus j.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.300
We're going along this row.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:06.160
But now the coefficients are xj,
that's what we're indexing

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.820
along, xj plus yj.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.890
And then times its sub matrix,
which is the same

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.582
as these sub matrices.

00:15:13.582 --> 00:15:20.500
So aij, which you might
immediately see is the sum of

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.250
these two things.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.220
If I, for every j, I just summed
these two things up,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.650
you're having two coefficients--
you could have

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.590
this coefficient and that
coefficient on your aij term,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.090
and then when you add them up
you can factor this guy out

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.560
and you will get this
right here.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.730
So you get the determinant of X
plus the determinant of Y is

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.470
equal to the determinant of Z.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.310
So hopefully that shows
you the general case.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.600
But I want to make it very
clear, this is just for a very

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.140
particular scenario where three
matrices are identical,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.790
except for on one row.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.450
And one of the matrices on that
special row just happens

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.600
to be the sum of the other two
matrices for that special row,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.320
and everything else
is identical.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.320
That's the only time where the
determinant of-- not the only

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.930
time, but that's the only time
we can make the general

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.145
statement where the determinant
of Z is equal to

00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:15.810
the determinant of X plus
the determinant of Y.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.340
It's not the case-- let me write
what is not the case--

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:30.390
so not the case that if Z is
equal to X plus Y, it is not

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.340
the case that the determinant
of Z is necessarily equal to

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:43.450
the determinant of X plus
the determinant of Y.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.120
You cannot assume this.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.550
Determinant operations are not
linear on matrix addition.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.740
They're linear only on
particular rows getting at it.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.750
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
