00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:01.459
Hi, I'm Jennifer Newsome.

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.990
I'm Tom Carruthers.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.600
And together we're Dream the Combine and today
we're here at MoMA PS1

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.440
to give you a tour of our installation called
Hide and Seek.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.720
The Young Architects Program is an annual
competition.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.580
The Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 contact
critics, heads of architecture schools,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.020
curators, to suggest a short list of architectural firms that might be a

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.380
good fit for proposing something for the courtyard
at PS1.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.820
We won this year, which was pretty surreal
I have to say.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.079
I think I did a happy dance.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.510
I may have jumped up and down.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.510
Our four year old daughter just screamed out,
"We won."

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.020
We named it Hide and Seek because there's
really this process of discovery that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.059
occurs as you're walking through the installation.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.899
So as you can see, we've got this elevated
platform.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.470
We're calling it the runway.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.040
If you want to vogue on it you can, but basically
at either end of these, like,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.920
architectural, sort of, features there are
paired mirrors and each one of these

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.060
mirrors moves with the wind.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.200
We're using a lot of structural steel but
we're treating it as though it's a drawing,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.200
and so with this, kind of, infinite line that
extends off into the distance,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.180
it's almost like a single point perspective drawing where
the, kind of, center of that drawing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.200
is wandering.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.580
So it's a little disorienting at times and
it also starts to throw the space around in

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.760
really, kind of, unpredictable ways.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.220
But it's also a sort of invitation for you
to come and actually manipulate the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.280
environment of the courtyard, and there's
also a bit of, kind of, call and response

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.800
because sometimes you might have someone who's
pushing on the back of the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.400
mirror but it's changing the environment on
the front side.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.880
So there's a kind of conversation there that's
happening with the architecture, as well.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.740
And I think for us it's less about the, kind
of, material properties of the mirror but

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.569
more about this, kind of, illusory environment
that's within the depth of the image

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.640
of the mirror.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.000
Your eye doesn't really differentiate between
depth in two dimensions versus

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.160
depth in three dimensions past a certain distance.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.840
So, like, when you look at the mirror and
the depth in the reflection,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.720
your body, your eye, thinks that it's actually, kind of, real.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.120
These elements are here to allow people to
bring their histories of movement

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.220
with them, but also hopefully to inspire other
types of uses, as well,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.760
and interactions between people.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.280
So Warm Up is a weekly dance party, really,
that happens at PS1 every Saturday

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.689
and it gets about 5,000 people coming into
PS1 to listen to music, eat some food,

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.640
drink some beer, see some art, and be inside
of this installation in the courtyard.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.880
We encourage people to come out, to actually
touch it, manipulate the mirrors,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.180
you know, see each other up in the periscopes,
kind of run in and out of the building.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.660
It's supposed to be playful.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.819
So in the main courtyard we've got this big
runway platform and then in the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.089
smaller courtyard there's a large hammock
for lounging and relaxing.

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.980
So we're gonna show you that now.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.380
When my daughter first came here, this was
what she wanted to show me.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.100
She discovered it.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.100
This hammock that I had been sweating about
and making it and designing with you.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.920
This side courtyard we nicknamed "The
Sanctuary" in our competition phase.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.740
I think it's an idea of counter point to some
of the more active program and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.680
dancing that we expect to happen out here
during Warm Up.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.460
But I think that this space also has it's
own, kind of, like energy and excitement to it.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.280
Like there's actually really no elegant way
to get into this hammock.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.340
So my favorite way to do it is I flip back
like this.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.360
The competition brief asked for seating, shading,
and water

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.000
and so we basically arrayed that in layers.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.839
Kind of in sections.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:10.909
So, you know, different, kind of, seating
areas, so the hammock being one, the

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.940
runway another, and then the small courtyard
there's a little seat in that little baby courtyard.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.079
And then there's canopy fabric overhead and
then in the two upper trusses

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.780
there's a, kind of, misting system that, sort
of, goes on and off at different times of day.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.740
So if you turn around, you can see a tree
where one is not supposed to be and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.560
the tree functions as a kind of veil.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.660
You actually, through the tree, can see the
street corner outside where during Warm Up

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.240
people will gather before coming in,
and afterwards, once Warm Up has closed,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.940
it's where people gather after
the event is done.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.460
I think that we talk a lot in our practice
about both the individual and the collective.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.100
Just by virtue of our relative position to
one another, we'll have different

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.720
experiences of the installation.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.300
He's gonna see different things in the mirrors
than I will and I think that that, kind of,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.760
variety is our strength and it's something
that, you know, we're really trying to

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.060
embrace in this installation.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.080
That it's for everyone to feel like they're
in place in this place.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.820
You know, I hope it's, kind of, reflected
in the architectural proposition, as well,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.250
that a lot of our work together is about people,
the relationships between them,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.200
and the trust that is built between people.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.480
And I think that, you know, it's through our
friendship and our, kind of, trust of one

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.000
another that we're able to actually, like,
execute this project.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.009
So we hope you enjoyed the tour of Hide and
Seek.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:43.220
It'll be up through Labor Day Weekend at PS1
and we hope you come and check it out.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.760
Bye.
