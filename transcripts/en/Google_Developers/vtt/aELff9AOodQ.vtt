ANKUR KOTWAL: Hi,
I'm Ankur Kotwal,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.810
and I'm an Android
developer advocate.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.290
ALEX DANILO: Hi,
I'm Alex Danilo,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.912
and I'm a Chrome
developer advocate.

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:16.370
ANKUR KOTWAL: Today
we want to talk

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.520
to you about some new
developer features

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.560
that we've added in the
web view on Android.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.800
So more specifically, Android
4.4-- also known as KitKat--

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560
introduced an updated web
view which is actually

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.940
built off the
Chromium web view now.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.345
And that brings a whole range
of new features for developers.

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:35.720
ALEX DANILO: That's
right, Ankur.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.690
In fact, what we've
built now into the web

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.720
view is all the
functionality of Chrome.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.160
So what that means to
you as a developer is

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.030
that you have all the
HTML5 capabilities that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690
exist in Chrome shifted
into the web view,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.525
so you can take advantage of
modern HTML5 and all its APIs.

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:52.459
Which is kind of nice.

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:53.500
ANKUR KOTWAL: Absolutely.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.102
So let's have a look at a demo.

00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:57.310
ALEX DANILO: Well, before
we should go into the demo,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.120
I just wanted to
point out something.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.411
One thing that's been really
hard for me as a developer

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.728
is actually debugging
stuff in a web view.

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:05.269
How do you debug
normally when you're

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.780
building Android applications?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780
ANKUR KOTWAL: I use
Android Studio or Eclipse.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.571
ALEX DANILO: Right,
like I used to as well.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.430
But when I'm developing
on the desktop,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.940
I use Chrome dev tools, which
really makes my life simple.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.220
And now you can actually
do it from the web view.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.500
So why don't we just have
a look at how we actually

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.370
go about doing that.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.010
What I have here is we have
a little full screen game.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.000
You hit the start button here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.230
And what you have is a ball
that you can roll around.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.622
So it's kind of
a standard thing.

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:34.080
But what I'd like
to point out here

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.610
is that we're actually using
the motion of the device

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.679
to control the ball.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.470
We couldn't do that
before could we, Ankur?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.840
ANKUR KOTWAL: No.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.290
So this is now
the accelerometer.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.140
And the Chromium
web view is mapping

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.710
that hardware accelerometer
on your Android device

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.770
straight through to
the web view itself.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.690
So this is a demo
that Alex, you built.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.580
And we now this app here is
effectively-- it's a web app.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.140
It's just a thin wrapper of an
app that drops in a web view.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.285
And it's just a login
to your site, isn't it?

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:06.160
ALEX DANILO: Exactly.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.020
And so the beauty of this is
that now we have this web view.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.910
And in the old days,
prior to Kit Kat,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.410
you'd be thinking,
how I debug this?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.985
It's really hard.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:16.110
But what I can do is then
come over here to Chrome,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.615
and I can just go over and
have a look at Chrome inspect.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.240
If I go and have a
look at that, you'll

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.760
suddenly see the devices that
are connected to my laptop

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.260
visible.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.625
And here we actually
see we've got a Nexus

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.810
10 running this
application at the moment.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.620
And you can see the
actual web view itself.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.010
So for Android
developers, you'd be

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.140
familiar with this
com.alex.roller.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.130
So that's the namespace my
app's been developed in.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.770
So all I have to do is
click this Inspect link,

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.330
and lo and behold, we have
the full Chrome dev tools

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.180
experience.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.430
Identical to what
happens on a desktop.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.637
But now it's actually
talking into the device,

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:50.720
and I can look at the DOM.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.740
I can write point JavaScript.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.584
I can modify the DOM on the fly.

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:57.000
ANKUR KOTWAL: And this is not
a special build of your app,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.350
right?

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.470
ALEX DANILO: No.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.080
ANKUR KOTWAL: It works for
debug and release builds.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.450
ALEX DANILO: Exactly.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.450
That's the beauty of it.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.020
This is for any app that
uses the Chrome web view now,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.580
which is fantastic.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.800
So I can drill down,
look in the DOM here.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.910
And of course, I can
see the Start button,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.950
but there's no game content.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.540
You can see hovering
over it, it's

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.720
actually changing what
you can see on the screen.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.809
So if I actually tap
the start to start

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.100
the game you see all of a
sudden all these new elements

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.850
appear in the DOM.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.620
So this is a live DOM.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.520
Actually on the fly.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.978
And if you have a
look at down here

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:28.470
at the very bottom, which
I have that highlighted.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.980
You see the rotation
and the transforms

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.010
are changing on the fly.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.620
So as the ball is moving around,
this is actually changing live.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.990
So this is just fantastic.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.280
Although the holes that
the ball falls into,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.580
they're a bit dark for me.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.440
What do you think?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.730
ANKUR KOTWAL: Yeah, I mean
all of our UX research

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.900
shows that you should
use lighter colors, Alex.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.580
ALEX DANILO: I
think you're right.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.990
So why don't we do that.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.365
Why don't we actually change
the color that we're seeing.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.100
So if I go back up the top--
since I actually wrote this I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.380
know what to look at, but--

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.970
ANKUR KOTWAL: I
notice that says SVG.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.175
That's also a new feature of
the Chromium web view, right?

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.490
We now have SVG support.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.573
ALEX DANILO: That's right.

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:07.890
We brought in SVG support.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.320
I think it was Honeycomb
was the first version that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.960
supported it.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.899
But now the web view
actually has it.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:14.440
And it flies.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.339
So I've got these gradients here
that are used for the holes.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.130
So if you have a look,
here's this gradient

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.500
that's black and gray.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.840
I might just decide that I'd
prefer the holes to be blue.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.580
Start as blue.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.080
So if you actually
watch as I change that,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.190
all the holes suddenly
changed to blue.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.300
So we're actually
modifying the live DOM.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.740
And this is an
incredible feature.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.999
So the ball itself, let's
go down to the ball.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.790
Let me have a look.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.234
You'll notice we have a
Chrome logo there on the ball.

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.650
See, that's a
Chrome logo spinning

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.190
around which is controlled
by this image here.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.870
Now I could actually just
select it and delete it.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.692
And lo and behold, our
ball has become a blue ball

00:04:50.692 --> 00:04:52.150
because I've taken
away that image.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.105
And this is really bad
because now we can't the ball

00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:55.730
from the holes.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.180
So we can actually
change the color

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.420
of that circle that the
ball, and it becomes red,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.794
and we can again see
what it looks like.

00:05:02.794 --> 00:05:03.460
So they have it.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.740
We have actual live editing,
on the fly of our web app,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.200
without any code changes.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.650
And you can do this from your
desktop, from your laptop,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.300
on the fly.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.380
It's just an awesome
new feature in KitKat.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.880
ANKUR KOTWAL: And
we should also add

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.340
that when we
connected with Chrome

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.050
we didn't need ADB or the
developer tools installed.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.920
It's all built into Chrome now.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.164
And you can connect
directly, it just shows up.

00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:26.580
ALEX DANILO: That's
exactly right.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.280
Pro tip, for all the
developers our there,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.030
turn on hardware
acceleration because that

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.310
will make your apps
fly with the new view.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.140
So hardware acceleration,
HTML5 features, I love KitKat.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.150
It's fantastic.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.110
ANKUR KOTWAL: Thank you.
