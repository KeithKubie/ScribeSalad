00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:02.126
The debate over gun
control has deep roots

00:00:02.126 --> 00:00:03.000
in the United States.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.910
And the fatal shooting
in Washington DC

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.120
will most likely
heat that up again.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.110
Thanks for tuning in
to D News everyone.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.810
I'm Trace.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.340
Police in Washington DC are
still gathering all the facts

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.670
as they investigate the
shooting at the US Navy Yard

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.730
earlier today.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.240
At the time of
this recording, CNN

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.580
has reported that at
least 12 people died,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.830
including one of the
suspected gunman.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.070
During times of gun
violence, debates inevitably

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.756
rise about how guns
fit into our society.

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:35.630
A new study published
in the American Journal

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.360
of Public Health is
making a bold claim.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480
It says, states where gun
ownership is higher experience

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.710
a higher number of
firearm related homicides.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.320
This flies directly in the
face of some gun advocates who

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.400
cite the 1998 book,
More Guns Less Crime

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.350
by John Lott Jr. Where gun
controls effect on crime

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.852
is thrown up against
a lot of data.

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.560
This book and others
like it contain data

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.530
from various sources
compiled in such a way as

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.300
to push gun ownership as
a more sensible solution

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.140
to deter crime.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.220
This new three decade
data heavy study however,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.710
indicates a
contradictory finding.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.870
The Boston University
School of Public Health

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.980
looked at CDC records
from 1981 to 2010,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.970
and found as the number of guns
in the state increased by 1%,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.527
the number of homicides
with guns increased 0.9%.

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:24.360
The researchers pointed
out that they're not

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.970
saying that more guns causes
more killings in these places,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.820
but that over three decades
the number of killings

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.270
and the number of guns were tied
into this is very similar pace.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.660
The assertion isn't
particularly new.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.450
The Harvard injury
control research center

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.220
found the same thing in 2012.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340
And their data showed
even when controlling

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.730
for every other variable, more
guns correlate to increased

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.470
homicides.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.440
Even if you take the
whole United States out

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.760
of the reckoning and only
look at other countries,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.880
they found that
since 1990 across 26

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.320
developed countries where
more guns were available

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.010
there were more homicides.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.820
Other studies in
the last 10 years

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.950
have found similar results.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.440
Regardless of how you come
down on the great gun debate,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.120
these studies are compelling,
though not causal.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.580
Not one of these studies
does claim or even can claim,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.110
more guns means more homicide.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.640
But guns and crime seem to
increase and decrease together

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.230
across race, gender, age, type
of crime, urbanization, alcohol

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.760
consumption, employment, and
income level in all counties,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.810
cities, regions, states,
and countries studied.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.320
Data like this
tends to put people

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.930
on both sides of the gun
debate on their warpaths.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.980
Gun advocates claim since
the 1990s gun ownership has

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.250
increased and thus
crime has dropped.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.690
And though that it's
true crime has dropped,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.310
there is no way to prove
causality they're either.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.290
A number of gun homicides
have dropped overall.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.660
But so has all crime
in the United States.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.990
And this Boston University
studied still applies.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.110
So though crime is down
overall and gun homicide

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.940
is down overall, the greatest
number of gun homicides

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.430
are found where there
are a lot of guns around.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.110
For some reason, we're not sure.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.150
Researchers are
working on the answers

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.520
as to why right as we speak.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.070
Check out the Pew
Research Center

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.980
social and demographic study for
some really interesting reasons

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.282
on why crime may be dropping.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:16.740
So what do you
think of this study?

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.830
Share your thoughts
with us in the comments.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.420
And hey, this is science.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.650
So let's try to point to
actual signs here too guys.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.790
And not just anecdotes
or personal experiences.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.815
Let's have a discussion.

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:27.190
