00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.187
- [Voiceover] So we're
told that angle A is

00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:05.316
circumscribed about circle O.

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:07.937
So this is angle A right over here,

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:10.639
we're talking about this
angle right over there.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.479
And when they say it's
circumscribed about circle O

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.368
that means that the two sides of the angle

00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:19.578
they're segments that would
be part of tangent lines,

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:23.195
so if we were to continue, so for example

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.312
that right over there, that
line is tangent to the circle

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.762
and (mumbles)

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:34.769
and this line is also
tangent to the circle.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.146
So you see that the sides of angle A

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:41.291
are parts of those tangents,
and points B and point C

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.435
are where those tangents
actually sit on the circle.

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.345
So given all of that they're asking us

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:49.174
what is the measure of angle A,

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.961
so we're trying to figure
this out right here

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:52.363
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:52.363 --> 00:00:54.395
and figure it out on your own.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:57.402
So the key insight here
and there's multiple ways

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:59.556
that you could approach
this is to realize,

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:04.228
that a radius is going to be
perpendicular to a tangent

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:06.453
or a radius that intersects a tangent

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:08.351
is going to be perpendicular to it.

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.675
So let me label this,

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.175
so this is going to be a right angle

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:16.944
and this is going to be a right angle.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.946
In any quadrilateral,
the sum of the angles

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.283
are going to add up to 360 degrees,

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.477
and if you wonder where that comes from

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:27.545
well you can divide a
quadrilateral into two triangles,

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:29.353
where the sum of all the interior angles

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.385
of a triangle are 180 and
since you have two of them,

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.493
it's 360 degrees.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:39.146
So this is 92 + 90 + 90 + question mark

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:41.503
is going to be equal to 360 degrees.

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.333
So let me write that down.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:47.203
92 plus 90 plus 90 so plus 180.

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.212
Plus, let's just call this X. X degrees.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:55.093
Plus X, they all have to
add up to be 360 degrees

00:01:55.093 --> 00:01:59.110
so let's see, we could
subtract 180 from both sides

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.918
and so, if we do that we would have

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.751
92 plus X is equals to 180

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:07.520
and if we subtract 92 from both sides

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.807
we get X is equals to let's
see 180 minus 90 would be 90

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:13.087
and then we're just going
to subtract two more

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:16.004
so it's going to be X is equals to 88.

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:20.259
So the measure of angle A is 88 degrees.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:22.046
Now let's do one more of these.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:25.399
These are surprisingly fun. All right.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:30.399
So it says, angle A is
circumscribed about circle O,

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.368
we have seen that before
in the last question

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:34.498
and they said what is
the measure of angle D.

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:38.808
So we want to find, let me make
sure I'm on the right layer.

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.546
We want to find the measure of that angle

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:45.459
and let's call that,
let's call that x again.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.719
So what can we figure out?

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.149
Well just like in the last question

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.644
we have a quadrilateral here,
quadrilateral A, B, O, C

00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:53.883
and we know two of the angles,

00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:55.163
we know this is going to be a right angle

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:57.134
we have a radius
intersecting with a tangent,

00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:59.775
or part of a tangent
I guess you could say.

00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:01.604
And then this would be a right angle

00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:04.692
and so by the same logic as
we saw in the last question,

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:07.658
this angle, plus this
angle, plus this angle,

00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:11.661
plus the central angle are
going to add up to 360 degrees.

00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:14.017
So let's call the measure
of the central angle

00:03:14.017 --> 00:03:16.433
let's call that Y over there.

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:20.844
So we have Y plus 80 degrees or

00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:22.490
we'll just assume
everything is in degrees,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.222
so Y plus 80 plus 90
plus 90, so I could say

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:32.120
plus another 180 is going
to be equal to 360 degrees

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.490
sum of the interior
angles of a quadrilateral.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.617
And so let's see you have, we could have

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:42.047
Y plus 80 is equal to 180,

00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:43.836
if I just subtract 180 from both sides

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:47.971
if I subtract 80 from both
sides, we get Y is equal to 100

00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:50.547
or the measure of this is 100,

00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.471
the measure of this interior angle

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:54.564
right over here is 100 degrees,

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:58.251
which also tells us that
the measure of this arc

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:01.201
cause that interior angle intercepts...

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:04.491
intercepts arc C, B, right over here,

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:05.911
that tells us that the measure

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.674
of arc C, B, is also 100 degrees.

00:04:08.674 --> 00:04:10.726
And so if we're trying to find this angle,

00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:14.200
the measure of angle D,
that's an inscribed angle

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.683
that intercepts the same arc.

00:04:16.683 --> 00:04:19.331
And we've seen in previous
videos that an inscribed angle

00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:20.722
that intercepts that arc is going to have

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:22.266
half the arc's measure.

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:24.765
So if this is a 100 degree measured arc,

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.126
then the measure of this angle

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:29.519
right over here is going to be 50 degrees.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.608
So the measure of angle D is 50 degrees.

00:04:32.608 --> 00:04:35.554
And we are done.
