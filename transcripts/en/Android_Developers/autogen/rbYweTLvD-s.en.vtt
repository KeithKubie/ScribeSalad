00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.990
really easy it takes this much code um
just create an intent and start it then

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000
just create an intent and start it then
 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.640
just create an intent and start it then
you'll need a listener on the other side

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650
you'll need a listener on the other side
 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.790
you'll need a listener on the other side
to check to see what result you got and

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800
to check to see what result you got and
 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.800
to check to see what result you got and
whether or not they hit cancel that's

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810
whether or not they hit cancel that's
 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.720
whether or not they hit cancel that's
what the check if result is not equal to

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730
what the check if result is not equal to
 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.640
what the check if result is not equal to
okay so to gather your invitees off the

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650
okay so to gather your invitees off the
 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.060
okay so to gather your invitees off the
list

just grab the data extras and look for

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740
just grab the data extras and look for
 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.950
just grab the data extras and look for
extra players and then you can add that

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960
extra players and then you can add that
 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.810
extra players and then you can add that
to your turn-based match configuration

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820
to your turn-based match configuration
 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.870
to your turn-based match configuration
I'm not quite sure can you go back sure

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880
I'm not quite sure can you go back sure
 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.560
I'm not quite sure can you go back sure
so I'm sorry this get string array list

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570
so I'm sorry this get string array list
 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.600
so I'm sorry this get string array list
extra extra players what does this mean

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610
extra extra players what does this mean
 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.850
extra extra players what does this mean
is grabbing from the UI that I just

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860
is grabbing from the UI that I just
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.290
is grabbing from the UI that I just
dismissed the players I want to invite

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300
dismissed the players I want to invite
 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.980
dismissed the players I want to invite
exactly gotcha okay and then you create

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990
exactly gotcha okay and then you create
 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.720
exactly gotcha okay and then you create
a tournament match config using a

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730
a tournament match config using a
 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.360
a tournament match config using a
builder add that list of invitees and

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370
builder add that list of invitees and
 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.320
builder add that list of invitees and
then call create turn-based match gotcha

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.330
then call create turn-based match gotcha
 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.910
then call create turn-based match gotcha
it's a little bit more complicated if

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920
it's a little bit more complicated if
 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.250
it's a little bit more complicated if
you want to use Auto matching which we

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260
you want to use Auto matching which we
 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.740
you want to use Auto matching which we
absolutely recommend you try that is

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750
absolutely recommend you try that is
 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.150
absolutely recommend you try that is
still important yes

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160
still important yes
 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.980
still important yes
so all yours might not have friends so

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990
so all yours might not have friends so
 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.140
so all yours might not have friends so
as you saw when we were when we were

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150
as you saw when we were when we were
 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.930
as you saw when we were when we were
showing the demo there's always add Auto

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940
showing the demo there's always add Auto
 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.000
showing the demo there's always add Auto
pick player and anybody can choose that

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010
pick player and anybody can choose that
 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.650
pick player and anybody can choose that
and then in that case you'll get a

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660
and then in that case you'll get a
 

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.930
and then in that case you'll get a
minimum and maximum number of automatch

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940
minimum and maximum number of automatch
 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.840
minimum and maximum number of automatch
players this is a lot like our real time

00:07:59.840 --> 00:07:59.850
players this is a lot like our real time
 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.700

multiplayer code in terms of managing

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:01.710
multiplayer code in terms of managing
 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.490
multiplayer code in terms of managing
automatch players so you can look at

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500
automatch players so you can look at
 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.110
automatch players so you can look at
that as a reference as well but

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120
that as a reference as well but
 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.970
that as a reference as well but
basically grab the min and Max numbers

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:07.980
basically grab the min and Max numbers
 

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.660
basically grab the min and Max numbers
and create a automatch criteria object

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.670
and create a automatch criteria object
 

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.310
and create a automatch criteria object
and pass that to the Builder for the

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320
and pass that to the Builder for the
 

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.640
and pass that to the Builder for the
turn-based match so I know in real time

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:16.650

we are encouraging developers to you
know also kind of have a quick match

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:19.830
know also kind of have a quick match
 

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.770
know also kind of have a quick match
button that sets up Auto matching

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780
button that sets up Auto matching
 

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.110
button that sets up Auto matching
without going to that UI is that what

that you just want to have an auto match

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180
that you just want to have an auto match
 

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.640
that you just want to have an auto match
button all you have to do is follow the

if min automatch players is greater than
 

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.340
if min automatch players is greater than
zero just say automatch criteria create

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:44.350
zero just say automatch criteria create
 

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.499
zero just say automatch criteria create
automatic criteria number of automatic

case of 8-bit artists gotcha okay

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:51.309
case of 8-bit artists gotcha okay
 

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:53.790
case of 8-bit artists gotcha okay
after that pass set auto much criteria

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800
after that pass set auto much criteria
 

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.290
after that pass set auto much criteria
for your turn-based match config and

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:55.300
for your turn-based match config and
 

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.170
for your turn-based match config and
then call create turn-based match now

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180
then call create turn-based match now
 

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.059
then call create turn-based match now
Ottoman doing Auto match I think is

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:03.069
Ottoman doing Auto match I think is
 

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:04.199
Ottoman doing Auto match I think is
really neat we're doing what's called

00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:04.209
really neat we're doing what's called
 

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:07.350
really neat we're doing what's called
rolling automatch where you can start a

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360
rolling automatch where you can start a
 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.910
rolling automatch where you can start a
game take your first turn and pass it on

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920
game take your first turn and pass it on
 

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.019
game take your first turn and pass it on
somebody else so let's make that

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:10.029
somebody else so let's make that
 

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:14.189
somebody else so let's make that
concrete here so uh let's say I'm player

00:09:14.189 --> 00:09:14.199
concrete here so uh let's say I'm player
 

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:16.350
concrete here so uh let's say I'm player
one I've decided I want to play against

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360
one I've decided I want to play against
 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.420
one I've decided I want to play against
an automatch player what happens is I

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.430
an automatch player what happens is I
 

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.689
an automatch player what happens is I
take my first turn so if I were playing

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:21.699
take my first turn so if I were playing
 

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:23.160
take my first turn so if I were playing
it that artists I draw my first picture

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.170
it that artists I draw my first picture
 

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.319
it that artists I draw my first picture
and I hit Send by this point the system

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:25.329
and I hit Send by this point the system
 

00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:26.639
and I hit Send by this point the system
doesn't know who I'm playing yet it has

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:26.649
doesn't know who I'm playing yet it has
 

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.720
doesn't know who I'm playing yet it has
no idea it just knows you're going to

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.730
no idea it just knows you're going to
 

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.220
no idea it just knows you're going to
play against an automatch player and at

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.230
play against an automatch player and at
 

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.420
play against an automatch player and at
that point it sort of goes up into the

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:30.430
that point it sort of goes up into the
 

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.460
that point it sort of goes up into the
cloud and waits around to be automatch

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.470
cloud and waits around to be automatch
 

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.759
cloud and waits around to be automatch
now say Todd is playing Todd wants to

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:35.769
now say Todd is playing Todd wants to
 

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:37.230
now say Todd is playing Todd wants to
play and he hits I want to play against

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240
play and he hits I want to play against
 

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.840
play and he hits I want to play against
an automatch person at that point the

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:39.850
an automatch person at that point the
 

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.579
an automatch person at that point the
system actually knows well okay there's

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:41.589
system actually knows well okay there's
 

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:44.340
system actually knows well okay there's
this open auto match slot so let's just

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.350
this open auto match slot so let's just
 

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.889
this open auto match slot so let's just
put those guys together and make have

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:46.899
put those guys together and make have
 

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:48.809
put those guys together and make have
them play each other so when Todd gets

00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:48.819
them play each other so when Todd gets
 

00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:51.030
them play each other so when Todd gets
his game I will have already taken my

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040
his game I will have already taken my
 

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.100
his game I will have already taken my
turn and you'll be able to guess and

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.110
turn and you'll be able to guess and
 

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.559
turn and you'll be able to guess and
then draw your own so rolling automatch

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:55.569
then draw your own so rolling automatch
 

00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:57.480
then draw your own so rolling automatch
gets people going in the game right away

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.490
gets people going in the game right away
 

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.590
gets people going in the game right away
even in situations in situations where

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600
even in situations in situations where
 

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.929
even in situations in situations where
that your game sort of rules support

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:03.939
that your game sort of rules support
 

00:10:03.939 --> 00:10:06.179
that your game sort of rules support
that so what the advantage here is

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:06.189
that so what the advantage here is
 

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.410
that so what the advantage here is
basically we don't have to kind of take

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:07.420
basically we don't have to kind of take
 

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.449
basically we don't have to kind of take
that additional step of like I'm looking

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:09.459
that additional step of like I'm looking
 

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:11.519
that additional step of like I'm looking
for someone to play Oh wolf is decides

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:11.529
for someone to play Oh wolf is decides
 

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:12.900
for someone to play Oh wolf is decides
not going to play with me okay now I

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:12.910
not going to play with me okay now I
 

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.150
not going to play with me okay now I
take my turn it basically kind of gets

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160
take my turn it basically kind of gets
 

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.590
take my turn it basically kind of gets
me right into the game a lot faster yeah

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600
me right into the game a lot faster yeah
 

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.419
me right into the game a lot faster yeah
I mean if you if your game supports

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:18.429
I mean if you if your game supports
 

00:10:18.429 --> 00:10:19.829
I mean if you if your game supports
people taking their turns before they

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839
people taking their turns before they
 

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:20.879
people taking their turns before they
know who they're playing against you

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:20.889
know who they're playing against you
 

00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:23.009
know who they're playing against you
should totally use rolling Auto matching

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:23.019
should totally use rolling Auto matching
 

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:26.309
should totally use rolling Auto matching
it's very neat that sounds good um no

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:26.319
it's very neat that sounds good um no
 

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:28.470
it's very neat that sounds good um no

to get a or your game starts you're
 

00:10:30.189 --> 00:10:31.259
to get a or your game starts you're
going to get a turn-based match

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:31.269
going to get a turn-based match
 

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:33.059
going to get a turn-based match
initiated call back from the game's

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:33.069
initiated call back from the game's
 

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:35.460

client you can register a listener as

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:35.470
client you can register a listener as
 

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.650
client you can register a listener as
with all these callbacks you should

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:37.660
with all these callbacks you should
 

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.559
with all these callbacks you should
check that your status codes are right

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:39.569
check that your status codes are right
 

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:41.999
check that your status codes are right
sometimes things go wrong like Network

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:42.009
sometimes things go wrong like Network
 

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:42.419
sometimes things go wrong like Network
errors

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:42.429
errors
 

00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:44.850
errors
every callback comes with status codes

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:44.860
every callback comes with status codes
 

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.199
every callback comes with status codes
and you should use them we have sample

00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:46.209
and you should use them we have sample
 

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:49.199
and you should use them we have sample
code showing how to interpret them yeah

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:49.209
code showing how to interpret them yeah
 

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:51.119
code showing how to interpret them yeah
you may already have a game going so

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:51.129
you may already have a game going so
 

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:52.740
you may already have a game going so
when the game gets started you should

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:52.750
when the game gets started you should
 

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.240
when the game gets started you should
actually

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.250
actually
 

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.770
actually
look to see if your match data is not

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:54.780
look to see if your match data is not
 

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.200
look to see if your match data is not
null if your match dated is null it

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.210
null if your match dated is null it
 

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.760
null if your match dated is null it
means a you just got a fresh game and

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:58.770
means a you just got a fresh game and
 

00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.900
means a you just got a fresh game and
you should take the first turn and you

00:10:59.900 --> 00:10:59.910
you should take the first turn and you
 

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.700
you should take the first turn and you
should call whatever your turn your game

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:01.710
should call whatever your turn your game
 

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.370
should call whatever your turn your game
initialization steps are but you might

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380
initialization steps are but you might
 

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.300
initialization steps are but you might
have one of these rolling automatch

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.310
have one of these rolling automatch
 

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.530
have one of these rolling automatch
games at which point you're like oh

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540
games at which point you're like oh
 

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.180
games at which point you're like oh
we're already playing never mind just go

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.190
we're already playing never mind just go
 

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.400
we're already playing never mind just go
straight to the turn dating interface so

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:10.410
straight to the turn dating interface so
 

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.600
straight to the turn dating interface so
that's what this this code is

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:11.610
that's what this this code is
 

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.900
that's what this this code is
demonstrating so speaking of taking

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:14.910
demonstrating so speaking of taking
 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.920
demonstrating so speaking of taking
turns let's talk about actually taking

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:18.930
turns let's talk about actually taking
 

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.500
turns let's talk about actually taking
playing games yeah for us playing games

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:21.510
playing games yeah for us playing games
 

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.690
playing games yeah for us playing games
is taking turns when you're playing a

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700
is taking turns when you're playing a
 

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.400
is taking turns when you're playing a
game you'll be passing around this match

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.410
game you'll be passing around this match
 

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.170
game you'll be passing around this match
data so what's inside the mat shader

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180
data so what's inside the mat shader
 

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.880
data so what's inside the mat shader
first you just get game data which is a

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:30.890
first you just get game data which is a
 

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.030
first you just get game data which is a
byte array it's a 128k it's whatever you

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040
byte array it's a 128k it's whatever you
 

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.680
byte array it's a 128k it's whatever you
want it's opaque to us we don't even

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:36.690
want it's opaque to us we don't even
 

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.020
want it's opaque to us we don't even
know whatever you store here gets

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.030
know whatever you store here gets
 

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.910
know whatever you store here gets
propagated to everybody on all their

signed-in devices so if I'm multiple
 

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.540
signed-in devices so if I'm multiple
signed in getting it that's going to get

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:44.550
signed in getting it that's going to get
 

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.610
signed in getting it that's going to get
sent out to everything you also get a

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620
sent out to everything you also get a
 

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.290
sent out to everything you also get a
list of participants each comes with the

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300
list of participants each comes with the
 

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.150
list of participants each comes with the
unique part Ismet ID for games that have

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160
unique part Ismet ID for games that have
 

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.680
unique part Ismet ID for games that have
not finished Auto matching you'll only

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:51.690
not finished Auto matching you'll only
 

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.960
not finished Auto matching you'll only
get the participants and then you'll get

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:53.970
get the participants and then you'll get
 

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.250
get the participants and then you'll get
a number of unused automatch slots

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.260
a number of unused automatch slots
 

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.300
a number of unused automatch slots
lastly you're going to get some status

00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.310
lastly you're going to get some status
 

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.240
lastly you're going to get some status
bits on the on the game itself

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.250
bits on the on the game itself
 

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:08.230
bits on the on the game itself
there's turn and match status bits

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240
 

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.180
status bits like is it my turn and is

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:11.190
status bits like is it my turn and is
 

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.250
status bits like is it my turn and is
this game over are we Auto matching

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260
this game over are we Auto matching
 

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.130
this game over are we Auto matching
what's going on so and even when you're

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140
what's going on so and even when you're
 

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.900
what's going on so and even when you're
not taking even when it's not your turn

not taking even when it's not your turn
 

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.340
not taking even when it's not your turn
you'll still get these updates every

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:19.350
you'll still get these updates every
 

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.800
you'll still get these updates every
time somebody takes their turn so people

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:21.810
time somebody takes their turn so people
 

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.540
time somebody takes their turn so people
can monitor their game as it's going by

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:23.550
can monitor their game as it's going by
 

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.520
can monitor their game as it's going by
so we're playing a four player game I'm

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:25.530
so we're playing a four player game I'm
 

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.010
so we're playing a four player game I'm
player one mmm I passed my state data my

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.020
player one mmm I passed my state data my
 

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.720
player one mmm I passed my state data my
game CD and player two player 2 takes a

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:29.730
game CD and player two player 2 takes a
 

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.210
game CD and player two player 2 takes a
turn I will still get a notification of

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220
turn I will still get a notification of
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.490
turn I will still get a notification of
hagun or notification so your data will

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500
hagun or notification so your data will
 

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.380

check you'll say oh yeah look player 2
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.890
check you'll say oh yeah look player 2
took his turn ok so I can see player

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:39.900
took his turn ok so I can see player
 

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.810
took his turn ok so I can see player
two's turn I will see somewhere in the

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820
two's turn I will see somewhere in the
 

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.150
two's turn I will see somewhere in the
in the turn status that it's still not

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160
in the turn status that it's still not
 

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.890
in the turn status that it's still not
my turn the match data so that the games

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:45.900
my turn the match data so that the games
 

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:51.460
my turn the match data so that the games
still going on exactly ok

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:51.470
 

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.350
speaking of participants you should this

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360
speaking of participants you should this
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.970
speaking of participants you should this
should feel pretty familiar if you've

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980
should feel pretty familiar if you've
 

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.650
should feel pretty familiar if you've
used real-time multiplayer participant

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660
used real-time multiplayer participant
 

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.009
used real-time multiplayer participant
comes with a participant ID and a

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019
comes with a participant ID and a
 

00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:04.460
comes with a participant ID and a
display name and if they weren't Auto

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.470
display name and if they weren't Auto
 

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.559
display name and if they weren't Auto
matched then they come with a person

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:06.569
matched then they come with a person
 

00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:08.569
matched then they come with a person
data structure which has a way you can

00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:08.579
data structure which has a way you can
 

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:11.840
data structure which has a way you can
get their profile picture and things

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:11.850
get their profile picture and things
 

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.240
get their profile picture and things
like that so actually playing a game is

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.250
like that so actually playing a game is
 

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.410
like that so actually playing a game is
create some kind of shared state and

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420
create some kind of shared state and
 

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.710
create some kind of shared state and
then call take turn with somebody else's

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720
then call take turn with somebody else's
 

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.040
then call take turn with somebody else's
participant ID so if I'm you know if I

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.050
participant ID so if I'm you know if I
 

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.660
participant ID so if I'm you know if I
finish drawing I'm going to say take

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:26.670
finish drawing I'm going to say take
 

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.840
finish drawing I'm going to say take
turn and put your participant ID not

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:29.850
turn and put your participant ID not
 

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.900
turn and put your participant ID not
your person ID participant ID if you

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:32.910
your person ID participant ID if you
 

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.490
your person ID participant ID if you
want to pass it off to Auto matching you
