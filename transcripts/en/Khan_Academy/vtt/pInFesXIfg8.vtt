00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.010
We've got the function f of x
is equal to x to the third power

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.270
minus 12x plus 2.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.140
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.770
is think about at
what points does

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.559
my function f take on
minimum or maximum values?

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.600
And to figure that out I
have to first figure out

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.730
what are the critical
points for my function f.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.470
And then which of
those critical points

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250
do we achieve a minimum
or maximum value?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.790
And to determine
the critical points

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.706
we have to find the
derivative of our function

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:27.710
because our critical
points are just

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.230
the point at which our
derivative is either equal to 0

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.860
or undefined.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.882
So the derivative of this
thing right over here,

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:37.090
we're just going to use the
power rule several times,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.215
and then I guess you can
call it the constant rule.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.140
But the derivative of x to
the third is 3x squared.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.590
Derivative of negative
12x is negative 12.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.090
And the derivative
of a constant, it

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.464
doesn't change
with respect to x,

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.649
so it's just going
to be equal to 0.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.440
So we're going to get
a critical point when

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.430
this thing right over
here, for some value of x

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.540
is either undefined or 0.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.121
Well this thing is defined
for all values of x.

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.370
So the only places we're
going to find critical points

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.930
is when this thing
is equal to 0.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.800
So let's set it equal to 0.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.090
When does 3x squared
minus 12 equal 0?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.340
So let's add 12 to both sides.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.460
You get 3x squared
is equal to 12.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.930
Divide both sides by 3.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.680
You get x squared is equal to 4.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.790
Well this is going to
happen when x is equal to 2

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.980
and x is equal to negative 2.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.190
Just to be clear, f of
2, or let me be clear,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.160
f prime of 2, you get 3 times 4
minus 12, which is equal to 0.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.640
And f prime negative 2 is
also, same exact reason,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.370
is also equal to 0.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.130
So we can say-- and I'll
switch colors here--

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:58.370
that f has critical
points at x equals 2

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.450
and x equals negative 2.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
Well that's fair enough.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.590
But we still don't know
whether the function takes

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.720
on a minimum values at
those points, maximum values

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.864
of those points, or neither.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.530
To figure that out
we have to figure out

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.305
whether the derivative changes
signs around these points.

00:02:16.305 --> 00:02:18.180
So let's actually try
to graph the derivative

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.480
to think about this.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.560
So let's graph.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.989
I'll draw an axis
right over here.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.530
I'll do it down here
because maybe we

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.860
can use that information
later on to graph f of x.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.710
So let's say this is my x-axis.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.960
This is my y-axis.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.940
And so we have critical points
at x is equal to positive 2.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.190
So it's 1, 2.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.620
And x is equal to negative 2,
1, 2. x is equal to negative 2.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.250
So what does this
derivative look

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.280
like if we wanted to graph it?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.990
Well we have when x is equal
to 0 for the derivative

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.540
we're at negative 12.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.780
So this is the point y
is equal to negative 12.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.650
So this is, we're graphing
y is equal to f prime of x.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.635
So it looks something like this.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.900
These are obviously the
0's of our derivative.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.295
So it has to move up to cross
the x-axis there and over here.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.660
So what is the
derivative doing at each

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.480
of these critical points?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.170
Well over here our derivative
is crossing from being positive,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.150
we have a positive derivative,
to being a negative derivative.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.980
So we're crossing from being
a positive derivative to being

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.620
a negative derivative,
that was our criteria

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.750
for a critical point
to be a maximum point.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.590
Over here we're crossing
from a negative derivative

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.170
to a positive
derivative, which is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.470
our criteria for a critical
point for the function

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.210
to have a minimum value
at a critical point.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.600
So a minimum.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.710
And I just want to make sure
we have the correct intuition.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.780
If our function, if some
function is increasing

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.980
going into some point,
and at that point

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.770
we actually have
a derivative 0--

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.720
the derivative could
also be undefined--

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.130
but we have a derivative
of 0 and then the function

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.040
begins decreasing, that's why
this would be a maximum point.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.200
Similarly, if we have a
situation where the function is

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.086
decreasing going into a point,
the derivative is negative.

00:04:38.086 --> 00:04:39.960
Remember this is the
graph of the derivative.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.410
Let me make this clear.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.930
This is the graph of y is equal
to not f of x, but f prime

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.980
of x.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.580
So if we have a situation
we're going into the point,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.521
the function has
a negative slope,

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:55.020
we see we have a negative slope
here-- so the function might

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.552
look something like this.

00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:58.260
And then right at this
point the function

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.350
is either undefined
or has 0 slope.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.770
So in this case it has 0 slope.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.070
And then after that point,
let me do it right under it.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.730
So going into it we
have a negative slope.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.650
And then right over
here we have a 0 slope.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.080
Which I could draw it
even better than that.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.810
So if we were to imagine
going into it we have

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.080
a negative slope, right at
that point we have a 0 slope,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.510
and then we have
a positive slope.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.070
So the function
begins increasing.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.952
That's why we say we have a
minimum point right over there.

00:05:28.952 --> 00:05:30.410
So what I did it
right over here is

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.160
to try to conceptualize what
the function itself could look

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.700
like given the derivative,
in this case switching

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.240
from a positive derivative
to a negative derivative,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.460
across that critical
point, or going

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.700
from a negative derivative
to a positive derivative.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.120
That's why this is the
criteria for a maximum point,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.350
this is the criteria
for a minimum point.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.830
Well with that out of the
way, can we use this intuition

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.920
that we just talked
about to at least try

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.830
to sketch the graph of f of x?

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.000
So let's try to do it.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.150
And it's just going
to be a sketch,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.584
it's not going to be very exact.

00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:04.000
But at least it'll
give us a sense

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.010
of the shape of what
f of x looks like.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.140
So my best attempt.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.020
So it might not be drawn
completely to scale.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.520
So it's my x-axis,
this is my y-axis.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.170
We know we have a critical point
at x is equal to positive 2.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:28.340
And we have a critical point
at x is equal to negative 2.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.900
We know just from inspection
that the y-intercept right

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.550
here, if the graph
of y is equal to f

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.580
of x, when x is 0 f of x is 2.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.371
So we're going to
hit right over--

00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:41.870
I don't want to
draw this completely

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.860
to the same scale as the x-axis.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.510
So let's say that this
is 2 right over here.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.570
So this is where
we're going to cross.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.130
This is going to
be our y-intercept.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.760
And so we said
already that we have

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.960
a maximum point at x
is equal to negative 2.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.200
So what is f of negative 2?
f of negative 2 is equal to 8

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.640
or negative 8,
let me be careful.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.080
It's negative 8.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.640
And then we're going to have
12 times negative 2, which

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.810
is negative 24.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.450
But then we're going to add it.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.620
So we're subtracting
negative 24.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.080
So this is plus 24.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.930
And then we finally have plus 2.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.450
So negative 8 plus 24 plus 2,
so that's going to be negative,

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.340
let's see, negative 8 plus
24 is 16, plus 2 is 18.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.770
So f of negative
2 is equal to 18.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.630
And I'm not drawing it
completely to scale.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.830
But let's say that this
is 18 right over here.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.730
So this is the function.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.920
This is the point
negative 2 comma 18.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.060
And we know that
it's a maximum point.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.470
The derivative going into
that point is negative.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.740
The derivative going into that
point is negative-- sorry,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.070
the derivative going into
that point is positive.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.110
So we are increasing.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.620
The slope is positive.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.450
And then after we
cross that point,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.900
the slope becomes negative.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:13.000
The derivative cross the x-axis,
the slope becomes negative.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.070
I actually want to
use that same color.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:20.140
It looks like this.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.500
And then, of
course, the graph is

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.510
going to cross the--
it's going to have

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.140
a y-intercept,
something like that.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.310
And then, as we
approach 2, we are

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.690
approaching another
critical point.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.830
Now what is f of 2?

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:44.550
f of 2 is going to be equal
to positive 8 minus 24 plus 2.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.740
So this is 10 minus 24, which
is equal to negative 14.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.540
So let's say this is the point
negative 14 right over here.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.040
Actually I can draw
it a little bit.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.160
Let's say this is negative 14.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.870
So this is f of 2
right over there.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.810
And we saw already that
the slope is negative

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.800
as we approach it.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.420
So our function is
decreasing as we approach it.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.160
And then right there
the slope is 0.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.700
We figured that
out earlier, that's

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.890
how we identified it
being a critical point.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.700
And then the slope is
increasing after that,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.240
the derivative is positive.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.850
The slope is increasing.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.700
So this is our
sketch of what f of x

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.770
could look like given that
these are the critical points.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:30.320
And we were able to identify
2 as a minimum point.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.870
So this was a minimum value.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.430
The function takes on a minimum
value when x is equal to 2.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.310
And the function took
on a maximum value

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.510
when x was equal to negative 2.
