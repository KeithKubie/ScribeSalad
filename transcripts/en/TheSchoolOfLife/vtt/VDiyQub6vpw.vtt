00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.390
Athens, 2400 years ago. It’s a compact place:
only about a quarter of a million people live here.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.120
There are fine baths, theatres, temples,
shopping arcades and gymnasiums

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
It’s warm for more than half the year.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.680
This is also home to the world’s first true
– and probably greatest – philosopher:

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.640
Plato

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.640
Born into a prominent and wealthy family in the city,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.080
Plato devoted his life to one goal:
helping people to reach a state of what he termed:

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.840
εὐδαιμονία (Eudaimonia) or fulfilment.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.000
Plato is often confused with Socrates

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.120
Socrates was an older friend,
who taught Plato a lot but didn’t write any books.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.659
Plato wrote lots of them: 36, all
dialogues: beautifully crafted scripts of

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.820
imaginary discussions in which Socrates is
always allocated a starring role - among them:

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.110
The Republic
The Symposium

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.159
The Laws
The Meno

00:00:59.159 --> 00:00:59.839
and
The Apology

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.220
Plato had four big ideas for making life more
fulfilled.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.760
First big idea: Think more

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.549
We rarely give ourselves time to think carefully
and logically about our lives and how to live

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.080
them.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.070
Sometimes we just go along with what the the
Greeks called ‘doxa’: ‘popular opinions’.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.900
In the the 36 books he wrote, Plato showed
this ‘common-sense’ to be riddled with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020
errors, prejudice and superstition.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.390
Fame is great

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.400
Follow your heart

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850
Money is the key to a good life

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.170
The problem is, popular opinions edge us towards
the wrong values, careers and relationships.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.760
Plato’s answer is

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.640
‘Know yourself.’

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.030
It means doing a special kind of therapy,
philosophy:

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.410
Subjecting your ideas to examination rather
than acting on impulse.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.000
If you strengthen your self-knowledge, you
don’t get so pulled around by feelings.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.600
Plato compared the role of our feelings to
being

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.540
dragged dangerously along by a group of wild horses.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.970
In honor of his mentor and friend, Socrates,
this kind of examination is called a Socratic discussion.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.600
You can have it with yourself
or ideally, with another person who isn’t

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.370
trying to catch you out but wants to help
you clarify your own ideas.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.290
Second Big idea: Let your lover change you.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.410
That sounds weird, if you think that love
means

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.860
finding someone who wants you just the way you are.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.100
In The Symposium , Plato’s play about a
dinner party where a group of friends drink

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.810
too much and get talking about love, sex and relationships,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.450
Plato says:
“True love is admiration.”

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.570
In other words, the person you need to get
together with should have very good qualities

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.460
… which you yourself lack.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.120
Let’s say, they should be really brave

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.500
Or organised.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.360
Or warm and sincere

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.660
By getting close to this person, you can become
a little like they are.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.690
The right person for us helps us grow to our
full potential.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.900
For Plato, in a good relationship, a couple
shouldn’t love each other exactly as they

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.349
are right now.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.200
They should be committed to educating each
other – and to enduring the stormy passages

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.370
this inevitably involves.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.470
Each person should want to seduce the other
into becoming a better version of themselves.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.040
Three: decode the message of beauty.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.500
Everyone – pretty much – likes beautiful
things

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.310
Plato was the first to
ask why do we like them?

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.230
He found a fascinating reason:

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.790
Beautiful objects are whispering important
truths to us about the good life …

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.440
We find things beautiful when we unconsciously
sense in them qualities we need

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.380
but are missing in our lives.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.690
gentleness

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.680
harmony

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.620
balance

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.520
peace

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.480
strength

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760
Beautiful objects therefore have a really
important function.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.660
They help to educate our souls.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.830
Ugliness is a serious matter too. it parades
dangerous and damaged characteristics in front

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.550
of us. It makes it harder to be wise, kind
and calm.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.010
Plato sees art as therapeutic: it is the duty
of poets and painters (and nowadays, novelists,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.650
television producers and designers) to help
us live good lives.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.060
Four: Reform society.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.780
Plato spent a lot of time thinking how the
government and society should ideally be.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.019
He was the world’s first utopia thinker.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.579
In this, he was inspired by Athens’s great
rival: Sparta.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.650
This was a city-sized machine for turning
out great soldiers

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.940
Everything the Spartans did – how they raised
their children, how their economy was organised,

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:32.110
whom they admired, how they had sex, what
they ate – was tailored to that one goal.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.460
And Sparta was hugely successful, from a military
point of view.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.930
But that wasn’t Plato’s concern. He wanted
to know: how could a society get better at

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.529
producing not military power but fulfilled
people?

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.120
In his book, The Republic, Plato identifies
a number of changes that should be made:

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.990
Athenian society was very focused on the rich,
like the louche aristocrat Alcibiades, and

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.210
sports celebrities, like the boxer Milo of
Croton.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.580
Plato wasn’t impressed: it really matters
who we admire, because celebrities influence our

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.580
outlook, ideas and conduct. And bad heroes
give glamour to flaws of character.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.050
Plato therefore wanted to give Athens new
celebrities, replacing the current crop with

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.389
ideally wise and good people he called Guardians

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.400
models for everyone’s good development. These people

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.699
would be distinguished by their record of
public service, their modesty and simple habits,

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.659
their dislike of the limelight and their wide
and deep experience.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.339
They would be the most honored and admired people in society.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:38.289
He also wanted to end democracy in Athens.
He wasn’t crazy. He just observed how few

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.139
people think properly before they vote and
therefore we get very substandard rulers.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.979
He didn’t want to replace democracy with
horrid dictatorship;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.020
but wanted to prevent people from voting until
they had started to think rationally. Until

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.369
they had become philosophers. Otherwise, government
would just be a kind of mob rule [back to

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.839
To help the process, Plato started a school,
The Academy, in Athens, which lasted a good

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:08.479
300 years. There, pupils learnt not just maths
and spelling, but also how to be good and

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.629
kind.

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:13.689
His ultimate goal was that politicians should
become philosophers: ‘The world will not

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.430
be right,’ he said, ‘until kings become
philosophers or philosophers kings.’ [show

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.449
Hollande, Merkel, Cameron all trooping into
a uni- then coming out as philosophers]

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:16.460
Plato’s ideas remain deeply provocative
and fascinating. What unites them is their

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.479
ambition and their idealism. He wanted philosophy
to be a tool to help us change the world.

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:16.979
We should continue to be inspired by his example.
