[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.380
MATT: Jesse, who
is our guest, has

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.070
been working with Anji
Play in China, which

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.110
I think is a really
awesome new way of teaching

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.880
kids at an early childhood
just to be better people,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.512
which I think is a good thing.

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:21.970
I'm not going to
steal his thunder,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.958
so I'll let him go ahead and
tell you what it's all about.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.356
JESSE COFFINO: Hi, everyone.

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:32.640
And thanks, Matt, for
that lovely introduction.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970
And it's really
quite an honor to be

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.720
at Google talking to
people that are part

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.980
of a revolutionary endeavor
to change how we think

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.880
and interact and what we do.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.030
And so it's a really,
I think, fitting place

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.930
to talk about what's happening
in Anji, China, what's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.120
starting to grow across
China, and what's

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.240
now coming to the United States
in the form of Anji Play.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.470
And so Matt gave you a
brief introduction to me,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.050
but I want to give you
some context about why

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.080
I'm the person here talking to
you, what my background is, how

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.180
I'm involved in this project.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.880
About 3 and 1/2 years
ago, I get a phone call.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910
And it's from a
close friend, a woman

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.780
by the name of Dr. Chelsea
Bailey, former professor

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.750
of early education at
NYU, somebody with decades

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.620
of experience in the field.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.870
And she says to me, Jesse,
I'm in Anji County, China.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.340
There's a revolution
taking place.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.040
I think she used the word
epistemological shift.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.290
She said, the world
is going to change

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.840
because of the work that's
taking place right here, right

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.620
now.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.430
You speak Chinese.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.554
You read and write Chinese.

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:39.860
You're about to be a father.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.660
You should stop
whatever you're doing,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.000
and you should become a part
of what's happening right here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300
And I am 100% certain
that in that moment,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.097
my thought was, you're
out of your mind.

00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:53.180
This is why I told you not
to drink the tap water.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.670
You need to sleep more.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.430
But I said, I don't know.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.670
I'm a little bit busy.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
She said, well, there's a
woman named Ms. Cheng Xueqin.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.067
She is the force, the
mind, the drive behind

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:08.900
what's taking place.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.970
And I'm bringing her
to the United States,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.680
and she's going to
give some talks.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.750
And I've got a
PowerPoint, and I need

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.720
you to translate that
PowerPoint for me.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.490
It seemed like something I
could stomach as a friend.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.640
I was interested.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520
I'm a skeptic naturally,
but I was like, OK.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.930
Let's take a look.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.160
So she sends me through
a 200 page PowerPoint.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.950
And I opened it up, and
immediately, within seconds,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.880
I see a clarity, a profundity,
a depth of purpose,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.670
and I see what
Chelsea's talking about.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.360
And I spend the entire night
translating the PowerPoint,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.210
and I stopped everything
else that I was doing.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.800
And that's why I'm here now.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.320
And so in that period,
I've spent time

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.510
in Anji, China, a lot of
time with Ms. Cheng, who

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.200
has developed this approach.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.980
I have worked as
her interpreter.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.290
I've brought educators
from the United States

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.570
and Australia and Bangladesh
and Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.960
I brought them to Anji
to experience this.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.350
And so today I'm going to
share my view as a parent,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.030
because one of the really
lasting changes that Anji

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.860
Play has made in my
life personally--

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.860
and this is why I'm sticking
to this contextual, personal

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.890
introduction-- is it's
changed how I see my child.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.860
And what I expect of
people that are going

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.750
to be taking care of her and how
they see her and how I see her

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.910
and how my wife
sees her is informed

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.850
by this engagement
with these ideas.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.540
So my PowerPoint is going to be
about 1/10 as long as the one

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.990
that I interpreted
and translated.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.000
If it has 1/100 of
the clarity and depth,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.340
then I feel like this
will be worth it for you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.550
guys to be here.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.180
So I'm going to
start on that note,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.486
and I'm going to
start with this.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:04.800
It says, this is your
brain-- or this is my brain.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.830
I want you guys to take a
minute to take out your Pixel 2

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.460
or open a Google
Doc, and I want you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.079
to write down or recall
your deepest memory of play

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:18.685
as a child--

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:20.310
your deepest memory
of play as a child.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.393
I want you to take a
minute-- the first thing that

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:23.480
comes to your mind.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.580
Think about where
you were, what you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.697
saw, what you smelled, who you
were with, what was going on.

00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:29.780
And really think about it.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.170
And why this is important will
become clear in a few minutes.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:18.910
All right, I hope everybody has
a memory of play as a child.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.970
So Anji, China-- this
place that is the cradle

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.400
of a shift in how we
think about children,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.670
how we think about the role
of the teacher, the role

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.190
of the adult, the
role of society,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.360
really, in supporting the
growth, the development,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.430
the learning of the child.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.270
I think of it as the
Mendocino County of Shanghai.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.070
It's about a three-hour drive.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.670
It's beautifully
forested in bamboo.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.430
It produces white tea.

00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:58.590
If you remember
"Crouching Tiger,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.950
Hidden Dragon," it's where those
wire fighting scenes were shot.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.590
It's mountainous,
and it's diverse.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.670
You can see-- if
you could just go

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.350
straight southwest
from Shanghai,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.080
it's a three-hour drive.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.470
It's rural enough,
and it's originally

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.350
disconnected enough that it
has its own distinct culture--

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.530
its own distinct way of
being, way of living.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.920
It's a really gorgeous,
pleasant place to be,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.204
and I hope that all of
you will join us there,

00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:31.120
because we do have
opportunities to come visit

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.940
and to see what's
happening there.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.730
In 1999, Ms. Cheng is
appointed to the position

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.110
of director of pre-primary
education for Anji County.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.240
In China, the way the
system works is you

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.140
have kindergarten, which
is for ages 3 to 6.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.000
It's not compulsory.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.360
It's optional.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.900
It's not a mandated curriculum.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.140
There are very broad
guidelines, and it's

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.390
provided on a need basis.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.700
So tuition is calculated based
on the financial wherewithal

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.570
of the family.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.570
So when Ms. Cheng comes
in to her position,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.600
she comes from a background
of being an early educator,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.790
of being a preschool teacher.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.200
And when she was in college in
the '80s, when she was learning

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.330
her profession, a lot of
the focus was on traditional

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.230
abilities--

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.520
playing the piano,
drawing, singing--

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.741
approaches to
entertaining children.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.240
And so she was put
in this position.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.940
She was seen as somebody
who had great potential

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.930
for administration.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.940
She moved over from
the side of teaching

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.620
to the side of administration,
and her first and most pressing

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.500
concern was access.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.000
She had a large rural
county with a county seat

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.410
that was fairly urban, and she
knew that her responsibility

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:02.690
was to provide a clean,
safe, accessible space

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.340
for every child in her county.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.120
And I'm not going to go into the
really long and detailed policy

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.280
story of how she
made this happen--

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.470
and it's brilliant, and
I'm happy to share that

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.950
with you if you're interested.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.100
But she went from
a situation where

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.840
they had four sites that were in
the process of being privatized

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.590
at the beginning of
the 2000s when you had

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.530
a shift in economic realities
and the relationship

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.730
between the free market
and the government--

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.590
she made sure that
those schools stayed

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.210
part of her administration, and
then she grew it exponentially.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:40.039
And so from 1999 to 2009, she
goes from 4 sites to 130 sites.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.830
She goes from the
county seat to a point

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.600
where 98.5% of children
between the ages of 3 and 6

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.960
attend a public
kindergarten in Anji County.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.630
So she started by building
the infrastructure.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.840
So what is Anji Play?

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.660
We know where Anji is now.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.170
We know how early
education happens--

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.540
to a degree-- in China.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.320
First and foremost, it began as
a response to national policy.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.350
So in 1989, the UN
passed the Convention

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.940
of the Rights of the Child.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.970
In 1992, China ratifies that.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.860
In 1996, China integrates
a very core concept

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.500
within the Convention, which
is that children have the right

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.550
to play.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.258
They put it in their
guidelines, and then

00:09:28.258 --> 00:09:31.410
in 2001, it becomes even
more firmly established

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.960
at the level of
national policy to say

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.060
that the primary activity
of the child in kindergarten

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.570
should be play.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.480
But as I mentioned
a moment ago, there

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.180
is no mandated curriculum
for kindergartens in China.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.250
There are guidelines--
very broad guidelines.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.150
And so Ms. Cheng,
in her position--

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.640
in her position of
responsibility--

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.730
was confronted with this
question of, may kids play?

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.470
And so she had to
ask herself-- she

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.960
had to respond to this
question of what play is.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.024
What is play?

00:10:00.024 --> 00:10:02.190
And we asked that question
a moment ago to come back

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.810
to some of your memories.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.670
And so as this is
taking shape, she's

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.600
asking herself what play is.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.200
She's responding to
the concerns of parents

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.309
who, very reasonably,
want to know

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:14.100
that their children
are being taken care of

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.020
and that they're learning.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.990
She is responding to a
crisis that she's seeing

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.440
develop amongst her teachers.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.190
That crisis is something
that, in differing degrees,

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.660
exists in the United States.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.270
It exists in your communities--
which is that increasingly,

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.450
the demands of primary
school are being pushed down

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.830
to the early educator.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.320
And what happens then
is the early educator

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.560
is seen as a
caretaker, as a nanny,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.050
as somebody who is failing
at teaching children what

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.530
they need to know.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.620
And so you have the
status of the teacher

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.750
within the community as
one of passive obeyer

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.720
of the demands of the
parent and the demands

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.961
of the primary school,
and you have a question.

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.210
The teacher is saying, well,
what am I supposed to do?

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.700
What is my role?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.350
I have all these
conflicting interests.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.720
I know that I am a professional.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.730
I know that I am somebody
that should be respected.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.660
So one of the questions
that's being considered

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.880
and is being addressed as
this takes shape is, what

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.290
is the role of the teacher?

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.980
Who are they?

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.610
What are they
supposed to be doing?

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.880
There's also a response
to political imperatives

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.730
that's taking place
as this takes shape.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.830
So I share this picture.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.905
This is the party secretary
for a small village in Anji.

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:34.130
His name is Mr. [INAUDIBLE],,
and we've talked to him

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.620
and we visit him
every couple months.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.220
What he describes is
he was taking part

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.500
in Ms. Cheng's drive
to build schools

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.750
where, at the local level,
local leaders were asking

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.630
the people in the villages to
provide land, to provide space,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.790
to provide the
resources to create

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.110
these sites for children.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.340
What he said, is he said, I was
able to convince the villagers

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.620
that they should give
the best part of land

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.600
in the center of our
village over to children,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.380
because I knew that if their
kids were safe, that if they

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.620
were happy, that if they were
learning, they could go to work

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.262
and they could rest assured
that when they're at work,

00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:14.220
they don't have to worry
about what's going on.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.760
And my responsibility is to
the people in my community,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760
and so if we can do that
here, if we can do that

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.134
throughout the
county, then we're

00:12:21.134 --> 00:12:23.850
serving a very important
political role.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.540
So he saw his decision to
support early education

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.190
as a political decision--

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.470
as something that was
about sustainability,

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.300
about creating conditions
for prosperity,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.640
for harmony, things
that are considered

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.656
top national priorities.

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:44.030
And I would assume that those
are top national priorities

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.940
in many countries.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.060
There's also a response
to the status quo.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.720
And this is a very
important frame

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.745
for looking at what's
taking place in Anji.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:58.140
And that is that oftentimes,
when we design systems,

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.330
we first look at
what we're measuring.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.830
We say, here are the outcomes.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.600
And so the question
becomes, who decided

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.840
what those outcomes were,
and why are those outcomes

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.737
dictating our practices?

00:13:08.737 --> 00:13:10.320
Why do you start
with product and then

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.330
move backwards to process?

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.170
And so what was very
fortunate about the situation

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.620
that this moment in Chinese
political and social history

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.770
provided was there
weren't any measures.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.340
They were saying
kids should play.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.410
They weren't saying,
you have to have

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.730
this rating scale or this
preparation for kindergarten.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.150
And so they had the space
to discard those status quo

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.550
definitions of outcomes.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.000
So this is what Anji
County Kindergarten

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.490
looked like before 2001.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.820
Ms. Cheng calls this
the period of no play.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.680
You can see why
she calls it that.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.040
And I can tell you-- and
I've been to a lot of schools

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.730
in the United States that
change out the clothes,

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.570
change out what's going on the
walls, get some pedal desks.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.510
You're going to find
situations in the United States

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.910
where children are being
managed, where they're

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.000
being contained, where
they're expected to sit,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.800
where they're
expected to repeat,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.370
where they're expected
to learn very specific--

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.220
irrelevant, in my mind,
to their experience

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.060
and to their depth and
complexity of knowledge.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.870
So this is what was
happening pre-2001.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:27.740
From 2001 to 2002, Ms.
Cheng takes this imperative

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.290
from the Ministry of Education
that children should play.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.020
And so what do they do?

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.830
They build beautiful
environments, beautiful,

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:42.920
lifelike representations
of food, of various roles,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.780
various spaces, kitchens.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.780
And the teachers
design rules for play.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.880
They organize the
children to play.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.960
And at the same time,
they're winning awards.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.810
At the provincial level,
people are saying, wow,

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.670
look at that
beautiful environment!

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.530
How did you get your
teachers to spend

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.522
all of their time creating this
beautiful space for children?

00:15:04.522 --> 00:15:06.730
And Ms. Cheng walks
into these schools,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.950
and I share this
picture not because you

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.500
can see the environments
that were created--

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.380
what Ms. Cheng said is
that children are not

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.590
smiling with their eyes.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.600
This play does not
belong to these children.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.930
And again, you change a little
bit about the environment.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.180
You remove that Chinese
character in the background.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.300
You can go to a lot of
programs in the United States--

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.000
programs that are
play-based, programs that are

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.380
child-centric, programs that
emphasize the value of playful

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.400
learning--

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.370
and those are the
expressions you see.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.485
So false play was a reality
for Ms. Cheng in Anji,

00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.290
and it's a reality for
us here as parents.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.610
And if we go back to the
political imperatives,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.010
us as citizens--

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.130
because we have to think about
what this is doing to children

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.890
and what that means in terms of
our relationship to children.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.610
So what is true play?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.680
And so this is the question
that Ms. Cheng asked herself.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.930
She said, what is true play?

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.560
And where she started was
with her deepest memories

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.970
of play as a child.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.740
She said, what do I remember?

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.050
What is it in my
childhood that is still

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.390
with me that I can't forget,
that when I think about it,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.152
I smile?

00:16:17.152 --> 00:16:19.360
That when I think about it,
I can smell those smells,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.877
I can see those sites, I know
exactly how I was feeling?

00:16:21.877 --> 00:16:23.710
And that's why I started
with that question,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.390
because that's where she began.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.650
She began with the sense of a
deep sense of responsibility

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.350
to children, to her
teachers, to her community.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.350
And that began with a
question, and the question

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.930
that she started to ask her
teachers and her principals.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.280
Because what she saw--

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.380
she saw teachers
and principals who

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.430
were spending days and
nights creating environments

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.750
that children didn't enjoy.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.940
And so there was a tension.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.130
There was a opposition.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:51.730
I'm a teacher.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.910
I'm trying to do things to
make you happy, to play.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:55.619
You're not happy.

00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:56.993
Something wrong
with you, there's

00:16:56.993 --> 00:16:58.180
something wrong with me.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.971
Everybody thinks that
they're not learning.

00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:05.200
It became a very vicious
cycle of opposition,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.910
and that's not what
education is about.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.326
That's not what
learning is about.

00:17:08.326 --> 00:17:11.839
That's certainly not
what play is about.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.510
And so she reached
some conclusions.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.960
And at the end of
our talk here today,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.960
I want to ask you some
questions about your memories.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.609
But she saw some common
characteristics in the memories

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.890
that she and her
principals and the parents

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.280
had about their own play.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.240
Most importantly, the
play that was remembered

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.590
was play that arose from the
interest and the intention

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.760
of the child.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.800
It was play that
was self-determined.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.370
It was played where the child
decided with whom, where,

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.360
and what to play.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.540
It was play that oftentimes
took place out of doors.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.040
It was often risky play.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.300
It often involved
extensive periods of time.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.300
It was play that--

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:58.944
pardon me.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.280
It was play where the outcomes,
in terms of the individual's

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.960
experience, were clear.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.480
They had friendship.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.400
They had bravery.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.162
They discovered.

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:23.070
And so what they decided to
do and what they began to do,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.110
was they decided they
needed to step back.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.280
Ms. Cheng says that her
first instruction to teachers

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.585
is hands down, mouth
closed, ears and eyes open.

00:18:34.585 --> 00:18:36.460
Now, that's not the end
point of the teacher,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.070
but that's the starting point.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.930
Because if you
cannot see true play,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.060
if you cannot allow
for true play,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.590
then you have no way
of knowing to do--

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.644
you have no idea
of how you should

00:18:47.644 --> 00:18:49.060
act next, what you
should do next,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.351
how you should respond to that.

00:18:50.351 --> 00:18:53.890
And if we're saying that
this experience of true play

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.590
is the most fundamental,
the most natural,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.990
the most complex
form of learning

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.922
that a child can engage in,
then that is the priority.

00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:03.880
And so the priority is
to create the conditions

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.140
for that to happen.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.670
Once you create the
conditions for that to happen,

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.410
then you can make decisions
about how to support that,

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:17.770
about how to allow children
to reflect and to share

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.710
and to express and
to build on that play

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:26.680
in order to create knowledge--
to create true, deep learning.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.562
And in that process of
stepping back and observing,

00:19:29.562 --> 00:19:32.020
if you tell the teacher-- or
if the teacher becomes aware--

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.910
that their role is not
to possess the authority

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.715
of knowledge, to transmit the
authority of that knowledge

00:19:39.715 --> 00:19:40.690
to the child--

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.030
but that their stance
is a humble stance

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.700
of seeking to
understand the child,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.010
they gain a deep
sense of expertise.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.680
Because what they're
learning from is children.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.720
Their expertise is
children, and what

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.790
their expertise in
children is is not

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.626
what some dead scholar
said 100 years ago

00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:01.000
or 50 years ago or 20 years
ago or some live scholar said

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.830
5 years ago.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.581
The knowledge that
they have of children--

00:20:04.581 --> 00:20:06.621
the children that they're
seeing that are engaged

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:08.740
in the deepest, most
complex form of learning--

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.960
is coming from their
eyes and their ears.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.345
And they're creating the
conditions for that to happen,

00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:15.970
and so they become
experts in children.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.140
And they can communicate
that expertise.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.280
They can communicate that
expertise to children.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.460
They can communicate that
expertise to parents.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.670
They can communicate that
expertise to primary school

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.420
teachers and policymakers.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.740
And so what you see
when teachers step back,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.680
when they're given that space,
that permission, when they're

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.620
empowered to allow children
to lead their own learning,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:42.190
you see a status change
within community.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.800
And that happened in Anji.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.180
Teachers were no longer
nannies and caretakers.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.080
They weren't passive
receivers of the knowledge

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.550
that they were supposed to pass
on from the primary schools.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.070
And so the more
complexity they observed,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.110
the more they
understood the child.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.420
The more that they were
able to communicate that,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.850
the more value that was
perceived around their work.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.380
And so what we talk about--
and we talk about this,

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.210
and we'll get into
this in more detail,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.940
because risk is an
important aspect of this--

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.730
is that all true
learning-- and what

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.675
they decided when they
stepped back in Anji--

00:21:18.675 --> 00:21:21.440
was that all true
learning takes place

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.749
on the boundaries
of our capacity.

00:21:24.749 --> 00:21:27.040
And if you don't step to the
boundary of your capacity,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.660
you're not learning anything.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.000
And some of you are engineers.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.320
You have to problem solve.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.480
You have to think about how
to do something differently.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.180
You have to push yourself.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.014
You're not sitting there
with instructions about what

00:21:40.014 --> 00:21:40.930
you're supposed to do.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:45.620
You're at your best operating on
the boundaries of your ability.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.110
And so I want to bring us into
a quote here from Ms. Cheng.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.780
And it's a little heady,
but you guys are smart.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.960
And I could choose a quote
that's very touchy-feely,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.420
and there are a lot of those
about how amazing the child is

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.670
and how our job is to
discover the child,

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.030
but I want to go right into
the heart of what this means.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.730
So what she talks about is
returning the right of play

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.660
to children.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.090
And that means the child's
play is self-determined.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.530
It comes from their intention.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.760
And she's not talking
about liberating children.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.695
She's talking about
liberating teachers.

00:22:13.695 --> 00:22:14.570
And that's important.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.360
And as parents, we can think
of it as liberating adults,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.070
because we are not bound by a
need to control or to direct.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.895
And we're put in a position
of truly appreciating,

00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:28.820
of deeply loving
children, because we

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.260
see their capability.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.790
And we get that feedback of
children seeing our trust,

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.110
of feeling our trust,
of understanding

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.900
the respect that we feel for
their ability and knowledge.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.850
And so that's a
liberating feeling.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.040
It's liberating not
to be stuck in a back

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.080
and forth around
getting somebody

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.590
to do what they want to do.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.320
And that's not to say that
as a parent, as a teacher,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.300
there aren't instances
where we have to problem

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.500
solve around getting
somebody to do something.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.060
But when you say that the
primary role of the teacher--

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.510
the primary activity
of the school--

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.020
is a respect and the
creation of conditions

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.180
for deep experiences
of true play,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.020
you get this sense of
liberation, of empowerment.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.150
And then we get into
liberating teachers

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.290
from formalisms
and utilitarianism.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.570
And so utilitarianism
is just the idea

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.550
of outcomes defining
the approach--

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.820
of basing what you're
doing based on a perception

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.680
of what it will lead to.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.620
And so that's assessing how
many letters you have it for.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.250
That's how long you can
sit still without moving

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.870
and do your table work.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.600
That's defining
learning narrowly,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.260
based on measures
that don't account

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.012
for the incredible
depth and the complexity

00:23:44.012 --> 00:23:45.220
of the thinking of the child.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.510
So true play, as
it emerged in Anji,

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:57.092
was defined and continues to
be defined by five core values.

00:23:57.092 --> 00:23:58.300
You can call them conditions.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.830
And the first is love.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:06.770
And love is many things,
but in its most pure form,

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:12.650
is stability and safety
and respect and trust.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.160
It's that place that
you can stand on

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.110
and that you can go
and take that risk.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.967
You can go and do
that thing that you

00:24:18.967 --> 00:24:20.800
don't know the outcome
of, or that you think

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.424
you might know the outcome of.

00:24:22.424 --> 00:24:23.340
But you've known this.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.700
If you're playing and you run
away from home to go play,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.020
you know your home is there.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.480
There's that safe place
that you can return to.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.040
And that's something
that teachers can provide

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.460
and that teachers get
back from children.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.780
It's a deeply ecological
distribution of a condition.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.700
So when teachers provide
that love of a deeply engaged

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.660
presence, of putting the child's
own experience and intention

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.970
on par with the most important--
or treating it as the most

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.470
important--

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.660
activity of the school,
children give that back.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:06.330
Because when I, as a parent,
experience the capability

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.950
of my daughter in negotiating
risk and making discoveries,

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.470
I feel a deep sense of love.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.490
I've given her love.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.140
She's taken my trust
and my respect,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.820
and she's shown me
what she's capable of.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.499
And what happens then is you
can communicate that to parents.

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:23.290
You can communicate
that to administrators.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.914
You can communicate
that to principals.

00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:27.920
And it's not a one-way thing,
and it's not a simple thing.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.920
But what it really allows for--

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.340
that deep sense of
safety and security,

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.710
that deep sense of belonging--

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.380
is it allows for risk.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.490
And as we said, risk is
what learning is about.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.380
Any real learning is testing
the edges of your ability.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.430
It's standing on that
boundary and saying,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.800
I'm going to put my foot over.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.740
And we each experience
risk in a different way.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.300
In Anji, there's an
incredible amount

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.840
of really impressive physical
risk that takes place.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.440
But there's also social
risk, emotional risk.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.220
There's intellectual risk.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.000
Risk is not narrowly
defined as something

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.020
that might make you anxious
because it looks dangerous.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.660
Risk is really about
taking that leap--

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.880
figuratively or literally.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.040
And what you see
here in this image

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.860
is you see children
who have created

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.860
their own conditions for risk.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.580
And there's a lot of research
on this subject that shows that

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.720
when children are allowed to
decide how and when to take

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.020
risks, when they're given
materials that they can master

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.020
and build, that they will take
risks that are developmentally

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.750
appropriate, and they
will-- for that reason--

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.770
be safer.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.290
If you have a fixed
climbing structure,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.240
a child can't decide its height.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.310
They don't have a
knowledge of its structure.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.080
They get bored of being
low, they go high,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.132
and they fall off.

00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:53.340
And they can hurt themselves.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.570
But if you have children who
are building, who are testing,

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.530
who are experimenting, who are
using a minimally-structured,

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.395
large movable material to
build progressively over time

00:27:03.395 --> 00:27:06.020
and they're given the space and
time to do that and they're not

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.660
being told, do this, do
that, take this risk,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.710
take that risk--

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.690
because what's
important about risk

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.190
and what's important
about true play

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.627
is that can't come
from a teacher.

00:27:14.627 --> 00:27:17.210
That can't come from an adult.
If you tell a child to jump off

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.220
of something, that is danger.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.604
If a child builds something
and jumps off, that's risk.

00:27:23.604 --> 00:27:26.020
And so there is a responsibility
to provide materials that

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.720
aren't going to break,
that aren't poisonous,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.740
that spaces don't have pointy
objects sticking out of them.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.320
There is a baseline of safety
that has to be provided.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.990
But beyond that, by
creating materials--

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.420
and these materials, the
materials of Anji-- and there

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.390
are hundreds of materials
that Ms. Cheng has developed

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.180
over time based on her
observation of children

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.070
following specific principles.

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.600
They really create the
potential for maximum complexity

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.780
with minimal structure.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.320
And so what's the
outcome of risk?

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.140
What's the outcome
of risk when you make

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.940
a breakthrough in your work?

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.870
When you do something and you
feel that thrill of jumping off

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.740
that ladder, when you
get up on the stage

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.560
and you give your speech and
you're actually doing OK at it,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.790
you feel joy.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.590
You feel a deep sense of joy.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.840
And that's a reward mechanism.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.380
And to me-- and I think that
there's a lot of science that

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.270
will back me up on this--

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.100
that if you're in
a position where

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.160
you have the sense of safety,
the stability of love,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.459
when you're taking risks and
you feel joy, you're learning.

00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:35.750
You're learning about yourself.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.260
You're learning about the world.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.080
You're learning about
all of the things

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.070
that we try to teach
in very dogmatic ways.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.680
When you go back
to this picture,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.950
there's physics going on there.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.010
There's a lot of science
taking place there.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.900
It wasn't set up for science.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.910
We didn't demand that
they do this for science.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.500
It wasn't designed for science.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.386
But children are embodying--

00:28:58.386 --> 00:29:00.010
with their bodies,
with the materials--

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.800
the materials, in a
way, are an extension.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.350
They're an externalization of
what's happening internally.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.820
They're a part of their
being and their body,

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.160
and so they are feeling.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.440
They are experiencing.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.610
They are building
these concepts.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:15.120
And so that joy--

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.120
that joy makes you want
to take another risk.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.040
It makes you realize that
risk was worth taking.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:27.470
When you get love leading to
risk resulting in joy, what you

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.730
see is a deep, deep engagement.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:40.020
You see children who spend hours
focused on solving problems,

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.940
on negotiating challenges--
socially or intellectually.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.720
You see an engagement that is
the foundation for learning--

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.220
the foundation for learning
that takes place when they're 8,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.928
or when they're 9,
and when they're being

00:29:52.928 --> 00:29:54.880
taught abstract principles.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.974
Not only are they
embodying these principles

00:29:56.974 --> 00:29:58.390
that they're going
to learn later,

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.220
but they see the
experience of engagement

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.370
in understanding the
world as something that

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.300
has deep value and relevance.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.820
The last principle--
the last condition--

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.280
is where we get to the role
of the adult in all this.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.650
Reflection .

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.200
So when we went to
that memory and we

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.740
saw those memories of play where
there weren't adults present,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.770
the difference that we have
is that we have schools.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.790
And schools are systems, and
teachers have responsibilities.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:40.130
And so how do you treat the
experience of deep engagement

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:45.620
and joyful learning as
a fundamental subject

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.920
matter for the children?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.810
Well, what you do is you provide
opportunities for children

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.592
to reflect on their
own experiences.

00:30:53.592 --> 00:30:54.800
And something funny happened.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.500
When they first started
doing this in Anji,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.590
the teachers were
so impressed by what

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.030
they were seeing
the children do,

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.747
they were so excited that they
were pulling out their phones

00:31:04.747 --> 00:31:06.830
and taking pictures and
video, because they wanted

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:07.660
to show the other teachers.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.810
Look what my kid did.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.960
Can your kids do this?

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.710
And they realized that
they wanted to know

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.460
what the children were doing.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.110
And so they began to provide
opportunities for children

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:22.370
to describe and to discuss
their specific experiences.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.690
And so as the teacher
gains knowledge and becomes

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.630
more of an expert in the
children that are in their care

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.640
and in children in
general and children

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.800
in a context of
true play, they are

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.090
deeply attuned to what
those instances of learning

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.430
are-- what those
instances of insight are.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.090
What are those moments when the
children are doing something

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.740
that they haven't done before?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.810
When they're
encountering a problem

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.610
they haven't encountered before.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.340
And so they have that
ability to take a picture,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.350
to take a video
of those moments.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.680
And so when the children
come back into the classroom,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.100
they're invited to
engage in a discussion

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.020
of their own experiences.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.780
And it's very open-ended.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.850
It's not a leading discussion.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.190
The children are really
leading their own description

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.240
of their own experience.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.420
And what's crucial here is
the experiences that they're

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.210
describing are
experiences that have

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.980
come from their own intention.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.530
These are things that are
deeply interesting to them,

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.509
because it's coming from them.

00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:27.800
It's what they were just doing.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.180
It's what they chose to do.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.760
And so in the classroom,
that experience

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.620
is what is considered the source
of knowledge-- of learning.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.550
That is the experience that
the children are being told--

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.800
that are being communicated
to through the decisions

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.760
of the teacher--

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.280
is what is most valuable.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.270
And so what you see
is you see discussions

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.890
around problem solving.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.170
You see complexity
in descriptions

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.324
of physical principles.

00:32:54.324 --> 00:32:55.990
You see children
talking about the rules

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.340
that they have established.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.610
You see children talking about
how they've solved conflict.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.170
You have an opportunity
for children

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.180
to engage in thinking
about their own thinking.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.250
They're engaging in
metacognitive reflection

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.524
around their own decisions--
around their own complex

00:33:08.524 --> 00:33:09.190
decision making.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.720
And as this takes
shape over time,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.190
there's a decision that
there's a really important role

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:26.080
for children to take part
in art and description.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.722
And there are broad guidelines.

00:33:28.722 --> 00:33:30.430
There are guidelines
for early education,

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.147
and art is part of
those guidelines.

00:33:32.147 --> 00:33:34.480
And so it's important, in the
school, that children have

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.610
access to materials for art.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.230
They decided that
the children should

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:43.802
have an opportunity every day to
draw a story of their own play.

00:33:43.802 --> 00:33:46.040
And that starts when they're
three, when they first

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.290
start in kindergarten, and
it continues all the way up

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.130
until they're six.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.650
So every day, the child
is given an opportunity

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.930
without any other
prompt than to draw

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.930
or to depict the experience
of your own play.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.710
And again, what you see
is you see an eagerness

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.110
to talk about what was
taking place-- again,

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.110
for that same reason that
that play came directly

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.090
from their own intentionality.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.090
And what you see on the
back is you see writing.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.280
And that writing is the
child's own description

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.280
of their drawing,
which is transcribed

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.044
by a teacher or a parent.

00:34:18.044 --> 00:34:19.460
So if you think
about it, you have

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.314
14,000 kids that are doing
this on a daily basis in Anji.

00:34:23.314 --> 00:34:24.980
Over the course of a
school year, that's

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.460
about 3.5 million play
stories created every year.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.730
What you have is a
record of the learning

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.190
of the experience of
the child, and you see

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.949
a medium for shared knowledge--

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.989
for shared experience.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:44.280
You see a medium for
sharing across schools.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.440
And again, you see
documentation that

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.170
comes from the child,
that's put on the wall, that

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:57.440
becomes the primary expression
of the value of the school.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.770
So not only does this practice
result in deep reflection,

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.570
problem solving, planning.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:05.950
You see schematics.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.736
You see the development
of narrative storylines.

00:35:08.736 --> 00:35:09.610
You see these cells--

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.240
One child starts doing
that, and all the children

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.380
start doing it.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.530
You see a culture and
a language develop

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.160
from the child's own reckoning
with their experience

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.100
of learning.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.080
So complexity-- I've been using
the word complexity a lot.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.760
I haven't really given you
guys much basis for that claim.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.690
So I want to share a
quote, and again, I--

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:40.240
Alison Gopnik, who is a very
brilliant, respected professor

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.690
at UC Berkeley, who is on
the cutting-edge of research

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.970
into cognitive
development-- she talks

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.720
about causal relationships--
causal mapping.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.170
That our deepest thinking
is around cause and effect--

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.740
creating conditions and
reassessing those causes

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.670
and effects, making
inferences, and then planning.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.720
And that's where
imagination and that's

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.200
where inference comes from.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.720
So you see that
complexity that's

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.540
taking place in
environments where,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.250
rather than a top-down model of
assessing specific skill sets

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.890
and learning outcomes,
you're saying the child

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:18.560
has a capacity for
deep complexity

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.850
and deep causal mapping.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.530
And so where are we now,
and why are we here,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.260
and what's going
on in our context?

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.800
And there's a debate that's
gone on for about 3,000 years--

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.320
at least in the west.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.730
It's empiricism on one hand
and rationalism on the other.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:45.240
And the empirical argument is
that we gain our knowledge--

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.130
our mind develops
from sensory input.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.764
So experience informs
our knowledge.

00:36:49.764 --> 00:36:52.180
If we don't experience it,
it's not part of our knowledge.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.540
And what rationalism says
is that essentially, we're

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.250
born with little
acorns in our minds,

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.620
and they become oak trees.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.260
And it's all there, and
it unravels over time.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.370
And that has characterized, to
a great extent, our theories

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.760
of mind and our approaches
to understanding how we think

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.650
and how we develop.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.750
And as we get into
the 20th century,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.700
you move towards
an understanding

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.620
of behavior and development--

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.710
a scientific
description of why we

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.290
make decisions to
act certain ways,

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.170
and how we progress over
time developmentally.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.510
And so in both instances,
there is deep truth to that.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.140
If I give my daughter a cookie,
she'll get in the stroller.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.040
That's behaviorism.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.220
That works.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.230
It's very limited.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.560
It shouldn't be a strategy
for teaching or for respecting

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.680
the ability of the
child, but it's

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.350
present in how we think about
interactions with children.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.240
And developmentalism,
which talks

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.340
about stages of development.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.650
And it looks at
development as taking place

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.160
in a linear fashion.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.420
It posits that the ideal
outcome is rationality--

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.250
is rational adult thought--

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.440
and that our role as
adults, or as teachers,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.370
is to help children get from
one step to the next step,

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.021
to the next step, either in the
deepest or the most efficient

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:10.520
way.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.560
And I like to sum
it up by saying,

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.639
we know what comes next.

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:16.430
We can predict what's
going to happen next,

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.190
and so we can help children get
from that one place to another.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.410
And a lot has happened
since B. F. Skinner

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.000
and Piaget were around.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.170
There's been a lot of new
thinking about education.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.780
But this is a lineage
that still runs

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.060
very deep in how we
think about children

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.490
and how we educate children,
how we measure children,

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.840
and how we assess teachers.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.170
And so what happens in the '80s
and '90s, what happens with

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.430
Alison Gopnik--

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:42.780
is there is a rethinking of
these ideas of rationalism,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.900
of empiricism, of behaviorism,
of developmentalism.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.630
There is idea that comes
forward called Theory theory.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:55.250
And there's a elegant
simplicity to it

00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.507
that I think speaks to what we
see happening in Anji Play--

00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:02.090
what we see happening
in Anji, what we

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.170
see happening in
experiences of true play.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.090
And the idea is that we're
born with an essential theory--

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:11.330
essentially, a sort of
scientific method that,

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.360
through inputs, we
can draw conclusions

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.620
about cause and effect.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.810
And as we draw
those conclusions,

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.270
we refine our theories
and create new theories.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.147
So in a sense, there
is an empirical aspect.

00:39:23.147 --> 00:39:24.980
We're using these inputs
and our experience,

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.810
and there's a certain
rationalist aspect.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.480
We have this essential
theory that we're born with.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.760
But what that means is
that the more complexity,

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.120
the more opportunity you
have in terms of inputs.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.050
The more space you're given
to create new theories,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.480
to adjust your
theories, to engage

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.310
in that Bayesian adjustment
of predictions of outcomes

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.810
based on new inputs--

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.950
then you have, in the
period of development

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.920
between 0 and 6 or 0 and 8--

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.490
essentially, genius-like
thinking-- thinking that

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:04.025
isn't constrained by specific
naming of experiences.

00:40:04.025 --> 00:40:05.900
And so there's a way in
which the work that's

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.029
happening at Google represents,
in a way, this paradigm shift.

00:40:09.029 --> 00:40:10.820
I know that nobody here
is going to tell me

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.150
how the algorithm works,
but it's not a linear--

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.070
you get from here to there.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.430
There is a consideration
of a variety of inputs,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.500
of thinking about how
things are related,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.860
and then decisions
made based on how that

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:30.200
works in a given situation based
on a universe of possibilities.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.570
And so the danger that we have--

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.580
the great danger that we have--

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.340
is to say that that
is a deficient adult.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.490
Your job's to get out of that,
because that's not thinking.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.324
That's not learning.

00:40:43.324 --> 00:40:44.698
Let's get those
numbers into you.

00:40:44.698 --> 00:40:46.240
Let's get those
letters into you.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.620
And particularly in
communities where

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.770
there has been a systematic
denial of opportunities

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.910
for play--

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:59.410
where policy, where capital
has decided that in order

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.410
to solve a deficit,
we're going to teach

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.510
you earlier and
faster and harder

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.020
and we're going to
measure you more.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.680
And we're not only
going to measure you.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.900
We're going to
measure the teachers,

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.040
because if you're not
learning your letters,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.340
your teachers are failing.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.100
We should take their money away.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:19.030
There is a very vicious
and oppressive outcome

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:24.250
that is born from ignoring
this paradigmatic shift in how

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.720
we see the mind.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.900
And that shift is just
now being embodied

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.331
in a very systematic
approach to education,

00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:32.830
and that's what's
happening in Anji.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.780
And that's why what
we're talking about

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.960
is a revolutionary,
epistemological, paradigmatic

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.340
shift away from teachers
as keepers of knowledge

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.760
to teachers as
creators of conditions

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.820
for deep, authentic
learning that receives

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.120
the respect that it deserves.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.840
So we oftentimes talk about
Anji Play in a variety of terms.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.040
It can be referred to, I
think, as a philosophy.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.440
I think that's accurate--
a philosophy of education.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.800
It can be referred to as
a complete, comprehensive

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.320
approach to early education.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:12.060
In its totality, it consists
of materials, technologies,

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.280
practices, environments.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.300
But the reason it
works, its DNA,

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.910
the reason it's different
from a top-down model

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:24.150
of defining outcomes that
every kid should have,

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.810
is because it's a
grassroots ecology that

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.450
is based on respect for
the child, for the family,

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.360
and for the teacher.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.600
And so that ecology
connects all of these points

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.850
in a relationship that's defined
by those crucial elements

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.722
of learning and experience.

00:42:44.722 --> 00:42:46.180
And we talk about
this in our work.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.210
And my work, for the last
3 and 1/2 years, has been,

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.880
how do I share
this with integrity

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.260
with the world outside of China?

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.470
And that work includes
working with pilot partners

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.640
in the United States.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.140
It includes talking to parents.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.440
It includes talking
to educators.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.790
And whenever we look
at what we're doing,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.100
we look at these
five principles.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.010
And if something doesn't
feel right, I say,

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.900
is there some issue
around the love?

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.430
Is somebody not
feeling love here?

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.264
Are we not on the same
page about our risk?

00:43:15.264 --> 00:43:16.180
I will look at myself.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.670
I say, why am I
not deeply engaged?

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.920
Am I not feeling a sense
of joy from what I'm doing?

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.370
And then maybe we haven't
been reflecting enough.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.160
There is a way in which--

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.010
the definition of this ecology
is these five principles,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.430
and it stretches
beyond a curriculum,

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.520
and it's what creates the
strength for it to take place.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.170
It's what creates the
conditions for it to grow.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:51.150
And it's why it can't
be easily boiled down

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.490
to a simple set of instructions.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:58.780
It's not a boxed
binder of lesson plans.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.730
It's about a fundamental
change in the stance

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:08.070
of the adult towards the child.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.290
And so what you
see as this happens

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.800
is that you have support.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.940
So as government officials
see joyous children,

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.010
as parents see
joyous children, they

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.650
become involved in the
work of the school--

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.540
in the work of the teacher.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.210
There's a whole
description of how

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.900
the materials and
the environments

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.110
have taken shape
over time, and that

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.710
involves parents bringing in
their own experiences of play

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.910
as children--

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.220
of reflecting on
what they were doing

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.610
when they were kids, building
brick ovens for their children

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.820
in their schools.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.630
So there's a way in which the
creation of this ecology--

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.630
this deep engagement around
the learning of the children--

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:50.280
allows for a virtuous
cycle of strengthening

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.290
where the more you
become a part of it,

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.777
the more you can bring into it.

00:44:55.777 --> 00:44:57.360
And what we're seeing
now is that it's

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.344
impacting elementary education.

00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:01.760
The elementary
schools in Anji are

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.636
getting children who
are deeply engaged

00:45:03.636 --> 00:45:04.760
in the process of learning.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.800
And so as a result,
the entire province--

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.730
Zhejiang Province-- has
eliminated academic instruction

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.280
and testing and assessment
in the first year

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.050
of primary school.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:18.200
So there's a recognition
that something important is

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.770
taking place and that
it would be a shame--

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.590
it would be almost a crime--

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.860
to stop that from happening--
to cut it off too early.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.239
So again, the role of
parents, vis-a-vis teachers--

00:45:32.239 --> 00:45:33.780
I'm speaking to you
guys as a parent.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.840
It's often seen as the
biggest challenge of schools

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.980
to communicate with parents.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.490
And so that's why
part of the ecology

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.370
is the engagement and the
participation of the parent.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.970
The parent's ability to
own the same expertise--

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.680
to feel the same expertise--

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.430
the teachers have.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.800
And so there's,
again, strategies,

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.420
and there are vehicles for
that to take place within Anji.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.280
And again, resources,
materials, environments--

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.000
the things that schools need--

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.880
the thing that
schools here need--

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.780
become more freely
available when

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.450
the people who make
decisions about them

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.560
have a deep belief and
engagement in what's

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.950
taking place.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.630
So I want to just briefly touch
on the role of technology.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.580
I want to give
everybody a chance

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.790
for questions and answers.

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.729
But technology is a really--

00:46:26.729 --> 00:46:28.520
and, I mean, we're
standing here at Google.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.780
You guys know what
technology is.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.880
Technology-- there's
a lot of controversy

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.040
over what the role
of technology should

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.030
be in the lives of children.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.110
And so when you go into
an Anji Play school,

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.740
you see teachers with
smartphones taking

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.450
video of children playing.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.950
And what that
video is being used

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:53.400
for-- as we were discussing--
is sharing and reflection.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.110
The children are seeing
their own experiences,

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.960
and they're having an
opportunity to describe them

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.640
and to reflect on them.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.150
It engages children in
an active reconsideration

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.870
of their own learning.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.680
But fundamentally,
technology is a tool

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.380
for respecting the
experience of the child.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.530
Technology is not a passive
medium for delivering content

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.390
that's been developed
by adults-- again--

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:22.280
to derive those
outcomes by some advisor

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.740
who said that this is how you
can get kids to learn colors

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.060
faster.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:31.550
Technology becomes a tool that
the adult has to document--

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.720
to value--

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.550
the learning of the child.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:40.320
It's also a method for teachers
to develop, for administrators

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.280
to develop.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.640
When you have a deep record
of children's experiences,

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.970
you have the basis
for engaged discussion

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.780
about what's taking place.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.770
You have an opportunity to
understand the learning that's

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.980
taking place for children,
and you have the opportunity

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.350
to understand what
decisions about materials

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.520
and environments--

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.230
what impact that's
having on children.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.190
And you see the ability
to share with parents.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:13.030
That when parents see the
capacity of their child, when

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.470
they have an opportunity
to experience

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.700
the bravery, the
compassion, the ingenuity

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.530
of their own children-- again,
that's part of the ecology.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.610
So insofar as technology
has a crucial role in Anji,

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:34.600
it has a role in supporting the
development of that ecology.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.960
And for now, as we begin to
expand what's taking place

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.800
in Anji to sites in the United
States and in other parts

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.190
of the world, technology
allows us to communicate across

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:50.170
distance, to share in that
professional development--

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.780
that understanding,
that analysis--

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.190
with China, with Budapest,
with Madison, Wisconsin.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.089
And so we can share
and we can talk about,

00:49:00.089 --> 00:49:01.880
and we can think about
what's taking place.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.546
And we can think about
what we're doing,

00:49:03.546 --> 00:49:05.240
as adults, based on
what we're seeing,

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.805
and based on what
we're documenting.

00:49:08.805 --> 00:49:13.900
And again, a natural development
of a practice, of a use,

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.830
from that starting point--

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.290
that humble place
of saying, there

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:24.610
is something that a child can
do that I have no idea about.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.880
There is an ability,
there is a capacity

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.219
that I have no ability
to guess or predict.

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.760
And so what I have to do is I
have to seek to understand that

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.480
and to see that.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.370
That's my role.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:39.410
And so technology is a tool
that's come out of that.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.690
Because once you see
that thing, you really

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.940
want to know what's going on.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.330
And so obviously,
in Anji, that's

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.788
asking children
what they're doing.

00:49:45.788 --> 00:49:47.820
It's letting children
draw that experience.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.320
It's having them
talk to each other.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.980
But as a teacher,
or as a parent,

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.960
it's the opportunity
to review that,

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.820
to think about that, to
document that, to keep that.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.820
And again, it's an
acknowledgment of the fact

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.930
that technology exists,
that it's powerful,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.950
that it's unavoidable.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:11.380
I think it's a mistake
to say technology is bad.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.750
Children shouldn't
be exposed to it.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.630
And then go out in the world
and see technology everywhere.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:20.410
So it acknowledges the
reality of technology,

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:26.620
and it uses it to crucially
respect and reflect the child's

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.584
experience and learning.

00:50:28.584 --> 00:50:30.250
So a typical day in
an Anji Play school.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.749
And I know we're
getting to the end,

00:50:31.749 --> 00:50:34.640
and so I want to just zoom
through this really quickly.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.750
But again, the primary
experience of learning

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.060
is open-ended,
self-determined play.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.562
And that's given, usually,
at least two hours every day.

00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:45.520
But it's a full-time
schedule, so there's a lot

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.530
of other things that happen.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.600
There is the daily
contact that comes

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.480
when you drop off your child and
pick up your child at school.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.650
There's outdoor play.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.320
There's also indoor play.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.350
There's time that's provided
for reflection, for expression,

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.180
for self-care.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.430
The children are
encouraged to take the lead

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.400
in learning how to use the
bathroom, how to drink water,

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.464
how to take care
of themselves-- how

00:51:08.464 --> 00:51:09.880
to do all of those
things that are

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.110
necessary for ownership
of one's own experience

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.220
and self-sufficiency.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.580
There is a lot of
inquiry that takes place.

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.670
And what I call
extemporized pedagogy--

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.547
I think that there is a term
called emergent curriculum,

00:51:24.547 --> 00:51:27.130
and in my understanding, it's a
little bit different than what

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:27.955
happens in Anji.

00:51:27.955 --> 00:51:32.290
But it's really about creating
opportunities for children

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:34.100
to learn based on their
expressed interest.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.300
And it's less like what we think
of as project-based learning,

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.450
because it's more immediately
responsive to what's happening.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:42.820
And so the teachers
do play a role

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:47.630
in providing that support
for the children's interests.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:49.720
So I think it's a mistake
to think of the teachers

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.254
as standing behind a glass
wall and letting children

00:51:53.254 --> 00:51:54.170
do whatever they want.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:57.790
The teacher has a role of
authority-- of respect--

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.610
that they create
routines, that they

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.290
are the people
that are protecting

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.400
the play of the child.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.390
But they're teachers.

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.730
It's not a free-for-all.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.670
It's not "Lord of the Flies."

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.160
It's expertise at it's
finest, really, in teaching.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.580
And so what you have from
this is you have flexibility

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.120
so that teachers can decide
how aspects of the day

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.780
are organized based
on what they observe

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.460
in the interest of the teacher.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.680
And again, that's a deep
respect for the teacher

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.500
in making decisions about
what is most important based

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.180
on their knowledge
of the children that

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.760
are in their care, and
protecting teacher time.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.230
And so every Friday
is a half day,

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.210
and during that second
part of the day,

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.890
the teachers get
together and they

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.561
talk about what
they've seen that week.

00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:44.560
They share their videos.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.610
They talk to each other .

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.700
They meet both within the
school and between schools.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.260
And that time for reflection--

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:57.180
that time for joyous engagement
in understanding the children--

00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.520
becomes the basis
for their decisions

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.600
as teachers moving forward.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.710
And again, regular opportunities
for parent engagement-- parents

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.450
are brought in to
take part in play,

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:13.520
to engage in documentation,
to engage in sessions where

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.980
the more experienced
parents lead them

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.530
in video analysis
of children's play.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.386
So again, that part
of the ecology-- that

00:53:21.386 --> 00:53:23.510
engagement with the parent,
the bringing the parent

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:26.290
into the experience
of the school.

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:29.900
And now we're
really bringing this

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.150
to programs in
the United States.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:36.170
That's a really critical
aspect of our work--

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:40.700
is that as it scales in China,
as it scales beyond the 14,000

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.950
children in Anji
to 80,000 children,

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.970
now, throughout
Huzhou Municipality,

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.550
it's set, now, to expand
across Zhejiang Province

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.840
to all 90 counties.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.390
And it's become a matter
of national importance

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.580
at the Ministry of
Education level--

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.520
that these
opportunities for play

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.830
are crucially important for
children in the United States.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.180
And so what we're doing is
we're working with partners

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.740
that see the value of this--
that see the necessity of this

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.890
for their community.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.890
And so we're really
focused on programs

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.710
that serve children that
have often been denied

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.170
these opportunities for play.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.360
We've decided that to
create a model that

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.470
will allow us to scale
this with integrity,

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:28.640
with fidelity, with purpose,
that we have to begin working

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.550
with partners that don't have
huge budgets, that don't have

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:37.020
the access to every new
thing that comes up,

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.650
but with programs that
are deeply committed

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.470
to the importance and the
urgency of this experience

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.000
for their children and
for their communities.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.020
And so right now, we've got
partners in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.478
We're doing this incredible
program with the Madison Public

00:54:51.478 --> 00:54:55.410
Library, which is a free drop-in
program with the public parks

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.160
there.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.592
With Sierra college, which is
in California, and Contra Costa

00:54:59.592 --> 00:55:01.800
College in California, and
Wu Yee Children's Services

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.072
in San Francisco.

00:55:03.072 --> 00:55:03.780
And it's growing.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.320
We're getting incredible
interest from across the world.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.310
This is a map that
represents the geography

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.590
of the people that
are contacting us

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:16.670
about the need for this
in their community.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.260
So this is not something
that is limited

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:26.110
to a rural part of China or a
fancy play-based kindergarten

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:28.240
in Palo Alto.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.330
This is something
that is crucially

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:36.000
important to children
throughout the world, because--

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.220
and this goes back to what we
were talking about before--

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.170
we don't know the
challenges that we're going

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.610
to be facing in 30 or 40 years.

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:46.460
And I don't think
we're particularly

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.840
prepared for those challenges.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.240
And so if what we're
teaching is how

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.730
to confront the challenges
of 50 years ago,

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:56.490
then we're in a really
precarious position.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.560
But if we say, provide the
optimal conditions for children

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.800
to understand the world and
themselves, to solve problems,

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.870
to work together, to
understand the world--

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:12.350
then I think that puts us in
a much better place 50 years

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.065
from now, 60 years from now.

00:56:14.065 --> 00:56:15.440
And so it's
incredibly important.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.000
And the people that really
understand the trajectory

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.520
of our societies--

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.940
that understand the trajectories
of the human minds--

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.140
recognize this.

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.060
And so you guys
are all here today

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.030
because you're early adopters,
because you saw something

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.650
that interested you.

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:37.020
And those early adopters are
parents, and they're teachers.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.500
But they're also some
of the greatest minds

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.800
today thinking about education.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.790
And so I want to end with
this quote, because it really

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.090
brings home the fact that
things are changing fast

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.100
and that what we
need for our children

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.880
is the ability to
understand themselves

00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:01.290
and to confront what the
reality will be when we're gone.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:02.680
And so that brings me back to--

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.638
I want to say thank you--
but it brings me back

00:57:04.638 --> 00:57:07.210
to that first question
I asked, which

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.150
is your deepest memory of play.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:14.330
And what I want to tell you is
that we're getting to a point

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:18.320
where children don't have
those memories of play anymore.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.640
And so if I'm going to talk from
the perspective of a parent,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.180
I have a sense of
responsibility that when

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:30.209
my daughter, who's 3 now,
is working at Google--

00:57:30.209 --> 00:57:30.875
maybe she won't.

00:57:30.875 --> 00:57:34.717
I don't know-- but
she's at a talk.

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:36.800
That when she's asked,
what is your deepest memory

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.180
of play as a child?

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.090
She doesn't draw a blank.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.100
That she can speak
to that experience.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.790
And my hope-- and that's what's
been part of my parenting--

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:49.250
is that she'll have too many
experiences to remember,

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.500
and that she'll have
to choose one of many.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.340
And so I want you,
if you're parents,

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.780
to think about this when
you're with your child,

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.916
when you think about how
you schedule their time,

00:57:57.916 --> 00:57:59.290
how you interact
with them around

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:01.510
play, what you expect of them.

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.250
Take a step back.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.800
Put your hands down.

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.676
Close your mouth.

00:58:06.676 --> 00:58:09.710
And see what you can see.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.590
So I want to thank you guys
for taking the time to listen,

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:14.244
for taking the time
out of your day.

00:58:14.244 --> 00:58:16.160
I had a video I wanted
to show of my daughter,

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.410
but we're getting really late.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:20.360
And I'd love to provide
an opportunity for anyone

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.059
to ask questions
that might have them.

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:30.190
So the question is,
the cultural challenges

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:35.990
and the regulatory challenges
of bringing Anji Play to China.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:42.210
The cultural challenges-- so the
name Anji is a county in China.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:47.840
But what I would say is that
deep, authentic learning--

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.530
that true learning and true
engagement, the experience

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:53.720
of joy and of love--

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.230
really is, more or
less, universal.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.245
In terms of acceptance--

00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:00.620
I mean, I think
that's a question

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:06.090
of education and of sharing and
our work to share these ideas.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:09.980
And it's also the work of
policymakers and scientists

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.570
that the most
advanced understanding

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:16.100
of cognitive development
is reflected in policy

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.870
around education and
around expectations.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.860
So it's the work of
parents to demand this.

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:24.770
It's the work of policymakers
to understand this.

00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:27.460
And it's the work of
all of us, really.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.870
And it really
doesn't matter where

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:33.080
you happen to be culturally.

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.610
But I think that at
the end of the day,

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:38.900
it comes down to a commitment
to respect children.

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.470
And I certainly hope that's not
a culturally-specific value.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.920
In terms of regulatory
issues, the science

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.300
around self-determined
risk is very compelling.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.570
And the standards around
licensing for safety

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:59.475
are not based on that very
compelling, very, very

00:59:59.475 --> 01:00:00.350
cutting-edge science.

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.050
So there's catchup
that has to take place.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.600
At the same time, we
live in a democracy,

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.100
and we can make change,
and we can make demands.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.240
And so oftentimes, when
we engage in change,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.150
you hear a lot about why
things aren't possible.

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:16.380
This can't happen.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.400
That can't happen.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.420
This can't happen.

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.424
That can happen.

01:00:19.424 --> 01:00:21.090
We're working with
pilot sites that say,

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.544
we're going to make this happen.

01:00:22.544 --> 01:00:24.460
They're figuring out
ways to make that happen.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:29.340
So if you have the determination
to create the conditions

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.200
for what we're
describing, then you

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.480
can figure out how to
change those regulations,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.130
how to work within
those regulations.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.940
There's always a way--

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.590
in any context-- to figure
out, to problem solve.

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.950
Because what Anji
Play is largely about

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:45.430
is problem solving.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.662
It's about problem solving.

01:00:46.662 --> 01:00:48.120
It's about complex
problem solving.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.840
It's about taking risks.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.510
[INAUDIBLE] school system--
do you feel that you we need--

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:57.860
do we need a federal standard
to ensure that students

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.010
are learning effectively?

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:03.890
That is a big question.

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:09.960
I think that there is
a lot of fragmentation

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.040
around the organization and
policy around education.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.470
We have states, and we have
the federal government.

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:19.720
A lot of that is tied
into funding mechanisms.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.140
So there are
accountability measures

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.560
that are tied to how
schools are funded.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.520
So it would be great if the
federal government wanted

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.250
to work with us to
create an assessment

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.300
of true play and true learning.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.750
So if that were the case, I
would certainly support that.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:42.780
I think that I would
absolutely, absolutely advocate

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.020
for more spending at
the local, at the state,

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.120
and at the federal
level in children,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.790
because there's incredible
amounts of research

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.420
that that is a good
investment, that that pays off.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.100
And so what we have
in Anji Play is

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.480
we have a very comprehensive,
clear, scalable model.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.797
And so that can be the
basis for that change

01:02:02.797 --> 01:02:03.630
on a national level.

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.320
It's the basis for the change
on a national level in China,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.600
and I think our goal is that
it's the basis for change

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.309
around the world.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.766
So we're going to have to work
with the federal government,

01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:15.060
and I think they'll see how
effective that learning is,

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.310
and then they can create
some standards based on that.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.870
Well, thank you
guys so much again.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:26.330
I hope you'll check out
some of our resources

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:29.390
online and stay in touch.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:30.590
Thank you.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.340
[APPLAUSE]
