Joe Mosnier: Today is Wednesday, April 27,
2011.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.510
We're in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Artmore
Hotel in midtown Atlanta, with Ms. Jamila

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.750
Jones, um, to conduct an oral history for
the Smithsonian's National Museum of African

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.330
American History and Culture project entitled
“The Civil Rights History Project.”

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.330
My name is Joe Mosnier of the Southern Oral
History Program at UNC-Chapel Hill, and our

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.330
videographer is Mr. John Bishop.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.330
Ms. Jones, good morning.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.700
Thanks so much for sitting down.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.290
Jamila Jones: Good morning -
JM: Appreciate -

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.290
JJ: And thank you for having me.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.989
JM: Appreciate your effort to get up with
us, um, during this Atlanta visit.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.730
It's really nice to see you.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.210
Thank you.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.620
Um, let me start today, um, as we enter into,
enter into a conversation about, um, your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.100
work in the Southern Freedom Movement, um,
in the '50s, '60s, and even thereafter, um,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.799
talk a little bit about your family, starting
with that.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.909
[Coughing in background].

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.509
Can you tell me a little bit about growing
up in, um, in Montgomery and your family,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.840
your parents, and ?
JJ: Okay.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880
I lived with a mother and a grandmother.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.189
Um, I grew up with a sibling, my sister, Doris
Crenshaw, and a brother, a little younger,

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.399
about ten years younger, John Allen McCloud.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:45.670
And I guess key to the Movement is the fact
that my sister and I rode the Montgomery bus

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.810
line.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:56.630
So, we experienced on a daily basis during
school the harassment that came from the,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.270
uh, bus driver.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.209
Uh, and so, I guess that inspired us, or it
was something in us that, uh, made us relate

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.689
to, of course, the Montgomery bus boycott.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.799
JM: Can you talk a little bit about, um, how
you came to know, um, Ms. [Rosa] Parks and

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.430
to join the youth chapter of the local NAACP?

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.019
JJ: Uh, yes.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:30.349
In fact, my sister was the one who introduced
me to Mrs. Parks, uh, as we joined the NAA

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.420
youth group, NAACP youth group.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.799
Uh, my sister was the vice-president; I was
just a member of that group.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.270
Uh, she would have us into her home.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.379
We would sit on the floor.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.680
And she'd give us bits and pieces about life,
actually.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.720
And people ask quite often if I remember things
that she said, and I do not.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.900
Uh, but I know she read from, uh, papers,
from the, uh, national office of the NAACP.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.250
And she taught us, uh, that we were important
- I can remember that - and that, uh, it was

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:24.000
key that we, uh, learn our rights, and that,
uh, voting was an important aspect of, uh,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
our lives.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.430
And I can just remember those things about
the conversations that she had with us.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.740
And she also taught us that, uh, it was important
to carry yourself in a good, responsible,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740
uh, way.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.260
Uh, after we would meet, she would give us,
uh, Kool-Aid and cookies.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.569
JM: [Laughs]
JB: Joe, can we pause for a sec?

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.579
JM: Certainly.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.639
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: We're on.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.219
JM: Uh, Ms. Jones, you mentioned your sister,
Doris Crenshaw.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.829
Can you talk a little bit about her?

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.010
You mentioned she was vice-president, and
just describe her a little bit.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.950
JJ: Yeah, she was like a leader of the bunch.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.410
And whatever she did, basically, I did.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.360
Uh, there was, uh, a difference in us, in
that I was, uh, mostly interested in the music

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.761
portion of things that happened, and she was
more of the leadership-fighter type, uh, movement

00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:27.810
person.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:38.760
But, uh, she somehow had interest from a very
young age in, uh, rights and what was right

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.410
for you.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.730
And she led me down that path.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.730
JM: Um-hmm.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.660
So, you must have been about eleven years
old when the boycott began, thereabouts?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.410
JJ: I was eleven years old when the boycott
started.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.410
JM: Yeah.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.940
Um, what are some of your - you know, from
this distance, what are some of your most

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.110
vivid, most central, important memories from
that experience?

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.540
JJ: [Sighs] From that experience, I know that,
um, the youth, and Mrs. Knott [?] [nb: spelling

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.390
of name uncertain] often said, had their own
[5:00] kind of individual movement, that we

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.010
kind of led ourselves around what was happening
with the Movement, in that we organized ourselves

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.670
to get across - what we called across town,
uh, when we were no longer riding the buses.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.100
And we had to find our own way for survival.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.250
My sister, being the leader that she was,
wouldn't allow us ever to go and get a ride.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.990
Uh, she said we'd be taking up space from
an adult and we were going to walk.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.200
So, the 361 days there was school, we walked.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.750
JM: Um-hmm.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:07.240
Um, when the boycott concluded and some measure
of success was realized, in some measure on

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.240
that narrow question of busing, what was your
feeling?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.370
JJ: It was a joyous feeling, of course.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:24.460
And no longer we felt that we had to take
the abuse, uh, that we had experienced on

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.120
those buses since I was six years old, because
I started to ride the bus at age six and had

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.140
done that to age eleven.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.240
And we found our ways to survive through that.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.690
Uh, it was piercing to see adults have to
leave, uh, the bus and go around to pay their

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:54.460
money, and then get off the bus and come to
the back of the, uh, bus.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.560
Uh, I almost never had to do that, because
we were the first stop, so we always found

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.980
ourselves with a seat.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:11.410
But curious as we were, there were times we
tested to see what would happen if we sat

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.650
in the front of the bus.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.440
And we did, and, uh, then they would ask us,
of course - when one white lady got on the

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.390
bus - I can never forget her.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:32.770
She had red hair, long hair, and when she
entered the bus, we would have to get up,

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:39.240
even though, um, there were a number of seats,
and she was the only white to get on that

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240
bus.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.430
So, I think that was so piercing to us that
it nev - I never forgot it.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.800
And, uh, when the bus boycott started, of
course, that lived within me, and I knew that

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.980
I would walk three hundred and what - however
many days, actually, that, uh, it would take.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:08.690
And to a six-year-old, you just basically
are so curious about why is it that we have

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:17.310
to get up, that often I would sit behind her
and, uh, she would choose the same seat each

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.830
time she got on the bus.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.910
JM: This white woman?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.910
JJ: This white, uh, woman.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.910
I don't know her name.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.360
I just remember her face and her red hair.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:32.089
But when she got on the bus, I decided, uh,
several times to just feel her hair, to see

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:39.000
if I could put my little fingers, uh, on the
top of the seat to see if it was a difference.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.260
What is the difference with her and the rest
of us?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.400
And I did.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.270
I would just kind of feel that hair like it
was an accident.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:56.740
I don't know what I concluded from that, except
that it just gave me a feeling that, uh, I

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.090
feel she's really no different.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.640
This hair is not so much different from ours.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:09.360
And, um, that was just my little childhood
curiosity and how I answered it.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.620
JM: Sure.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:18.280
[Clears throat]
JJ: Uh, so that just that one white lady put

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.440
such, uh, curiosity in me.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:32.250
And I wanted to answer that so much that I,
uh, knew that I was going to walk the length

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.180
of the time it would take for us to get to,
uh, our goal.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.330
JM: Yeah.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.140
Um, when and how did you start singing?

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:48.900
JJ: Started singing - we were, um, elementary
school students at Alabama State Laboratory

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.670
High School.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:10:02.480
And, uh, each Friday we would have a, uh - I
would call it a talent show.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.460
And we formed this group, uh, three girls
- uh, actually it was four of us from the

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:17.120
beginning - formed this group [10:00] so that
we could compete each Friday in the, uh, talent

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120
contest.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:24.960
Somehow, it was something in us that made
us want to do freedom songs.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.930
And I can't answer today why we chose that,
because we're about the same age as, uh, Diana

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.930
Ross.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:39.570
But when we went outside to practice, we practiced
freedom songs.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.220
And that's what we would sing.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:49.300
So, when the Montgomery bus boycott came - we
formed this group at, uh, around the age nine

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:55.720
and ten - uh, we were kind of ready.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.870
And so because of the songs we were singing,
it lent itself to the Movement, we were asked

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:07.850
to come to sing at practically every tea that
was held in Montgomery.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.910
You know, uh, during that time, they had a
lot of teas that raised money for the Movement,

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.770
as well as other things for the churches.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:25.310
And they would invite us to come, and I felt
like, uh, it couldn't be a tea, or they felt

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.540
like, uh, they couldn't have a tea if we didn't
come.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:34.980
So, we went all over town to teas on Sunday
to participate, and we were kind of carrying

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:41.240
the message of the Movement, uh, through our
songs.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.770
And we were relevant for the time, and that's
why they called on us.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.510
JM: So, you were - this was a group of four
girls, all eleven or twelve years old, I guess,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.490
in that ?
JJ: We were, um -

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.490
JM: In that moment.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.490
JJ: In that moment we were eleven.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.400
JM: Do you remember the names of the other
girls?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400
JJ: I do.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.930
It was Gladys Carter - because we formed the
group and we, uh, all through high school,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.350
we kept the group.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:13.440
Uh, Gladys Carter and Minnie Hendricks, now
McCants - we were the three girls who lasted

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.220
among the four.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.720
Uh, we decided we were going to not only practice
at school, but we would practice at each other's

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.089
homes.

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:29.160
And that's how the fourth girl dropped out,
because her parents wouldn't allow her to

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.860
come each evening, or the evenings that we
had set for practice.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.000
And thus, it became the four - three girls.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.600
JM: Did you also - I'm sorry.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.970
Did you also sing in church?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.970
JJ: We did.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:49.230
We would sing in church, but we mostly sang
at school at first, because, uh, we all went

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.230
to different churches.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.230
JM: Yeah.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.230
Which was your church?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.710
JJ: Uh, mine was Mt. Zion A.M.E.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.750
Zion church.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.190
JM: Was any of the other girls, uh, at Reverend
King's church?

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.380
JJ: Uh, none of us were, uh, members -
JM: Yeah.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.520
JJ: Of Reverend King's church.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.980
Minnie McCants was a member of, uh, Reverend
[Ralph David] Abernathy's church.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.980
JM: Um-hmm, um-hmm.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:19.720
JJ: I was with, uh, Reverend [Solomon] Seay
[pronounces “Say”], Seay [pronounces “See”],

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:25.089
Seay [pronounces “Say” again], uh, who
was - had the first meeting for the Montgomery

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:28.750
bus boycott, uh, and he was very active.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.750
JM: Um-hmm.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:36.120
JJ: As a matter of fact, the, uh, things in
your life that cause you to - I guess the

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.390
sum total of things cause you to be what - whatever
you are in life.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:51.710
And, uh, he taught each Sunday about accomplishments
they had made, uh, toward needs of the black

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.529
community, and I would hear what he had to
say.

00:13:54.529 --> 00:14:01.750
Uh, so that was one of the influences that
I had, in terms of my life and, uh, fighting

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.080
for freedom or struggle.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.240
JM: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.310
Um, let's see, you must have entered high
school around '57, fall of '57, fall of '58,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.399
I guess?

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:15.670
JJ: Yeah, I finished in '62.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.310
JM: Yeah, okay.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:23.380
Um, and can you describe, um, the ? I think
in the late '50s, because at some point if,

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.990
if, um, - I've read a couple of different
accounts, but, um, one indicates that you

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.710
traveled to Highlander Folk School.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.310
JJ: I did, but that was before high school.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.120
It was like junior high, I think it was.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:46.050
But, um, I was singing, and along with the,
uh, my sister being very active, we were selected

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:51.240
to go to do a kind of like a cultural exchange
in terms of our music.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:15:01.029
We would share the kind of songs that we were
singing, and Guy Carawan headed up that, um

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:03.310
- the workshops.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:09.630
And people from around the world, actually,
because we met people from Africa there, uh,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.870
would share [15:00] the kind of movement songs
they were doing.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:22.430
It was because we - our repertoire of songs,
of freedom songs, were, uh, great and extensive

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:35.480
that he asked that we come to, uh, uh, New
York to do, uh, freedom songs to raise money

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.230
for the Movement, Southern Movement.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.850
And that's how we got to Carnegie Hall with
Reverend [Fred] Shuttlesworth and others,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.279
to do that, uh, fundraiser.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:59.649
And from that came one of the first albums
of civil rights songs, uh, to be, uh, used,

00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:03.330
uh, for fundraising and that kind of thing.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:10.520
And so, we were, uh, the Montgomery Trio.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.630
We did not have a name.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:17.260
We went all over Montgomery before that time,
never thought about a name.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.660
Uh, they would just say, “The girls,”
“We gotta have the girls,” or “The girls

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.210
this -.” And when we got there, uh, they
said, “For this album, you've got to have

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.210
a name.”

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:32.420
So, we debated and debated about what could
be our name and came up with the Montgomery

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.420
Gospel Trio.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.420
JM: Um-hmm, um-hmm.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.390
How old were you at that time when you went
to New York?

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.750
JJ: I want to say I - you know, around sixteen.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.750
JM: Yeah.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.220
Just into high school?

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.600
JJ: Yes.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.961
JM: [Coughs] Um, can you, can you talk me
through the - your high school years, because

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:55.360
obviously the Movement will shift into a very
active phase while you were in high school

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.360
-
JJ: Right.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.330
JM: And um, uh, the, um, Freedom Singers will
come into being towards the end of your high

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.070
school years.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:08.379
So, I'm interested in how you move through
those years singing, protesting, as an activist,

00:17:08.379 --> 00:17:09.379
young activist.

00:17:09.379 --> 00:17:10.379
JJ: Yes.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:18.249
And what happened is that Montgomery - when
you have a large-scale movement like that,

00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:31.070
uh, quite often there are a lot of wounds
that occur - so, Montgomery, um, particularly

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:40.169
it - adults, it, uh, the adults could not
sit down sometimes in the same room, let along

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:42.759
talk about [laughs] a movement.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:46.429
And so, the youth were used.

00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:51.480
So, when James Bevel and all the people came
into Montgomery - and, by the way, we did

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:59.379
meet James Bevel and, uh, Bernard Lafayette
- were the other group that came to, uh, do

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:03.999
the concert at Carnegie Hall, so we had already
met them.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:12.970
But they came into Montgomery first with the,
uh, Freedom Riders.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:20.470
And so, because we knew them, we had gone
to, uh, Reverend Abernathy's house and waiting

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:27.549
to get the cue to go pick up the Freedom Riders
as they came in, because at that time we still

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:32.490
active in the Movement and still singing.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.429
And Mrs. Abernathy, uh, said, uh, “We don't
have anybody to pick them up.”

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:43.940
Now, a lot of adults will tell you that they
did, [laughs] but that day we stole a car.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.080
We said, “Well, oh, we got to go, uh, find
a way to get the, uh, Freedom Riders!”

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.600
And, uh, there was a girl, her name was Antonette
Carson, and she had her license at the time,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.490
and her fath - grandfather would leave his
car in the garage every day.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:08.850
So, we schemed together and said we were going
to steal his car and go pick up the Freedom

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.470
Riders.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.470
And we did.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.649
But we said, “How in the world are we going
to get this car back in here?”

00:19:13.649 --> 00:19:22.460
So, what we did was we took some chalk, school
chalk, and marked where the tires of his car

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:31.909
were, and took the car, picked up the Freedom
Riders, went back and put that car right in

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:35.710
the tracks of those marks that we had made.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:45.100
And it was such an eventful day to see how
they were beaten and how they were treated,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.450
uh, when getting off of those buses.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:55.580
And we had a carload when we - when we left.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.970
JM: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.980
Were you, um, yourself, uh, ever so close
to violence that you really feared for your

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.850
own personal safety?

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:11.520
JJ: [Sighs] It's something about youth, that
even when you have fear [20:00], and it's

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:19.629
something about having lived that kind of
life, that your fear is bundled, and it's

00:20:19.629 --> 00:20:31.659
there, but it does not outweigh the need to,
uh, participate.

00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:35.559
So that there were times when we had - we
feared, we had fear.

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:42.779
In fact, the night that the Freedom Riders
came in, uh, we went to the church, uh, carried

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:48.549
them to the church, and we were there for
the mass meeting that night.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:53.929
And when we went in, there were no whites.

00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:59.590
When we sat there a while, the church was
completely surrounded.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:09.309
As far as you could see were, um, white, uh,
mostly males on horses and, uh, carrying long

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:13.980
guns and sitting outside, waiting on us to
come out.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:20.320
And that was the night that we, in fact, spent
the night at the church.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:29.139
So, it was a fearful night, but not enough
fear to stop us from doing what we needed

00:21:29.139 --> 00:21:30.139
to do.

00:21:30.139 --> 00:21:32.759
JM: Did you ? Sorry.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:38.929
JJ: I was just going to say that, uh, Reverend,
uh, Seay said that night, uh, to me.

00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:43.779
We were eating - some food had come in, sandwiches
and that kind of thing - and he was sitting

00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:48.000
on the steps at the church, on the inside.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.059
And I said, “Reverend Seay, what what are
we going to do?”

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:57.249
Because as far as we could see were all these
people surrounding us!

00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:04.580
And he said, uh, “We're going to do like
the doodle bug.”

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.779
And I said, “What do you mean?”

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:10.210
He said, “Doodle Bug,” because he called
me Doodle Bug quite a bit, “we're going

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.289
to do like the doodle bug.”

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:17.039
And I was an adult before I really understood
what he was saying, but we played this game

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:22.899
in Montgomery, and we would sing the “Doodle
Bug Song.”

00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:27.700
It was [begins to sing], “Back-a-back, doodle,
back, back.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.049
Your house is on afire.

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.259
Your children's burning.

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:34.239
Back-a-back, doodle, back, back.”

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:44.330
And I had to think about it as I became an
adult, because I really didn't know at the

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.499
time what he was saying.

00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:51.330
And I thought about how that song said, “Your
house is on afire, and you're in trouble,”

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.190
but you're going to be just like the doodle
bug.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:59.280
And the doodle bug, when we were singing that
song, the doodle bug would baaack up, just

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:08.749
back out of, uh, the sand, and, uh, he was
so small, but as if to say, “I'm protecting

00:23:08.749 --> 00:23:09.929
my own.”

00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:18.190
JM: Let's pause for just - excuse me just
one sec, if we could, John.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.359
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: We're back.

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:21.359
JM: We're back after a short break.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:23.419
Can you tell me about, um - Ms. Jones, can
you tell me about the founding of the, um,

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:25.669
the Freedom Singers?

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:32.509
JJ: Well, actually, the Freedom Singers, as
you know them, I was not a part of that group.

00:23:32.509 --> 00:23:36.669
I joined after leaving the Montgomery Trio.

00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:42.729
But remember I went to school at Alabama State
University, so that, uh, we kept the group

00:23:42.729 --> 00:23:49.639
- and so did, uh, the other two girls, and
so we kept the group going during the time

00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:54.669
that we were fighting to, for voter registration
and that kind of thing.

00:23:54.669 --> 00:24:02.429
I may have mentioned that, uh, a lot of that
was done by the youth, because a lot of adults

00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:06.559
no longer wanted to participate for whatever
their reasons were.

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:14.559
Uh, so, when James Bevel and those people
came into Montgomery, they called on us to

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:21.429
sing before the meetings that we would have
in the rural areas, as well as in the city

00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:22.739
of Montgomery.

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:30.619
So, we would travel around with them, and
we'd do the singing, um, at the churches before

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:33.229
the speaker would, of course, speak.

00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:39.309
So, we kept our group, the Montgomery Trio,
going up until that time.

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:49.470
And, um - after which I came to Atlanta, uh,
got with Bernice Reagon.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:58.590
Uh, it started, I guess - I have to back up
to say that, uh, she had asked that I participate

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.200
in the, what they called the Penny Festival.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:12.539
And that's where the community and the school
- there was so much separation [25:00] that

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:18.220
they had formed this Penny Festival to come
together with the community to put on a performance

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.220
each year.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.269
JM: This was here in Atlanta?

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:21.350
[Increased microphone noise]

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.350
JJ: Yes.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.869
And, uh, SNCC did that.

00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:30.909
And when Bernice Reagon asked me to participate,
we did the music for that first Penny Festival

00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:33.530
that we would, uh, we were doing.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:41.809
And, um, after, I said, “Goodness, I haven't
been singing, and this was so good to participate

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:43.950
in this kind of thing.”

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:51.190
So, myself, along with another singer that,
uh, was in the Harambee Singers, Mattie Casey,

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:58.139
uh, Pierce now, went to Bernice's house and
knocked on the door and said, “We'd like

00:25:58.139 --> 00:25:59.830
to just continue to sing.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.539
Let's continue to sing.”

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:09.000
And thus, uh, was started the Harambee Singers.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.340
So, I wasn't in that, uh, freedom group singers
with Bernice, but in the Harambee Singers

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.340
with her.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.109
JM: Let me take you back.

00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:23.639
Tell me about - I want to ask about repertoire
and what you most liked to sing, say, in the

00:26:23.639 --> 00:26:27.359
- early in the gospel trio in Montgomery,
later in the - when you're in college, and

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:30.580
then later with Harambee.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.360
JJ: It depended on what was happening at the
time.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.400
Uh, that determined what we would sing and
what message we would - because we learned

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.870
at Highlander that these songs not only could
carry a message for the Movement in Montgomery,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:56.809
but songs carry, uh, the message of the Movement
wherever.

00:26:56.809 --> 00:27:06.239
And that when we went to, uh, Highlander,
we would sing, and, uh, our songs, uh, “This

00:27:06.239 --> 00:27:12.110
Little Light of Mine,” which became one
of the famous songs of the Movement.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:18.250
And it's interesting to note that we were
singing that for the Movement at eleven years

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:28.450
old, um, and became one of the songs on the
the, uh, album that we did.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.570
But that was one of the important songs.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.479
“We Are Soldiers in the Army” was one
of the songs we did.

00:27:35.479 --> 00:27:36.609
“Oh, Freedom.”

00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:44.259
So, we were doing all of these songs at eleven
years old for the Movement, songs which later

00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:53.049
became the bulk of songs and, uh, the basis
of the songs for that upcoming Civil Rights

00:27:53.049 --> 00:27:54.049
Movement.

00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:57.479
JM: [Coughs] Would you ? [Clears throat] Excuse
me.

00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:00.309
What part did you sing?

00:28:00.309 --> 00:28:01.700
JJ: I sang, uh, basically the melody.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700
JM: Um-hmm.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:08.590
JJ: But we did interchange, and I'd do a lot
of the lead singing on the, uh, songs, uh,

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:09.590
the verse singing.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.590
JM: Um-hmm, um-hmm.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:18.080
Tell me about, um, that work, um, I think
with, um, about '66, 1966 forward, the Harambee

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080
Singers.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:25.929
Tell me about how that group evolved and,
and your work there.

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:27.429
JJ: I will.

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:37.690
Um, I do want to say a bit more about Highlander
and how our songs began to change as we, uh,

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:42.799
attended those workshops with Guy Carawan
and all.

00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:48.639
If you go back to the songs, you'll see that
we were singing songs, but basically we didn't

00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:49.639
write the songs.

00:28:49.639 --> 00:28:56.730
There is a Montgomery song that represents
that movement that was written by one of the

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:03.239
professors at Alabama State, which for me
for that era was the first actual song that

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:06.399
was written for the movement.

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:11.581
And I'd like to get that in, because people
think it happened later on, but, no, right

00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:14.450
at that time, he wrote that song.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.240
But when we went to Highlander, we were singing
some of the songs, basically the freedom songs,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.499
basically as they were done traditionally.

00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:33.499
And we are traditional singers, uh, and we
would add a word in, and a verse or a line,

00:29:33.499 --> 00:29:39.200
to represent our movement, or sometimes we
would change a line.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:46.909
But we weren't actually changing whole songs
until actually we got there - to Highlander

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:48.429
- and saw others do it.

00:29:48.429 --> 00:29:49.850
And then, we thought we were equipped.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:55.929
We were going back then, writing songs and
doing our own, you know, version of the songs.

00:29:55.929 --> 00:30:01.190
But we kept it traditional, in terms of how
we would sing the songs.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:07.559
So, if you hear our album or any of those
things, you will see we kept, uh, the traditional

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:09.440
ways of, uh, doing that.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.610
I wanted to add that [30:00] because I wanted
to give him credit for how songs changed during

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.620
the Movement and that kind of thing.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.860
JM: [Coughs] Excuse me.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.359
JB: What was the song that ?
JM: In particular - yeah?

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:23.139
JB: Yeah, what was that song that he wrote?

00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:29.009
JM: There's one song that your -
JJ: He wrote, uh, uh, “Ain't Gonna Ride

00:30:29.009 --> 00:30:31.950
No Bus No More.”

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.900
And it's interesting how he wrote that song,
because sometimes now when I'm singing it

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.600
or we are performing that song, people look
and say, “Did y'all say ‘hell'?”

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.309
“Yes, that's the way he wrote the song,”
because he wrote it from a traditional song

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:54.470
that, um, I think that that song is “Ain't
Gonna Rain No More.”

00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:01.049
And in that song it says, “How in the hell
do the old folk know it ain't gonna rain no

00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:02.049
more?”

00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:07.359
And he said, “How in the hell don't the
white folk know we ain't gonna ride them buses

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.359
no more?”

00:31:08.359 --> 00:31:10.729
JM: [Laughs] I have read two different accounts
for how, uh, you are credited with adding

00:31:10.729 --> 00:31:12.919
a very important verse to “We Shall Overcome.”

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:16.309
Can you share that story with us?

00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:20.169
[Sound levels vary while Ms. Jones is speaking]

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:22.109
JJ: You know what?

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:28.700
I don't know how much light I can, uh, place
on that, because you have to remember that

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.049
I was at Highlander when I was probably fourteen
years old.

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:37.239
And we weren't thinking at the time, “Oh,
I said this; I did this.”

00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:39.739
That was not upon our minds.

00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:50.649
So that I can remember that, uh, when we went
to Highlander, uh, we had workshops to prepare

00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:54.979
us for different things that we would face.

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:59.789
And one of the things that Reverend Seay,
who drove us there, uh, said to us is that

00:31:59.789 --> 00:32:01.249
we are going to leave by night.

00:32:01.249 --> 00:32:10.200
And the reason for that is when you get into
Monteagle, Tennessee, the population of, uh,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:17.499
blacks is - the population is just one, and
that was Septima Clark.

00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:23.919
And so, to go in by night, we would not be
noticed as we would go in.

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:29.269
So we went there by night, and we came back
by night.

00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:36.019
But one of the things that happened when we
were there is the policemen from the city

00:32:36.019 --> 00:32:38.090
came in.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:44.249
Uh, we were having a movie, I believe, that
night, or a song fest, and, uh, they came

00:32:44.249 --> 00:32:45.249
in.

00:32:45.249 --> 00:32:48.559
They turned out all the lights - from the
city they turned them out.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:53.299
So, we were in complete darkness that night.

00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:56.320
And, um, we could not see each other.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.789
We didn't know where - I didn't know where
my sister was.

00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:01.450
I didn't know where Minnie was.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:07.919
We were just there - wherever we were at the
time when the lights went out - careful - that's

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:08.929
where we sat.

00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:13.249
And so, all these policemen came in.

00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:19.759
And all we could see, basically, is the billy
club, uh, waving, and the, uh, the butts of

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:24.960
their guns - you could see it shining on their
holster.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:33.200
Uh, and they told us to sit, you know, of
course, uh, stay seated, or be quiet, or what

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.320
have you.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:51.110
And something [pause] said, [begins singing
slowly] “We are not afraid,” and everybody

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:59.609
started singing, [singing] “We are not -,” and
you could hear people come in.

00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:05.679
My sister, who is not a singer, I knew she
was safe, because I heard her little out-of-tune

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:07.169
voice coming in.

00:34:07.169 --> 00:34:13.609
And I could hear Minnie's bass come in, about,
“We are not afraid.”

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:20.990
And we got louder and louder with singing
that verse, until one of the policemen came

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:29.690
and he said to me, “If you have to sing,”
and he was actually shaking, “do you have

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.950
to sing so loud?”

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:36.990
And I could not believe it.

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:48.589
Here these people had all the guns, the billy
clubs, the power, we thought [pause] and he

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:59.770
was asking me, with a shake, if I would not
sing so loud.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:11.030
And it was that time that I really understood
the power of our move—of our music, [35:00]

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:23.530
how powerful it was that this - it unnerved
him so much that he had to come and ask that

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.890
I not sing so loud.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:32.940
And I can just tell you that I got louder
and louder.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:42.700
And somehow even the nature out there in that
darkness, because everywhere was dark, but

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:56.119
it looked like our voices blended that night
to the point of complete harmony and beauty.

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:58.490
And from then on, I knew exactly how powerful
our songs were.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:10.230
JM: Can you remember singing in a - can you
tell a story about singing in a particular

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.349
place that really stands - in a moment and
a place that really stands out in your memory,

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:15.349
very vividly?

00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:16.349
JJ: Now, that stands out.

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:17.349
JM: I'm sure there are lots.

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:21.119
JJ: But - there are a number of them, but
I can say that we were in Montgomery.

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:25.349
I was in college at the time.

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:33.819
And we were, uh, King was going to take us
from his church - uh, he was no longer living

00:36:33.819 --> 00:36:38.230
there at the time, but he had come back for
- I can't even remember what the Movement

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.829
was all about.

00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:47.200
But we were going to march to the, uh, capital
in Montgomery.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:54.970
And as we, uh - we got to the top of the steps,
and you saw all of these white folks.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.680
The people had - they had taken - the males
had taken off their shirts, and they were

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.910
just bare-chested, standing up there with,
uh, rifles and riding their horses.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.170
And, again, I saw - I faced these horses coming
down on you.

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:14.570
And when I got to the top of the steps, it
made me sing [laughs] that verse again, “We

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.579
are not afraid,” and we started singing
it.

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:23.010
Now, I can tell you that my knees were actually
shaking that day when I looked out to see

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:31.160
all of them, and we were going to, you know,
try to march to the—to the capital.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.050
But singing that song and that verse helped
to kind of steady those knees at that time.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:43.319
And I can remember that particular verse at
that time and that particular, uh, movement.

00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:48.770
JM: Tell me - let's just, um, shift for just
a moment.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.940
And I'm interested in your experience in college.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.630
Can you describe your ?
JJ: Well, those college days were spent, as

00:37:53.630 --> 00:38:01.020
I said - SCLC had formed and sent James Bevel
and James Orange into Montgomery.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:07.270
And what we worked on at the time was, uh,
voter registration again, even though I had

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:12.220
handled voter registration at eleven, uh,
twelve years old with Mrs. [Idessa] Williams

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:21.339
in Montgomery, and, um, uh, during my high
school days we just continued that whole thing

00:38:21.339 --> 00:38:24.359
of, uh, going to Kings Hill.

00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:30.819
We ventured out into other places besides
Montgomery, because Montgomery was so tight

00:38:30.819 --> 00:38:35.960
at that time, after having gone through that
Montgomery bus boycott.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.130
And the other thing we were working on was,
uh, sit-ins.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:46.190
And so, we would go to the church and plan,
as youth, with James Bevel and James Orange,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.720
how we were going to go to the five and ten
cent stores.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:58.010
And, um, they taught us at that time - they
had gone through training sessions on how

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:03.990
to protect your head and that kind of thing,
and what happens if someone spits on you.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:09.529
And, uh, really, they taught us nonviolence
to a great extent.

00:39:09.529 --> 00:39:15.200
And so, that's - those were the kinds of things
that we worked on.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:23.170
But let me just go back and say, at twelve
years old, uh, Mrs. Rosa Parks and Mrs. Williams,

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:33.190
uh, taught us how to fill out twenty-seven-page
questionnaires, uh, so that we could go into

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:43.170
the homes of adults and teach them how to
fill out those questions, uh, to become voters.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:47.900
That's what you had to do at the time, just
silly, stupid kinds of questions.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.109
We had to learn the preamble to the Constitution.

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:54.710
But they set us in a little shop, uh, behind
her house.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:59.099
She was, uh, a hairdresser, and we would - the
youth would go in there, sit on the floor,

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:06.579
and we'd learn how to fill out these - at
eleven - fill out these, uh, and answer the

00:40:06.579 --> 00:40:07.579
questions.

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:12.359
And, uh, we would knock on doors and [40:00]
teach adults how to fill it out.

00:40:12.359 --> 00:40:13.359
JM: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:21.809
By the mid '60s, the Civil Rights Act has
passed, the Voting Rights Act has passed,

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:26.640
but there's been tremendous violence and difficulty,
and I'm thinking about the founding of the

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.640
Harambee Singers.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:36.720
And, um, how did your perspective at that
time, say '66 maybe, compare to your perspective

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.569
earlier in the '60s?

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:46.510
Were you - what was your overall sense and
feeling about the Movement at that point and

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.230
its progress and its challenges and its difficulties?

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.230
JJ: Um-hmm.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:41:00.400
Uh, personally, I started paying more attention
to I guess what we call Black Power and the

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400
Pan-Africanist movement.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.619
And so, the songs that we performed as Harambee
Singers were what we would call very radical

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:16.240
type songs, uh, “Move On Over Or We'll Move
On Over You,” and the songs took a different

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.450
tone and became also international.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:28.260
We were very in tune to our heritage at the
time and, um, as I said, Black Power.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:37.440
And, uh, so, when we went, our hair was Afroed
and this kind of thing, and our songs took

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.320
on some of that same mentality at the time.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:49.340
So, the Harambee Singers' songs - we never
did the songs that, uh, were performed by

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.880
the Montgomery Trio, but in fact, uh, Pan-Africanist
type songs.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.380
JM: Can you tell me a little bit more about
[clears throat] - excuse me - about the group's

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.380
repertoire?

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:08.440
JJ: Um, in terms of the songs, um, “Hands
Off Nkrumah” was one of the songs that we

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:14.869
did, because at that time, as I say, we had
a Pan-Africanist perspective to what we were

00:42:14.869 --> 00:42:16.490
doing in song.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:25.210
And, uh, so, that was important to us as,
uh, the Movement was going on in Ghana.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:34.760
We, uh, did do that song of “Hands off Nkrumah,
uh, that's what the people say, ‘Hands off

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760
Nkrumah.'”

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.040
Uh, and, uh, we talked about the CIA in the
song.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:49.030
So, we start attacking other elements of not
only, uh, this country, but the world, in

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.030
what was happening.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.030
JB: Can we pause for a sec?

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.030
JM: Sure.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.030
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JJ: I go into things, uh - there are other

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.030
elements or things that come to mind.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.030
JM: Sure, sure.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.030
JJ: You know, but, um - unless you have some
questions about the things - uh, want me to

00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:00.299
expand on things that have already been said,
I'll just kind of think, you know - don't

00:43:00.299 --> 00:43:02.569
you ?
JM: We've done pretty well, is that what you're

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:03.569
saying?

00:43:03.569 --> 00:43:04.569
JJ: I would think.

00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:05.569
[Laughs]
JM: Yeah.

00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:06.569
No, I think it's been fabulous.

00:43:06.569 --> 00:43:08.349
JJ: [Laughs]
JM: I did want to - I did want to maybe go

00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:09.349
back -
JJ: Um-hmm.

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:13.049
JM: And just ask about, um - the question
of whether or not, uh, your mother and your

00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:18.599
grandmother ever had to try to pull you and
your sister and brother back a little bit

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:19.670
out of fear for your safety.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.680
Did they - is that a good question - because
that's just a natural ?

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.210
JJ: Yeah, but I'll start with our community
and just say [clears throat] -

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.210
JM: Okay.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.210
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: We're on.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:30.210
JM: We're on, okay.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:35.700
We've had a short break and we're going to
come back and talk a little bit more about

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.010
family and community.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.539
JJ: Yes.

00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:49.400
Um, our community were, uh, was filled with
people who had participated in struggle in

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.599
some type way.

00:43:50.599 --> 00:43:57.960
Um, we had Flora Grant, who had one of the
large debits in, uh, Atlanta Life Insurance

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:06.770
Company and who kept herself close to movement
things that's happening in the community,

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:13.230
who would come to my home and sit with my
mother to talk about those things, as I sat

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.380
under the table, and they played cards.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:24.859
But, uh - and I would hear a lot at that time,
because she was very knowledgeable as to the

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:28.410
kind of current things happening in the Montgomery
community.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.070
So, we had Flora Grant.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:37.039
And we had the young lady who wrote, uh, “See
How They Run.”

00:44:37.039 --> 00:44:47.160
Uh, we had Sullivan Rogers, who was one of
the first black jockeys, and, uh, we saw him

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.819
train his horses, and he would tell us stories.

00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:59.380
Uh, and we had my aunt, who lived with us,
and her name - we called her Bessie B. [45:00]

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:09.079
Now, Bessie B was the storyteller in my family,
and she would tell us about all kinds of struggles.

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:15.369
And the story that I remember from her was
about Old John.

00:45:15.369 --> 00:45:23.450
And when she talked about Old John, she said
that he, uh, worked hard from sunup to sundown

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:31.059
to take care of his family, of the family,
but at the end of the day or the week, he

00:45:31.059 --> 00:45:39.710
had no meat, he, uh, had very little food,
and it would bother him so much that he had

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:51.359
taken care and raised the food for his, uh,
owner, uh, as he sharecropped, but, uh, he

00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:55.510
could not pay his bill at the end of the week.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:04.559
And so, Old John found ways to, uh, every
so often, get his family a chicken.

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:12.480
And she told us the story of how John trained
his younger son to come with him, as they

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.670
would get one chicken out of - from the white
folks' chicken coop.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.359
And he said, “John, this night I'm going
to teach you how to pries.

00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:28.950
And you're going to pries the chicken coop
while I go under and get this one chicken,”

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:34.579
because there's something about black families
that told them that they were to get whatever

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:38.980
it was to survive, but not more than that.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:43.290
And so, he would get this one chicken, uh,
for his family.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:48.510
So, he carried, uh - Little John, I guess,
uh, was about the age of twelve, I think she

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:55.769
told us - and they would get this long stick
to pry up the chicken coop.

00:46:55.769 --> 00:47:02.240
And, um, this particular night he was saying,
“Pries, boy!

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:10.000
Pries, boy,” as John was shaking and almost
to drop the chicken coop, uh, before John

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.970
could get the, uh, chicken from the chicken
coop.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:15.990
And he did.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.349
“Pries, boy!

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:18.349
Pries!”

00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:26.330
And my aunt would just shake all over in her
voice as she was telling the story about “Pries,

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.330
boy!”

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:32.170
And, um, he dropped the chicken coop, could
no longer hold it.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:34.950
And John said, “Run, boy!

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.910
Go tell your mama you done drop - uh, you
done lost your pries!”

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:45.390
And so, later on in life, uh, from that story
- I'll never forget, uh, that John could not

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.759
feed his family working from sunup to sundown.

00:47:48.759 --> 00:47:55.690
Something in my head did not, you know, set
well with the fact that he couldn't feed his

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:57.299
family in that story.

00:47:57.299 --> 00:48:03.029
So, later on, I wrote a song that says, [begins
singing] “Pries, boy!

00:48:03.029 --> 00:48:04.519
Pries, boy!

00:48:04.519 --> 00:48:06.740
Pries, boy, pries!

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.230
Run fast!

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:13.220
Go tell your mama John done lost his pries.”

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.380
JM: Mmm, that's beautiful.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:22.520
JJ: So, the people in the community - and
as I say and tell young people, the sum total

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:27.740
of what you select to do in life will determine
your life.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:35.000
And I think it was the sum total of these
people and their impact on our lives that

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.700
kept us even today, as I sit here, sixty-seven
years old, uh, still involved in, uh, fighting

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.910
for freedom.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:53.470
So, it is those kind of things, and I tell,
uh, even seniors today - I work with seniors

00:48:53.470 --> 00:49:00.460
- that we have to keep ourselves close to
the young people, because it's the older people

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:08.430
that had this impact in our lives that caused
us to be the people that we are today.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:16.279
JM: I really want to thank you for joining
us this morning.

00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:22.170
It's been a real pleasure to be with you.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.479
Thank you.
