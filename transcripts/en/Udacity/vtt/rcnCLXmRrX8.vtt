00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.570
When you were playing
with the label element,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.710
did you notice how the label
appeared next to the input?

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.170
This is not an accident.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.560
It makes it easier to see the label.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.530
Please remember, portrait and landscape
view have different form factors.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.219
In landscape view ports,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.480
like this one, labels should
be next to the input elements.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.250
In portrait view ports,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.850
like this one, labels should
be above the input elements.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.690
Few things to keep in mind.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.420
If you are not careful, custom scroll
handlers may scroll input elements

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.970
to the top of the page hiding the label.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.470
You should especially avoid placing
labels below the input elements

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.040
because you run the risk that they
may be covered by the virtual

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.820
keyboard, not good.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.300
For example, here we make sure that
all the labels appear above the inputs

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.270
because, as you can see,
the virtual keyboard is coming up.
