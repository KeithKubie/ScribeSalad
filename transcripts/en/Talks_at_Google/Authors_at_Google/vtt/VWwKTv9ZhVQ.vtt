[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.150
BENJI BENNETT: Thank you
so much for having me here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.410
to Google today.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.210
To have the
opportunity to follow

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.020
in the footsteps of people who
have done these Google Talks is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.360
pretty daunting, I have to say.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.120
I do have a bit of
a cough, so you'll

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.470
have to excuse me if I
have to take a moment.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.260
So I always-- when
I do a talk, I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.900
set out a little
bit of housekeeping.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.460
What I'm going to
be talking about

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
is a very emotional
subject to me personally.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.170
And I'm sure you
will probably find it

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.800
quite an emotional
subject to listen to.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.930
So if I have to
take a moment, it's

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.379
not because I'm
going to lose it.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.170
Sometimes I just have
to take a second just

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.520
to get myself back
together, because I

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.644
can get quite emotional
having these conversations.

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:55.810
So you're welcome
to laugh at me when

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.530
I have those moments as well.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.130
So what I'd like to do
is to try and just--

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.510
is to get to know you
guys a small little bit.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.410
And I was thinking
about this last night,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.460
and it will help me to
make some of my points

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.280
a little bit clearer.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.380
In life, everybody is
struggling with something.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.137
Whether it's within
your own mind

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:21.720
or whether it's
external to your mind.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.290
It's somebody in your family, a
sickness, a death, an illness,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.240
stress, worry, mental
anxiety, and so on, we all

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.220
have something to worry about.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.950
And they are all
equally the same.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.700
There is nothing stronger or
worse than anybody else's pain

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.760
or issues that they have.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.310
So my whole talk,
really, is about family.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.150
And there was two things I
was thinking of last night

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.247
that I'd like to start off.

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:51.580
I'm going to do a little survey.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.769
Now, you can put up your
hand or not, whichever you're

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:55.810
feeling comfortable with.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.340
But hopefully, you'll just
bear with me for a second.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.420
So everybody here is
working in Google.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.280
So my first question is when
you were in school and college,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.080
was Google going to be your
number one place to work?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.455
When you were in college, you
said, right, I'm in school.

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:17.954
I'm going to leave
school, I'm going

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.020
to go to college because
I want to be in Google.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.350
Hands up who had that
thought in their mindset

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.430
when they were studying.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.040
Good.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.539
Good.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.540
Great.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.190
We had one.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.510
OK, he's a real Googler.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.890
He watched that movie we all
watched, and we loved it.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.660
OK.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.470
So that's good.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.540
Now, how many of you now have
a qualification or a training

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.590
relative to working in Google?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.880
So I presume most of you would
have some sort of qualification

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.300
or degree or whatever.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.800
So a lot of you have trained
to do a job that you never

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.080
really thought that
you would be doing.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.820
Now, bear with me for a second.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.560
The other side of
this little equation--

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.390
hands up here, anybody
who have children.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.890
OK.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.180
So there's is a good
few who have children.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.700
Anybody-- you don't
have to answer this--

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.020
anybody here in a relationship
that hope maybe one

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.570
day they will have a family?

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.520
OK.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.740
Now, finally, anybody who
hasn't put their hand up,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.532
is anybody here who was ever in
school when they were younger--

00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:32.490
oh, when I grow up, I'm
going to have a family,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.110
and get married, and have kids.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.840
Does that cover the
rest of you here?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.650
OK.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.590
So the point-- why
I wanted to ask

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.760
this was that I think it's
fair to say everybody, pretty

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.960
much, in the room has an
aspiration to be a parent.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.910
Anybody in this room
have any formal training

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.660
on being a parent?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.570
Yes.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.340
Great.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.170
So this has all worked
exactly how I imagined it

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.090
at 2 o'clock this morning
when I was going, OK, what--

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.230
so the point to
all of this, if you

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.910
can let me be a little bit
relaxed on the actual stats,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.610
everybody here
never really thought

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.350
about working for
Google yet you're

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.870
trained to do a job in Google.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.150
And everybody here
has an aspiration--

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.180
is or would like to be a
parent, and you have no training

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.660
to be a parent.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.680
So what effectively is the most
important job of everybody's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.440
life is that of being a parent.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.870
And there is no formal
training out there.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.990
And that's really the basis of
what my whole message is about

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.060
and what I'm trying to do.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.140
I'm not a trained psychologist.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.230
I have a master's in
international business.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.940
I've been in the
corporate business before.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.670
So by the experience
that I've been on,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.700
I have been inspired
to not tell people

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.480
how to raise their children,
or what to do, or what to eat,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.180
or what to put on
them, or what to say.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.420
All I'm trying to do is
to encourage families

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.860
to have more fun together.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.930
And that's the essence
of everything I do.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.080
I always call it the
love, hugs, and kisses.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.610
So if we can, in our
families, as parents,

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.850
spend more time engaging
with our children,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.515
show them the love,
bring them out in nature

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:30.140
and engage with them
a little bit more,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.897
I think the world would
be a better place.

00:05:32.897 --> 00:05:34.730
One of the other analogies
I was thinking of

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.410
was parenting is like
being a government.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.670
You do your best.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.800
Not everybody is happy.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.490
And most politicians on our
end have no formal training

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.770
of being in government,
and they all go

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.200
and they do what
they have to do.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.167
And then you give
the kids too much.

00:05:56.167 --> 00:05:58.250
They'll be given out, or
they will be complaining,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.810
or they want something,
or they'll be bold,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.370
or they'll go on
strike, or whatever

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.360
it is as the children
are getting older.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.950
So now we have the boss guys.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.690
They're all old.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.481
They have their own
voice, and they are now

00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:11.686
being bold children.

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:14.060
Or they are being good children,
because the parents were

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.660
useless in the first place.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.510
So there's the
conflict right there

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.360
between parenting and children.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.390
Now, we've all had
different kinds of parents.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.560
And God forbid we'd all have
Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.170
as our analogy of
parents, but there

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.930
are parents in that
kind of category

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.660
who are just in
it for themselves.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.190
They can become quite selfish.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.640
They're not really caring about
their children or their country

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.530
so far as to what's
going on in Syria.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.280
So I just wanted to
make that analogy

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.990
of the importance of parenting
and the importance of having

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.230
some sort of information
about how to parent.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.380
And it always boils
down to spending time.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.670
When you're with them, be
with them, and encourage them,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.050
inspire them, and spend
your time with them.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.360
And as I have now, is reading.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.790
So that's a little
analogy of what

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.450
I wanted to say in terms of
what the content of my story is.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.190
So I'm going to tell
a bit about myself.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.560
So like you, 10 years ago,
I was in a corporate world.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.910
I worked in Vodafone.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.290
My job was pricing.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.519
And the idea was how can
we have a pricing plan that

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:36.060
makes people think that they're
getting great value for money

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.190
but spend double the
amount of money with this.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.550
So I'm sure you're all
the same at Google.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.940
You're all the same in Google.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.760
How do I get--

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.995
and I'm one of those people,
oh, ads, and oh, so on.

00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:49.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.500
And I wanted to climb
that corporate ladder.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.520
And now we're on this other
side of this whole equation

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.880
I'm talking about, which is
our work-life balance is so--

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.110
luckily, I went to work,
I worked really hard,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.190
I was on my way
going up the ranks,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.370
and I always had
time for my family.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.090
Weekends were always sacred,
and we would always go out.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.500
It would always be an outing
or a walk to the beach,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.510
the park, whatever it is.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.900
And it was one summer.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.890
And we have a place down in
Brittas Bay It's a mobile home.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.330
I was there last
night, actually.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.520
If any of you are on
Facebook, it's Adam's Cloud.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.360
You see a photograph
that I took--

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.270
not last night, but
the night before.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.520
And it's quite magical
and incredible.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.240
That photograph is what
I call Adam's bench.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.990
And I'm going to talk
about Adam now in a moment.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.090
So 10 years ago, we were down
in this spiritual and magical

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.900
place called Brittas Bay.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.740
And we have a caravan
beside the sea,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.510
and myself and my wife
Jackie, who we met at work,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.650
we would go down with our
three children, Henry, Adam,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.750
and Robbie.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.742
And we loved it.

00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:05.700
We'd go down at winter,
we'd go down at Easter,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.800
we'd go down at weekends.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.250
And I was on my
holidays from work.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.300
And I was sitting on the
deck, looking out to the kids.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.590
They had just cut the grass.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.240
The kids are making
haystacks with it.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.720
The sun was shining down.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.067
Sorry.

00:09:22.067 --> 00:09:24.400
This is one of those emotional
moments I was telling you

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.430
about, so feel free to laugh.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.050
So the sun was shining down,
and I raised a glass of wine

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.550
to my wife, and I
said, we're in heaven.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.660
I have a good job.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.595
Look at our kids.

00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:39.970
We're here in this
holiday place.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.320
The sun is shining.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.650
It's just incredible.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.700
I was in this
bubble of happiness.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.380
And I try always to
stay in my bubble.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.460
And literally at that moment,
our then-four-year-old Adam

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.180
came up onto the deck
complaining of a headache.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.660
And like all parents, you
think the worst-- oh, my god.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.730
Oh, don't be silly.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.410
Anyway, go on into bed
and have a lie down.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.170
We gave him some calpol.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.810
That night, he was up all night.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.190
He was complaining
of a headache.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.400
And then the next day, he was
complaining of a headache.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.225
And then he started vomiting.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.350
So then we were starting
to get a little concerned.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.090
We brought him to the doctor.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.240
The doctor looked in his
ear, looked at his heart,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.198
looked down his throat.

00:10:21.198 --> 00:10:23.130
He said, he seems fine to me.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.750
I think everything is OK here.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.016
Give him some Motilum.

00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:27.140
It will settle his stomach.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.100
And give him some calpol
and see how he goes.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.890
That night-- my wife had
done the previous night.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.797
She was up all night.

00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:42.130
And I said, look, I'll take
Adam into bed and I mind him

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.629
tonight.

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:45.010
You have a rest.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.030
I didn't sleep a wink.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.000
Adam was up all night.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.833
He was getting sick.

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:49.460
He was complaining
of a headache.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.300
And I went, something is
really not right here.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.271
So the next day, we
brought him to hospital.

00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:56.020
Though I'd just had
my two weeks holidays.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.620
It was a Monday.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.120
I was due to go
back to work Monday.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.470
And I went, oh, great, day off.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.040
Bring him up.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.070
Get him sorted out, and then
we'll be back down later on.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.160
We went up.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.540
He was admitted into hospital.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.070
And within about 30
minutes, he got sick.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.590
I lifted him in my arms,
and he went like this.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.330
And that was it.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.180
Now, he was kept alive through
the advances of medicine

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.755
for another number of hours,
and they operated on him.

00:11:24.755 --> 00:11:26.626
And we had no idea
what was wrong.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:27.500
What's wrong, doctor?

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.460
It could be meningitis.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.910
We don't know.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.250
He came in with a headache.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.550
And so it turned out that he
had a massive brain tumor.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.370
I've never researched it,
because I just can't go there.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.927
But it was a vascular
tumor that just bled.

00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:43.510
So essentially, he
had a massive bleed

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.890
in his brain, which
caused the swelling, which

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.905
caused the vomiting, which
caused the headaches.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:55.490
So we went from the happiest
people-- we have life sorted,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.330
we know what's life.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.790
We spend time with our
kids, we're working,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.380
we're doing what we were
supposed to be doing,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.430
we were just finished our
holidays, to Adam is gone.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.180
And Adam had an older
brother who was 6 and 1/2

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.955
and a younger brother,
Robbie, who was just gone 1.

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:14.580
Now, that day I
brought him to hospital

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.410
just happened to be my birthday.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.880
So that's a lovely time
of the year for me.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.335
So after all of the
madness and the--

00:12:23.335 --> 00:12:24.460
it was very calm, actually.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.234
It was a very, very
calm experience.

00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:27.900
There was no shouting
or running around.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.690
It was actually-- if it
doesn't sound too strange,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.790
it was beautiful
the way he left us.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.260
It was very, very special.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:42.570
And immediately, at that moment,
I turned to Jackie and I said,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.030
we were very-- we told Adam
we loved him every day.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.310
I played football with
him when he wanted.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.880
We spent time.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.720
He got so much in
in those four years.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.270
And I immediately said,
I have to tell people,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.840
I have to remind people that
there's so much to life.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.941
And children need so much
time and love and affection

00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:03.690
and encouragement and
all of those things,

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.580
and confidence building.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.507
And I said I need
to remind people.

00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:09.090
Now, it wasn't a big
stick of, oh, you

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.506
need to spend time
with your kids.

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:13.530
It was just that reminder that
I wanted to get out there.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:19.980
So I immediately started writing
without any thought process

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.590
in my mind at all.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.850
So I started writing,
which I've never published,

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.247
which is a book about
a time I went camping.

00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:29.830
Adam was four years of age, and
we went camping out overnight.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.842
And Robbie was at
home with his mom.

00:13:32.842 --> 00:13:34.050
And we had an amazing night--

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.470
Harry, myself, and a few
others, and of course, Adam.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:44.267
And so then this whole thing of,
OK, I've got to remind parents.

00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:44.850
What do we do?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.260
So I said, OK--

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.280
and I mentioned this at
my speech at the funeral--

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.800
if every parent can spend
an extra 10 minutes a day

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.610
and tell their children the love
them before they go to sleep,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.590
the world will be
a better place.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.874
Because if any of who have
the children here are like me,

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.290
I shout and scream at them,
and I'm giving a hey, come on,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.890
put your coat on.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.280
Hurry up.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.613
For God's sake, eat your dinner.

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.110
And we're all doing that.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.770
So if you think of
a small person who

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.750
are getting those messages
all day of hurry up,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.320
and come on, and quickly, and
you're late, or whatever--

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.300
and then they go to
bed, and all of that

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.800
is in their mind for the day.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.990
They wake up the next day,
and then it starts again.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.220
There's no break.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.170
There's no, OK, what am I doing.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.300
Why are people at
me all the time?

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.520
Because we're all busy.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.150
And it's what most parents do--
well, the Irish ones, anyway.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:41.460
So the point is that 10 minutes
at the end of the day telling

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.790
your children you love
them is a big, huge eraser.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.830
It rubs out all the shouting.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.472
And it sends them to bed happy,
knowing that they're loved.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.180
And they are going to
have a nicer sleep,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.782
and they're going to wake up the
next morning feeling happier.

00:14:53.782 --> 00:14:55.740
Now, as I said, I'm not
a trained psychologist.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.000
But I'm a huge believer that
that 10 minutes every night

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.310
spent with children, I believe--

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.970
and I have no research
to back this up--

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.640
is going to help with so
many mental health issues,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.700
anxiety issues with
children, confidence issues--

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.990
Everything that children need,
just that 10 minutes every day

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.520
is going to help
and if nothing else

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.150
was done other than a walk in
the park and that 10 minutes

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.390
one on one at bedtime where
you can have your chat.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.900
So that's my message,
and that's what

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.050
I have been inspired about.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.440
And going back to love,
loss, and inspiration--

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.600
I couldn't have loved
Adam any more than--

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.610
it was impossible to
love any of my children,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.640
and my wife, indeed,
of course, as well.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.900
He was gone.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.330
He was lost.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.360
And now I've been
inspired with a message

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.940
to try and change the world
is what I'm trying to do.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.590
I'm doing it on my own.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.390
So I wrote this book,
"Before You Sleep."

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.790
And it just represents
a parent and a child

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.340
together going on magical
adventures together.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.180
And the text is very simple.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.480
"I love you much more than
the sun, moon, and stars,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.730
even much more than
the red planet, Mars.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.130
If we could together fly in
a big rocket ship, what fun

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.910
we would have on
a magical trip."

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.370
And so it goes on.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.294
And it references
love to the love of--

00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:22.710
I love you much
more than pirates,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.110
and Halloween, and Christmas,
and diggers, and dinosaurs,

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.940
and all the stuff
that kids love,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.860
and parents actually
love as well.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.890
But it also then relates
the reader and the child

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.140
in the book together going
on their magical adventure.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.850
So it brings that bond together.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.000
So without knowing anything
about the publishing industry,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.930
I publish my book.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.200
What does that mean?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.960
It means you've got to finance
it and find a way to sell it.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.210
Everyone would say, how
did you publish your book?

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.569
And I went, well, I don't know.

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:51.360
I just printed it and
am trying to sell it,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.830
and that's publishing.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.970
And ignorance is bliss, because
I had no idea how many books I

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.930
would sell, and so on.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.590
So I printed 10,000 copies.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.560
And we used to
laugh in my family.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.420
We'd go, oh, Jesus.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.126
He's printed 10,000 copies.

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:10.250
We're all going to have to
buy at least 1,000 each.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.660
You know what I mean?

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.509
And we had this vision of,
I'm just going to the toilet.

00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:18.050
No, don't go in
there, because that's

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.500
where the books would be.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.890
You'd open the door,
and they'd all fall out.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.930
So what happened was I
published the book, 10,000.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.490
I haven't a clue.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.420
I actually probably only should
have printed 500 or 1,000.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.360
But I was interviewed on
Ireland AM with Ryan Turbidy.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.320
And actually, the book came out
on Adam's first anniversary.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.530
So to have, within that year--
and on his first anniversary,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.360
we had a new baby as well.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.560
And the reason why I'm saying
that was we didn't back down.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.780
We knew we were in trouble.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.830
And we said, we've got
to get out of this.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.540
No one can help us out of this.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.789
We can ring Joe Duffy
all day, and we're not

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:58.080
going to get anywhere with him.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.954
Because he's going to
hear my story, and then

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:01.320
they'll be on to the next one.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.420
We had a major fight on our hand
for the survival of our family

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.460
and our minds as well.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.960
And so that's what we did.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.200
So within the first year
and Adam's anniversary,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.250
we had a baby girl.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.450
So now we had an angel
in heaven, two boys,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.860
and a little girl.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.700
We had a book coming out.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.970
And life was still hard,
but it was beautiful.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.890
It was wonderful.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.090
And it was very special.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.120
"Before You Sleep"
went to number one.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.020
It sold 10,000
copies in six weeks.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.500
And I went, OK, that's easy.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.540
Do all books do this?

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.290
And ignorance is
wonderful, because I just

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.920
thought that was it.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.470
So I went on to my printer
and I said, another 10,000.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.350
And she said, you're mad.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.485
You're just mad.

00:18:51.485 --> 00:18:52.880
Don't-- you've had run.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.880
The way the industry
works, you have a big blip,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.440
and then it all fizzes out.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.398
And I went, oh, look,
I'll sell them somewhere.

00:18:58.398 --> 00:19:00.520
I have my website, and so on.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.940
So then another 10,000.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.350
And they were gone
before Christmas.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.110
So I launched them
the 13th of August,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.420
and 20,000 copies were
gone before Christmas.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.490
And I was on for
another reprint.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.800
And she said, OK, I know
I told you the last time

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.640
not to go mad, but
don't go mad this time.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.360
I went, 10,000 copies.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:27.280
And then I had my 10,000
copies, and February came.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.140
And then I went, I still
have 10,000 copies.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.900
And then March came, I
still have 10,000 copies.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.870
Because the Christmas
period had run.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.760
I was still working at
Vodafone at the time.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.000
I wrote my second book,
which was a space adventure.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.380
And that came out
after a huge event

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.120
in my life with the
book, which was I

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.760
entered "Before You Sleep"
into the Irish Book Awards.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.240
Now, to be a
self-published author,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.514
I didn't have a publisher.

00:19:55.514 --> 00:19:56.430
I don't have an agent.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.500
I don't have any publicity
and all that sort of stuff.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:05.560
That book was taken in
to a shortlist of four.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.330
And I got as many of my family
around a 10-seater table--

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.960
I think we had 13--

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.340
and we stuffed them all in.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.380
And it was more of a thank you
to them, not expecting to win,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.330
but hoping.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.926
It was a thank
you for my family,

00:20:20.926 --> 00:20:22.550
because they helped
us through so much.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.260
And I said, look,
this is a celebration.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.690
So I'm got emotional because
I'm thinking of the night.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:34.230
So when we won the book
award, I was sitting down,

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.700
and they were going through it.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.420
I hear the nominations.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.795
And the winner is, and I'm
going, oh, my god, oh, my god,

00:20:38.795 --> 00:20:39.330
oh, my god.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.220
And it was Benji Bennett
for "Before You Sleep."

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.540
I can't tell you the
feeling that that was--

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.360
not because I won a book award.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.740
I didn't care about that.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.770
But it was Adam was there.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.220
It's his message, and
he's minding his dad.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:07.310
So for me, that was more
about this message is real.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.090
Adam is real.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.450
He is pushing me.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.610
He is driving me.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.250
He is inspiring me
to do what I'm doing.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.320
Ever since then,
I haven't stopped.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.260
I've now written eight books.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.756
I've been nominated for four
of the times for Irish Book

00:21:22.756 --> 00:21:24.630
Awards, and I won it
again for my other book,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.910
"Before You Sleep."

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.160
I launched "Before You
Sleep" over in America.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.780
Now, again, I'm on my own, so
I don't have a big financing

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.780
backing behind me.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.230
And I went to the
London Book Fair,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.830
and I found a
distributor in the US.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.107
And they said, OK,
we like this book.

00:21:43.107 --> 00:21:44.190
We're going to take it on.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.940
And I went, great.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.120
And I said, look, I think I'll
be able to get some publicity.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.550
So went off to the printer and
I said, 20,000 books for the US.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.420
And she goes, Jesus.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.990
And it is later.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.936
And so I have my 20,000
paperbacks printed.

00:22:01.936 --> 00:22:03.810
And then my distributor
comes along and said,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.000
look I was in with
Barnes and Noble.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.080
And they said if you can get
the publicity over in America,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.830
they'll take your book in.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.720
But they want a hard copy.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.540
And I'm like, OK, well, I've
just printed 20,000 softbacks

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.254
with the dollar
and all the rest,

00:22:20.254 --> 00:22:21.420
and now you want hard backs.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.940
And I went, OK, it's just stock.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.450
I'll eventually sell
them, and whatever.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.040
So off we went, and I printed
15,000 hardback copies,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.260
sent them over to
the US last August.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.386
And I got in touch with a
PR agent over in the US.

00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:42.260
And she said, yeah, I
think I can get you on.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.100
This is going to be great.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:43.724
It's brilliant.

00:22:43.724 --> 00:22:45.770
And oh, my god.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.999
And of course,
then, on to "Ellen,"

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:51.290
and on to "The Today Show,"
and all these kind of guys.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.440
Oh, no, not at the moment.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.680
And Donald Trump is
all over the news.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.790
And I was trying to launch my
book at the worst possible time

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.770
in US political
history, because it was

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.330
Donald and Hillary everywhere.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.070
You just couldn't get anything.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.150
So I didn't get any
publicity whatsoever.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.850
And then the distributor
came, and they said,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.230
you haven't got the publicity.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.480
Barnes and Noble are not
taking in any of your books.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.630
And I'm going, oh, Jesus, I've
got 20,000 softbacks, 15,000

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.360
hardbacks.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.710
Oh, my god.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.150
And nobody is selling them.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:29.270
So I got on to my beloved
Adam's Cloud Facebook page.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.830
Adam's Army is what I call them.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.010
It's an army of people who
are helping me and carrying me

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.510
through by spreading the message
of the love of hugs and kisses.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.440
And I said, guys, just
launched over in America.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.620
If we can get some
good reviews on Amazon,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.540
that means Amazon
might present my book

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.700
to more of their customers,
and we might sell some.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.840
Again, ignorance is bliss.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.260
I didn't have a clue.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:59.340
So 500 five-star reviews
later within three days,

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.460
I'm going, oh, my god.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.390
This is unbelievable.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.950
And it wasn't just that
they were five-star reviews.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.460
It's what people said about
the "Before You Sleep" book.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.620
It's touched people
on such a level.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.596
The stories I can
tell you how it's

00:24:12.596 --> 00:24:14.670
helped people who have
lost their children,

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.680
and how it's helped people
with sick children--

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.594
grandparents,
parents, everybody--

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.510
they were fanatical in
what they were writing.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.410
It was like, buy this book.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.100
Buy this book.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.890
Just don't even think about it.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.919
And then there was a case
of, OK, that's great.

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:31.960
I have these reviews up,
but nobody is seeing it.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.160
So I started
advertising on Facebook.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.880
And all of a sudden, the
sales started coming in.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880
And I went, oh, that's--

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.920
I'm looking at my
chart position.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.305
120,000.

00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:45.930
that's not bad.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.610
That's out of all
of books on Amazon.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:48.360
OK.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.420
100,000, great.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.460
That's brilliant.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.840
90,000, 50,000, oh, my god,
10,000, oh, my god, in the top

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.380
selling 10,000 books.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.450
I don't have a publisher.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.033
Nobody knows about
me over in America.

00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:00.630
It's on Amazon.com.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:01.560
This is amazing.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.290
5,000, brilliant.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.680
On Black Friday,
we got to number 3

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.790
in the children's charts and
number 600 over all books.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.140
So I'm competing with the
Harper-Collins, the Worldwide,

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.440
everybody, and there is my
little "Before You Sleep"

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.090
book--

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:23.190
again, Adam doing his
work and doing his job.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.400
And so thankfully, in
the run-up between Amazon

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.320
and a few others, we
sold 10,000 copies

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.100
of the hardbacks in the
US without anybody knowing

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.060
who I am and no publicity.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:46.120
So that, for me, is
not anything about--

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.140
my dad says, oh,
you make your luck

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.830
and all that sort of stuff.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.730
But what it is-- and it's one of
the things I always like to get

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.420
across any time
I'm doing a talk--

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.875
is that we all need
goals in our lives.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.240
We all need to have--

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.910
whether it's in work,
whether it's our family.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:09.040
And my number one
goal when I started--

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.150
if I can try and
contain myself--

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.750
my number one goal and priority
when all of this started,

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:20.210
I wanted desperately for
Adam's picture to be on TV.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.980
That was my biggest
driver behind this.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.914
It wasn't about selling 1,000
or 100,000 or 200,000 books.

00:26:26.914 --> 00:26:28.580
It wasn't about winning
the book awards.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.570
I have a job.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.810
I was just doing it.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.470
But my one thing was I wanted
him to be on the television.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.220
And the other thing
was I wanted to spread

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.097
this message of love, hugs, and
kisses, and help families not--

00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:43.180
as I said, what you eat,
or what they should wear,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.720
where you should go, and so on.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.160
Just spend time with them.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.330
Talk to them, engage them.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.210
They're cleverer than we think.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.040
And with just those two
things, this journey

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.150
has been absolutely
spectacularly amazing.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:03.780
So to go from where we were,
which was deeply in love,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.090
happily married,
this magical bubble

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.020
that I'm in-- life was
great, wasn't any [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.340
the average person.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.160
We were right at the top of
the bubble, the last bubble

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.360
that we had.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.920
And literally, the
day we lost Adam

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.070
was the day that the bubble
burst, both in Ireland

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.960
and for my own family as well.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.210
And to be able to
go through that--

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.970
and how we made it was the
love in a family, spending time

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.770
with our children,
and just focusing

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.219
on those important
things in life.

00:27:31.219 --> 00:27:33.510
And the important things are
providing for your family.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.710
We've all got to work.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.820
Some people say, oh,
the work-life balance.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.920
We are all struggling.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.000
But we've got to
just make that time.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.540
And for me, if we can
inspire our children

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.000
and make that
difference-- because they

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.312
are the new legislators.

00:27:46.312 --> 00:27:47.520
They are the new politicians.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.686
They are the new government.

00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:49.890
They're the new Googlers.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.931
They are the new doctors.

00:27:50.931 --> 00:27:52.440
They are everybody.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.970
And if they have
compassion and love

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.710
and affection in their life,
that's the multiplier effect.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:04.350
And I think we can
make a big change.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.342
And that's probably
a half an hour or so.

00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:11.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.600
SPEAKER: Thank you,
Benji, for sharing

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.820
your story and Adam's story.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.465
It's special.

00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:18.400
It's obviously very emotional.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.230
So we'll start with
a lighter question.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.700
BENJI BENNETT: Good.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.420
SPEAKER: You worked in
business originally,

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.040
and then you took a
very big leap of faith.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.920
When did you know that-- other
than the bathroom door that

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.440
couldn't be opened because
it was full of books, what

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.702
[INAUDIBLE] that?

00:28:36.702 --> 00:28:38.410
BENJI BENNETT: It was
almost immediately.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.820
Because again, what
happened to us--

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.570
and as I said at
the start, everybody

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.490
has something that
they're struggling with.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.240
Everybody does.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.320
And you see them on the street,
and they may have a bad day.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.360
I knew straight
away I did not want

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.910
to be the guy in the office.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:56.430
Leave him.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.200
He's a bit mad.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.750
His son died a few
years ago, and he's--

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.970
we just leave him in here
and hide in this kind

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.350
of corporate environment.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:08.660
I would have lost, and I would
have died myself in there.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.116
Because selling
minutes on a network,

00:29:12.116 --> 00:29:13.490
what did that mean
to me anymore?

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.819
It didn't mean anything to me.

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.985
Doing this analysis and
being passionate about-- you

00:29:16.985 --> 00:29:17.943
know what we should do?

00:29:17.943 --> 00:29:20.840
Because I was always
very passionate in work.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.200
So I almost knew, straight
away, that I needed

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.790
to do something different.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.430
So when I started writing the
book, it was like when I'm--

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.930
there was no plan.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.310
I just started doing it, because
I had this goal of change

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:40.580
the world on my own and spread
this message of love, hugs,

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.660
and kisses.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.360
So that's really
where it happened.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.510
I knew I needed a change,
both in work, what I did,

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.955
and the life that I led.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:53.150
SPEAKER: So you have three
surviving children, Harry,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.050
Robbie, and Molly.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.520
How old are they now?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.370
BENJI BENNETT: So
Harry is now 16.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.780
He is on transition year.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.840
He is building a
community center in Brazil

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.640
as part of that.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.750
So yes.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.020
And so they have to raise
their funds, and he's gone off.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.940
And 17 in the class.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.380
120 were picked.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.800
And it's an amazing experience,
and he's so excited.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.780
He's been on the phone,
and it's brilliant.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.732
Then we have Robbie, who he is
10, and Molly, who is eight.

00:30:21.732 --> 00:30:23.540
There's two years between them.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.300
They are best friends.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.260
They are like that.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.790
And a lot of my
social media content--

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.320
because Harry is off doing
his thing, pretty much--

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.449
a lot of my social media
is just what they're doing,

00:30:34.449 --> 00:30:35.990
and the fun, where
I'm bringing them,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.880
what I'm doing with
them, the conversations

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.040
that they have together.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.190
It's just brilliant, and I
love to observe them as well.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.780
SPEAKER: Harry features
in some of your books,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.140
in the "Space Adventure."

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.667
And the others, do they
have a feature as well?

00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:56.750
BENJI BENNETT: "Before We
Sleep" was my first one,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.950
and that was Adam the
character with a parent.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.180
Now, as you can see
from the photographs

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.450
with the ripped muscles,
it's 100% shaped

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.440
on my physique and good looks.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.000
So that's a joke, of course.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.370
And then the "Space" book,
because Harry was 6 and 1/2

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:20.870
when I lost Adam, I wanted
to have something for him.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.240
So it was Harry and Adam,
just the two of them,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.750
went off on this big adventure.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.890
The next one was
a Christmas one,

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.570
because I'm a nutter
for Christmas,

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.195
and I love Christmas.

00:31:31.195 --> 00:31:33.320
And there's a lovely message
in the Christmas book.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.180
And that's when I
introduced Fluff.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.770
Because as my kids
were small, they

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.020
weren't getting up to mischief
or going on adventures.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.390
So it was just Adam and Fluff.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:46.190
And then on my fourth book,
"Adam's Pirate Treasure,"

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.710
that's when I introduced
all of the kids into it.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.050
And Molly is in that, and so on.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.550
So they've grown,
and my books have

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.700
grown as I've grown as a dad,
as my children have grown.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.010
And yeah, all my
kids are in them.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.870
Fluff flies them
wherever they need.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.830
And now this year, I have a new
book coming out in September,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.140
and Bailey, our dog, is now
part of the action as well.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.700
So we got close to the
"Famous Five" going on there.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.600
SPEAKER: And has the
age range changed, then,

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.290
for the focus of the books?

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.040
BENJI BENNETT: No.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.360
Some of my books would be a
little bit more educational.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.110
My invention is one, it's
time travel and inventions.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.664
We don't have Google as
the invention in there.

00:32:26.664 --> 00:32:27.830
So we have Apple, all right.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.440
SPEAKER: Not yet.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.770
BENJI BENNETT: So they will
deal with certain themes.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.410
So the inventions, or
even the world of wonders,

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.540
what's the most wonderful
thing in the world.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.190
And they go off looking
for it, like we all do.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.660
We're trying to find out
what's the most wonderful thing

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.110
in the world.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.330
And it's represented by the
Colosseum, the Pyramids,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.540
and the Taj Mahal.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.820
And Adam comes
back, and he goes,

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.620
I don't think I've
quite found it.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.870
I just don't feel I've got it.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.274
And then it's a kiss
and a hug at bedtime,

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:57.440
and a big hug and a squeeze.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.570
And he goes, ah, that's--

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.300
I didn't have to leave my home,
because that's what it is.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.344
So the illustrations
are very broad.

00:33:06.344 --> 00:33:08.260
Some of the themes will
be a little bit older.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.480
But the age range is from babies
to about nine years of age.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.367
So I'm very lucky with that.

00:33:16.367 --> 00:33:18.200
SPEAKER: So slightly
more personal question.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.950
And after this one, then we'll
open up to audience questions.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.645
I'm not a mother yet--

00:33:23.645 --> 00:33:25.600
I'll had to qualify.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.300
But I have two
beautiful nephews.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.970
And I don't struggle in any way
telling them that I love them.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.340
I probably don't say it
enough, but I'll improve

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.100
after hearing your talk.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.030
But saying I love you is
difficult to another adult--

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.500
maybe not to a
husband or a wife,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.400
but to your friend or your
brother or your sister.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.940
That's more difficult. Have you
been asked for advice on that

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.405
before, or have any impressions?

00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:53.680
BENJI BENNETT: It's funny.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.471
I've never been asked
that question before.

00:33:55.471 --> 00:33:59.020
And yes, it is a
kind of a funny one.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.980
Now, my kids will tell
each other they love them,

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.840
and they tell me I
love them, and so on.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.820
And that that's a
normal family thing.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:10.179
But as you get older, it
does seem to be friends

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.380
and so on are--

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.880
when you're in
school or whatever,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.088
if you told your best friend
you loved him, oh, god I

00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:16.480
think he's gay, or whatever.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.510
You'd have that type of thing.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:23.770
So to say those words--

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.464
it's not just about saying them.

00:34:25.464 --> 00:34:27.130
And that's why I was
talking about time,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.699
spending time with them
and inspiring them.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:36.810
For example, when I was younger,
my dad [INAUDIBLE] myself--

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.469
we have six kids, and
two of them were younger,

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.080
and two of my
brothers were older.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.251
And myself and my sister
were kind of in the middle.

00:34:44.251 --> 00:34:46.750
And there was a stage where my
dad would bring the two of us

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.880
up to the mountains, and
we'd go with the dog.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.800
And I loved it.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.260
And to this day, I still
absolutely love it.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.639
And I remember the chats
that we would have up there.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.800
Do you know what I mean?

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.956
And even at the time
of the Stardust fire,

00:34:59.956 --> 00:35:01.580
we were actually up
at the top of that.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.870
And I remember that.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.160
And he just gave me a hug.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.090
And sorry.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.380
I'm thinking of the
people in that tragedy.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.420
But he gave me a hug.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.150
And he didn't say I love you.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.580
But we were up on the
top of a mountain.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.850
I was, whatever, nine
years or 10 years of age,

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.270
or whatever it was.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:23.200
And it was a
wonderful experience.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.770
And all of those walks I loved.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:27.852
Now, he has inspired me.

00:35:27.852 --> 00:35:30.310
This is why I'm talking about
the inspiration for children.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.930
He has inspired me to do
that with my children.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.390
And my children love going out.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.140
They're outdoorsy.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.700
They climb trees, they do that.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.230
And they are healthy
and they're happy.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.490
And so that expression of
love doesn't necessarily

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.960
have to be verbal.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.420
You can tell somebody
you love them.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.800
But if I don't put the bins out
for my wife, she's kind of--

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.339
I'd have to do that, because--

00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:54.880
not to show her that I love her,
but it's because I love her.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.870
That's why I'm going to do it.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:57.490
So it doesn't have
to be the words.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.550
I think the actions are
very important to do that.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.650
So saying the words
can be uncomfortable.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:04.150
Don't worry.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.975
Just do the nice
things, I think.

00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:07.600
But always tell the
kids you love them,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.640
because they're smaller, and
they need to be told as well.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.598
But I think we all need
to be told we're loved.

00:36:11.598 --> 00:36:12.205
Am I right?

00:36:12.205 --> 00:36:13.450
I think we are.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.770
So tell your neighbors now.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.780
You can tell each other
you love each other.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.280
Hi, guy.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.300
I love you.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.700
Hugs for everybody at lunchtime.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.360
I'm serious.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.920
SPEAKER: Would anyone
like to ask a question?

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.685
Yes.

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.665
AUDIENCE: So the
question is, why

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:35.684
you chose writing [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:35.684 --> 00:36:37.600
BENJI BENNETT: Well, the
big goal, eventually,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.070
is puppets and TV
screens and movies

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.922
and all that sort of stuff.

00:36:41.922 --> 00:36:43.380
But no, I had never
written before.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.034
But in Vodafone, I
had to communicate.

00:36:48.034 --> 00:36:49.950
I used to kind of joke,
it's like, right, I've

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.130
got to catch all these people
who know nothing about pricing,

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.090
what's going on and so on.

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.600
So my communication
skills were developed

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.070
in a business environment.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.490
Why the writing?

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.530
Again, there was no
thought process here.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.660
So we lost Adam.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.740
We were absolutely devastated.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.690
We had a young one-year-old.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.470
And I just sat down, and
I just started writing.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.190
And I just wanted to remember
the fun that I had with Adam,

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.140
because I had very late video.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.560
And we didn't have a huge
amount of photographs of him,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.890
because there was no
camera phones back then,

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:29.100
unfortunately.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.457
So I went, I have certain
things I have to remember.

00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:33.290
I have to remember his
spirit and his smile.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.420
That's why I wrote--
it was for myself.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.570
And a lot of people who
have gone through trauma

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.350
like that will write, because it
gives them something out of it.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.710
And so that was it.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.800
And then to be able
to put something

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.400
in the hand of parents where
the words are from the parent

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.880
into the child's ear are
the words, "I love you,"

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.070
there can't be a more
powerful, stronger

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.440
way of delivering
Adam's message there.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.095
And that's really what it was.

00:38:03.095 --> 00:38:05.570
So I never wanted
to be a writer.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.560
Who knows?

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.440
AUDIENCE: What was
the editing process

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.320
that you followed
to get [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.680
and given for
children's storybooks

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.270
that the illustrations are
such a big component of it?

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.220
BENJI BENNETT: Thanks for that.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.740
So I'll come on to the
editing bit in a minute.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.550
Any time I'm writing a
book, I have a full vision

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:34.110
of exactly what my crazy
kids are doing in the scene.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.540
And I know where
Fluff is going to be,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.352
and I know the environment
they're going to be in.

00:38:39.352 --> 00:38:41.310
So for the first one,
it's I love you much more

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:45.350
than the deepest blue sea.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:49.070
And I said, OK, we've got to
have the parent and the child

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.300
going on an
adventure underwater.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.430
And crazy stuff-- well,
fishes go to school.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.340
You'd be inspired
by certain Disney.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.360
I love the Disney
stuff, Nemos and stuff.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.340
And I went, OK, so we need
all the fishes going to school

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.480
and the submarine bosses.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:04.940
You know what I mean?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.731
Oh, there's a line.

00:39:05.731 --> 00:39:07.060
You know what I mean?

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.140
So as I'm doing my writing,
those images are in my head.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.960
Now, I can never imagine how
they're going to turn out.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.480
So when I'd finished the
book-- and it's funny.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.150
That was in crumples of paper.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.150
And I'd go out to any
stranger who would listen.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.354
I had a beard, long hair.

00:39:23.354 --> 00:39:25.270
My jumper was on inside
out and back to front.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.740
I was like a crazy man.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.484
Have a look at that, and they
go, that's really lovely.

00:39:29.484 --> 00:39:31.150
And of course they're
going to say that,

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.700
because it's a crumpled
piece of paper, and so on.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.910
But a lot of the feedback that
I did get was very powerful.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.390
They just said,
it's very simple.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.230
So on my first book, I
wrote a 30-page brief

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.250
on the illustrations.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.840
So I sent pictures
of Adam, any videos

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.197
that we had with the team.

00:39:52.197 --> 00:39:53.530
I wanted everything to be happy.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.140
I wanted a tree to be smiling.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.814
I wanted the submarine
to have a smile.

00:39:56.814 --> 00:39:58.480
Everything was
personalized in the book.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.104
It's this wonderful
world of happiness.

00:40:00.104 --> 00:40:01.940
It's my bubble.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.730
And then I got into some
detail on the specific images.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.020
So I gave an overall theme
and then the specific ones.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.330
And luckily, I found
a great illustrator

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.430
through Cartoon Saloon.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:14.570
Spent a fortune on it.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:15.380
I went to the bank.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.600
And again, didn't-- no plan.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.500
I went to the bank
and I said, I need

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.900
12 grand for illustrations.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.730
And they're going, oh,
jeez, it's 10,000 books.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.070
And no thought
process whatsoever.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.710
It was just that inspiration
of get Adam on the TV

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.760
and spread the message.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.470
And then the editing was--

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.300
I got a--

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.980
I think it was a D in
passing, [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.660
probably because they couldn't
understand my writing.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.940
But punctuation is probably
my biggest, and grammar.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.500
So I just got
somebody I knew who

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.900
was able to straighten it out.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.250
They didn't change, necessarily,
anything that I wrote.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.970
They just fixed it up
for glaring mistakes.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:55.120
And there is one or two
that I go, oh, sugar,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.540
we missed that one.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.200
So that's the process
that I went through.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.172
And again, just kept it simple.

00:41:04.172 --> 00:41:08.060
AUDIENCE: I lost my nephew
just over Christmas,

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.407
and my brother and
his girlfriend,

00:41:10.407 --> 00:41:11.948
they're still going
to work everyday.

00:41:11.948 --> 00:41:13.406
They're trying to cope with it.

00:41:13.406 --> 00:41:15.836
I was wondering, what
advice do you have,

00:41:15.836 --> 00:41:18.760
what kept you going
in your darkest hours?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.900
BENJI BENNETT: First of all,
my condolences to both you

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.050
and your family, because it
does extend to the whole family.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:31.370
And everybody here has got
either a parent, a cousin,

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.910
a brother, a sister,
somebody, or your aunt.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:40.500
And grief is so different
for so many different people.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.440
Very close friends of ours had
a particularly tragic situation,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.690
and he's barely operating.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:53.870
And you don't operate properly
for the first year, as I said.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.250
I would just sit
in a chair, and I'd

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.980
be talking, thinking I was OK.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.870
But people looking inward
are going, oh, my god,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:03.080
they're a mess.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.600
And for you looking in
at them, it's like that--

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.870
I always use the
backseat driver analogy.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.450
If you're ever driving
a car, you're fine.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.970
You're in control.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.620
But if my wife is driving the
car, it's like, oh, my god,

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.060
she's driving too close,
or she's not looking,

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.143
or does she see that bike.

00:42:19.143 --> 00:42:20.580
And you're worrying about them.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.720
It's the same with grief.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.580
When you're looking
in on it, you're

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.740
just looking at their raw pain.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:31.830
Now, they have it, and it's
horrific, and it is survivable.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.440
For me-- and what I've learned
with the work I've done with

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.398
Barretstown--Barretstown--[MUSIC PLAYING]
I've raised 50,000 euros from

00:42:37.398 --> 00:42:39.990
donations through the
books to charities--

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.610
what I've learned is it's
a celebration for me.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.132
Adam was always a celebration.

00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:46.590
As I said, when we
lost him, it was

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.030
quite a beautiful experience.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.810
His funeral was so magical.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:56.250
And then you have your
meltdown and your breakdown,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.220
and you'll have that.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.890
Keeping busy is
always important.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.240
But to always celebrate them.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.740
Their child will always
be on their mind.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.240
So never be afraid to--

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.999
people say to me, oh, gosh,
I don't know him from Adam.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:15.040
You know that expression?

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.870
It's an Irish expression.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:16.840
And they go, oh, god, I'm sorry.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.830
I say, it's fine.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:20.110
I was thinking about Adam
before you even said that.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.510
So they would always
be thinking of them.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.120
All you can do is just keep
ringing, just meeting, just

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.040
listen from your perspective.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.570
For them, they just have to
find their way, and celebration.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.480
And usually doing something,
whether it's planting a tree,

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.030
or putting up a
bench, or whatever.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.120
Just to do something for
them is always a nice thing.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.790
But it's impossible to
imagine what you go through.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.570
I can't even imagine it now,
because we're 10 years on,

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.000
and we are blissfully
happy, and Adam is amazing,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.090
and our life is so spiritual,
and everything around us

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.020
is wonderful.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:58.630
But when you're starting
off, it's just no hope.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.870
And to talk to other people
who have lost their children as

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:05.710
well-- because for me, I didn't
want to hear anybody's story.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.660
I just wanted to hear
how long have you gone

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.220
and how was your life.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.475
Because I was so fearful that
I was going to be finished.

00:44:13.475 --> 00:44:15.955
AUDIENCE: Last question,
I saw in one of your books

00:44:15.955 --> 00:44:17.660
that you collaborate
with LauraLynn,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.520
so could you tell us
something about that?

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.760
BENJI BENNETT: So when
I wrote my first book,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.430
as I was writing it, we
went on a bereavement camp

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.570
with Barretstown.

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.580
And again, no plan.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.500
So when we lost Adam,
there was a golf thing on,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.560
and it was cancer.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.430
So all of the money for it
was just given to a charity.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.350
And somebody suggested
to me Barretstown.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.100
I didn't know.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.225
I heard of them, but I
didn't know much about them.

00:44:41.225 --> 00:44:43.120
And I said, whatever.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.570
And then when we went down,
we went on a bereavement camp.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.250
And I said, Joan, it
would be nice to be

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.670
able to do something extra.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.370
Now, in my commercial
mind, I knew

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:55.210
that I wouldn't be able
to do the whole thing just

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:55.794
for a charity.

00:44:55.794 --> 00:44:57.959
I was hoping that maybe it
would be something that I

00:44:57.959 --> 00:44:59.270
could make a career out of.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.610
I wasn't too sure.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.950
So I said, look, I just want
to make a small donation

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.330
from the sale of each book.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.379
The idea is that as long
as I'm alive and as long

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:08.920
as that book is
selling, you're going

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.900
to get the percentage
straight off the top.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.920
And they went, oh, god.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.544
We'd love that.

00:45:12.544 --> 00:45:13.450
Thanks a million.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.250
So that's how that started.

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.590
Then when I was doing
the "Space" book,

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:19.030
Make A Wish contacted me.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.620
They said, we heard
about your book.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.890
Would you be interested in
helping us grant wishes?

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.940
And I went, Adam granting
wishes, oh, my god.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.730
That's the best thing ever.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.020
So they got the next two books.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.670
Then LauraLynn is a
charity I know well enough

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.405
through person, but
I just know of them,

00:45:37.405 --> 00:45:39.030
and I love the work
that they're doing.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.654
So I rang them.

00:45:39.654 --> 00:45:41.921
I said, look, I'm
doing my books.

00:45:41.921 --> 00:45:43.170
You don't have to do anything.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.530
I'm not asking for anything.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.010
Do you want this presented?

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:47.010
And they went, great.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.810
So that's really what it is.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.530
And then Anamara as well is a
parent's bereavement support

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:53.100
group.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.530
So that's really--
it's all charity,

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:57.990
children-related charities
that I'm helping.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.120
So I love it, and it's amazing.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.322
And for Adam to grant wishes
and help families is incredible.

00:46:05.322 --> 00:46:06.530
SPEAKER: It's amazing, Benji.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.129
You've done wonders
for his memory.

00:46:09.129 --> 00:46:10.170
BENJI BENNETT: Thank you.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.170
SPEAKER: It's beautiful.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.970
Can you tell us--
you have eight books?

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.120
BENJI BENNETT: Eight books.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.020
SPEAKER: One jigsaw?

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.170
BENJI BENNETT: One jigsaw.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.087
SPEAKER: And you're in
the US, so what's next?

00:46:18.087 --> 00:46:19.045
BENJI BENNETT: Oh, god.

00:46:19.045 --> 00:46:20.460
Well, in the US,
it's just trying

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.280
to get the US going
a little bit better.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.430
I have a new book
coming out in September.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:28.850
A lot of where I'm
selling them now

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:31.760
is through the bookshops
online, but a lot of events.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.650
I was in the [INAUDIBLE] at
the Pregnancy and Baby Fair.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:36.480
So a lot of promoting
all the time,

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.030
because at the end of the
day, it's what pays the bills.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.180
And so I am out a
lot of the time.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.180
I'd like to be doing a
little bit more blogging.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.800
But the last year has
been very successful.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.660
And if we have a good year--

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.450
so hopefully, all you Googlers
can tell all those Googlers

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.610
in America about my books.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.380
And when I'm doing
my book tour, I'll

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.984
go and do a talk
over there as well.

00:46:56.984 --> 00:46:58.067
SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:58.067 --> 00:46:59.290
We'll have to look in to it.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.295
Thank you very much
for sharing your story.

00:47:01.295 --> 00:47:02.670
BENJI BENNETT:
Thank you so much.

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.720
[APPLAUSE]
