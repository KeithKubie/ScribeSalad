00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.690
A curve has the equation y
equals the natural log of x,

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.980
and passes through the
points P equals e comma 1.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.780
And Q is equal to
x natural log of x.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.970
Write an expression in x that
gives the slope of the secant

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.500
joining P and Q. So I think I'm
going to need my little scratch

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.550
pad for this one
right over here.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.710
So this is the same
question over again.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.790
Now let's just try to visualize
this curve right over here.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.380
So let me draw my axes.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.760
So let's say this is my y-axis.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.600
This is my y-axis, and
then this is my x-axis.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.580
This is my x-axis
right over here.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.120
That's my x-axis.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.390
And natural log of x-- so let's
think about it a little bit.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.790
The natural log of 0, e to
what power is equal to 0?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.370
Well, that's going to be 1.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.710
So you're going to have
the point 1, 0 on this.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.140
So that's 1 right over there.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.880
And then the natural log of
smaller and smaller numbers

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.610
as we approach 0 is going to
get more and more negative,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.130
all the way going down
to negative infinity.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.175
So this curve is going to
look something like this.

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:28.310
It's going to look
something like that.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640
And we know it also has
the point e comma 1 on it.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.590
So it has a point,
the natural log of e.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.320
So if that's 1,
that'll be about 2.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.660
That'll be about 3.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.200
So that is e right over here,
roughly e, right over here.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.600
And that's the point e comma 1.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.240
So that's the point e
comma 1 right over there.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.280
And I'll just mark
that as P there

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.420
to give us a label for it.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.920
So that is P.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.760
And we want to find the
secant line between P

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.690
and an arbitrary
Q for any given x.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.340
The y value is going
to be natural log of x.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.300
So let's say that this
is our Q right over here.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.490
So let's say this right
over here is our-- actually,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.321
I want to make it clear that
it is a, I'll do it our here.

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:16.570
I'm being a little indecisive.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.403
So let's say that is
our Q right over there.

00:02:18.403 --> 00:02:22.860
And that's the point x
natural log, natural log of x.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.590
And we want to find the slope
of the secant line joining

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.440
these two points.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.880
So this, the slope
of this line, I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.010
want to try to make it so
it doesn't look tangent,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.390
so it's secant.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.430
So you see it cuts
through the curve.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.300
So that's the secant
line right over there.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.830
It intersects the
curve at P and at Q.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.580
So I want to find the
slope of that secant line.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.700
Well, to find the slope
of the secant line,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.630
I just need to find
the change in y

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.040
and the change in x
between these two points.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.290
So what's the change in--
so let's be clear here.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.240
This is the point, this is
when x is equal to-- well,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.580
it's just a kind of arbitrary x.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.650
And this right over
here is the point lnx.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.250
So what is our change in x?

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.340
Our change in x-- this
value right over here,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.740
our change in x-- is just
going to be x minus e

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.760
is equal to x minus e.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.230
And what is our change in y?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.380
Our change in y is
going to be lnx is going

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.640
to be the natural log
of x minus 1, minus 1.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.570
That's this distance
right over here.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.060
So the slope of
this line, the line

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.460
that contains both of these
points, the slope-- I could

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.910
write m for slope-- is
going to be our change

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.270
in y over our change in x,
which is equal to lnx minus 1

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.570
over x minus e.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.490
And now we can just
input that and make sure

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.660
that we got that right.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.890
So let me try to remember it--
lnx minus 1 over x minus e.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.260
So let me input that.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.000
So we have the natural
log of x minus 1 over--

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.380
and it interprets it
nicely for us right below,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.400
so we make sure that we're
doing over x minus e.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.040
And now let us check our answer.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.240
And we got it right.
