James Steward: We wanted to answer the question of why an individual work of art matters.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.280 position:97%
— why someone who isn’t a specialist in the discipline ought to find something engaging, how does it

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.750 position:98%
relate to its moment, how does it speak to the career output of the artist in question distinct

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.500 position:98%
from it being simply an object in a vacuum? I think one of the real challenges in contending with

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.350 position:98%
art from the past, especially from cultures that seem quite remote from our own, is the challenge

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.460 position:97%
of bringing the original work of art back to life. And instead of simply talking or telling people

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.510 position:98%
verbally about the extent to which European artists re-engaged with the ancient world to consider

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.550 position:98%
how to represent the human form, we’re actually showing it. So, we’re juxtaposing a great anonymous

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.840 position:98%
painting of St. Sebastian with a second-century Roman torso to make very direct that sense of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.980 position:97%
causality that there was indeed a formal relationship between these objects.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.040 position:98%
Christopher Heuer: James’ approach is one which is going to make the museum not just kind of more accessible,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.080 position:97%
more marketable, but will do what museums across the country, across the world are being forced to do now,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.010 position:97%
which is make art relevant to the present day in a way that’s more than kind of superficial.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.640 position:98%
These kind of comparisons he’s drawn are just one way to do that.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.030 position:97%
My view is that every art museum is by definition (or should be) a teaching museum. Through looking at

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.270 position:97%
a broad array of let’s call them cultural artifacts, we can get a better understanding about the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.640 position:97%
impulses of a culture at any given point in the past. And we’re encouraging students and other

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.010 position:97%
visitors to make these direct connections to see linkages and to re-awaken a sense of: How would

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.850 position:97%
this have been viewed in the time that it was created, and what were the factors in society that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.050 position:98%
gave rise? Why do paintings or any other works of art look the way they look?

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.150 position:98%
Caroline Harris: This is a portrait of Jean Cocteau by Modigliani and it shows the translation into his

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.830 position:98%
painting of the aesthetics of African sculpture. These are actually instruments used in weaving

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.550 position:98%
in association with the Modigliani because this is exactly the sort of African art that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.010 position:97%
he was looking at and was interested in. And when you look at the treatment of the face,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.040 position:97%
all of those stylizations of the features really resonate with the African

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270
objects that he was interested in.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.740 position:97%
James Steward: All of this combines, we hope, to create a more accessible approach to very

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.620 position:75%
rich content no matter what one’s background is.
