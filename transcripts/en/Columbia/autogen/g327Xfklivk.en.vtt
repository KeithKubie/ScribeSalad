we have to explain
right now true

01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:36.309
 

01:18:36.309 --> 01:18:43.290
so it doesn't mean so obvious

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:43.300
 

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.870
Torian is he making kinda people call

01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880
Torian is he making kinda people call
 

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.100
Torian is he making kinda people call
each of those rules were

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:51.110
 

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:58.379
history of seems that we incur hopefully

01:18:58.379 --> 01:18:58.389
history of seems that we incur hopefully
 

01:18:58.389 --> 01:19:03.620
history of seems that we incur hopefully
by that but in philosophy

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:03.630
 

01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:06.770
for this

01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780
 

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.569
well

01:19:09.569 --> 01:19:09.579
well
 

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:14.320
well
yeah

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:14.330
 

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:18.129
ultimately I don't like his arguments

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:18.139
ultimately I don't like his arguments
 

01:19:18.139 --> 01:19:22.729
ultimately I don't like his arguments
but but I I find it extremely

01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:22.739
but but I I find it extremely
 

01:19:22.739 --> 01:19:29.479
but but I I find it extremely

01:19:29.479 --> 01:19:29.489
interesting because he first of all this
 

01:19:29.489 --> 01:19:32.300

scientifically or my biggest objective
 

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.229

but that this is really what you believe

01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239

philosophical justification for this in
 

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.600
philosophical justification for this in
which time this is not at all naive

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:29.610
which time this is not at all naive

these these two opposite poles on the

these these two opposite poles on the
 

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:11.759
these these two opposite poles on the
one hand you have to be fully objective

01:21:11.759 --> 01:21:11.769
one hand you have to be fully objective
 

01:21:11.769 --> 01:21:16.209
one hand you have to be fully objective
on the other hand you have to allow

on the other hand you have to allow
 

01:21:16.219 --> 01:21:18.899
on the other hand you have to allow
yourself and ultimately you have to

yourself and ultimately you have to
 

01:21:18.909 --> 01:21:21.879
yourself and ultimately you have to
appropriate this thought for yourself in

01:21:21.879 --> 01:21:21.889
appropriate this thought for yourself in
 

01:21:21.889 --> 01:21:24.580

it's sort of difficult to get into that
 

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.520
it's sort of difficult to get into that
but but in that that's how you know

but but in that that's how you know

what I believe was was to hold those two

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719
what I believe was was to hold those two
 

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:26.570
what I believe was was to hold those two

01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:54.860
his work is is white is quite depressive
 

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:57.660
his work is is white is quite depressive
and I think the

01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:57.670

the relation of it is quite impressive

01:23:59.190 --> 01:23:59.200
the relation of it is quite impressive
 

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:12.319
the relation of it is quite impressive

01:24:12.319 --> 01:24:12.329
 

01:24:12.329 --> 01:24:16.790
because you always mention the risk

reduction

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:25.650
 

01:24:25.650 --> 01:25:05.470
so in a few minutes

01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.480
 

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:12.509
what would a reduction

01:25:12.509 --> 01:25:12.519
 

01:25:12.519 --> 01:25:15.660
I mean I can find very specifically what

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:15.670
I mean I can find very specifically what
 

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:18.189
I mean I can find very specifically what
I meant was

in the French this debate which means

01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:02.900
in the French this debate which means
 

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.750
in the French this debate which means
that there was a framework it was not

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:04.760
that there was a framework it was not
 

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.780
that there was a framework it was not
the traditional literary history

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:07.790

framework but each article was related

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360
framework but each article was related
 

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.839
framework but each article was related
to a date that had been chosen

01:37:14.839 --> 01:37:14.849
to a date that had been chosen
 

01:37:14.849 --> 01:37:18.029
to a date that had been chosen
so there was a sort of overall

01:37:18.029 --> 01:37:18.039
so there was a sort of overall
 

01:37:18.039 --> 01:37:21.719
so there was a sort of overall
philosophy of disturbing even though it

01:37:21.719 --> 01:37:21.729

was a new feeling superior intended say
so but in your case what is a bit

01:37:26.819 --> 01:37:26.829
so but in your case what is a bit
 

01:37:26.829 --> 01:37:32.399
so but in your case what is a bit
troubling is that each article could be

01:37:32.399 --> 01:37:32.409
troubling is that each article could be
 

01:37:32.409 --> 01:37:36.359
troubling is that each article could be
based on a different conception and

01:37:36.359 --> 01:37:36.369
based on a different conception and
 

01:37:36.369 --> 01:37:43.319
based on a different conception and
philosophy history yes I mean in in that

01:37:43.319 --> 01:37:43.329
philosophy history yes I mean in in that
 

01:37:43.329 --> 01:37:44.459
