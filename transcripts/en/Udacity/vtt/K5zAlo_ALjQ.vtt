00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The thing that is suspicious is that in this binomial distribution, it seems that the frequency

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of outcomes is centered around the expected outcome of 0.5 that falls off

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
according to a funny looking curve--often called a bell curve and the reason is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
this could be the world's largest church bell.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The significance of this bell curves in the relationship to what's called the

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
central limit theorem will be discussed in the next unit.
