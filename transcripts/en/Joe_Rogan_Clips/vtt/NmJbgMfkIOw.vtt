00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.470
You know,
Scotland's a weird place.

2
00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:05.400
Like you have to dress a certain way when you hunt there,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
or at least they have a certain way.
They dress like a traditional way,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.710
but it's not like they don't wear Cammo.
It's like an outfit.
Yeah.

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.560
It's like an outfit.
Like what do they wear?
The wear like clothes,

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.750
like a weird old timey clothes.
I like that.
I like tradition.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.860
Um,
yeah,
I know you did.
That's why I brought it up.
Bordain went um,

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.540
hunting in Scotland because television show,
right?

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
You had to wear some crazy ass outfit.
You get suited for this outfit,

10
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:38.310
this traditional hunting outfit and it's pretty cool.
Yeah.

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:40.110
A lot of those that's,

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.320
that's traditional places like Scotland too.
If I'm in,

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.860
I think most of it was like private land.
Right.

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.720
I think back in the day,
like that was what Robin Hood was all about.
Right.

15
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.590
Robin Hood was originally supposed to be about someone who was poaching and

16
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.140
hunting on the king's land because they were hungry.

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.850
So they were stealing from the rich to feed the poor gentlemanly pursuit,

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.650
hunting and shooting attire.
Wow.
Dress.
Does that help you?

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.310
Helps me be a good hunter because aren't you have to goof on them or does it

20
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:14.910
like does that help?
Does that get in the way of hunting or is that help hunting,

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.850
but that's not helping shit.
[inaudible]

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.530
to Kinda fresh though.
Go back to his boots.
Yeah man,

23
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.930
that guy looks like his boots.
Can you make them boots larger?

24
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.440
Look at those fresh boots.
I wear those on stage.

25
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.300
Would I get in trouble for cultural appropriation?
Wherein in stuff,

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.260
if they're white to work and know that if they're more powerful than you,

27
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.200
then you're okay.
Like how does that work?
How does that work?

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.300
You can't take from how much,

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.230
what percentage of native American do you have to have in you to wear moccasins?

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.980
Who a lot hassle jacket.
How about the,

31
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:51.720
like the Suede tasseled jacket.

32
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.200
They're like Roger Daltrey.
It's like good rebels in the 70s war.

33
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.630
I wanted one of those so bad when I was in high school.
They look so cool.

34
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.530
The easy rider with the fringe on it.
It's all moving.
Driving,

35
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.190
man.
I wanted the arm out the window with the car and it's flopping around.
Yeah.

36
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
You're on stage singing.
The ladies must love yet.
Look at that.
Ah,
oh,
Gloria.

37
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.340
Come on.
Strips of leather.
See,
but that goes too far,

38
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:24.030
so you have it because they have the native American thing.
I'm asleep.

39
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.740
You see this one right here?
No,
not that other one.
Well,
that one's,
yeah,

40
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.290
it's too far.
That one.
If you do that one,

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.520
you better kill the bear that you use for those fuckers.
Yeah,
that's too,

42
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.520
that's ridiculous.
Now there's a white guy version of that,
which would be okay.

43
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.950
That's a girl claims to be a healer,
right?
Yeah,
that's who would wear that.

44
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.280
See if you were that in Texas.
You're okay.
Excellent.
Yeah.
Okay.

45
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.700
Daniel Boone?
Yeah.
Out of here with that one.
That one's dark,

46
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.410
dark one.
No.
What do you prints if be like that guy?

47
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.220
What are you a has to light?
Bat looks terrible.
It looks terrible.

48
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.510
He's got the fringe on the bottom.

49
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.240
That's what's going to separate us from everybody else.

50
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:12.060
The curtains on the bottom or fringe.
A Nice curtain in a fine,

51
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.350
a fine restaurant.
We'll get Elvis.
Elvis had tassels.
Elvis had rainbow tassels.

52
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.860
You could get away with it if you're Elvis,
if you,

53
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.550
if you're working for enterprise,
rent a car,

54
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.560
I think you may be.
You don't wear that?
Yeah.
Elvis got away with some wild shit.

55
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.060
Who the fuck would jumpsuits before Elvis jumpsuits?
It was him and evil Knievel.

56
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.740
Okay.
Oh Man,
look at that Hendrix.
Oh my God.
That's,

57
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.070
yeah dude.
See,
but he's doing some of these playing the guitar.

58
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:46.610
He's moving around.
He's got a headband.
If you just,
if you're making snow cones,

59
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.340
you don't,
that's not your jacket,
man.
I wanted one when I was in high school,

60
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.400
I wore my,
see,
I literally never put that back up.
Put that picture back up.

61
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.600
Look at that.
That look.
How good does it look and I could never wear it.

62
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.170
He's got friends Gianna yet.
What does that greenish yellow,

63
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.970
how would you describe that color?
It's like a teal,
like a light teal light teal.

64
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.320
He's got,
he's got bell bottoms.
They'll bottom jeans,
washed bell bottoms,

65
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.650
and he's got this cool jacket with fringes that are literally two feet long and

66
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.550
then a headband to,
and it's just his kind of Fuchsia that had been,
right.

67
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.440
It's kind of reddish.
Yeah,
like a light red and he's,
it's on Jimi Hendrix.

68
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.910
That's the,

69
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.970
that's the thing that we can't match when we could buy all those items,

70
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:35.770
but it's still our head.
It's Jimi Hendrix's knowing that it's 2019 two.
