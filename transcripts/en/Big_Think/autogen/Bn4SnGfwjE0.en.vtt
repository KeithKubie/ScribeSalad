if you want to be an astronaut there are

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
if you want to be an astronaut there are
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.750
if you want to be an astronaut there are
three main things that are important

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
three main things that are important
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.589
three main things that are important
number one is simple just physical how

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
number one is simple just physical how
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.390

healthy is your body if you're gonna get

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
healthy is your body if you're gonna get
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150
healthy is your body if you're gonna get
on a spaceship and leave Earth then it's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
on a spaceship and leave Earth then it's
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859
on a spaceship and leave Earth then it's
really difficult to go see a doctor or

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
really difficult to go see a doctor or
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.080
really difficult to go see a doctor or
to get to a hospital and so we need

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
to get to a hospital and so we need
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359
to get to a hospital and so we need
people to be healthy part of that is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
people to be healthy part of that is
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.380
people to be healthy part of that is
just a roll of the dice

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
