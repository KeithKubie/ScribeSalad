RICHARD CUMMINS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.905
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.280
As part of Black
Googler Network,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.600
my name is Richard Cummins.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.840
This is our first collaboration
with Talks at Google.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.350
We're very welcome and thankful
for Remi Kapo coming in today

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.850
and speaking during
Black History

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.120
Month about his
new book and also

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.560
an introduction to
his life as well.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.280
So big round of
applause for Remi.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.908
Thanks for being here.

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:33.732
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:36.570
REMI KAPO: First of
all, let's start up

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.070
by thanking Google for
inviting me to hold this talk.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.640
It's not usual for us in the
business of writing to actually

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340
start a book off this way.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.870
This is certainly new.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.690
Let me start off by telling
you a little bit about myself.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.490
Now, I came to England
in 1953 when I was seven.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.105
I went to boarding school.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.480
I was at that boarding school
about three or four or five

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.430
years.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.780
And I ended up in
a children's home

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.890
for the next five, six
years, Beechholme Residential

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.500
Home in Banstead, Surrey.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.820
And from there I went on
to become a cadet officer,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.990
because I needed to
get away from England.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660
I needed to get
away from the shore.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.909
I needed to get away from
everything I'd known before.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.150
And the best thing I could
think of doing was going to sea.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.440
So I was a cadet officer in a
nautical college, King Edwards.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.950
After a year, I went there to
do three and a half years at sea

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.610
with British-India Steam
Navigation Company.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.910
And I came ashore and took
my second mate's certificate.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.315
So I became a navigation
officer after that,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.440
which meant I was one of
the first black navigation

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.510
officers we had in England.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.390
And it's quite
interesting actually,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.360
because from being a cadet
officer being kicked around

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.080
to being a navigation officer
and holding executive authority

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.500
at a very young age meant that
all the things that people had

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.170
done to you, like seamen
had treated you badly,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.080
they regretted it, because you
now had executive authority.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.970
I was given my
first 12-man watch.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.180
So it's eight hours off,
four hours on the bridge.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.690
And that time these 12
men were presented to me.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.635
And the captain noticed
there's two of them who

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.210
were exceptionally nervous,
because this was going

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.490
to be the officer of the watch.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.860
And he said, Mr. Kapo, do
you know those two men?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.910
When they'd gone.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.840
I said, yes.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.300
They said, Gave you a
hard time, did they?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.682
I said, yes.

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:55.982
He said, Can I give
you a piece of advice?

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:57.940
I thought, no, I didn't
want a piece of advice.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.680
I wanted to get my own back.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.060
And then he said,
Let me give you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.970
a piece of advice-- do
nothing, say nothing,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.820
be very nice to them, treat
them with great kindness.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.620
He said, because
all the time you're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.710
the officer of the watch,
you have executive authority,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.920
and you can make their life
miserable, which I could do.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.350
At the end of that
three-month voyage, which

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.610
was from West India dock
all the way down to set

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.980
port in Nigeria and back,
they ran off the ship.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.824
Thank you, Mr. Kapo.

00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:31.990
That was a wonderful voyage.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.880
We're signing back on.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.500
And that was the
first time I learned

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.040
how not to use power
over people and how

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.520
to learn to understand
what power actually looked

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.920
like and felt like.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.740
Anyway, let me move on.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.370
I went from there.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.350
I came ashore.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.960
I started writing for
the "New Statesman."

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.150
From there I went to
Tim's Television, ATV.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.810
Then I became the
director of The Roundhouse

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.690
in Chalk Farm for seven years.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.010
And from there I then
decided to leave all that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.360
and write a trilogy.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.660
Now, this is where it
becomes interesting.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.240
I thought, writing the trilogy--

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.000
but I'd never written
a book before.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Because I remember the next day
I phoned up some of my friends

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.846
who all had been great
authors, because I was living

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:31.970
in North London, wasn't it?

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.780
The intellectual
enclave in North London

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.990
where everybody, all the
writers and journalists, lived.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.720
But, Remi, you just announced
you're going for 10 years

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.560
to write a trilogy.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.490
I said, yes.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.939
But didn't you know--

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.730
I said, well, I've
never written a trilogy.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.220
I've never written a
novel for God's sake.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.231
I've written a book, which
was a book called "The Savage

00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:52.730
Culture."

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.950
That was a book
about life in Britain

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.910
as a black man on the
streets of Britain

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.640
and what had happened to me.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.790
But I had never written a novel,
which was very, very different.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.730
He said, well, I can't
really teach you.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.440
And I realized why he couldn't.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.780
A, they couldn't teach
me very much about this.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.480
I wanted to write about slavery.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.560
I wanted to write a story,
which started in 1600,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.720
with a Nigerian family--

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.140
Yoruba family, some Yoruba--

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.650
and an English family,
landed gentry Catholics

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.850
from Yorkshire.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.310
Now, what happened
to these two families

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.100
over from 1600 to 1966-- it
was almost a 400-year period.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.850
And I thought, well, let
me read about slavery.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.810
Now, I could find many
things about slavery

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.490
to do with abolition, but the
actual issue of slavery itself,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.540
the actual mechanisms,
how slavery was used,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.030
how slavery worked, the
business of slavery,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.860
I couldn't find anywhere,
hardly anywhere.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.360
Why?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.950
It's almost as if
somebody in this rush

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.230
to write about abolition,
which was the nice end

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.470
of the wedge, nobody--

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.170
the unpleasant end,
which it would have been

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.640
unpleasant for black and white.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.300
That was left behind.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.530
That was kind of left out.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.240
Nobody wanted to deal with that.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.090
Therefore, I couldn't
find almost anything

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.280
to do with the
business of slavery.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.790
So I realized what
I'd have to do.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.339
I'd have to write
one, first of all,

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:29.630
before I could write the novel.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.680
I'd have to write
the history book.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.170
And that's what I set out to do.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.940
Now, what else did I want to do?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.510
I wanted to write a book that
was going to captivate and hold

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.170
both black and white
readers, because I noticed

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.660
that the whole issue
of slavery we had,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.200
it made some people feel
guilty, some people angry.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.230
Some people just didn't want
to read about it, deal with it.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.470
But for me, it was
very, very important,

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:03.120
because inside some of the
worst catastrophes in the world,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.520
you'll always find
a human compassion.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.830
You will always find contact
between human beings.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.940
I had a friend of mine,
Yehuda Segal, Jewish,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:21.800
met his wife in Dachau
in the second World War.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.050
And one of the questions
I asked him is,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.490
was there not but one
German who took compassion

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.060
as to the way you
were being treated?

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.268
Because it was horrific what
they were going through.

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.580
He said, yes, we did.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.360
We depended on some of the
Germans, because some of them

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.230
couldn't take it, couldn't
accept what was going on.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.410
Well, equally was what
went on with slavery.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.790
So I started looking
at the issue of slavery

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.600
even more closely.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.550
When I looked closer,
I began to realize

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.460
that what we were talking
about was a minority of people,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.310
both in the West African
coast and in Britain,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.210
conducted slavery, owned the
slaves, owned the plantations.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.670
And therefore, there
also from that minority

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.185
came the educated--

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:09.530
the educated minority-- who
also were going to be the ones

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.670
to write the story.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.540
Well, obviously, those who
are going to write the story

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.910
were also going to--

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.170
a very human thing--

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.880
but we don't really
want to put this bit in,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.460
because that's a bit unpleasant.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.065
And so is this bit.

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:27.880
So it started
picking and choosing.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.880
Now, if we were going to
learn anything about slavery,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.350
we need to know a whole lot.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:41.000
We are talking about an era
when the slave trade began,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.620
where the working
class of Britain

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.810
was just as much enslaved
as the black people.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.180
We were talking about an era
when the educated minority were

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.410
the upper middle class
and the aristocracy

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.960
and the landed gentry.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.890
We're talking about
an era that they were

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.720
the ones who owned the slaves.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.560
So we're talking about an
era that this mass had almost

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.550
nothing to do with slavery.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.720
And yet when my people
arrived in Britain,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.820
we looked around,
right across Britain,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.210
we were all convinced that every
white family had an involvement

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.546
with slavery, which isn't true.

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:17.420
We'd lived with that.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.450
I'd lived with that until
I began looking closely

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.730
into what slavery was about.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.900
And the closer I
looked, the more

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:33.070
I realized slavery in England
was conducted by a minority,

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.430
was hand and hand
with the minority

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.510
of the establishment of the
rich and the wealthy on the West

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.280
African coast.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.000
In other words, the
masses of both coasts

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.800
had virtually nothing
to do with it.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.566
That made me really
interested, because I realized

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:55.190
that what we were talking about
when we're talk about slavery--

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.560
we're talking about a story
that should interest everybody

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.900
because we're both involved.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:07.490
And therefore, I found
the very, very things

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.985
that I needed to
say, the very things

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:17.160
that I needed to portray
in the people themselves.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.360
So there were people
who helped the slaves.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.130
Of course there were.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.870
There's one story, which
was really quite important.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:34.080
It was the issue of, I
think, June 6, 1772, which is

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.850
called the Mansfield decision.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.880
James Somerset escaped
from an American ship--

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.820
I think, from Rotherhithe.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.240
He was passed
through safe houses,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.150
through working class areas, to
the hands of the abolitionists,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.700
like Granville Sharp
and Thomas Clarkson,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.490
who decided at that time
here we have this man is--

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.549
why should-- he's escaped.

00:11:04.549 --> 00:11:05.840
He should no longer be a slave.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.330
He's now in England.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.610
So what they were trying to say
is when somebody is over here,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.660
they were no longer a slave.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.290
But that needed to be
tested in the king's bench.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.050
And that's when it was tested.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.930
Over a period of six months,
Lord Mansfield prevaricated,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.340
went this way and that way.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.730
Because here was an
issue of his class

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.220
that's going to affect
people of his class.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.350
That's also something
that's going to affect

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.720
all those people out there.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.890
So what did he do?

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.290
By June, he decided to
free James Somerset.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.250
Now, what was interesting
about that is this--

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.870
they needed about
150, 200 guineas

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.240
If you imagine 1722 what
200 guineas would be now.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.930
We'd be talking an
awful lot of money.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.620
Where did that money come from?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:01.040
It came from working class
people, mainly white people,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.550
collecting pennies and
farthings in these pubs

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.290
and establishments and
the cafes equivalent

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:14.960
and festivals all over
England, especially

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.180
in London, just
so that they could

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.640
get this one black man free.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.790
And that's what made me realize
that-- my goodness, if we are

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.460
going to talk about
slavery anymore,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:31.790
we needed to have stories that
actually we were attracted to.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.760
We needed to read.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.980
We need to understand.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.280
Because through it,
we begin to understand

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.510
what England is really about.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.720
Well, what England--
who England belongs to.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.770
It belongs to all of us.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.930
Because we've all
had something to do

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.560
with that whole issue of
slavery, which, by the way,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.020
also basically
supported the finances

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.970
in this country, most of
the great houses, sugar.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.660
All these huge
finance establishments

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.580
were built on the
back of slavery.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.310
That doesn't mean that I
want people to feel guilty.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.660
That's the one thing
we don't want anymore.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.990
We need to get rid
of the guilt. We

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.670
need to get rid of the anger.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.610
We need to replace it
with understanding.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.490
So I thought the best way to do
it was to write the story, not

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.740
a history book for the
people, but to write

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.920
a story about people.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.280
To write a novel that people--

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.740
a novel that people
could understand

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.640
how the humanity
of people comes out

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:40.900
when they see what activities
they are led to perform just

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.190
to free somebody else.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.410
Just to say, I
support this person.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.750
They respected the
color of his skin.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.340
And that's what
we've always had.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.500
We have always had
that in England,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.940
but you wouldn't
think so though.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.560
If you look outside
today, when you

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.330
think of the
difficulties we have

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.820
with the whole
issue of race, you

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.730
would not think for
a moment that there

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.680
was that commonality.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.940
There was that community.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.370
There was that spirit
that actually brought

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.580
black and white people
together in the 18th century

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.220
to free one black man--

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.580
quite extraordinary.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.920
And that was one
of the reasons why

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.000
I wanted to write this
whole story about slavery.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.900
Not one that was that to make
you angry, because I've had

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.430
enough of stories
that made you angry.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.710
There's people that
make films that--

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.240
you've seen the whites
come in, and you walk out

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.681
of it feeling guilty.

00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:37.180
Why?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.263
They had nothing to do it.

00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:40.450
There's nobody in
this room today

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.962
who was either a slave
owner or a slave.

00:14:43.962 --> 00:14:45.670
And if there's anybody
in this room today

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.190
who came from a family where
they made money from it,

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.560
it's still not their
responsibility.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.610
We've had enough of that.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.640
That's what's actually held
us back as a people the fact

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.060
that people still feel guilty
and angry about slavery when,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.250
in fact, this is something
that's affected us

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.580
detrimentally as a nation.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.980
And so I think
it's about time we

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.050
put the whole issue of slavery
on a different footing,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.390
on the footing of novels.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.340
Because through those novels,
through those stories,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:22.140
through the activities of
people in these stories,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.690
we begin to understand
how people have actually

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.340
stood for each other.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.450
Now, why hadn't this issue of
slavery been written about?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.664
Well, until about
the 20th century,

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:34.080
I don't think
there's much written

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.960
about the history
of women, was there?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.677
Until about 1938, when AR
Morton wrote "A People's History

00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:45.010
of England," I don't think
there'd been anything written

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.830
about the history of the working
class, the majority for God's

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.670
sake.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.660
That was the majority,
and yet 1938-- so we

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.510
can only come to
the whole history

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.020
of women in the
early 20th century

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.720
and the issue of
the working class,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.280
the history of
the working class,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.050
in the early 20th century.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.450
That helps me to
certainly understand

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:16.150
why black people and
their relationships

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.690
have come so late.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:23.920
Now, if you look today at
our diverse community now,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.100
in my generation--

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:33.090
I'm 71-- we didn't talk
about diversity in 1953.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.179
I don't think anybody knew
how to spell the word.

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:36.720
And if they did know
how to spell it,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.880
I don't think they knew
what it actually meant.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.850
Now you look around
Google, you look

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.740
around some of the
companies today,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.520
you look around at
the young generation.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.740
When we left school, all the
black ones went this way.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.690
All the white ones
went that way.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.910
When my children left school--

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.640
one of them is in
the room today--

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.400
black, white, green,
yellow, pink went that way.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.660
Same thing went that way.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.326
In other words, they
have a commonality.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.099
They had had a community.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.329
They had understood diversity.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.770
They lived with that.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.849
And they had learned
from us that we

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.760
don't want to make the
mistakes your generation made,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.930
my generation.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.869
Actually, my generation
and my parents' generation

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.859
actually stabilized Britain
after the second World War

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.390
and then held it back
towards the '60s.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.000
We held it back
because we couldn't

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.390
find any kind of commonality.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.580
We couldn't find a way through
the difficulties of race.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:47.930
We could not find any community.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.710
My generation failed
England because of that.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.882
Now when I look around
my children's generation,

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:56.340
they're doing a
lot better then us.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.250
They've still got
a long way to go,

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.590
but they're doing a
lot better than we did.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.140
And I think that's the
direction Britain is on.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.810
When I look at even this
audience today, my god,

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.370
I've got every
color in the world,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.870
which I think is fantastic.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.430
And you're sitting
where you want to sit.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.250
Oh, no, in my generation,
the black ones

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.030
sat together, the white
ones sat together.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.350
The very first time
I walked into Google,

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.370
I was stunned by
the array of colors,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:38.320
the array of disinterest
as to who was who.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.570
We could not find a community
of understanding, my generation.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.790
And in that way, we
were the worst ones

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.090
to actually lead Britain
into the new century--

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.870
absolutely-- and that we
are actually taking now--

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.180
we're being led by our kids.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:01.360
And that's a good thing, because
at least our children are not

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.870
trying to hold the country back.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.260
They're actually trying
to find a way through.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.660
Now, that to me is important.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.450
That's why it was
important for these--

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.980
I've got two books so far.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.080
"Reap the Forgotten
Harvest" is the first one.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.850
"Torrents of Fire"
is the second.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.860
And there's a third
one to come out.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:28.270
That will make the total
box set, should we say,

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:34.310
of this trilogy, because I
wanted to go to the 1960s.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.070
Why?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:39.880
I wanted to come not
too close to where

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:45.870
we are now but close enough
that I could actually say,

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:53.950
this is not just that we failed
in a way but how we failed.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:59.270
And that it would help the
next generation not commit

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.550
the kind of mistakes we made.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.280
But you have to have slavery,
not as a fearful thing,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.410
which is what we had.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.940
You notice it today.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.940
On my Facebook page-- my son
was running my Facebook page,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.850
and there's a lot of
people writing it,

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.780
but we were the first
ones to abolish it.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.350
The issue we're talking
about was slavery.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.640
Who did what with whom?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.320
Who supported whom?

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.030
I mean, how many
stories must there be?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.530
My editor, Dr. Jill
Sudbury, she has

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:38.540
a family where, in
the 1720s, her family

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.590
were helping a slave get a job.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.900
And they've got that history.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.780
So you can imagine
the history of slavery

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.520
has yet to be written.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.990
That's what we need to do.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.640
We need to write it.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.660
Now, I am just one person.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.686
The next generation will
write it even better.

00:20:56.686 --> 00:20:57.810
And they'll have even more.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:58.309
Why?

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:01.050
Because the families--
personal stories

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.050
will come from
different families.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.110
And the government
will probably release

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.610
even more documentation.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.630
For instance, they released
a document to-- well,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.000
more than one set of documents--

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.960
when the slave trade
was ended in 1833, '34.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.460
In order to end it, the slave
owners said, we will lose out.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.200
So the slave owners were paid.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.750
The government
basically used 40%

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.470
of the gross domestic product
to buy the lives of the slaves,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.656
to buy the slaves
of the slave owners.

00:21:41.656 --> 00:21:43.801
But nobody ever thought
that these files would ever

00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:44.300
come out.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.390
So anyway, it's all put
down, and they were all

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.960
shoved in the treasury,
disappeared into the treasury.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.800
One day, the government
released those files to--

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.320
guess who?

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.340
University College
London who immediately

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.550
went through them properly
and documented them,

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.795
up they went into the internet.

00:22:06.795 --> 00:22:08.586
And we know once it
gets into the internet,

00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:09.850
it gets everywhere.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.020
Well, lots of people
started, yeah,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.700
but we've got no money left.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.110
The fact of the matter is that
a lot of the families who owned

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.480
slaves then are still here now.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.290
They're not guilty.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.460
They're not guilty.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.010
They should not need to
have to stand up to say--

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.000
and Richard Dawkins
did not need to say,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.450
well, we've got
none of the money.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.950
It was all spent
a long time ago.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.010
He shouldn't have
needed to say that.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:48.170
David Cameron, whose
ancestors also owned slaves,

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.610
didn't need to excuse
himself, right?

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.020
Because he didn't do it.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.510
And that's what
I'm trying to say

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.200
is that what has happened
yesterday happened yesterday.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.920
We don't want the
families of the great

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.720
and the good or
the landed gentry.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.580
We don't need them
to come and say,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.730
we've got no money
left yet but--

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.290
we know the money is there.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.950
We don't even need England
to say our major cities

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.720
like Liverpool,
Bristol, and London were

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.950
built on the back of slavery.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.660
We don't need any
excuses for that.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.940
We just need to
know the history.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.451
We don't need to know
who did what to whom.

00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:29.270
But we need to know mostly
how it supported this, that,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.750
and the other, and how
these industries were

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.650
built over a period
of time, and how

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.360
money was made from slavery.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.840
Because it's no good saying,
what are the black people

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.340
doing here?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.440
I think they've already
paid with their bodies.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.200
And I think that there's an
awful lot of white people

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.100
who supported them, who
not only supported them,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.290
who married them.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.450
When you think of
today, in Britain,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.060
we have 10% of our
nation is now what?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.410
Mixed race.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.050
My own children-- I'm very
proud to say-- my children

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.640
are mixed race.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.330
And I'm very proud of that.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.390
They're very clever.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.220
And, of course, every
father says that.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.780
But I really mean it.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:15.490
And the fact of the matter is
that they represent both of us.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.730
What are we going to do?

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.690
We're going to attack them
because they're mixed race?

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.050
They're part of us.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.350
And there's a bridge between us.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.080
And therefore, what I needed
to say, what I needed to do

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.880
was to write something
that became like a bridge.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.500
So the books I've written
are for black and white.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.950
I wanted to keep both eyes
of black and white people

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.620
on the same page
all the way through

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.000
without feeling they are
being offended in anyway.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.450
But you don't need
to be offended.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.580
That's not what
slavery is about.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.770
That's not what the
whole story is about.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.250
The story is about something
that should unite us today

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.420
not divide us.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.540
And yet it is still dividing us.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.910
It's dividing us because
we don't understand it.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:04.840
We fear it.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.350
And what you fear can
certainly divide you.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.220
And slavery is something
we shouldn't fear any more

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:18.020
than men should fear the fact
that women have been set back

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.460
and that women need to
have one huge step forward.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:22.960
Absolutely.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.950
We shouldn't fear that.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.110
That should be something
we should warm to simply

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.750
because it needs to be done.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.580
And we need to understand
the issues of--

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.430
certainly, our children
need to understand this--

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.114
that their mixed race status
shouldn't set them back

00:25:40.114 --> 00:25:41.030
in any way whatsoever.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:41.480
They're virtues.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.550
It gives them advantage.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.430
It should give them an even
bigger advantage then I have.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.510
And I didn't have that
in the advantages.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.660
But the fact of the matter
is that our children

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.710
should have the
advantages I never had,

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.920
both of them, black and white.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.640
This division of black
and white has been really

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.600
promulgated very much by
the whole issue of slavery.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.800
And I'm saying to you
today that until we

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.550
begin to realize that slavery
is something we control,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.950
it doesn't control
us, we don't fear it.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.380
We don't need to fear it.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.750
We need people who used
slavery as a cudgel

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.120
to bash each other with, and
that's not going to happen.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.210
That's not going happen.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.860
That's why I spent two
years traveling just

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.410
along the West African
coast, photographing

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.780
the entire British
efforts of the forts

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.980
and factories of the slave
trade, around the Caribbean,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.090
and all over England.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.530
That was two years traveling.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.700
Then I did two years in the
British Library researching

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.950
as much as I could
on what was left.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.790
And then I did 10
years writing just

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.900
to get the whole issue
of slavery on a footing

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.970
that I could understand.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.060
Once I could understand it, once
I realized what it was about,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.980
once I realized
where it was going,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.800
then I was able to
say to myself, right,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.400
I'm not in control
of this issue.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.870
And I'm going to be
the one who's going

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.560
to say next where it goes to.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.420
And where it goes to is this--

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:28.330
that slavery has divided this
country for far too long,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:33.600
and that slavery is something
that only divides it

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.390
because we don't understand it.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:44.320
Slavery is something that was
an issue that people used to--

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.560
it's a great pub talk
to wind people up with.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.610
I mean, you see people
getting in pubs.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.810
You enslaved us.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:57.600
Yes, but we were the
ones who freed you first.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.480
Don't think that matters.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.060
It's irrelevant actually.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.400
It's totally irrelevant.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.250
What is more relevant is
that something happened.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.260
What?

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.570
And let's get this clear.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.890
In a country which is
so divided by class,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.430
the biggest division of all--

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:23.730
class is like the elephant
infant in the room in England.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.070
Class is the one
that everybody fears.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.960
Now, in a country that's
so divided by class

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.250
that when I tell you
a lot of the working

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:41.620
class of this country
behaved then as they do now.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.430
When the first slaves got
their first houses and places

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.240
to live in the
east end of London

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.430
and different parts of England,
where do you think they lived?

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.990
They lived in Lord
so-and-so's house?

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.490
No.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.200
Working class houses.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.560
When our people arrived in this
country in the '40s and '50s,

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.060
where did we live?

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.620
Working class houses.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.230
That's where we've always
had our friendships.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:13.150
That's where we've
always had our meets.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.520
That's where we've
always had unification.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.606
That's who we had children with.

00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:23.620
And because of that
that's why the working

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.200
class in this country
has been the greatest

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:31.430
friends of black people through
the centuries and still are.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.140
And when you go to
your working class pub,

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.006
you hear, but we freed you.

00:29:37.006 --> 00:29:39.005
And they've got nothing
to do-- they didn't even

00:29:39.005 --> 00:29:41.580
know anything from slavery.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.810
And that's really, really
the meat of something

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.320
that didn't exist.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.760
It didn't exist.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.480
And what did exist is
that a class above them

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.610
perpetrated it.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.900
There's no need to hate them,
because we can't change that.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.870
What we can do is understand it.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.320
And therefore, in
writing what I did,

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.900
I wrote it to help
understanding,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.420
to bring people together, to
bring understanding together,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.040
not to divide.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.730
I didn't write it to create
any more kind of division

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.650
that we already have.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.890
We have enough division.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.310
We have racial division
in this country

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:31.550
that hasn't changed that much.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.960
But it's changing because
the next generation suddenly

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:42.190
got tired of the lack of unity.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.080
They got tired of
doing the same thing.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:55.150
We couldn't find
any understanding.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.950
We could not find
any understanding

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.080
between us, my generation.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.684
And therefore, and I can see
that everybody in this room,

00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:03.100
I should imagine,
younger than me,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.400
apart from that one over there.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.980
And he, in particular,
would understand this

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.590
because we went through
very similar things.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:27.130
Now if, for instance, we are now
going to find the way forward,

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.020
what we need to do,
I think, is to accept

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:38.590
that holding back the next
generation of black writers

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.590
or women writers or
working class writers

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.620
is not going to solve anything.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.210
We need to hear from them.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:50.440
We need to read what
they have to say.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:59.650
We also need to find out that
the issue we're talking about

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.510
is probably one of the
most exciting issues

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.790
that I've come across in
the time I've been here.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.110
Why exciting?

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.930
Because of the things
people did for each other.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:11.580
Wow!

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.270
I was stunned by this stuff I
found out, what people actually

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:20.040
did, what people were
prepared to do for each other.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.610
So I spent some of my
best years of my life

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.690
putting that down and writing
it into the form of a story that

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.680
wasn't untrue.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.940
It was perfectly true.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.900
I just happened to
put it into a novel.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.630
Now, it's easier to write--

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.580
when I wrote my first
book, "Savage Culture,"

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.282
that was a factual book.

00:32:40.282 --> 00:32:43.080
It was much easier to
write that than to write

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.930
a novel of 500 pages.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.380
You've got to be
crazy to sit down

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.420
to want to write a
novel of 500 pages,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.550
because it takes a lot more.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.950
It takes a lot more out of you.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.240
And I just think that--

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.010
I mean, the last
one was 400 pages.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.343
And I thought, my god, that
really took a lot out of me.

00:32:58.343 --> 00:32:59.460
I'll never do this again.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.780
And next one is 500.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.600
It's 100 pages longer.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.560
I promise you the next one
won't be more than 650 pages.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.020
I'll try and keep it short.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.300
But the thing is
it's a big story.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.690
It is a big issue.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.990
And it is an issue that we
need more than one set of eyes.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:27.460
I don't mind a white man
writing as a black character.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.370
To write that book, I had
to write as black and white.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.900
So what did I have to do?

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.630
I had to lose my blackness
intellectually, emotionally,

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.820
and you do.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.804
Because one of the things--
the moment somebody

00:33:39.804 --> 00:33:41.470
sits down and reads
your novel and feels

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.890
that, this is written by
a black person or white,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.630
you're going to lose it.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.910
You don't want to feel anything.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.050
You really, really don't.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:54.610
And to emotionally
lose yourself,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.590
the thing you've known all your
life, the color of your skin,

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.590
and that black mentality,
because everything out

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.910
there reminds you every day--

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.519
you're black.

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:03.060
You're black.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:03.520
You're black.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.010
And suddenly, one day, you
have to sit down in your study,

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.740
and you have to
lose that blackness.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:13.440
I remember the first time I
wrote a scene where a slave was

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.940
going to be punished.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.590
Here I was-- a white
person was going

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.380
to punish this black person.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.510
What was I going to?

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.020
Hold, pull the punches?

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.270
No.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:26.820
It took me at least six
months to get over it,

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.159
just to get over how to do it.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.750
It took me about a year to
understand what I was doing.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.710
But once I got into that,
I found that it was easier.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.889
And it actually made it
easier for somebody to read,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.320
because they weren't going
to have this thing be shoved

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.969
in their face all the time.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.239
They weren't going to have
guilt or anger or dissension

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.500
or dissatisfaction.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.989
They were not going to have
that be pushed into their face

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:54.710
all the time.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.900
So you need to lose
your blackness.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.420
Now, if you're going
to be a white man

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.847
writing or a white woman
writing as a black character,

00:35:01.847 --> 00:35:03.180
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.780
We need to get past all of that.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.400
We've had arguments
in this country.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.680
There was almost like
an unwritten rule

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.044
in the '50s, '60s, and
'70s that you never wrote

00:35:14.044 --> 00:35:18.030
as any other race but your own.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.310
And if you wrote as any
other race, it was a cameo.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.720
Now if you do 500
pages of something

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.830
to do with a story as big as
this, you have to be both.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.180
You do have to be both.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.960
Equally, I've had
women writers who've

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.610
written as men and very
successfully as well.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.300
And it can be done, but
you have to do it simply

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.842
because we're not interested
in the color of your skin.

00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:42.800
We're not interested in
your gender, so and so.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.420
We're interested in the story.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.070
And I don't want it
shoved in my face

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.190
how you feel about me as a
man or woman or this or that

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.260
or the other.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.892
And that's what's essentially
important in writing this.

00:35:54.892 --> 00:35:56.600
And that's what you've
got to get across.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.590
Because if you ever
get into film material,

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.690
then it's got to be balanced.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:06.890
It's that balance you've got to
find in yourself as a writer.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.230
And that balance is
not easy to achieve.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.460
It really, really isn't.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.700
In fact, it's very
difficult to achieve,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.050
but once you get the
understanding what

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.180
it is you know
what you're doing,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.390
it makes it much easier, far
more interesting, and far more

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:27.310
useful for the reader, because
you're not asking the reader

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.210
to feel guilty.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.220
You're not asking the
reader to feel angry.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.030
I'm an African now.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.020
What part did I play
in the slave trade?

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.020
What part did my people
play in the slave trade?

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.650
Well, we played part of
selling our own people

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:49.210
as well as being sold ourselves.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:55.550
Now, my West Indian friends
were very angry about it

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:56.420
in the '60s.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.590
My god, they feel
very angry about it.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.820
And in feeling that
anger, we could never

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.140
get a conversation through
more than half an hour

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.090
before it exploded.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.882
Now we're going to
get past all that.

00:37:09.882 --> 00:37:11.090
We're going to get past that.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.300
People have got
to understand you,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.540
the white man, or you, the
black person, was never a slave.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.860
You were never a slave owner.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.410
You were just a person who
represents those colors.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.310
That's all.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.230
But you're nothing
more than that.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.340
And the moment we begin to get
past that, we get into the era

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.370
where it becomes
interesting-- what happened?

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.460
So what I'm saying today that
Britain needs to get away

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.020
from the things we
know about abolition,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.630
and we know all about that.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.240
We need to know what happened
in this 400-year period

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.060
of history--

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.810
all the kinds of things.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.600
So we need the shipping
records, the shipping companies,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.990
like the Royal African Company,
East India Company, all those.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:00.080
We need those records found.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.670
We need to find out where
they were trading to.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.610
I mean, I myself was fascinated
as to which shipping companies

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.460
would pick up from which
African ports along the West

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:17.790
African coasts, where'd they'd
bring them to England sometimes

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.280
or straight to the Caribbean.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.420
Now, in England, we had what's
called the major ports--

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.430
London, Liverpool, and Bristol.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.300
Then we had the minor
ports, myriads of them,

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.200
tiny little ones in Essex,
all around the coast, even

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.700
Rutherhithe.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.660
And Gravesend was a minor port.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.390
And these were the middle class.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:46.440
One ship-- if we could do
a run down to West Africa,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:52.170
take 300 slaves and move it
to there and sell them there,

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:53.420
we could make quite a killing.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:39:00.670
Now, all of those port
authorities have records.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.640
We need those records.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.890
Everybody needs those records.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.130
And this is what
I'm saying today.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:09.740
That's why I've written
these three books.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.570
And we need the records
of the slave trade

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.290
brought out so that we can
have the Englishmen of today,

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:21.130
Englishwomen of today,
whatever color, I don't care,

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.140
write the story about slavery.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.940
And in writing the
story about slavery,

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:30.790
we have a much better idea
of what has gone on before us

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.490
and what has made us
the way we are today.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.350
I think I'd better leave
it here to give you

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.330
some time to ask questions.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.240
Thank you very much.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:48.990
RICHARD CUMMINS: We do
have time for questions.

00:39:54.854 --> 00:39:55.770
AUDIENCE: Hello, Remi.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.650
Thank you very much.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.630
That was an amazing
speech and talk.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.380
So thank you for
coming to Google.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.580
I have a question.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.350
I'm not sure if you're
aware, on Monday,

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.430
we actually had a doodle
on the home page of Google.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.521
You know about this.

00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:11.270
REMI KAPO: My family
showed it to me, yes.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.450
Equiano.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.330
AUDIENCE: I'm interested to
know what you think about that.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:27.720
And also, I'm interested to
kind of ask you, as an African,

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.625
how did you feel about
seeing this doodle

00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:31.530
on the homepage of Google.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.020
REMI KAPO: Well,
myself, anything

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.480
that produces information
about yesterday

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:44.190
is, to me, to be applauded.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.780
We shouldn't have waited
for Google to do it.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.420
We should have been doing
this in our newspapers.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.080
We should be doing it ourselves
in England a long time ago.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:02.000
It seems that it's taken the
Americans to actually wake us

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.950
up and remind us that--

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.290
I mean, we've only
just remembered about--

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:09.770
somebody wrote-- David
Olusoga and "The Guardian"

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.260
wrote something about
that "Roots" is now

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.640
going to be remade.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.720
Where is England's roots?

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.290
Well, England's roots
has always been here.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.030
The trouble is we've
spent as much time

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.049
as we can avoiding
dealing with it,

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:28.340
while the Americans have
dealt with it, because they've

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.880
got no choice.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.860
Their enslavement was
homemade, and they

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.910
can't get away from it.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.730
Therefore, by
their making it, we

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.630
are quite happy to carry
on re-showing "Roots"

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.070
and re-showing "Roots" without
any white Englishmen or woman

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:51.170
or black Englishman or woman
being able to actually write

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.465
about what we've done.

00:41:53.465 --> 00:41:57.490
And the BBC-- the
BBC of all people--

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:00.305
saying, it's time we
made a film about it.

00:42:00.305 --> 00:42:02.941
The BBC will be shamed
into it in the end.

00:42:02.941 --> 00:42:03.440
Why?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.020
Because they don't know
how to actually recognize

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.440
English history
from English people.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.170
And I think that here--

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.435
Olaudah Equiano is
a classic example.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.590
Why hasn't the BBC
made a production

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.190
about Olaudah
Equiano, a big one?

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:32.240
Because through his life
and through his example,

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.930
there's so much I'm saying
today he said before me.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.480
And I'm glad that Google has
bothered to go and do that,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.430
because it's reminding
Britain all the time that we

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.300
have a responsibility
to this new generation.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.280
And the responsibility we have
towards this new generation

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.362
is to give them all
the information-- more

00:42:56.362 --> 00:42:57.820
information-- and
allow them to get

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.986
their hands on the controls.

00:42:58.986 --> 00:43:01.096
Because we know
that with the hands

00:43:01.096 --> 00:43:02.470
on the controls
of my generation,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.090
it's not going anywhere.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.979
And so, yeah, that's
a good question.

00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:09.270
That really is a good question.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.103
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:16.207 --> 00:43:18.790
AUDIENCE: Where do you think the
future lies for Black History

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:19.290
Month?

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:27.650
REMI KAPO: Well,
in effect, if we

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.740
follow its natural progression,
Black History Month will

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.430
eventually cease to
exist, because we'll

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.610
see more of our history as--

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:42.390
because our histories
didn't happen separately.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:47.970
When you think in terms
of slave trade, by the way

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.960
we [AUDIO OUT] today,
the slave trade,

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.160
where there was black slaves,
and there was white people,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.080
but there's no
relationship between.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.770
It's that relationship
we need to find.

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.470
That relationship is
where history takes place.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.660
That relationship
is also where we

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:11.080
need to remind people that
this history, as we call it,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.500
is not history.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.420
It's one way of
telling something.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.580
Now, the history I
learned at school

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:25.495
was white history, mainly
monarchical, lords and ladies,

00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:29.150
the establishment,
the big companies.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.430
And I remember the
first history book

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:39.280
I read, I think by Trevelyan, in
'57, had a paragraph that big.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.340
This was the whole slave
trade-- this 400-year period

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:46.780
of something that actually
bolstered Britain into a major

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.430
trading nation--

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:54.630
slavery-- was a few
lines, and they had

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.660
elicited, what, 10,000 slaves.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.760
So I was trying to work out--

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.920
that young mind of mine
was trying to work out,

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.750
10,000 slaves every 400 years.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.500
That's not very many.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:11.290
And as the years went on, the
numbers grew and grew and grew.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:17.300
Now, unless we unify
history, we will

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.630
have to keep Black History
Month to keep reminding people

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.780
that black history does exist
along with white history.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.950
But we shouldn't need that.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.970
We need our history
book re-written clearly.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:34.010
And so we will celebrate
history together.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:40.100
We might have a white
history day or black history

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.150
day, something like that.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.120
I think Black History
Month is important.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.130
And I think one has to
praise companies like Google

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.720
for even bothering to have it.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.470
But I think I understand
why they have it,

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.160
because they see all
the people they employ

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:04.610
and the diversity of the
community they employ

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:10.330
to be such that they
have a responsibility

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.620
to their own staff.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.690
Well, I think we have a
responsibility to Britain.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.690
And I think we have a
responsibility to Britain,

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.870
and that's why when this
government, whichever

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.220
government it is, when they've
finished all their arguing

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.450
over Brexit and
everything else, and they

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.890
begin to realize that
there's also pressing issues

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.960
within the nation that
needs to be changed.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:35.990
You can't have the same old
class system that we've had,

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.660
which keeps things going
along the same old ways

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.330
that we've had up till now.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.670
And that's why
Black History Month

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:44.710
is something we should
be looking to get

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.490
rid of over a period of time.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.540
Absolutely.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.960
That's where its direction lies.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.950
AUDIENCE: Question
about history.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:03.100
So Britain had colonies all
across the world from Australia

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.270
to India to Egypt to whatnot.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:12.200
So why did this happen only
from West Africa to America?

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.781
There could have been
slaves from, say, India.

00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:15.780
It was a populous place.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.730
They could have brought them
from there or from Egypt.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.670
Is it forgotten history?

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.660
Or nothing happened that
way, or why was it this way?

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.480
REMI KAPO: I think it's a lot
to do with where you were.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:41.276
In India, the whole concept
of colonial India was itself--

00:47:41.276 --> 00:47:43.345
they called in a
jewel in the crown.

00:47:43.345 --> 00:47:47.770
It has everything England
needed in position, in situ.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:51.047
So the Indians, when
slaves [AUDIO OUT],,

00:47:51.047 --> 00:47:52.880
they didn't need to
take them anywhere else.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.254
They could enslave
them in India,

00:47:54.254 --> 00:47:55.700
which is exactly what happened.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:48:00.020
The Lodge, as we
called it, was not

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:07.010
a benign, nice kind of club.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:08.467
It was a brutal club.

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:09.050
It really was.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.810
I mean, the Indians tried to
get rid of the English twice.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:15.940
There were two wars of
independence, not one.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.690
And so, in a sense,
the Indians saw that,

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.934
and they also
realized that England

00:48:22.934 --> 00:48:24.350
didn't need to
take them anywhere,

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.558
because they could enslave
them there, get everything

00:48:26.558 --> 00:48:27.230
from there.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.700
And the East India Company
was a classic example

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.810
and headed by people
like Lord Curzon, who

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.660
was a great colonist.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.770
They had absolutely
everything in place.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.490
Now, when it came
to West Africa,

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.910
they were talking about
what we needed to develop.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:50.180
Why couldn't you just develop
the plantations in West Africa?

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.550
Well, it was a brutal
land, wasn't it?

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:59.940
I mean, they had diseases
they've never even heard of.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.390
The West Africa, for instance,
was called the White Man's

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.820
Grave because of
all the diseases

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.200
that existed along there.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.090
So taking them away from there
to somewhere which is far more

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:17.990
salubrious, which was far
less dangerous and far more

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.260
controllable, was far
better for the English.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.290
Remember, it wasn't the
majority of Englishmen involved.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.700
You're talking about a
small elite in England

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:33.860
who owned the shipping
companies, who

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.380
owned the plantations.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.440
And what they were doing was
developing their plantations

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.260
with the sugar, they'd sell
it over here and sell it

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.780
around the world, make the
money, build their estates,

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:55.730
build the exchanges,
and basically build

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.400
London, Bristol, and
Liverpool, from which

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.440
everything else sprang from.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:07.592
Now, having done that,
they did not need--

00:50:07.592 --> 00:50:10.640
remember, they also had a
pressure of the working class

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.490
here.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.990
And they were
keeping them at work

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:17.430
enslaved in the mill towns.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.340
It was an enslaved
working class in England.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:27.150
And so I understand
the establishment

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:29.880
in this country, why they don't
want to deal with the issue,

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.120
because it's a big issue.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.330
It's a much bigger
issue than race

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.510
when it comes to class-- a much,
much bigger issue than race.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.340
And it's also a
very dangerous one.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.240
I myself try to avoid it.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:49.380
I touch on it in my
books, but I think

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.990
I need to sit down
with other people

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.720
to work it through as to
how it can be portrayed,

00:50:54.720 --> 00:51:03.750
because the controlling minority
will never have the greatest

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.620
interests of the
majority at heart.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:16.540
And saying that, they've never
had the controlling interests

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.470
to better them in a sense.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:24.850
Hence, charitable
companies came in.

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.650
They were the ones who
did the charitable works.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.020
And the government
itself and the state

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.690
itself avoided all that.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:39.070
I think it was
understandable why you never

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.200
need to move anybody
away from India,

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.010
you never needed to
move anybody to Africa.

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:45.510
Africa is far too
difficult. I mean,

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:47.140
have you seen the
size of Africa?

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.970
It takes in--

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:53.475
Russia, India, China, a
number of other nations,

00:51:53.475 --> 00:51:55.640
all on one continent.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.270
It's a huge continent,
and that was far too big.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.340
But it's easier to take
them away from there

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.540
and develop in small
islands over there.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.760
And what has it left?

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.290
It's left a rift between black
people of the same race who,

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.220
to the extent, treat
each other badly

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.455
because one was born
in the Caribbean

00:52:18.455 --> 00:52:20.340
and one was born in Africa.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.610
And yet they're the same race.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.160
And that's something we
still have to deal with.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.790
That's an issue I find
really tears at me.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:35.240
Because when I met a West
Indian when I was young--

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.410
they don't do it so much
now, but we were young--

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.670
oh, you sold us.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:39.894
Oh, my God.

00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:40.710
Jesus Christ.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.090
I don't have any money.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.280
I mean, I don't have anything.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:47.640
But the fact of the matter
is that that was very, very

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.810
uppermost in their minds.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.570
Almost like somebody
said, they sold you.

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:52.200
Look at that.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.240
They sold you.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.260
That is an issue that
is also still with us.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.230
So all the issues I'm talking
about are still here with us.

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:05.360
They're issues we
have to deal with.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.230
And I try to deal
with that in here,

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.790
in this "Torrents of Fire."

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.530
I try to deal with the issues of
the difference between the West

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.180
Indians and the Africans.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.806
There's no difference.

00:53:17.806 --> 00:53:19.140
They are ours.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.530
So when we start talking
about reparations--

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:23.194
and people do.

00:53:23.194 --> 00:53:24.360
They talk about reparations.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.310
And the first one they
say, Britain must pay.

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:29.480
Why only Britain?

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.910
If we're looking at
reparations sensibly,

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:36.760
we'd be looking at every nation
in Europe that took part.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.180
We'd look at the
establishment of every nation

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.075
in West Africa that was
involved as well, as well

00:53:42.075 --> 00:53:48.490
as the Americas, and the Spanish
colonies in South America,

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.180
so on and so forth.

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.139
Now, if you look at
reparations that way,

00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:54.180
you're talking about a
very small amount of money

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.070
to actually reparate the
Caribbean islands as nation

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.710
states.

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:02.150
And that's what
needs to be done,

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:06.500
but you cannot go for
Britain and leave that side

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.470
the Africans.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.095
Oh, well, because
they've got problems.

00:54:09.095 --> 00:54:09.595
No, no, no.

00:54:09.595 --> 00:54:12.740
The fact of the matter is
that there are Africans today

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.280
who we have landed gentry today
whose estates are built up

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.410
on it.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:25.320
We have whole areas
of our commerce today

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.420
that was started from slavery.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.940
But we've got the
same in Africa.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.460
And Africa needs to be
involved in that as well.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.360
In other words, if you're
dealing with these issues,

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.590
include everybody.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.600
Don't leave anybody out.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.460
Because we have
serious things to deal

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:48.060
with when it comes to
the emotional differences

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.730
between Africans and
the West Indians.

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.614
There's no difference
between West Indians.

00:54:52.614 --> 00:54:54.030
Every West Indian
I meet, I always

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:58.420
call them Yoruba, even
Sydney back there.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.780
He says, I'm Nubian.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.470
No, you're not.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.090
You're Yoruba.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.350
You're one of ours.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.580
And the fact of the matter
is I'm very proud of that.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.040
I really am proud of
that, because I recognize

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.610
all our brothers and sisters
in the Caribbean should

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.520
have rights to go to
any place in Africa.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.290
If they don't know
where they're from,

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:17.678
they have a right
to go anywhere.

00:55:19.737 --> 00:55:21.570
RICHARD CUMMINS: Time
for one more question.

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:22.153
REMI KAPO: OK.

00:55:25.214 --> 00:55:27.630
AUDIENCE: There was a number
of articles in "The Guardian"

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:31.130
and in "New Statesman"
as well about removing

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.830
the historical statues
in Britain of people

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:37.070
who were involved in
slavery, like Cecil Rhodes,

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:40.930
but also, which was a
bit surprising to me,

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:44.690
Nelson who turns out
was a big defender

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.720
of slavery in the parliament.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.969
What's your opinion about that?

00:55:49.969 --> 00:55:51.510
REMI KAPO: My opinion
is very simple.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.060
It's this.

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.960
Brushing away history
is difficult. Unwriting

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.890
a book is difficult. So
say a book was written,

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.417
like "Mein Kampf" was written.

00:56:04.417 --> 00:56:05.500
Now, should we destroy it?

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.310
It should never
have been written.

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:07.750
It should never
be in the library.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:08.867
No, it's been written.

00:56:08.867 --> 00:56:09.700
It's in the library.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.890
We should leave it there.

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.220
If Nelson was put there,
I haven't got a problem

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220
with Nelson being there.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.010
But I think, at the same time,
at the foot of Nelson's column

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:22.620
should be all the
other feelings he had,

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.070
all the other
things he felt like,

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:30.600
like some of the great
columnists who are supposed

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.819
to have been so wonderful and
done amazing things for India,

00:56:34.819 --> 00:56:35.610
so on and so forth.

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:38.010
But we should also have
at the foot of them,

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:41.650
at the same time, a plaque that
says all the other things so

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.770
that that satisfies both
sides of the feelings

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.300
towards that individual.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.120
RICHARD CUMMINS: A very
quick last question.

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.110
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:55.229
On the question of technology--

00:56:55.229 --> 00:56:56.145
REMI KAPO: Technology.

00:56:56.145 --> 00:56:59.060
AUDIENCE: Technology, yes,
and scientific developments

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.610
and how we may access those--

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:05.840
I'm thinking both in terms of
digitization and the ability

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:13.250
to search digitized records
and also DNA and the way

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:18.560
that we can now map through
our DNA our origins.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:25.430
And perhaps you could just talk
about how these sorts of issues

00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:28.190
affected not only our
own research for this,

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:32.360
but how this could
have an impact

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.390
for future generations
of researchers

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.280
on the subject of slavery?

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.310
REMI KAPO: Yes.

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.630
Well, that's a good question.

00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:41.270
They're all good
questions actually,

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:49.280
but part of the issue of
not knowing is now to know.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:55.130
So part of the thing of
the West Indian community,

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.980
say, in England, they
should always have a right.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.560
All West Indian people
of West Indian background

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.430
should all have a fundamental
right for their DNA

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.990
to be assessed if they
wish and to find out

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:13.600
precisely where they're from.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.345
Because knowing-- I
know my background,

00:58:16.345 --> 00:58:19.285
and I know my Europe ancestors--

00:58:19.285 --> 00:58:22.390
800, 900 years, we can
almost name everybody.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.570
But that's because Yorubas were
very much an isolated people

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:29.070
in that sense and were
also conquerors by the way.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:33.400
They were just as
colonized like the British.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:34.480
Most people were.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.050
And most of us all
had slaves as well.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:39.036
But the thing is--

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.310
that's just one aspect
of it, for people

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.110
to know where they're from.

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:50.407
So since our nation was one
who moved themselves there,

00:58:50.407 --> 00:58:52.240
there, and there, they
should have a right--

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.240
almost like state funds
should be paid for that.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:03.920
Because of digitization, we are
able to access a whole amount

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.110
of other information.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.180
We've got universities,
haven't we?

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.220
We have researchers.

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.560
We have bundles of
researchers and universities

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:19.550
who could be put to
use actually accessing

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:25.130
the records for us and
for the next generation

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:30.050
about the whole issue of
slavery and what part it played

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:37.880
and where the records,
what part they played,

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.490
and what they mean.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.650
Now we've got--

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.060
I don't know how
many researchers

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.210
we have in universities around
Britain and how many of them

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.370
aren't being put to use.

00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:54.480
Now, if they bother to go to
do all their PhDs and DPhils

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.950
and master's and
all that, surely we

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.130
should also be using
those same people

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:07.634
to actually access records
and for those records

01:00:07.634 --> 01:00:08.300
to be published.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.300
Now, one of the
ones that we've got

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.175
was the UCL ones, which
came from the treasury.

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:16.550
How many other departments of
government-- now, remember,

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.880
England is a very
secretive nation.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.170
We got records dating back
to everywhere and every time.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:30.140
Why don't we release the records
of the various government

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.800
departments dating
back to whenever so

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.160
that we can find out and use--

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.914
since we go to
these universities--

01:00:38.914 --> 01:00:40.580
why don't we use some
of our researchers

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:41.570
to do something useful?

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.280
RICHARD CUMMINS: Thank
you very much, Remi Kapo.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.240
REMI KAPO: Thank
you very, very much.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:48.840
Thank you.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.590
