MALE SPEAKER: Carolyn
VanEseltine, our guest today,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.040
has been in video games
since roughly the start

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.270
of the current century.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.240
She got hooked on
designing them,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.420
and then on observing
what kinds of games

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.730
other people are making
and connecting those,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.270
and also what kinds of games
people haven't been making

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.450
and are just thinking of now.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.175
So Carolyn VanEseltine.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:35.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.540
CAROLYN VANESELTINE:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.110
As [INAUDIBLE] introduced
me, I'm Carolyn VanEseltine.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.740
And I'm here today because
everybody can dance.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.660
I know there's this punch line
that normally goes after that,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.100
everybody can dance, but
not everybody should dance.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.820
I don't believe that.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.540
I believe that
everybody can dance

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.450
and that everybody who
wants to dance should dance.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.980
I think they should dance,
I think they should sing,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.740
I think they should
write poetry.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.870
I think they should do whatever
art expression moves them.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.570
I think that art expression
is a natural human right that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.790
transcends every
boundary we have.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.624
The problem is, this hasn't been
true for our youngest art form.

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:23.290
And by our youngest
art form, of course,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm talking about video games.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
Historically, there's
been a very high border

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.470
to being part of video games,
because historically, in order

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.300
to make video games, you
need to be a programmer,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.220
you need to know
somebody who can program

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.160
and who's willing
to work with you,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.280
or you need to have the
money to hire a programmer.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.380
For this reason, the people
who've been making video games

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580
are extremely different than
the people who have been singing

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.180
or writing poetry or dancing.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.430
I have a quick
question before I fully

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.910
get into this,
which is, I'd like

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.210
to know how many people
here are programmers.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.920
Great.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.790
OK.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.540
Thank you so much.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.889
Just didn't want to
make any assumptions.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.820
Now there's a
terminology thing I

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.650
should hit before I keep going.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.980
There is a difference of
opinion about the difference

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.380
between coding and programming.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.820
So I just want to
admit I'm going

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.520
to use those synonymously
for the most part.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.530
When I talk about someone who
is a no-programmer, what I mean

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.630
is someone who is not fluent
in any scripting language,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.390
or-- I mean, someone who is
not fluent in any programming

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.860
language, or I mean someone
who identified themselves

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.250
to me as not being a programmer,
because a lot of this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.458
is about self-identification.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.340
So I want to take a
step back and tell you

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.080
a little bit about my history
with video games, which

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.770
starts in 1980, when I
was born into a house

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.800
with a computer, which
was true of fewer than 1%

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.530
of American households
at that time.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.950
When I was five years old, my
dad, because he is awesome,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.100
introduced me to
Colossal Cave Adventure.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.859
I thought that this was the
best thing I had ever seen.

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.900
I could tell the computer
things and the computer

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.510
would do things.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.160
It was fantastic.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.320
He printed out the
source code in Fortran

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.290
on our old dot matrix printer.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.410
It was about this big,
from the perspective

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.270
of someone about this tall.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.880
And I would carry
it to day care.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.320
I wanted to understand it.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.100
I wanted to know
what was going on.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.190
Fourth grade.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.000
My fourth grade elementary
had a school computer lab.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.840
I met Logo there.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.670
Logo go with the turtle.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.650
The turtle is awesome.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.470
You told it what
you wanted to do,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.310
and it would just
do it on the spot,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.420
and you could make
procedures and you could link

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.510
all these commands together.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.530
In fifth grade, I had decided
I wanted to make video games.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.230
I had this idea it was like a
mashup of Infocom's Wishbringer

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.580
and Colossal Cave Adventure
and Jurassic Park.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.130
It had dinosaurs.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.790
It was going to be great.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.770
And I would map it all
out on graph paper,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.480
and I would write all the
text descriptions down.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.150
By eighth grade I
knew a little Basic.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.787
I knew a little Pascal.

00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:18.745
At one point I borrowed
a book from the library

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:22.660
that had an explanation of
Conway's Game of Life in basic.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.300
So I typed it into
the computer, and it

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.220
was a really bad implementation
of Conway's Game of Life.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.530
So every time the cells
hit the edge of the board,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.530
they would break.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.530
My parents saw what I was
doing, and one of them

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.630
showed me one way
to make it better,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.770
and the other showed me the
other way to make it better.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.790
Of, you know, the
millions of ways you could

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.040
have made that program better.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.650
It was a pretty
bad implementation.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.500
But the point I'm
trying to make here

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.570
is that I wanted video games.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.600
I wanted this.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.590
I wanted to be part of this.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.430
I had wanted it my entire life.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.659
And I had every advantage.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.700
There was a computer in
my house when I was born.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.080
I have never lived in a
house without a computer.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.990
Both my parents
were programmers.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.920
There was a computer
lab at my school

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.090
I had basic programming concepts
from about five years old.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.090
So I went to college and I
majored in creative writing.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.270
And I never took a single
computer science course

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.600
because one of my
friends had told me

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.560
that the Comp Sci professor
who taught Comp Sci

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.090
101 deliberately washed people
out who didn't want to major.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.250
I didn't want to major.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.800
Programming was great, but
it was a means to an end.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.870
And there weren't any
game programming classes.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.220
I didn't know how to take
my little bit of Basic,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.890
my little bit of Pascal--
even if it had been expanded,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.160
I didn't know how to take
that and make something

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.582
with graphics.

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:52.040
I didn't know how
to make something

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.450
that you could put on a
disc in a box on a shelf,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.110
and then someone
could go to the store

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.690
and buy it and put
it in their console.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.460
Those were the people
who made real games.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.470
It wasn't a meaningful
aspiration for me

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.474
and so I faded out of games.

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.140
I'm standing here in
front of you today,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.770
and I did say I was a
professional game developer.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.600
So you can tell that at some
point I got back on the horse.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.860
But I didn't do it by
learning to program.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.910
I came in the back door.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.190
There was a company
called Simmtronics Games.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.470
And they started somewhere
in '94, 95, I think.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.179
And I apologize if I
just got that wrong.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.345
But the pertinent part is
that what they were making

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:39.580
was a pay for play mud.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.190
And it was available
on America Online.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.190
And I wound up doing volunteer
customer support for them

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.330
in exchange for my pay for
play being play instead of pay.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.090
So I got through the door there.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.540
Eventually they hired me on.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.830
When they hired me, it
was to run in-game events,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.730
it was to write
documentation, and it was

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.700
to do more customer support.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.930
At that point, I was
in the games industry.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.360
And I had no idea how
to make my own game.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.720
I knew how to support
someone else's.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.140
But games were for people
who knew how to program.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.780
They were for people
who could put that disc

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.080
in that box on that shelf.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.880
I didn't know how to
do any of that, which

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.230
meant they weren't for me.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.560
So obviously, at some
point, I got over this.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.560
I got over this because of
a system called Inform 7.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.980
Inform 7 made it possible for
me to release my first game.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.130
One Eye Open is a
psychic horror game.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.380
It was a collaboration between
me and my friend Caelyn Sandel,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.300
and it came out in 2010.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.120
The reason I was able to
create and release a game

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.920
is because of a system
called Inform 7.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.620
Inform 7 looks like that.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.080
It does not look like
a programming language.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.180
To me, with my limited
background and experience,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.700
when I saw something
like this, when

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.519
I saw something that
looked like English,

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.810
I was a creative writing major.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.830
English was comfortable.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.740
I knew how to work with it.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.630
I had the confidence.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.180
I said yes, I can make
something that looks like that.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.190
Inform 7 was created
by Graham Nelson.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.590
Graham Nelson was looking
specifically at non-programmers

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.700
and trying to make a system that
was more comfortable for them.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.419
It has an integrated
development environment.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.409
It is actually a transpiler.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.409
It does not go from
Inform 7 to working game.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.566
It goes from Inform 7 to
Inform 6 to working game.

00:08:42.566 --> 00:08:43.940
What you're looking
at right here

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.900
is a relatively
common in fiction

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.910
snapshot of a game
called Cloak of Darkness.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.290
It's a very bad game.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.980
But the point of
Cloak of Darkness

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.890
is to show how various
systems handle the creation

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.720
of various game elements.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.230
This is what Cloak
of Darkness-- well,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.250
this chunk of Cloak of
Darkness-- looks like in Inform

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.460
6.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.690
If you know how to program,
this is not scary looking.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.760
If you don't, computer
code is intimidating.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.320
Computer code is intimidating
because the computer

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.570
doesn't think like a person.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.620
The point of learning
to program is

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.010
learning to think like
the computer operates.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.110
That's the whole point
of computer science.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.370
If you don't know how to think
like the computer operates,

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.705
then you need some kind bridge.

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:38.860
You need something
that makes it easier

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.990
for the way you think to
correspond with the way

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.810
that the computer operates.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:48.380
And that's what
Inform 7 was for me.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.414
When I originally
launched my game,

00:09:50.414 --> 00:09:51.830
I was working at
Harmonix by then.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.310
I'm not going to go
into the details of how

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.660
I got there, but assume it
was kind of like how I got

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.560
into games in the first place.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.610
When I launched my game, I
was really excited about it.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.640
I told a bunch of people at
Harmonix, hey, I made a game.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.240
And one of the engineers
asked to see my source code.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.330
I would be happy to
show you my source code.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.370
I sent over my source code.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.210
Inform 7 actually tells you your
word count instead of your line

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.332
count, so I knew that it was
upwards of 100,000 words.

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:18.290
I had no idea what that
meant in lines of code.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:19.660
I still don't.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.499
But I sent it over, and
he sent it back and said,

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.290
you accidentally sent
me your design notes.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.750
I wanted to see the source code.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.070
But that was my source code.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.380
I didn't have anything
else to show him.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.060
He had looked at it and
seen it as something

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.880
that a non-programmer
could do, something

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.427
that a non-programmer
could understand.

00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:43.260
Inform 7-- don't get
me wrong-- can actually

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.480
do some extraordinarily
complicated things.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.680
But Inform 7 was
released in 2006.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.890
In the year 2006, use of Inform
6 it dropped like a rock.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.210
An by the time you
get to 2012, Inform 6

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.820
alone was hardly being
used anymore at all

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.810
because the people who were
making interactive fiction

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.760
were people who were coming
from a programming background,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.480
but also from a
writing background.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.830
They had the same
experience I did.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.560
Also, Inform 7 has an integrated
development environment,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.370
which makes everything
so much better.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.620
Here's the problem
with Inform 7.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.730
Inform 7 is a
scripting language.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.870
It has a very specific syntax.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.560
The syntax is actually
as specific as the syntax

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.260
for Inform 6, which means that
even though it looked intuitive

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.670
and it was easy
to read, oh, man,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.261
you can get the most amazing
compiler errors out of it.

00:11:38.261 --> 00:11:40.760
And because it's trying very
much to help you and figure out

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.590
what you meant to do,
it's not as simple

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.070
as, I think there might
be a semicolon missing.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.260
It's kind of amazing, actually.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.910
I love Inform 7.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.414
I don't claim that
it's for everybody.

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:54.830
I'm going to digress
for a second,

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.460
because I do come, as
a hobbyist, very much

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.910
from an interactive
fiction background.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.500
Inform 7 is used to
make parser games.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.510
Parser games tend
to look like that

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.960
when someone who doesn't
know how to play parser games

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.770
plays a parser game.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.530
They try commands that don't
work because they don't

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.184
understand the limits,
because they haven't been

00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:18.350
taught to play parser games.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.830
There's an actual
skill involved here.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.413
You need to know
that you need to make

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:25.140
these noun-verb or
verb-noun combinations.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.240
And you need to understand
that it's just not

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.360
understanding English.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.010
There are a lot of people who
play and love parser games.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.150
There are a lot of people who
get frustrated by the fact

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.190
that the prompt is
giving them this illusion

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.970
of infinite choice,
but in reality they

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.440
have very limited choices
available to them.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.370
But there are systems
that are easier than this.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.990
This is the other major
branch of interactive fiction.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.460
It's called choice-based
interactive fiction,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.820
and it actually comes from
the tradition of game books

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.040
and from choose
your own adventures.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.920
Instead of giving you an
illusion of infinite choice,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.140
it shows you exactly what
you can do in that room.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.870
And the actuality
is, all you can do in

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.370
that room is walk around.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.800
That makes it so
much less frustrating

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.480
to people who don't
have the skill

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.110
to interact with that program,
who don't have the experience.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.980
So bringing it back
to game engines.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.660
What's needed is
a game engine that

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.590
is just as accessible
as this, something

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.140
that takes that experience
of, I don't know what to type,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:39.300
and turns it into, I know what
I can type, or not even type.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.950
This is Construct 2.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.860
And Construct 2 is a
visual scripting engine

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.200
for making graphical games.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.590
It is something that
presents everything in menus.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.860
It presents everything
with drag and drop.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.990
What you're seeing
right here is actually

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.530
a script in the making.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.090
If you click the little
heart image, which

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.400
is the A frame sprite with
the left mouse button,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.920
it will rotate 90 degrees.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.290
And it's currently
offering me the chance

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.690
to add another action
to this script.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.030
This is not a
complicated script.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.670
But once you start adding them
together and chaining them,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.510
just like a small program can
become something dramatically

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.560
larger, a small script can join
with others to become a game.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.710
Just because it works
with visual scripting

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.790
does not mean that a program is
necessarily going to be simple.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.270
All it's doing is making
the syntax accessible.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.060
Here you can see that
there are a lot of things

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.167
you can do from the system
object, many of which

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:43.750
are extremely
important, many of which

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.470
require mastering the engine
apart from the scripting side.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.190
There are actually a number
of engines in this style.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.950
They are engines that
are based around the idea

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.850
that it will be
easier for people

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.050
to code if they don't
have to fight with syntax.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:07.290
This is an image from the game
Airscape: The Fall of Gravity.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.660
Airscape was greenlighted
through Steam.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.790
It received multiple
awards, including

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.840
an award on its physics
engine specifically.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.810
It was created entirely
in Construct 2.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.610
It is a fiendishly
difficult puzzle platformer.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.550
And the developer selected
this system specifically

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.300
because he didn't
have experience making

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.350
games with programming yet.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.790
He needed something that was
accessible to where he was

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.070
at the time he was starting.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:43.060
There are a number of other
game engines in this same vein.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:49.920
Clickteam Fusion, GameMaker:
Studio, GameSalad, and Stencil.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.320
The last one is Stencil.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.175
And there are others, but
those are some major ones.

00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:56.300
I'm not going to go through
and detail all of them,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.580
because what I actually want
to do is move to show you

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.170
a completely different
kind of game engine.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.910
This is Twine.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.630
Twine is designed
specifically for making

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.820
choice-based interactive
fiction games.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.680
What you're seeing here
is the design interface.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.760
And since Twine games are played
as this series of web pages,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.340
essentially, you can see with
a map the web page forming.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.837
This is actually the exact
same Cloak of Darkness section

00:16:26.837 --> 00:16:28.420
that you saw before,
although I didn't

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.020
implement the rest of it.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.740
Here's the thing about Twine.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.310
I didn't try to
teach you Inform 7.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.870
I didn't try to teach
you Construct 2.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.212
Those take half
an hour, at least,

00:16:40.212 --> 00:16:41.670
to teach somebody,
if what you want

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.997
is for them to go
from zero to game.

00:16:43.997 --> 00:16:46.330
And that's regardless of
whether they have a programming

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.724
background or not.

00:16:47.724 --> 00:16:49.390
Let's face it, a
language is a language.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.470
There's syntax to learn.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.900
There's a system to learn.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.330
I can teach you to
Twine in 30 seconds.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.310
I have done this repeatedly.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.030
You can make a basic Twine
game with the information

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.940
you get in 30 seconds, which
is, start at the start.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.960
Type whatever you want
into that passage.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.380
Whenever you want to make
a link to a new passage,

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.020
put in double brackets.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.310
It will open up a
new passage for you.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.640
Keep going until you are done.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.225
Hit Build.

00:17:18.225 --> 00:17:19.260
Build story.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.660
You now have a
playable web page.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.369
You can put it anywhere you want
and people can play your game.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.880
It is that simple.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.839
And that is why
people are flocking

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.430
to Twine right now, because
there is no game engine more

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.120
accessible.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.260
Twine is free.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.910
It is also open source.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.970
And it supports a lot more
than simple hyperlink.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.320
It has full support
for variables,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.630
for conditional logic,
for extensions with images

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.930
and CSS and video and sound.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.710
And it also extends
with JavaScript.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.690
But for that basic game,
the first experience

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.130
of, I made a thing,
there it is, it's

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.540
amazing for someone
who never thought

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.190
they could make a game before.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.760
Here's a different engine.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.130
Choice of Games.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.590
Choice of Games is also an
interactive fiction engine.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.500
But it's an interactive
fiction engine

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.060
that is aimed at a
very specific audience.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.810
And it's aimed at a
very specific audience

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.900
because it's used to create
a very specific kind of game.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.400
Choice script is
used specifically

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.760
to make novel-length
interactive fiction.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.970
Choice of Games is
a commercial company

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.840
that is making its
money on selling

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.260
novel-length
interactive fiction.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.310
They are not aiming
at programmers.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.720
They're aiming at
writers, specifically

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.450
writers who never intended
to make this kind of system.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.430
It's as simple as it
can be because they

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.740
need it to be accessible
to this specific audience.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.990
There isn't actually an
ID for Choice of Games,

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.010
for Choice of Games
choice script.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:54.460
The system you use actually has
extraordinarily simple syntax,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.020
and you just write it
in manuscript form.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.320
When you're done, what
you get looks like this.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.230
This is actually optimized
for people playing

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.540
on their iPads or other
touchscreen devices,

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.580
but you can play on
a computer as well.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.980
And again, it's very
intuitive to play.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.450
Select your option,
click Next, move on.

00:19:16.812 --> 00:19:18.270
These are three
examples of engines

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:22.080
that are also aimed at creating
very specific kinds of games.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.450
Ren'Py is specifically
for visual novels.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.420
RPG Maker is
specifically for RPGs.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.070
Adventure Game Studio
is specifically

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.980
for click and point adventures.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.646
Again, I'm not going to walk you
through the full details of all

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:35.930
of these.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:41.440
All of these engines
are aimed, or had

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.120
as a primary audience,
people who don't know how

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.540
to program in mind.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.090
This one was aimed programmers.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.000
Unity is a big deal.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.870
They currently have 45% of the
market share for game engines

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.760
used in commercial games.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.930
47% of developers are using it.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.540
4.5 million developers
are registered.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.860
And they have 600
million gamers,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.930
at a minimum, playing
projects created with Unity.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:17.080
Unity uses C# and
JavaScript as its languages.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.490
This is not something
that's accessible to people

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.910
who don't know how to
program, except that a company

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.560
saw the void.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.650
The people who make playMaker
put a visual scripting system

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.740
on top of Unity.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.380
It is in use at actually
some rather large studios.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.560
Most famously, Blizzard used
the visual scripting system

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.760
playMaker when it was
making Hearthstone.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.000
Hearthstone is a digital
collectible card game,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.450
and the income is estimated
at about $20 million a month.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.000
It's a very
successful card game.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.720
The reason why
they used playMaker

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.340
was so that, with their
15-person team that

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.240
was working on it,
the art team was

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.315
capable of building
things in the engine

00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:00.190
without needing to pull
a programmer off what

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.470
they were doing at the time.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.120
Specifically, playMaker
is a visual state editor,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.380
and it's also a runtime library.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.030
But the net effect is of a
visual scripting system that

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.450
was built directly into Unity.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.470
In addition to large
studios using it

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.940
for specialized projects, it
is possible to make a full game

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.560
with playMaker.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.360
Jenna Hoffstein is the founder
of Little Worlds Interactive.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.750
Her launch product was
The Counting Kingdom,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.320
which is a tower defense game
that is aimed at teaching kids

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.710
arithmetic.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:41.752
She made it completely in Unity
with the support of playMaker.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.290
Now I've been talking
about non-programmers.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:49.490
I've been talking
about programmers.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.490
When it comes to
game development,

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.890
do programmers have an
advantage over non-programmers?

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.950
It depends on what
you mean by advantage.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.690
A lot of people ask
if non-programmers

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.330
can use these tools to
compete with programmers,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.140
but that depends so much on
what you mean by compete.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.940
When I talk about
game developers,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.230
I'm not just talking
about people who want

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.890
to make games commercially.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.040
I'm going to show you
one of my favorite quotes

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.220
about game development.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.570
It's from Zoe Quinn.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.450
"How to win at game jams: Go.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:22.150
Make a thing.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.810
It doesn't have to
be good or finished.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.110
OK, cool, you won."

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:31.130
This is an attitude I
can get behind 100%.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.040
Games are not intended to be
polished commercial games.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.640
This is kind of like
a 48-hour hackathon.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.430
You want to get from zero
to game, and at the end

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.930
you have the joy
of having done it.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.910
And possibly you polish
and refine it and continue.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.480
But the concept of
compete isn't meaningful

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.300
if you look at game
development as a whole.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.466
It's only meaningful if you
look at game development

00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:54.720
in a commercial market.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.890
I made this game once.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.080
It was specifically
for one of my friends,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.720
and it was called Coffeeee
with about five E's on the end.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.599
And it was this tiny text
adventure about how awesome

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:07.140
it is when you wake
up in the morning

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.210
and someone else brings
you a cup of coffee.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.050
It couldn't compete with Super
Mario Brothers for the Wii U.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.540
Super Mario Brothers
for the Wii U

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.520
couldn't compete with Coffeeee.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.650
They're in two completely
separate worlds.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.420
They're in two completely
separate universes.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.810
Yes, video games are
a commercial market.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.070
So are novels.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.150
Not everyone wants to
be the next JK Rowling.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.630
Some people just want
to make little games

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.710
that they can show
to their friends,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.860
or just make them for fun, or
just keep them for themselves.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.750
These concepts exist in writing.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.669
People write for fun.

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:44.960
People write for their friends.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.590
People write for themselves.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.690
Postcard Game is the
term given to a game that

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.750
is just for one other person.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.010
Diary Game is the
term given to a game

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.190
that you made just for you.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.230
These things, you might show
them to someone else later,

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.690
but that's not necessarily
why you made it.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.030
This is an art form.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.135
People practice this
art form for themselves.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.360
As I was preparing
for this talk,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.400
I spoke to a number
of game devs,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.700
actually about 35, who
are not programmers.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.980
I asked them, why do
you want to make games?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.950
What's in this for you?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.830
Is it really worth it to you?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.700
I got an amazing
variety of answers back.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.790
And I just want to
read you a few excerpts

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.700
that exemplify themes
that people talked about.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.530
One of them was joy.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.580
Darryl [? Calvo ?]
told me, "For me, games

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.530
are windows on other worlds.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.140
Discovering new things,
ideas, ecosystems.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.190
It's about creating
tiny play spaces

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.150
to create and share wonders."

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.230
People talked about the
unique nature of the medium.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.810
Valentina Christopsomo
told me, "There

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.740
are two reasons I make games.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.720
One is that I love the
idea of creating something

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.190
that people can
interact with and get

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.620
an emotional response back.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.750
Two, I love the
idea that people can

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.200
have such a strong emotional
response, that it's in my power

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.120
to make them feel
it, that people

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.560
resonate with a story in a game
more than any other medium."

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.120
People talked about
self-expression.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.052
That's something
you can't access

00:25:27.052 --> 00:25:29.510
in the world of commercial game
development in the same way

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.676
that you can if you're
sitting down at your computer

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:34.300
and making a game for you.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.730
[INAUDIBLE], "I
showcase an aspect

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.830
of what is important to me,
using themes and elements

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.620
taken from my life.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.550
I want to walk with
whoever ends up playing.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.270
I also want people to finish
the game and have a part of me

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.940
to walk away with."

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.420
People talked about contributing
to the greater body of art.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.210
[INAUDIBLE], "I want to
make video games because I

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.000
like to pretend there's more
to this medium than escapism

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.140
and power fantasies.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.630
I don't like competition.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.140
I don't like capitalism.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.690
I don't like violence.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.070
I can't stand the values
mainstream games usually

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.210
convey.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.330
I like to pretend
I can change that

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.890
with my very limited skills, at
least for the handful of people

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.810
I can reach."

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.010
And here's one
very common theme,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.290
from Talen Lee, "I make games
because people make games.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.380
Little kids make games
on the playground.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.200
We make games when we
walk on tiled floors.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.470
I've basically always,
constantly been making games.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:40.220
And computer games were just
another thing I wanted to do."

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.540
I spoke with 35 game devs.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.650
Of all of those
people, one person

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.560
mentioned money as
a primary motivator.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.990
I spoke with multiple
professional game devs

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.790
who are making their
incomes off the games

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.030
that they were making.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.880
They didn't get into
this for the money.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.870
Singers don't get into
music for the money.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.150
Artists don't start
painting for the money.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.436
Actors don't start out
in theater for the money.

00:27:06.436 --> 00:27:07.810
Of course, it's
nice to get paid.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.976
Everybody likes to get paid.

00:27:08.976 --> 00:27:10.700
Getting paid is great.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.417
But what brought them in
originally was the art form.

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:15.750
They found something in it
that spoke to them, something

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.050
in it that resonated with them.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.848
It's the same way
in game development.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.050
There are 7.3 billion
people approximately,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.610
a very large approximation,
on this planet right now.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.889
Of those people, how
many people like to sing?

00:27:33.889 --> 00:27:35.930
I can bet you it's a lot
more than the people who

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.890
are making their living off it.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.200
I would guess that it's
millions, hundreds of millions,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.150
perhaps literally billions.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.640
All we see, usually, is that
little tip of the iceberg.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.710
But there's this huge
iceberg of people beneath it

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.580
who want to sing, just to sing.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.710
In game development,
historically, there

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:01.500
was this barrier.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.040
You had to know how to program.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.830
You had to know a
programmer or you

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.380
had to pay someone
to program for you.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:12.190
That meant there wasn't much
below that tip of the iceberg.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.310
You saw the professionals.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.000
That was pretty
much what you saw.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.120
To be clear, to be fair, there
were game creation systems

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.070
in the '80s, things like
Pinball Construction Set, things

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.330
like Adventure Creation System,
things like Gary's Kitchen Game

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.154
Maker.

00:28:27.154 --> 00:28:28.320
There were more in the '90s.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.930
RPG Maker originally
showed up then.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:31.915
Divinity for Realms.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.600
But those systems existed.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.630
You had to know
where to find them.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.300
You had to know that
they existed even

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.890
to go looking for them.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.160
And all this time,
it was easiest

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.014
if you knew how to program.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.910
So historically, most examples
of this art form that we have

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:03.910
are the examples that were
created by programmers.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.170
Most of them were
created in studios,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.630
which means by corporations,
or by solo developers working

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.430
on their own in a context
where their games might not

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.300
be seen afterward, even
if they wanted them to be.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.540
This is the youngest
art form we have.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.250
We don't know who
invented singing.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.180
We don't know who
invented acting.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.590
We don't know who
invented painting.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.020
We know who filed the
patent for the very first

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.050
interactive electronic game.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.420
That would be Thomas
T. Goldsmith, Jr.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.156
and Essel Rayman.

00:29:41.156 --> 00:29:42.530
They filed a patent
for something

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:47.240
called the cathode ray tube
amusement device in 1947.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.992
That was 68 years ago.

00:29:48.992 --> 00:29:50.950
And given that it was
analog, we might not even

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.320
count that when we're
talking about digital games.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.500
Pong is commonly cited as the
first video game that we had.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.610
Pong is from the '70s.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.700
This is young.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.500
This is a very young art form.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.860
And right now it is undergoing
this incredible revolution

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.210
where instead of this
tiny group of people

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.440
being able to make video
games, there is a land swell.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.520
Here's what we know
about the people who

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.670
are at the tip of the iceberg.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.100
The IGDA-- that's the
International Game Developers

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.882
Association-- runs
a survey every year.

00:30:31.882 --> 00:30:34.090
And one of the things they
do is collect demographics

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.840
about the people who answer.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.700
Most of these people are in
studios, either large studios

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.550
or small ones, or
are freelancers

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.470
associated with the industry.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.920
Here's what the IGDA said
in 2015 about its members.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.500
The people who responded
were whites, they were male,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.830
they were cisgender, they were
heterosexual, they were young.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:00.550
They were usually married or
in a long term relationship,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.240
but they did not have children.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.630
Most of these people were
in the United States.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:10.490
And 93% have some amount
of higher education.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:15.930
93% of people in the world
do not have higher education.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.010
93% of America does not
have higher education.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.300
94% of the people
who own computers

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:28.180
in their homes, or gaming
systems, or smartphones-- it's

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.720
not 93%.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.690
This is a very specific
group of people.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.450
Right now, the
profile of video games

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.190
is changing because the
profile of the people making

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.411
video games is changing.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.950
We are not just
seeing games now that

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.940
are made by this profile of
people, which means that we're

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.220
not seeing games that
are necessarily aimed

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.310
at this profile of people,
because that is also

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.970
what was happening here.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.245
Because this was the profile
of people making games,

00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:11.620
they were making
games for people

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.240
who looked like themselves.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.620
They were making games
for white men in America.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.800
And they were making games
where the protagonist tended

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.000
to be a white heterosexual
man with American attitudes,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.690
though not necessarily
in America.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.000
So this is a very big
change, for people

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.530
who are not in this
profile to be realizing,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.950
we can make games, too.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:38.700
We can take this
into our own hands.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.770
We are capable of being
part of this art form,

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:48.956
even if we don't know how to
program, even if-- for those

00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:50.330
of you in this
audience who don't

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.900
know how to program-- even if
you don't know how to program.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.412
Game dev is open to you.

00:32:56.412 --> 00:32:56.995
It's changing.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.890
The barriers are coming down,
and this is a moment in history

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.700
that people are going to look
back to and see that an art

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.970
form became available
to the public

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.031
instead of to a
small, specific group.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.972
Now, this is an argument
I've heard before.

00:33:22.972 --> 00:33:24.430
If people want to
make video games,

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.080
they should learn to program.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.710
It doesn't make
sense for people who

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.040
don't know how to program
to be making video games.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.560
There is no merit in
these systems that

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.377
are making it
possible for people

00:33:34.377 --> 00:33:36.460
who don't know how to
program to make video games,

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.210
because the people who
know how to program

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.260
will make better video games.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.950
This is not true.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.560
I have worked in
AAA development.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.570
It does not make you
a better game designer

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.930
to be a better programmer.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:52.120
These are two
separate skill sets.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.750
The one does not
follow the other.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:59.470
It's like having to learn
human anatomy before you're

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.320
allowed to sing.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.990
But what about the
limitations of the tools?

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.801
Well, tool limitations
relate to design.

00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:10.300
If you're trying
to design something

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.120
that runs outside the
limitations of your tools,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.199
then yeah.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.469
It's like having a hammer.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.984
If you have a hammer, and
that's what you've got,

00:34:18.984 --> 00:34:21.360
you can be incredibly
versatile with it.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.915
That hammer can
be a screwdriver.

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:23.949
It can be a lever.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.360
It can be a panini press.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.710
It can be a s'more stick.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.730
There are so many things you
can do with that one hammer.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.460
If you're used to a full
toolbox, having one hammer

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.290
is terrible.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.610
But if that's not
what you're used to,

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.320
if someone gives
you one tool, you

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.929
can do amazing things with it.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.241
Yeah, if you're used to
having the full power of C#,

00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:45.949
or the full power of
C, for that matter--

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:49.400
let's go even lower level-- than
visual scripting is incredibly

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.840
limiting.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.510
But that doesn't
mean that you can't

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.330
make amazing things with it.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.426
Remember Twine?

00:34:57.426 --> 00:34:59.050
I talked about Twine
as the game engine

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.890
that is the fastest to
pick up, the one you

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.070
can learn in 30 seconds.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:08.000
This is a non-extended
version of Twine.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.500
This is what you can
do with variables.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.910
If you can set variables
and you can check variables,

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.470
you can make so
many amazing things

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.540
happen with game development.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.260
Comparing Twine to
Unity, yes, there

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.610
are huge differences
between these two programs.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.840
Twine cannot do 3-D animation.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.780
It doesn't have a built-in
physics engine at all.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.810
And it doesn't, for
example, make a good tool

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.820
to make something like
World of Warcraft in.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:41.040
There are no Twine massively
multiplayer role-playing games.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.230
But Twine runs in your
browser, which Unity does not.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:50.070
Unity can run in your browser.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.190
It requires a plugin.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.600
You have to download the plugin.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.160
You have to get
the plugin to work.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.770
The plugin does
not work on Linux

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.770
or, appropriate to
this audience, Chrome.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.400
You cannot play Unity games
in Chrome in your browser.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.260
So Twine might have its
limitations, but Unity does,

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.760
too.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:12.320
And this is because every
tool has its limitations.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.200
Going back to
1841, 1841 was when

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.060
it became possible to
purchase pre-made oil paint.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.060
Before 1841, if
you were an artist

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.100
and you wanted to
make a painting,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.990
you were probably
grinding your own pigment.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.880
You were probably
mixing it with oil.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.670
And you were probably
stretching your own canvas,

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.490
because let me tell
you, pre-made canvases

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.820
did not exist back then either.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.090
So if you have an
idea for a painting,

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.970
and it's about six
feet by two feet,

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.850
and you happen to have a
six-foot by two-foot canvas,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.190
you're fine.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.750
Your image for the project
fits within your parameters.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.590
But if the idea
for a painting you

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.250
have is six feet by
two feet and the canvas

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:00.430
you have is four by three, if
you know how to stretch canvas

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.970
and you have the supplies,
you're still good.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.320
You can just stretch the
new canvas that you want.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.130
If you don't know how
to stretch canvas,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.240
then you can either
alter your design

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.500
so that it fits within
the materials you have,

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.270
or you can paint on the wall.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.680
The second version
is not recommended.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.610
So that's what programming
is like in this context,

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.940
in the context of this art form.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.630
If you know how to
program, you know

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.770
how to grind your own pigment.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.740
You know how to
mix your own paint.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.440
You know how to stretch
your own canvas.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.600
You can go beyond the built-in
limitations of your tool.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.060
And that's fine.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.230
And that might make
amazing things.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.040
But it doesn't mean
that a game made

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.070
within the limitations
of the tool

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.370
is innately inferior,
because games

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.200
that are designed
with their tools

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.532
in mind, whether you know
how to program or not,

00:37:52.532 --> 00:37:53.990
are going to work
better than games

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.740
that are not designed
with the limitations

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.450
of the tool in mind.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.294
But everyone should
learn to program.

00:38:00.294 --> 00:38:03.882
Programming is awesome, and
I say that with the greatest

00:38:03.882 --> 00:38:06.090
enthusiasm, because one of
the things you should know

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.960
is that, by now, I do, in
fact, know how to program.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.685
I think it's wonderful.

00:38:10.685 --> 00:38:12.610
I've been doing C#
for about a year.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.880
I've been doing C for
about three years.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.500
Programming is so
cool, you guys,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.000
as many of you in this
room doubtlessly agree.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.280
But not everyone should
learn to program.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.380
The people who want to program
should learn to program.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.515
There are no huge
definitive you must do.

00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:36.890
There are things that will
make your life a little easier

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:37.810
in this society.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.980
If you know how to read, that
will make your life easier.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.160
Knowing how to
program-- it's actually

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.540
not a basic societal skill.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.080
And game dev is an art form.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:55.050
Art is a basic part
of human society.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:00.120
Game dev is a valid
end in and of itself.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.340
It doesn't have to be a
gateway to anything else.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.620
If somebody tries game
dev and they get excited,

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.900
and they want to learn to
program, like yours truly,

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.870
that's fantastic.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.090
More power to them.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.255
But if they just want to
make a game, that is OK.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.950
So going back to the 35
game devs who I spoke with,

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:25.000
the 35 game devs who are
not, in fact, programmers,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.910
I asked them this question.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.730
If it were impossible
to make games

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.690
without learning
to program first,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.450
would you still have
chosen to make games?

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.620
Some of them said yes.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.710
More of them said no.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.540
Many of them had already
tried to learn to program.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.540
They had not succeeded.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.160
And it wasn't a lack of effort.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.320
They were up against
huge barriers

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.640
that they had no personal
control over, barriers

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.850
like time, money, energy, the
former education that they were

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:05.520
coming into this with,
access to tools and teachers

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.640
and people who would give
them feedback on their work,

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.670
confidence, social pressure.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:16.000
I want to tell you a story
about social pressure.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.940
This comes from Megan
Hughes, a game maker

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.600
who uses Twine and GameMaker.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.830
Megan Hughes, "I went to an
all girls high school here

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.760
in Durban, South Africa.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.410
We had a male teacher
for computer science.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.630
While he taught us well,
he would make comments

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.440
about the fact that women
should not be programmers.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.950
He'd chuckle to
himself if anyone

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.070
spoke of that sort
of career for women,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.080
and he was generally
patronizing,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.850
even when we might
correct him about code

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.290
he'd put on the board,
as in, he humored us

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.070
throughout our education.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.120
For most of the three
years I had him teach me,

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.530
I thought he only
had a son of whom

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.720
he spoke incredibly fondly.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.410
Somewhere near the
end of the third year

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.690
he accidentally
mentioned his daughter,

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.260
a well-accomplished
specialist daughter.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.420
This attitude,
combined with the fact

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.860
that the male friends I
knew who were into computers

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.590
seem to sell far
ahead of me, having

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.110
dads that encouraged them
and taking apart machines

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.930
and coding from an
early age, whereas I

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.220
was blamed for anything
even slightly off

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.295
on our home computer.

00:41:19.295 --> 00:41:21.170
And we certainly didn't
have the funds for me

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:25.390
to run risks of breaking
anything with code attempts.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.690
I figured I'd already lost
the race before starting.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:35.470
In the end, I pursued my
other love, psychology."

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.610
This is not just about America.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.430
This is about
everybody worldwide

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.940
who might want to
access to this art form.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.150
This is about me, but it's
also about Megan Hughes.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.670
It's about everybody I heard
from who wasn't in the United

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.940
States, and everybody who was,
but who never thought that they

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.080
could ever learn to program.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.780
Some of these
people, the ones who

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.980
thought they would never,
ever learn to program,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.300
are learning to program
because of game dev.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.130
This is especially
common in Twine,

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.210
that super simple language.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.290
And the reason it's
especially common in Twine

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.890
is because Twine
extends with JavaScript.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.000
People working in Twine
see what other people

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.432
have done in JavaScript.

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:16.640
And some of them are getting
curious and some of them

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.560
are getting involved.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.520
This is Kiva Bay.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.370
"I'm 32, and I feel for
the first time in my life

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.190
like I could learn programming.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.270
Maybe not well, but I could
figure it out with some help.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.550
And I think it's because
I've made a Twine game now

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.540
that I feel confident
enough to even try.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.630
Programming always felt
like a secret society hidden

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.180
behind a locked door
I could never find.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.580
Twine showed me a window
to sneak through."

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:46.320
Kiva Bay's first game is
about her personal experience

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.640
of homelessness.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.750
It's called 12 Hours, and it
just went through green light

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.430
on Steam.

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.670
This is not a game
that would exist

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.182
if she had to learn to program.

00:43:01.584 --> 00:43:03.840
But while some
people are inspired

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.550
to learn to program by
their game dev experience,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.766
it's not true for everybody.

00:43:08.766 --> 00:43:11.140
This is Mike Rosen, who works
in Quest and Adventure Game

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.970
Studio.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.540
"I have mild dyscalculia,
which is basically

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.750
like dyslexia but with numbers.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.320
It's nearly impossible for
me to recognize or make

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.880
sense of patterns and
sequences in numbers,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.610
and I'm also pretty bad
with computer logic.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.490
Years ago a friend
tried to teach me

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.950
some basic programming,
and I just could not

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:31.860
get a handle on it at all.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.210
I just assumed making a
game would be something

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:40.190
beyond my abilities until
I found these programs."

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.570
I spoke with 35
non-programming game devs.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.270
They work on over a
dozen different engines,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.530
and between them
they have created

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:52.310
literally hundreds of games.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:56.890
Some of these games are
hours and hours long.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.480
Others are 15 minutes, 10
minutes, five minutes, two.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.310
Some of them have
created just one game.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.930
Others have created dozens.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.650
The vast majority of
these games would not

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:16.050
exist if they had had to
learn to program first.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:20.510
We are better off because
their games exist.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.960
We are better off for these new
voices, these new experiences,

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.550
these new ideas
about what is a game.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.540
We are better off
even for the games

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.150
that were just created for
one person, or for no one else

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.000
to see.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.190
Has anyone ever
drawn you a picture?

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.980
Has anyone ever
written you a poem?

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.400
It doesn't have to be big.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.890
Just something small,
like, oh, a dirty limerick

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:52.060
or a new version of "Roses
are Red, Violets are Blue."

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.527
What would the world be
like if no one could?

00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:56.610
What would the world be
like if your choices were,

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.920
write the entire
"Iliad" or nothing?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.070
That is where video
games have been.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:06.880
That is what is changing
right now, right here,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.620
at this moment in history.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.880
Every single person in
this room, programmers

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.900
and non-programmers,
could go home tonight,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.490
download a free game engine,
and start making a game

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:21.330
if that was what you want to do.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.690
This is how the
world is changing.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.290
This is incredible.

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:25.980
This is huge.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.060
And more people every day,
thanks to the internet, thanks

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.130
to free tools, thanks to
other people telling them,

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.030
you can make a game too--
more people every day go home,

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.790
download that free
software, try it out,

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:41.630
discover that they
can be part of this.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:43.190
The world is changing.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.230
It's changing right now.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:48.910
This is the future where
everyone can make games.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.720
And it's really important.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.480
Thank you.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:59.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.780
I would like to take
a moment to thank

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.060
the devs who were
willing to speak with me

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.730
and share their insights.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.616
There were more stories
here than I possibly

00:46:08.616 --> 00:46:09.990
could have shared
with you, and I

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.890
wish I could have shared more.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.710
I was deeply honored
by their willingness

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.990
to tell me their stories.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.390
I would also like to
thank the people who

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.970
take the time to make software
to help non-programmers

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:26.890
into this art form, particularly
the people who are releasing it

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.900
for free, as many of the people
coming into game development

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.260
do not necessarily have the
money to be able to afford

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.285
an expensive game engine.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.660
So, any questions?

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.862
Yeah.

00:46:45.862 --> 00:46:47.445
AUDIENCE: I'm 20
years older than you,

00:46:47.445 --> 00:46:52.190
but I remember witnessing a
fairly similar phenomenon with

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.860
HyperCard, where there were
people developing interactive

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.187
stories in the mid-'80s.

00:46:59.187 --> 00:47:00.520
CAROLYN VANESELTINE: Absolutely.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.740
And I think part of
what's going on right now

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.740
that makes the change
here is the internet.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.630
I think how easy
it is for people

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.670
to pass their games from
one person to another,

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:16.100
because HyperCard, not as easy
as just downloading someone

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.540
else's file or playing online.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.670
But yes, Hypercard an
example that absolutely

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:24.530
fits into this model.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.030
AUDIENCE: So you don't have to
be a programmer to use Twine,

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:31.880
but presumably a
programmer created Twine.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.752
So from a meta
design standpoint,

00:47:33.752 --> 00:47:35.728
if you wanted to make
tools for game designers,

00:47:35.728 --> 00:47:37.300
what advice would you have?

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.675
CAROLYN VANESELTINE:
The question

00:47:38.675 --> 00:47:40.780
was, from a meta
perspective, what

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.510
would be my advice to
people who want to make game

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:48.700
engines for non-programmers.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.200
This is actually a really
interesting question for me,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.860
because one of the things that
I've been working on quietly

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.580
behind the scenes has
been exactly that.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.630
There are reasons why
I wanted to learn C#.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.470
The thing that I
would say is most

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:07.990
important to keep in mind
is that you want to minimize

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.210
the number of walls that
people can run into,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:15.850
that if it's possible
to keep people

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.950
from using bad syntax, for
whatever the system is,

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.380
keep them from doing that.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.000
Make it impossible to
make bad decisions.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.580
Make it possible to make
interesting decisions.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.120
And I recognize
that it's very hard

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.730
to get rid of runtime
errors, like, you

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.490
can't help the people who go
and divide by zero deliberately.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.440
Yes, you divided by zero and
now everything is going to stop.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.990
But if it's not
possible for them

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:42.940
to hit go and then have compiler
errora after compiler error

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.720
fter compiler error, if it
will run but give them a heads

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.100
up about what went wrong,
that would be my advice.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.440
Make it as streamlined as
possible to make something.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:58.100
I also want to give credit
to Chris Klimas, who

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:02.600
is the creator of Twine,
who was looking specifically

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.503
at this kind of question
when he created it.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:08.854
Anybody else?

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:13.990
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question that's

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.170
a little bit of a
tangent from your talk,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.184
goes a little bit
beyond game design.

00:49:19.184 --> 00:49:21.600
The thing I find really neat
about what you've been saying

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.672
has been the-- I guess I'll say
the bridge between programmers

00:49:25.672 --> 00:49:27.630
and non-programmers in
the field of game design

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.090
that's been created by these
different systems where you can

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:32.620
actually do some game design.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.203
And I think of these
different systems

00:49:34.203 --> 00:49:39.021
as providing different ways to
express programming logic that

00:49:39.021 --> 00:49:41.270
are somewhat more intuitive
to people who haven't gone

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.170
through the, OK, let's learn
Assembler from scratch,

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:45.086
and all right, this is
how the computer thinks

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:46.410
and that kind of stuff.

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:49.179
And I'm sort of wondering,
how do we expand that

00:49:49.179 --> 00:49:49.970
beyond game design?

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.490
Because you said, should
everyone learn to program?

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:51.990
No.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.770
And I certainly sympathize
with the feelings behind that.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:55.940
There are people who
can't learn to program.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.065
There are people for whom
it's really not worth it,

00:49:58.065 --> 00:50:00.490
and they will not enjoy it
and they will be miserable.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.210
But our society is
more and more one

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:07.150
that's like, just, the computers
are accumulating under our feet

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.580
and we're being
risen up by them.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.120
And for the people who
don't understand anything

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.730
about programming, don't
understand how computers work,

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.340
I think the feeling
is just being

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.480
more and more helpless in the
face of all sorts of stuff

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.570
around them.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.380
So I'd love to see that bridge
that you're building in game

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.014
design outside of game design.

00:50:25.014 --> 00:50:26.430
Do you know of any
efforts in that

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.350
area, ways to make, I'll
say programming in general--

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:32.250
although, wow, is that
broad statement-- more

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.810
accessible to people
who aren't programmers?

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.280
CAROLYN VANESELTINE:
Code Academy.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.060
Code Academy comes instantly
to mind from a game design

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.100
perspective, because
hey, I come back to this.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.150
It's my lodestone.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.620
AUDIENCE: That's your head.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.580
That's this talk.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.090
So go ahead.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.673
CAROLYN VANESELTINE:
There is a system

00:50:47.673 --> 00:50:49.980
that was created at
MIT called Sketch.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.460
And what's really
interesting about Sketch,

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.760
it's aimed at eight
to 16-year-olds.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.340
But it works in the browser.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.590
And not only does it not
let you fail your syntax,

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.220
but all of the
visual drag and drop

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.520
scripting, all the
pieces of it are kind of

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.010
shaped like puzzle pieces.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.120
So you can see how
they all fit together.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.980
So it makes it very
easy to understand, OK,

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.590
if I have an if else,
there's this little gap here,

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:17.670
and that little gap means
that I have to have what

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:19.620
my conditional is in there.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.410
But you also asked
a broader question,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:26.210
not just about programming,
but about growing

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.810
more comfortable with
computers at large.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:32.110
And I want to point out that
another way to look at this

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.450
is that it's a UI challenge.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.790
And that is a UI challenge
that, number one,

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.600
is being tackled at Google,
number two, Apple excels at.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.030
And there are so many
people continuing

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.580
to tackle this challenge of, how
do we make computers that look

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.030
like they think like people?

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:54.360
How do we make things Intuitive
And it's an ongoing struggle.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.250
It's an important struggle.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.050
And how to teach
programming is undergoing

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.830
that exact same struggle.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:01.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:02.270
I'm worried.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:05.020
I mean, I'm behind
efforts to make computers

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.300
think more like people.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.524
But I think that
the way computers

00:52:08.524 --> 00:52:11.190
think has a way of their own and
it's always going to be around.

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.680
And helping people in general
understand a little bit more

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.170
that would be valuable, too.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.610
But that's a
programmer perspective.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.720
CAROLYN VANESELTINE: Well,
so I had an experience

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.070
a couple weeks back where I was
working on a roguelike game.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.130
So these are the top
down dungeon games,

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.470
procedural generation,
whole nine yards.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.310
And I was working
on line of sight.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.470
So here's my player character.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:39.460
How far can they see?

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.210
What can they see?

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.501
How are things getting exposed?

00:52:41.501 --> 00:52:44.720
How does this interface
with the light mechanics?

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.670
And it was the
first time I'd used

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:52.540
my algebra in about 20 years.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.440
And before that, I was in school
doing something in school.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.140
But it was important
for me to learn algebra.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.790
In the same way, I
think that there's

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:07.210
merit to learning programming
in the context of actually

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.380
programming.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.820
There's a lot to be said for
knowing some programming.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.600
There's a lot to be said
for knowing some algebra.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.670
And possibly it'll
show up 20 years later,

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.660
and you'll sit there going,
I'm so glad I paid attention

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:19.260
in that class.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.480
Why didn't I listen
to my trig teacher?

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.720
Or why didn't I listen to
my programming teacher?

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.200
But my protest is
against the idea

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.570
that a barrier
should be in place.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:34.002
The barrier, when it's not in
the context of being a barrier,

00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.126
is another matter entirely.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.480
Anybody else?

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.170
AUDIENCE: So I had a general
question about building tools.

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.710
So in some sense, building a
game with a restricted language

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.418
is like building a
very specialized tool.

00:53:48.418 --> 00:53:51.437
So for mechanical things, you
can build either a hammer,

00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:53.020
and a hammer is very
good at hammering

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.237
but terrible at other things.

00:53:54.237 --> 00:53:56.070
And their other tools
are Swiss army knives,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.510
which are kind of expert use.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:59.905
So I've seen this
in game engines

00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:01.030
that you try to build, too.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.870
This is a tool.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:03.456
It knows how to
speak certain things,

00:54:03.456 --> 00:54:05.080
but it's extremely
frustrating when you

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.950
try to go beyond that paradigm.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.533
And I don't know if
you can talk a bit

00:54:08.533 --> 00:54:10.510
about that trade-off
between generalized tools

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.740
and specialized tools.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.210
CAROLYN VANESELTINE: Certainly.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:18.150
So that's something that we see
with choice scripts, RPG Maker,

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.370
Adventure Game Studio, Ren'Py.

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.980
They are aimed very
specifically at doing

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.420
one specific kind of game.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.666
And once you branch
off that, it's

00:54:28.666 --> 00:54:31.610
that question of making
sure that the system you're

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.390
using to make what
you're making actually

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.670
fits with what you're
trying to make.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.740
And I got rescued by
a programmer once,

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.110
about a year ago, because
I had this great idea

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:47.900
for an asynchronous multiplayer
game written in Inform 7.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.870
And I knew that Inform
7 can support data that

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:53.990
holds over from play to play.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.919
And I thought to myself, I can
make a game that's multiplayer

00:54:57.919 --> 00:55:00.210
where multiple people can
play it and affect each other

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:02.970
by just putting it on a server.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.649
I didn't understand
what was going

00:55:04.649 --> 00:55:06.940
to happen was that it was
going to cache in the browser

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.060
and people would not be able
to interact with each other.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.110
I didn't understand
the limits of my tool.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.360
I wound up-- and this
was for a game jam--

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.110
so I wound up running,
actually, to my fiance,

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:20.800
Danielle Church, who
is extraordinarily good

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.810
at programming,
and said, save me.

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:27.360
I have created an idea
that is beyond my toolset.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.340
And she set up server
communication and JavaScript,

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.350
and made it so that
it could actually

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:36.310
happen the way I had
originally pictured it.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:36.970
Yes.

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:38.761
There are dangers if
you decide that you're

00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:40.734
going to use your hammer
as a panini press.

00:55:40.734 --> 00:55:42.900
It is a good idea to look
around and see if you have

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.460
a panini press available first.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.994
Anybody else?

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.140
Well, in that case,
I want to thank you

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:55.280
so much for your time.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.660
I really appreciate that you
came here to hear me speak

00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:58.610
today.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.840
And I actually have a
blog at sibylmoon.com,

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.120
I think about game dev
and the state of game

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.370
and the people making games.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:08.500
So if that's of interest
to you, please stop by

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.590
thank you so much.

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.140
[APPLAUSE]
