RACHEL: I am really pleased
and excited to have Judith

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.860
here today at Google
for our talk.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.900
Dr. Judith Wright is hailed as
a peerless educator, world

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.570
class coach, lifestyles expert,
inspirational speaker,

World Magazine." And Judith
has appeared in

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.890
over 500 radio stations--

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.480
I didn't even know there was
500 radio stations--

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.180
and 80 television shows.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.600
Well, maybe there's 80
television shows--

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
including ABC's "20/20,"
"Oprah," "The Today Show," and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.810

degrees and certificates in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.720
transformational leadership

So today we're really excited
because Dr. Wright is going to

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.200
share with us her cutting edge
research in the science behind

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.840
creating a spectacular life
and how to get rid of the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.520
mindless habits that get in the
way of our mindfulness and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.030
living a richer, fuller life.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.070
So please welcome Dr.
Judith Wright.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.395
JUDITH WRIGHT: Thank you.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.210
Thanks, Rachel.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.770
Thanks.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.530
Thanks to all of you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.530
Thanks for having me and that
we're going to have this kind

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.190
of mindful mindlessness.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.860
We're going to be more mindful
about our mindlessness.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.030
And how many of you can admit
that perhaps you've had a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.000
mindless moment somewhere
in your life?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.780
Could I see there?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.560
I want to check.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.840
How many of you are so out
of it right now you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.820
can't raise your hand?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.190
I just want to see how we
want to play with that.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.690
How many of you could
have been doing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.930
something else right now?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.730
Obviously, you could.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.570
And you chose to be here.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.560
I also want to find out,
do you participate?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.120
Can we do this together?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.880
All right, great.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.060
Three of you said, uh huh.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.100
So we're, OK.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.750
We'll play with that.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.720
Great.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.400
What I'm going to be
working with--

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320
I want to find out what
do you yearn for.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.060
That's going to be a bigger term
that we're going to be

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.670
working with and how this
relates to mindfulness and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.100
overcoming our mindless
habits.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.530
But I'm going to ask you some
questions and if it feels like

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.610
something that matters to you
or that you yearn for, if

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.610
you'd raise your hand.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.000
How many of you would really
like even more consciousness,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.865
more mindfulness?

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:11.530
Can I see that?

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.040
OK, great.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.880
How about some just real
basic stuff of life.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.555
How about more time?

00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:17.760
Who would like more time?

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.140
All right, great.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.820
Perfect.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.090
How about more money?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.100
Let's just go at it that way.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.240
But the rest of you
have too much?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.380
We can trade a little.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.340
We can mix it up a little bit.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.770
How about more energy?

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.790
Can I see that?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.820
How many of you don't
have energy to raise

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.410
your hand right now?

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.020
All right.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.900
These are all related to what
we're going to talk about.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.680
How about--

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.390
I think this means something--

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.155
meaning, fulfillment,
satisfaction, having your days

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.440
be more meaningful than
they might be now?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.790
All right, good.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.730
How about more satisfying
relationships, more intimacy?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.060
Who's interested in that?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.310
The rest of you just had
a bad relationship?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.680
Are we like--

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.980
all right, great, just
want to check.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.390
How about dealing with
stress better?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.777
Who'd like that?

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:59.290
All right, good.
this helps me.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.660
How about, who'd like
a better memory?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.150
Who can't remember what
I just asked you?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.160
This is related.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.500
Then also how about learning
faster, remembering things

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.590
more, having more critical
thinking, having your

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.930
cognition be even better
than it is now.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.480
All right, good.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.000
How many of you are interested
in a deeper spiritual

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.510
relationship or spirituality?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.310
OK.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.500
How many of you would like
to maximize your IQ?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.860
All right, good.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.260
And this one's kind of generic,
but how many of you

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.830
would like an even
richer, deeper,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.340
fuller quality of life?

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.310
OK.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.510
And how about just
more happiness?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.270
Can we see that?

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.680
All right.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.970
I know these are related but
there's a specific reason I'm

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.050
mentioning all these different
things I'm talking about.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.960
How about--

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.600
I think this is something that
many of us yearn for--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.210
to realize our potential, become
who we could become,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.030
live this life really,
really well.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.390
Who's interested in that?

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.620
All right, great.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.050
We talk about that as
the life project.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.860
We go about our work projects
and our home projects, but

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.930
taking on our life project.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.780
So how many of you would like a
well-lived life project that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.210
gets a really good grade
or however it works

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.990
when you turn it in?

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.090
All right, good.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.240
JUDITH WRIGHT: So all these
things I just mentioned,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.399
they're very common
kinds of things.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.829
But they're all very related
to what we're

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.579
talking about today.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.610
And the research shows that
these are the things that are

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.360
impacted by the kinds of things
we're going to be

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.260
talking about today.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.400
And the more we get more skill
with this, the more all those

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.550
results happen in our life.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.120
And the less skill
we have, all of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.210
those things are impacted.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.790
That's how important it is
what we're talking about.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.120
And obviously you're here
because you want something.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.790
And we're going to learn
to grow together.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.830
So part of where I'm going to
be coming from, I've been

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.520
spending 35 years of studying
great lives.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.090
I grew up in a factory town.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.670
So it was an interesting kind
of thing to see how people

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.090
chose to live their life.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.690
So I was really interested in
who lives a better life.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.780
Who lives a great life?

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.320
Who fulfills their potential?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.030
How do you do this?

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.610
What is that?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.920
So I've been studying
it for a long time.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.870
It was part of my research.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.750
It was part of my doctoral
dissertation.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.110
And I really wanted to know
who really maximizes their

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.890
potential, what did they do
differently, what is that?

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.250
And it's led me on this kind
of amazing journey over all

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.680
this time, not just doing
research, but developing

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.080
curriculum, testing things out
with thousands and thousands

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.760
of people, developing ways to
help people learn life skills

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.350
to be able to get the best out
of their careers, their

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.400
personal lives, their
spirituality, their

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.660
relationships, their
family life.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.310
And overall this time there's
some things that started to

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.870
become very clear to me, plus
looking at my own life as I

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.860
was on this journey.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.810
And what I found is that
consciousness and

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.490
mindfulness--

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.220
and social, emotional
intelligence is obviously part

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.870
of this, as I'm sure many of
you know and have been

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.080
working with that.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.170
But what I've been finding is
that there were some surprises

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.050
for me because what I thought
was a formula for a great life

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.660
is not exactly what the
research showed.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.090
And that's what we're going to
be looking at today in how it

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.110
relates to our mindfulness
and how our mindlessness

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.780
subtracts from that.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.430
So how many of you
are meditatators?

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.000
Can I see that?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.800
All right, great.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.930
How many of you consider
yourself on a spiritual path

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.310
of some sort?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.480
How about just professional

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.440
development, learning, growing?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.800
Personal development?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.830
OK, great.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.340
All of the above?

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.970
There's a few of us, OK.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.800
All those things that you're
doing are really critical and

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.720
very important in terms
of quality of life and

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.210
productivity and all those
results we talked about.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.090
However, these soft addictions,
mindlessness,

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.780
these places where we
go a bit unconscious

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.960
really take away from--

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.660
it's counterproductive to some
of our mindful practices.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.930
So we want to work with that.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.390
And also what we're looking at
and what our research shows is

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.390
how to be more mindful
moment to moment.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.810
Day to day interactions with
every work project we're doing

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.890
with the people we're working
with, how do we bring a degree

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.780
of all of this thing that
matters to us in every single

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.660
moment of every day, rather than
having kind of a driven

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.610
life with a moment
of meditation?

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.620
How many of you can relate to
that, kind of like you're

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.690
sneaking it in sometimes?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.000
All right, we want to work on
how to have that be more

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.630
available to you all the time.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.460
So the big issue here is this
term that I coined over 20

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.790
years ago, soft addictions.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.020
And they are where
we go mindless.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.410
Every single one
of us does it.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.120
In fact, a recent poll, 91%
percent of Americans admitted

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.350
to having soft addictions.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.180
I think the other 9% are in
denial because I don't know

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.420
anybody who doesn't have moments
of mindlessness.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.910
M

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.940
And you'll find just during
the time we're talking--

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.920
so how many of you have already
checked out several

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.010
times while we're talking?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.820
You're checking your smartphone,
whatever--

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.060
yeah.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.110
I'm not saying it has to be a
soft addiction but we go back

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.600
and forth this way.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.440
I must say-- just say this,
full disclosure.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.110
I'm not anti-technology.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.490
I love technology.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.360
It's a relationship
with it that we're

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.790
talking about today.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.740
So soft addictions are those
seemingly harmless habits like

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.210
overeating, over shopping,
watching too much TV, checking

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.740
your Facebook pages a zillion
times during the day, checking

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.860
your email compulsively.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.110
But over doing anything, over
doing any normal everyday

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.620
activity beyond its usefulness
for some other purposes.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.410
And it has a lot more cost
than we're aware of.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.770
It takes time, obviously.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.360
It oftentimes cost money.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.770
But it mutes our
consciousness.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.630
That goes to anti-mindfulness.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.010
It numbs ours feelings.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.550
It reduces our social emotional
intelligence.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.020
And it robs us of a lot of
energy and motivation.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.210
So we're going to work with
this a little bit and then

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.460
look underneath the neuroscience
of that and how

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.860
human beings are so predisposed
to these kinds of

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.720
habits and what we
can do about it.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.590
But rather than my talking about
them, we're going to

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.000
show a little video
clip from some

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.740
interviews that I've done.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.420
But see if you can recognize
yourself.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.700
And also watch if you're saying,
oh, I'm not that bad

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.000
because that's a clue too.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.549
So let's look at this
for a second.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.820
They're just lists of things.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.909
It doesn't mean these things
are a problem.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.840
But are you over doing
them sometimes?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.220
Do you get kind of high or
buzzed or forgetful or kind of

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.130
numb when you're doing it?

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.070
Do people tease you about it?

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.700
Have you thought, oh, I'm
kind of over doing that?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.030
Those kinds of things let us
know that these things might

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.060
be a little bit of an issue.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.210
So I'm going to go
through these

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.360
categories really quickly.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.310
Then I'm going to have you go
through the checklist and see

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.840
what you think might be
susceptible things for you so

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.020
we can have not just--

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.850
be more engaging.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.940
If you need any of the hand
outs, just raise your hand.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.930
We'll make sure you get those.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.350
OK, great.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.050
We'll pass a few more out.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.020
So there's four categories of
soft addictions as I've been

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.880
studying this.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.900
There's activities, the things
that you do too much of.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.100
Can you shout some things out?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.220
Not you, but your friends or
other people in the world.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.010
What do they do?

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.310
What are some of the
things we overdo?

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.260
AUDIENCE: Email.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:22.380
JUDITH WRIGHT: Email.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.235
What else?

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:23.660
AUDIENCE: TV.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.925
JUDITH WRIGHT: She's on
hers right now as

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:26.050
she's saying that.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.530
TV.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.960
JUDITH WRIGHT: She's
thinking no.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.110
So all kinds of things.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.670
It can be anything
that we overdo.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.970
So activities--

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.090
they can be media.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.510
They can be engaging activities,
things that we do.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.060
So activities can become
a soft addiction.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.170
There's another category,
which is interesting.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.570
It's not doing activities,
procrastinating.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.830
How many of you are guilty
of procrastinating?

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.490
And you know how we best
procrastinate?

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.620
We use other soft addictions
to do that.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.060
We disappear for a
while to do this.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.810
So procrastinate, not doing the
things we wish we had done

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.800
or not getting around to things,
that kind of thing.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.830
There's a third category.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.920
That's moods and
ways of being.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.450
This one was interesting to me
because you can get kind of

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.230
addicted to ways of being.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.340
How many of you know really
perpetually cranky people?

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.605
And it's like a habit.

00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:12.610
It's like it's a reflex.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:18.070
Or habitually smiley Pollyanna
types you sometimes run into.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.840
Or sarcastic, not like there
has to be wrong but there's

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.360
like a reflexive, anytime
something gets uncomfortable,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.480
somebody responds with this kind
of mood or way of being.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.900
And now they're finding that
the neurochemical wash that

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.960
goes on with these moods that
we get addicted to, as those

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.030
moods come up, and if we're not
feeling that, we think a

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.500
thought that triggers that same
neurochemical wash that

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.770
brings that mood back.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:40.930
It's fascinating.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.680
So moods and ways of being can
be also soft addictions.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.920
And things related to activities
are just things,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.780
consumable, edible
kinds of things.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.020
And it can be your favorite
chocolate or

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.750
collections that you have.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.360
I was doing a talk and a woman
said, oh, I think I have a

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.030
thing addiction.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.350
I said, well, most of us do.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.890
What is that?

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:00.800
She says, well, it's a food.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.590
It's a food group.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.620
And I said, what is that?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.450
She says, it's the
eeto food group.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.490
And I was like, what is that?

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.170
I thought it was like Asian
fusion or something.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.540
She said, no, Cheetos,
Frito, Doritos.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.925
I said, oh, yeah I got it.

00:11:10.925 --> 00:11:12.020
Now, I understand.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.070
So maybe that's something
of yours as well.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.500
So take just a moment or two
and take that checklist.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.710
Mark anything you think you
might be susceptible to so

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.230
that we're all in here
as human beings

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.300
working on this together.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.360
Oh, yeah.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.890
There should be blanks on
there because anything

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.790
overdone can-- even
great stuff.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.460
Playing chess can become
a soft addiction.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.310
One woman told me she
volunteered too much.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.180
And she really did.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.570
She was volunteering every day
and wasn't getting on with

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.540
sending her resume out, getting
a new job, things she

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.220
needed to do.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.370
So even practicing an instrument
can become a soft

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.460
addiction if you're over using
it to avoid some other kinds

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.180
of activities.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.590
So add anything that you might
be susceptible to.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.790
Well let me find out.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.000
How many of you had more in the
activities column, more

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.710
stuff you over do?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.140
Let me see that.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:57.770
OK.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.300
How many of you more in the
avoidances, things you don't

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.340
do, the procrastination or not
getting around to things?

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.550
How about the mood addictions?

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.610
Anybody find those for yourself,
mood or way of being

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.620
addictions?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.780
How about just plain old stuff,
whether it's chocolate

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.870
or collections or whatever
in that way?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.620
OK, great.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.650
The rest of you don't have soft
addictions or are you

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.820
still working on it?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.370
Because I just want you to see--
and I'm not saying these

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.980
necessarily are.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.640
It's our relationship
with these things.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.720
And partly I really want
us to look at it.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.920
We're going to understand the
addictive nature of human

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.140
beings and what to do to unlock
this so that all of the

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.885
practices that we're doing are
mindful practices, our yoga

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.080
that we do, our thoughtfulness,
our critical

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.200
thinking, all the capacities we
have are maximized rather

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.520
than compromised.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.790
So that's why I want you
to be looking at that.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.140
I can tell you some of mine.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.460
And I've been working
with them.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.090
But for me it was nail
biting and catalogs.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.030
I would just disappear.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.370
I would open a catalog and it
was like I was in a dreamland

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.530
for a period of time where it's
just like lots of time

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.970
would go by.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:56.980
And I'm a reader.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.480
And a lot of times I'm reading
for stimulation, intellectual

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.270
development, all kinds of
things, or research.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.310
But there's a lot of times I'm
reading it like it's just to

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.350
disappear and just go mindless
for a period of time,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.490
depending on the reading
material that I have.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.540
So if I can tell you mine,
you can tell me yours.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.850
So anybody willing to share and
just shout a few things

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.756
out you might have
a soft addiction?

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:16.550
AUDIENCE: Diet soda.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.180
JUDITH WRIGHT: Diet soda.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.760
Oh, that's a really
popular one.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.050
That's great.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.920
Great, thanks.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.830
What else?

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.510
AUDIENCE: Wikipedia.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.460
JUDITH WRIGHT: Wikipedia.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:22.850
That's great.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.100
What else?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.000
How many of you have food
addictions like chocolate or

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.870
salty, crunchy things
or whatever?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.260
I know.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
So that's a very common
one as well.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.870
So I just want you in the game
with this because if you've

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.720
got one or two you're thinking
about, you're going to

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.050
personalize what we're talking
about a little bit more and

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.280
see what this is.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.330
This isn't about-- and we're
going to find out the wisdom

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.660
that our soft addictions have.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.750
There's beautiful messages and
there's really interesting

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.770
information in them.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.580
So we're going to learn to
translate those by the end of

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.970
the talk today to find
out what are they

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.630
trying to tell us.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.730
Why are we doing that?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.060
What's trying to get
our attention?

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.450
And what's the neuroscience
underneath it that we can pay

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.845
attention to it and shift it?

00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:06.950
But lest you think this is just
a phenomenon of modern

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.650
times, it's not.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.880
Because many people tell
me that, oh, it's just

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.690
technology.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.710
That's why I'm so addicted.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.340
No.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.430
The ancient Greeks were dealing
with something very,

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.210
very similar where they were
talking about that.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.650
The Greek word is akrasia.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.070
And I think it makes
you crazia.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.240
Because akrasia, it's doing
things that you know just

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.440
aren't that great for you,
whether it's loss of self

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.750
control or over indulging in
things that aren't that great,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.880
but doing things that you don't
feel that great about or

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.270
you know aren't so
positive for you.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.840
And it's interesting because
they called it acting against

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.930
your better judgment.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.390
How many of you ever acted
against your better judgment

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.260
and then justified
it afterwards?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.740
That's part of it too.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.710
That's how you know you're in
that kind of territory.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.720
So it's really interesting.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.660
So it's fascinating because
they're the same categories,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.480
over doing activities, like I
have, and then under doing

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.700
them, avoiding things, like
procrastination or putting

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.740
things off, that
kind of thing.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.880
They looked at those two
categories as well.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.590
But then they're talking about
this addictive stuff.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.270
And I'm using that word for
a reason because addiction

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.080
actually means in Latin--

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.280
it's turning yourself over.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.710
It's giving yourself
over to something.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.710
We're not always that
considerate about what we're

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.910
turning ourselves over to.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.020
And addiction means the
repetitive behaviors that

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.910
we're doing and doing things
that we know aren't good for

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.650
us, that are actually bad for
us, but still have the

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.750
desire to do it.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.280
Who here, besides me, can admit
you've had the desire to

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.640
do some things that aren't
all that great for you?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.780
And how many of you have
acted on that desire?

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.950
Me as well.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.520
That's part of what
all this is about.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.170
So one of the biggest things
that gets in the way, that's

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:43.180
related to this akrasia is we
have this fundamental issue

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.490
about how we weight
consequences.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.400
Now, I think you can relate
to this because when we

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.500
overweight immediate
consequences and don't think

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.020
about long term-- and it's so
hard in the moment because

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.310
what seems really like right
now consequences, like the

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.870
comfiness of this couch, that
wonderful taste of that

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.850
chocolate cake, that laughter
of that talking kitty video.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.880
You know, those things seem like
the most important thing

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.010
in the moment when you're
stuck by those.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.970
But other consequences
are more distant.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.670
It's like your long term career
goals or losing weight

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.910
or shifting something in
your life over time.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.850
And we have this immediate
and long term.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.830
We tend to weight
the immediate--

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.530
and this is evolutionary, we'll
find out in a moment.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.240
We tend to weight the immediate
much heavier than

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.610
the long term, which is why we
don't often get everything we

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.160
could out of life.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.845
And it's really interesting.

00:16:34.845 --> 00:16:37.580
And they call it time
inconsistency or dynamic

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.306
inconsistency.

00:16:38.306 --> 00:16:39.550
But see if you can
relate to this.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.540
Here's what this study shows,
the research shows.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.420
If you're ordering food for next
week, if you're ordering

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.050
some groceries for next week,
you put together a really

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.990
great shopping list.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.410
It's got fruits and vegetables
and lean meats.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.160
It's really healthy.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.310
It's wonderful.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.000
However, if you go shopping
tonight, guess what you buy?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.010
Pizza, chips, ice cream.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:16:59.740
And the studies show this.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.770
But think about it.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.310
It's a little different
now when you're

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.470
streaming movies and stuff.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.480
But remember when you would
get your Netflix or other

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.540
things, and you'd get things
waiting in the queue?

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.980
What happens with movies, the
research shows the same thing.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.780
Like if you're thinking about
what you're going to watch a

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.930
week from now, you order
really highbrow films.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.650
But if you're going to watch
something tonight, you're

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.790
like, it's lowbrow stuff.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.900
It's just let me escape.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.329
Who can relate to what
I'm talking about?

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.420
Or another one, like you
download books on your Nook or

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.350
Kindle or your iPad or whatever
your reading device

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.675
is, and you're thinking about
things you want to

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:31.650
have there for later.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.010
And you have biographies and
histories and science text and

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.840
non fiction and Nobel Prize
winning literature.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.180
And you take that and you
get it all loaded up

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.140
to go on the airplane.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.900
And you're like, yes.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.410
I'm virtuous.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.220
I have all this great stuff.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.970
And you're in the airport.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.470
What do you buy to read
on the plane?

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.200
AUDIENCE: "Twilight."

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.500
JUDITH WRIGHT: Yeah, "Twilight."
You buy whatever

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.450
you can grab to try to distract

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.340
yourself in the moment.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.160
So this is what human
beings do.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.790
And it's really interesting
because we think about this.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.130
And the studies show this
over and over again.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.650
Like, the movie thing, 77% of
people order the highbrow

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.880
thing now and then watch the
lowbrow thing tonight.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.270
So that means most of
us are doing this.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.600
Not that I'm not making
moral judgments.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.090
I'm just trying to wake us up
to what our habits are like.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.650
Because if you think about it,
if we really could design our

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.570
lives from scratch, which
we can at a level.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.715
If we're really going to design
our lives, say, OK, how

00:18:21.715 --> 00:18:23.530
do I want my life to be?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.850
How do I want to live my days?

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.600
How do I want to
spend my time?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.990
What is it that, if I could
really step back and be an

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.870
architect of my own life project
and put the pieces in

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.710
place and design that, I don't
think I would do this.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.320
Like, OK, got to
design my life.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.190
OK, I want to watch five
hours of TV a day.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.320
And by the time I'm 60, I want
to make sure I've spent at

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.750
least nine years watching TV.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.400
And I want to have at
least 12 hours of

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.650
screen time every day.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.990
And that includes those
talking kitten videos.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.880
And then I want to make sure
that my kids spend more time

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.450
watching TV by the time they
graduate than they've spent

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.840
going to school.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.430
And, let's see, over shopping.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.167
I want to over shop and be kind
of frenzied and max out

00:19:09.167 --> 00:19:10.500
my credit cards.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.780
And then I want to spend six
hours a week shopping, as

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.040
opposed to 40 minutes
a week with my kids.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.790
And then I want to have so much
stuff that I have to rent

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.320
a storage container for stuff
that I never use.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.075
And then let's see,
keep designing.

00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:24.870
I'm missing something.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.120
Oh, I got it.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.380
I want to check my email 36
times an hour and then be

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.300
distracted for 15 minutes
afterwards trying to get my

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.290
focus back after every time.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.410
And what am I missing?

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.050
Oh, I know.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.200
I want to lower my IQ 10 points
by that compulsive

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.020
email checking and multitasking
so that I can dim

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.060
it a little bit.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.270
And then I went to over snack
and eat a lot of empty

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.170
calories and get all
fat and bloated.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.560
And then, wait, that's
not enough.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.320
I got to get some-- oh.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.470
And then I want to bite my
nails to a bloody pulp.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.770
And, oh, and in any moment I
have just a moment just in

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.760
between things or any possible
down time, I want to grab my

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.570
smartphone and avoid people in
the elevator, walking on the

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.340
street, or even when I'm
at dinner with them.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.590
And I want to check my
Facebook page in the

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.930
middle of the night.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.490
And then I want to check it
right before I get up, right

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.190
as I'm getting up, before
I go to the bathroom.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.240
And I'm still trying
to hold it in.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.790
But I got to check my page.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.540
And, let's see, I want to make
sure my kids sleep with a

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.860
BlackBerry instead
of a teddy bear.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.930
And I want to make sure, let's
see, that I don't have enough

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.660
money for a vacation because I
spent $1,500 to $2,500 a year

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.560
on gourmet coffee
at Starbucks.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.460
And I want to be distracted and
anxious and a little numb

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.100
and little buzzed and little
forgetful and a little zoned

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.920
out and look like this a
lot and answer people,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.870
uh huh, I hear you.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.595
You've put the kitten
in the dryer.

00:20:48.595 --> 00:20:49.770
Uh huh, that's great.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.620
I want to be like that rather
than conscious and engaged and

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.560
learning and growing and making
the best of my life.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.830
So all this stuff are not the
elements of a designer life.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.930
Yet--

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.360
I know I'm exaggerating
a tiny bit.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.490
But, actually, I'm not.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.070
Because everything I just told
you is statistically normal.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.190
This is what people are doing.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.750
This is the norm in our world.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.750
We do watch five hours
of television a day.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.550
We do watch nine years of
television by the time we're

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.820
60, et cetera.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.360
All those things are
statistically normal.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.790
But that's what's happening
in our world.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.720
So that means that some of us
that are listening to this are

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.360
caught by some of
these things.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.290
And it's fascinating because
there's two normals, if you

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:31.720
look at it.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.390
There's normal of what
everybody's doing, which is

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.980
statistically normal.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.480
There's another normal
of the normal

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.420
operating range of machinery.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.700
And that's where machines
work best.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.100
Those two normals are
very different.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.520
And they are getting farther and
farther and farther apart

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.990
in our world.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.830
And because of this, because of
what's normal, if somebody

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.060
doesn't think you're weird,
you're living really badly

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.300
because what's statistically
normal isn't in our normal

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.040
operating range.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.800
It isn't where we
function best.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.410
But that's kind of the norm of
how we are in our world.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.450
And so how many of us say,
I just want to be normal?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.940
That's not the best thing
for us at this point.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.560
And I don't want you to get smug
that this doesn't apply

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.540
to you because that would be
a way of being addiction.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.640
So I'm going to check because
we're all in this.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.760
This is part of our human
nature, what's happening.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.650
So part of it, like what's
the big deal?

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.020
And I think we're making
that point.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.540
And I want to just go through
some of the stats and the cost

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.170
of mindlessness to really
understand how pervasive this

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.170
is and how that no matter how
much mindful work we do, how

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:42.220
this subtracts from that and
keeps us from having the juice

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.570
that every day could have.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.360
So all these kind of mindless
activities that we so

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.920
naturally gravitate to, they
mute our consciousness.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.490
They numb our feeling.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.710
So they reduce our emotional
intelligence.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:58.960
They reduce our social emotional
intelligence, which

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.760
affects our decision making
and our intimacy and our

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.490
genuineness and our contact with
ourselves and our ability

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.110
to really relate and
be creative.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.420
It steals time.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.240
Tremendous amounts of time are
eaten up in things that we're

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.640
not that aware of.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.210
Oh, the intimacy, it diminishes
intimacy because

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.420
we're not there.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.880
We're not fully present
with ourselves and

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.920
another human being.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.610
And there was a recent study
at the University of Essex,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.730
this was fascinating.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.670
If you're out with someone and
you're trying to have a more

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.530
meaningful conversation, you're
sitting across the

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.840
table or next to someone, if
there's even a cell phone on a

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.650
table near you-- no one's
even talking on it.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.990
Just having that cell phone on
the table as you're talking

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.850
reduces intimacy.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.560
It lowers the trust and the
sense of connection and the

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.490
depth of the conversation.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.190
And they think it's because
it's an indication that

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.460
there's other people.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.280
It kind of represents there's
other people and you're not

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.390
just with the person, or it
could interrupt you in any

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.210
second so you don't relax
into the engagement.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.120
But that in itself--

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.260
so the clues are there that are
disrupting intimacy, much

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.900
less when we're actually
on that when we're

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.470
at dinner with someone.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.470
Multitasking.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.450
And there's no such thing as
multitasking, even though most

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.760
of still try it.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.200
We only pay attention to
one thing at a time.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.500
And we're flipping back and
forth between things.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.860
We're not as good at things
as we think we are.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.800
But what happens when we
multitask or really

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.320
compulsively check our email--
the norm is 36 times an hour,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.800
by the way.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.890
That's statistically normal.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:32.080
So what happens then is that
we lower our IQ 10 points,

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.030
which is the same as
smoking a joint.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.350
I'm not recommending one or the
other necessarily, but to

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.270
kind of get what happens going
on in our noggin when

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.570
this is going on.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.970
So what I say is it makes us
numb and dumber and fat and

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.280
fatter and all the other
implications that it has.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.920
And it's a huge issue for us.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.350
And it also costs
a lot of money.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.360
Because if you think about it,
just think about it-- just a

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.850
handful of songs on iTunes and
a book or so on your reading

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.000
device or gourmet coffee,
you start to add

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.990
things up over time.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.070
It really adds up.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.000
And I've done these trainings
now with thousands of people

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.560
over the last 20 years.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.390
The lowest amount we ever
heard people-- they do a

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.320
financial accounting to kind
of get the point for

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:12.730
themselves.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.410
Oh my gosh, it's so sobering.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.460
The lowest I've ever
seen anybody was

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.240
$3,000 for the year.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.670
And this person was pretty
much a hermit.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.340
He actually had avoidance
soft addiction.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.430
The norm was $30,000
a year of just

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.910
kind of mindless spending.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.280
And if you want to spend that,
that's totally fine.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.490
But usually it's just money that
goes somewhere they were

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.320
not aware of, that's not going
towards what it is that we

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.370
really want.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.610
So part of the deal with
this-- let me kind of

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.750
personalize this a bit.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.490
And then we're going to play
with the neuroscience under it

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.360
and find out why this is.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.565
Part of why I've studied human
potential for all these years

00:25:48.565 --> 00:25:51.710
is because there was something
that I was looking at it in my

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.880
own life that I felt like there
was something more there

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.190
that I wasn't quite getting.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.940
And I thought I was
living life well.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.390
But something was
missing for me.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.010
See if you can relate to some
of things I'm talking about.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.820
I don't think your story
should be mine.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.860
But just see what you can
see because I knew about

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.570
achievement.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.100
I was always a great student.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.870
I was valedictorian
of my class and

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.900
graduated summa cum laude.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.090
And I was able to achieve.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.400
And I was able to--

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.570
I rose to national prominence
in two different careers by

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.850
the time I was 28.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.060
So I knew how to do well.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.580
But at the same time I was
having career success, I was

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.590
overweight, overwrought,
overstressed.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.740
There was--

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.160
even despite my success,
I was really unhappy.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.780
I felt very empty.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.820
And I felt like I was
sleepwalking through my life.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.330
I was doing a lot of things,
but there was a

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.460
numbness that I had.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.080
Something like life was
out there but I

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.940
wasn't touching it.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.000
How many of you know what
I'm talking about?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.690
That numb kind of sleepwalking
feeling?

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.930
How many of you are too numb
right now to raise your hand?

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.950
And I couldn't seem to
break what that was.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.300
And I tried a lot of things.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.500
So I lost weight.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.970
I got a guy.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.140
I worked harder.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.620
I meditated more.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.060
I prayed.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.310
And it kind of helped.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.560
But it didn't really
unlock it.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.030
And then I partied a lot.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:07.690
Where are my partiers?

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.950
I got to make sure we've
got a few of us.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:09.840
They usually sit in the back.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.740
So, hey, good.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.520
There's a few of us.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.450
So whatever it was, I kept
trying to try new things to

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.740
try to unlock this pattern.

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.590
And it wasn't working.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.240
And I was just getting so
frustrated with my life

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.250
because I thought it
was a formula.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.600
You do well, you try hard, you
have success, whatever.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.930
It didn't work.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.440
But what happened was that I
realized through some of the

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.270
work I was doing--

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.940
I started a demonstration
program, one of the first

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.000
programs in the country to set
up programs for students with

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.140
disabilities to be successful
on campus.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.160
And I designed it and did
research and designed this

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.170
model program.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.660
So I had these students--

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.280
paraplegic, they were
quadriplegic, or blind or deaf

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.820
or cerebral palsy, all
kinds of things they

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.320
were dealing with.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.280
And then I also had a program
after that that I started at a

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.870
university for little children
that had developmental

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.290
disabilities and
their families.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.830
And there was something that I
noticed because these people

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.090
were dealing with some
really tough stuff.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.350
It wasn't easy to be doing
what they were doing.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.710
And I realized that many of
these students and many of

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.770
these families with these tough
situations they were

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.560
dealing with were much
happier than I was.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.520
And the contrast was
very stark for me.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.280
And it was upsetting to me.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.120
I was happy that they
were happy.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.470
But I couldn't understand
what was going on.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.265
And I discovered something
at that point.

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:37.500
And I had kind of an epiphany.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.510
It didn't happen
in one moment.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.360
But it kind of dawned on me
that there was something

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.160
really wrong with the formula
that I was going

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.260
about my life with.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.880
Because I thought it was being
good, being a good girl, and

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.360
working hard and being perfect
and doing well at work and

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.590
having a perfect body, perfect
situation, perfect

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.080
circumstances.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.890
And that wasn't it.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.080
And it was very upsetting
to me to realize.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.920
Because the people I was working
with didn't have

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.400
perfect circumstances or bodies
or minds or whatever,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.080
yet there was a quality of
life that I didn't have.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.130
And it really woke me up because
I realized, wait a

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.160
minute, it's not the formula
that I thought it was.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.550
Because I work hard and then
try to have some recovery.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.540
I would work hard and
then meditate.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.750
I work hard, recovery.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.040
Who's my work hard, recovery?

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.810
How may of you know that one?

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:29.900
You work hard and
then collapse,

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.270
work hard and collapse.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.140
That formula wasn't
doing it for me.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.335
And I finally woke up and I
realized that-- and it was

00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:39.930
very upsetting to me because
it was so disturbing--

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.210
that it really wasn't
about that.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.680
It was about consciousness.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.730
It was about being mindful, not
just my mindful practices.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.880
It was about being present in
the moment, feeling what I was

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.650
feeling, being able to express
those feelings, share those,

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.820
to be engaged fully in the
moment, in moment by moment

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.390
day to day kinds
of experiences.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.920
It was about being fully alive
and being more real and being

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.940
willing to make mistakes and be
more vulnerable and allow--

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.580
I was so cool before.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.050
You have never seen cool.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:11.955
I was so cool.

00:30:11.955 --> 00:30:12.610
And then I realized,
oh, my gosh.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.630
This is not it.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.660
It's about being warm.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.080
That's much more important
on the other side.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.590
And all those things started
to dawn on me.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.410
And that was always being
modeled by the people that I

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.070
was working with.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.200
There was a genuineness
in the moment.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.830
They were present with
whatever struggles

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.080
that were going on.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.980
Not everybody, but
many of them.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.560
There was a realness.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.490
It was so much different
in quality.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.600
And I woke up and I realized
that I had learned to master

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.090
my eating by that point, but I
was still addicted to thinking

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:42.730
about food.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.250
I hadn't shifted my relationship
inside.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:49.320
I hadn't mastered my mood
addictions that had me feeling

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.460
certain ways and then I'd
compensate with other soft

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.120
addictions.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.920
It wasn't about doing the right
stuff and achieving and

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.770
trying to be perfect
and being good.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:58.965
That was not it.

00:30:58.965 --> 00:31:00.860
And it was only when I realized
that some of these

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.840
students and some of these
families had a higher quality

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.150
of life than I did
that I really

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:05.100
started to examine this.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.240
And it started me on this
journey, this deeper

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.650
commitment, that's taken me to
where I am today, where my

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.160
life has a tremendously
different

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.510
quality than it had before.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:18.420
Because what I realized was that
I was hungry, but not for

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.950
all the snack food I was eating
and not for all the

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.300
activities I was buzzing
through my life.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.760
I was hungry for something
much more.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.190
I had deeper spiritual
hungers.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.585
I had deep yearnings
on my heart.

00:31:28.585 --> 00:31:29.560
There were things that
I really cared

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.950
about much more so.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.520
And I realized that I was
misreading my yearning and

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.360
numbing it with my
soft addictions.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.950
And I didn't know to call them
soft addictions at the time,

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.470
but I realized that
that was the case.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.210
I started to turn toward what
it is I really yearn for.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.760
And we're going to learn a
little bit more about that now

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.390
and learn a little more the
neuroscience behind this.

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.300
And that's when things
started to shift.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.680
From the outside of my life it
looks pretty much the same,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.560
but the inside is totally
different.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.190
And I've given up
being perfect.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.680
My life is not perfect.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.950
That's not what it's about.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.820
But it's a different kind
of journey for me now.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.520
And I want to talk
about this more.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.780
That's why I came up with the
term soft addiction because I

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.650
was also working with a lot of
high achieving people who

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.780
weren't making the progress in
all the quality of their life

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.230
that they really needed
or wanted.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.480
And that this was the
same kind of thing

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.950
that I found in them.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.050
So why is it this way?

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.810
Why is it so easy to fall?

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.310
And why are the statistical
norms the way they are?

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.310
Why is it so easy to fall into
all these habits and things

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.970
that we do that deprive us of
the quality of life and

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.670
connection and sense and
presence and consciousness?

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.070
But there is an answer to it.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.270
And it's important for us to
understand it because it's

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.550
evolutionary.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.910
Because what happens is
evolution should have weeded

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.480
all this stuff out if it
wasn't good for us.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.320
But it can't because what
happens-- do you love this?

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.690
It's a little parody.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:58.310
But what happens in evolution is
our circuits that we have,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.750
we're always scanning for
threats or scanning for

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:01.570
opportunities.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.640
That's what kept us alive
with early man.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.110
Is there a saber-toothed
tiger coming?

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.240
Where's their food?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.650
Those circuits that are always
scanning are what our survival

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.210
is based on.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.490
But our soft addictions co-opt
those very circuits that we

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.330
can't get rid of because
they're part

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.740
of our being alive.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.550
So co-ops those.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:25.840
So it hijacks these systems
we have in our brain that

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.900
condition us to look for
food, for sex, to keep

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.780
us away from predators.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.610
It's those same systems
that it takes.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.720
So what happens is that we start
seeing threats as highly

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.250
salient and things that might
be novel or give us a little

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.480
dopamine burst as something
that's really salient for us.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.220
So everything gets translated
into either food, sex,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.480
circuits, or threats.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.400
So what happens, we start
seeing-- and we're really

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.010
wired for the salience.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:03.394
So what happens, we start seeing
salience in chocolate,

00:34:03.394 --> 00:34:08.679
in, oh, let's see, yeah, for TV,
wet t-shirt contests start

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:12.420
looking really interesting to
us because it captures that

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.000
same circuit that's kept us
alive and kept us procreating

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.340
throughout life.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.620
So part of why this is so
important for us to understand

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.239
is that we're hardwired to pay
attention to things that we

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.139
think are salient.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.239
But we start seeing those
immediate consequences as

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.540
being more salient to us than
something long term.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.570
So same thing, if we were like
an ancient man or woman and

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:40.850
there's a lion, we're going to
immediately deal with that and

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.790
stop building our hut.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.250
So the longer term thing
gets pushed aside.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.810
And that's pretty much
how we're wired.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.800
And we need to be
aware of that.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.570
So what happens is that soft
addictions capitalize on this

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.699
ready-made programming for us.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.810
Now, what we need to do-- so the
longer term evolution of

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.790
us and our older brain and
our limbic system is

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.260
wired for the survival.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.090
That's what gets captured
all the time.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.480
And I'm going to teach you
about those neuroscience

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.470
circuits and those
in just a second.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.750
But what need to do is use our
frontal lobe or prefrontal

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.180
cortex, which is the more
recently evolved part of our

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.160
brain, which is the more highly
developed part of our

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.660
brain that can counteract
that.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.600
That's a part of our brain
that's interested in the long

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.690
term, in our dreams, in our
yearnings and possibilities

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.060
and what can happen and who can
we become and what can the

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.850
world be and what we can
invent and discover.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.560
And all the things that create
all the beautiful things you

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:36.690
create here are from this part
of our brain as it overrides

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.260
some of those more
early signals.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.200
And it's really important.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.780
They've done some-- you may
have heard of the famous

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:43.420
marshmallow study.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.520
So Walter Mischel did this
study-- some little

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.650
four-year-olds.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.860
And they had this choice.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.650
They sat at these little tables
and they had this

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:51.260
little marshmallow.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.850
And they said, look, you can eat
the marshmallow right now.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.610
But if you can wait a little
bit, you can have two

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.940
marshmallows.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.590
Well, these four-year-olds,
it was so--

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:01.910
there's videos all
over of them.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:02.660
You can watch them.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.140
They're going crazy
with these.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.840
They want to eat the
marshmallows so badly.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.020
They're like licking it.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.880
They're grabbing the middle of
it and trying to pretend they

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.400
didn't eat it.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.730
And a lot of the kids just gulp
it, just gulp the one

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.210
marshmallow.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.470
And other kids found
delaying tactics.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:17.100
They sing.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.320
They sit on their hands.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.240
They spin around on
their chairs.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.020
They look away.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.840
They distract themselves and
wait and got the second

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.130
marshmallow.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.730
This is a really important
experience for you to

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.220
understand because those
children that waited for the

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.600
two marshmallows, they studied
them longitudinally.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.320
And by the time they were
adolescents and even later,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.030
their social development was
way beyond the other kids.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.340
Also their SAT scores were 210
points on average higher.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.090
So that being able to delay
gratification, to look at what

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.980
a bigger reward later
is really critical.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.450
It's a really important thing.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.060
And that's part of what
we need to be able

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.610
to be looking at.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.470
But what happens, if we're
easily distracted by the buzz

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.820
in our pocket or a chime of an
email or a smell of coffee or

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.730
whatever it is--

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.150
we're easily distracted.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.030
All of sudden we forgot about
the two marshmallows of life

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.070
and we've gobbled the one and
we've not gotten the two.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.880
So there's much better
gains for us if we

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.560
can sort this through.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:22.010
So what happens with this
addictive process is anything

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.360
that triggers the possibility
of reward sends this amazing

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.850
dopamine squirt into
your brain.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.320
And I'm going to have you play
with this in a moment.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.940
I'm going to tell you a little
bit how this works.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.050
And there's two different--

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.760
I'm going to skip ahead
a little bit, Kate.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.220
There's two different circuits
in our brain that really help

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.410
us orient either to this
immediate pleasure or this

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.270
longer term kind of goal.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.935
And I'm going to make this
distinction so I want you to

00:37:51.935 --> 00:37:52.530
have the difference.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.870
Because what happens, this
addictive process happens--

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:59.720
we have these hedonic
hot spots.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.050
And actually what happens is
that there's one center in our

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.210
brain that wants and craves.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.200
And there's another center
of our brain that yearns.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.630
And it's different.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.590
I'm going to have you have an
experience of this and then

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.750
I'm going to unpack this
a little bit for you.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.660
So what happens is that we--

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.210
many of the neuroscientists
have found this.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.320
We have things that we want.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.470
But the wanting is very

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.040
different than liking something.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.320
These two centers-- sometimes
they call it the wanting

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.430
center or the center of
excitement in our brain or the

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.790
seeking center.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.080
And it's the one that gets
fueled by dopamine.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.920
And it's really intrigued by
the possibility of reward.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.660
But it's not the
reward itself.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.430
And this is when we get
a little bit crazed.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.170
We're kind of ah, ah,
ah and oh, oh, oh.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.480
You get that little buzzed
kind of look.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.660
On the other hand, we are
not wired for being

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.460
sated in that center.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.760
There's another center
for being satisfied.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.410
And they're different neural
circuits that do this.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.610
The dopamine center
is our wanting.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.730
It's what gets us kind of
motivated and high and gets us

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.200
to start engaging.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.340
And the other center is
fueled by opioids.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.330
And what are opioids?

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.130
What does that sound like?

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.840
Opium.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.940
And what is opium known for?

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.350
It's kind of that bliss, that
satisfied pause, that bliss.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.670
But we need both things.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.120
But I'm going to give you an
experience of this and we're

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.410
going to unpack this
a little bit.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.810
I'd like for you to
grab a buddy.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.950
So if you could turn towards
somebody in the area.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:24.730
Just find somebody.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.310
Or if you're at the end of an
aisle and you don't have

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.790
somebody, you could make a
threesome if you want.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:29.900
But the twosomes are best.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.520
Does everybody have a buddy?

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.810
And if you don't have one maybe
raise your hand and we

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.650
can find somebody that isn't
connected to somebody.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:36.970
Does everybody have a buddy?

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.540
All right, would you pick an
A and B with your buddy?

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:47.250
Pick an A and a B. A and
a B. All right, great.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.140
Now, let me get you back.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.790
I'm going to raise our
hand to get us back.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:50.380
Come on back.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.200
All right, A and B. Now, I want
you to have an experience

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.050
of the wanting center of your
brain, the one that gets

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.820
co-opted all the time the minute
you have a sense of a

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.140
possible reward or even thinking
about something you

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.960
might like or want
in the future.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.690
And this is what gets triggered
when you smell that

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.390
burning coffee or hear
a little chime or

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.500
see that sexy girl.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.180
This is all the stuff
that gets triggered.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.340
So you're already
getting into it.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.160
I'm talking, you're smiling.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.590
So A and B, you're going
to talk at the

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.610
same time right now.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.895
And what I want you
to do, I want you

00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:21.580
to become want machines.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.510
Like, how many of you have ever
seen a two-year-old in a

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.980
grocery store?

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.670
What are they like?

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.730
I mean, they want everything.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.160
Like, what are they grabbing?

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:29.610
Everything.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.690
They want everything.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:30.980
They don't care.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.600
They just enjoy the sensation
of wanting.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.840
I mean, they're grabbing
tampons or Rolaids.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.430
They don't care what it is.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.610
They just want to want.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:40.040
So right now I want the two of
you to talk on top of one

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.920
another just naming as many
things as you possibly can

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.940
think of that you might want.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.170
You can say the same
thing over again.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.790
I want her to shut up.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.310
I want this to be over with.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:47.980
I want coffee.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.190
I want to go to do this.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.420
I want a hot new car.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.110
I want new clothes.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.850
I want to discover
blah, blah, blah.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.960
So two of you--

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.220
I'll cut you off in a second.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.530
But just talk on top
of one another.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.913
I want, I want, I want.

00:40:57.913 --> 00:40:59.760
I want, I want, I want.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.986
I want, I want, I want.

00:41:00.986 --> 00:41:02.860
Wanta, wanta, wanta, wanta.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:03.760
OK, let me get you back.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.350
Let me get you back.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.080
Good, come on back.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.720
Now, just tell me, how do
you feel right now?

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.520
Where is your energy?

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.500
What's it like?

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.190
Chaotic?

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.430
Yeah, Yeah.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.790
Can you feel?

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:13.390
Where's your energy?

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.160
Here, here, here?

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.060
Where is it?

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.700
It's kind of more
here, isn't it?

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.500
What do your eyes look like?

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.274
What did your buddy's
eyes look like?

00:41:19.274 --> 00:41:23.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.550
JUDITH WRIGHT: This is a
neurotransmitter dopamine.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.200
We get like this.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.890
This is the part that gets
co-opted all the time.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.220
You get high.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.060
You get kind of buzzed.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.810
You're kind of like, whoo.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.790
It's like a party.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.290
And how many of you even noticed
you had a buddy?

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.050
I mean, you kind of.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.690
But it's not even relevant.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.200
And you're just in this--

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.520
you're in your own zone
when this is going on.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.280
And what happens, sometimes you
don't even remember what

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.130
you said or what you want.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.720
You get forgetful.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.410
You get buzzed.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.195
You get kind of high.

00:41:48.195 --> 00:41:49.990
So this is dopamine
in our system.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.570
We need it because it's
what helps us get

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.600
motivated to take action.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.990
But you never get sated
in that center.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.000
It's not designed for that.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.530
So I'm going to teach you about
yearnings for a moment

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.840
and then give you a little
more to work with.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.650
Now go back to your buddy.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.080
And you picked who's
A and who's B?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.330
Take a deep breath.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.730
Now, close your eyes for a
second because I'm going to

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.510
give you the language of
yearning and then we're going

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.970
to play with that and
see the difference.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:18.540
So just close your eyes.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.000
And I'll say some of these
universal yearnings of the

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.240
human heart that are related
to our satisfaction center.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.210
I yearn to love and be loved.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.060
I yearn to matter.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.570
I yearn to make a difference.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.370
I yearn to be seen,
to be heard, to

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.170
touch and be touched.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:44.700
I yearn to the fulfil
my destiny.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.810
I yearn to create and
to develop and to

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.725
learn and to grow.

00:42:48.725 --> 00:42:53.370
I yearn to connect, to belong,
to be part of something

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.620
greater than myself.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.070
Think about those yearnings.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.650
See which ones feel
true to you.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.390
Chances are all of them will.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:03.675
But there might be one or two
that really touch your heart

00:43:03.675 --> 00:43:07.460
or feel most important to you.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.760
And take a deep breath.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.790
And now if you'd open your eyes
in silence, just look at

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.970
your buddy.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.620
And, A, I want you to start.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.950
I just want you to very--
just a brief thing.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.390
What I yearn to-- and just
fill in one thing.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.750
I yearn to be loved or connect
or make a difference or

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.550
matter, whatever feels
true for you.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.045
I yearn to-- just
say that phrase.

00:43:30.045 --> 00:43:31.295
I yearn to.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.400
All right, just return
to silence.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.690
Return to silence.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:39.300
Take it in.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.210
And B, you share one.

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:42.460
I yearn to.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.410
All right, good.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.650
Thank you.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.520
Now, come on back.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.020
Let me get you back.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.840
Now, tell me what your energy
feels like right now.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.583
Where you do you
feel this now?

00:43:55.583 --> 00:43:56.350
AUDIENCE: Calm.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:56.740
JUDITH WRIGHT: It's calmer.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.190
How many feel more calm,
more grounded now?

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.170
And it's not up here anymore.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.800
Where is it?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.280
Maybe more in your heart or
down somewhere grounded.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.500
How do you feel about your
buddy right now?

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.700
How many of you can't believe
you kind of like this person

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.740
after saying that?

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.030
You kind of got to know them.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.060
How many of you realized you
had a buddy in this part of

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.830
the exercise?

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:15.220
That happened.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.030
There's a person there.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.660
You're more there.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.290
There's something there.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.320
That's more of the opioids
and the oxytocin, the

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.540
neurotransmitters that you're
connecting with right now that

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.440
are helping you have this sense
of being sated, calmer.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.090
It's a satisfied pause.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.570
We need the balance of both
of these circuits.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:37.980
But when they compete, the
wanting always wins, not the

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.350
satisfaction center, not
the yearning center.

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.890
So we have to really learn to
focus on the yearning center

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.510
so we can have the satisfaction
and the

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.280
consciousness and the
mindfulness that we really

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.820
need and want in our lives.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.120
And let me tie this back
together with this whole thing

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.210
about soft addictions.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:52.980
What is this about?

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.290
What is that?

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:56.710
See what happens, our soft
addictions are cravings.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:57.470
They're wanting.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.270
They're all fueled by those
evolutionary centers, the

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.710
dopamine squirts, and that fix
and that getting high and the

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.330
things that have kept us
alive all this time.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:07.560
And we need them in order
to get motivated.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:11.150
But underneath every single soft
addiction, that wanting,

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.620
that craving, is a
deeper yearning.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.050
And the soft addiction is trying
to get our attention to

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.470
tell us what it is that
we really need.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.170
If you really, really want a
big old bowl of ice cream,

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.890
what do you think could possibly
be the yearning

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.262
underneath that?

00:45:25.262 --> 00:45:26.512
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:34.330
JUDITH WRIGHT: We got
to talk after, OK.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.410
If you want a big bowl of ice
cream, chances are you're

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.100
yearning for comfort or
maybe just literally

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.850
sweetness in your life.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.770
If you just have to check your
email or your Facebook page

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.140
compulsively right this second,
what do you think the

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.830
yearning might be
underneath that?

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:49.770
AUDIENCE: Connection.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.080
JUDITH WRIGHT: Connection.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.650
Connection, belonging, being
important, being part of

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.810
something, knowing that you
exist, all of that's

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.000
what's going on.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.930
So every soft addiction is
trying to tell you what it is

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.130
that you really need.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.590
However, we just keep indulging
that with that

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.690
automatic dopamine high.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.760
We never get the yearning met.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.160
And it never brings us as
present and conscious and

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.680
fulfilling as we possibly
can have in our lives.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.780
It doesn't bring us the results
of all those things we

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.920
talked about earlier
in the talk.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.960
So what I want you
to think about--

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.140
I'm going to give you
an assignment.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.680
And we can talk about it more
and you can ask some questions

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.690
and we can be with
this together.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.870
I want you to look at what
is it that you do

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:27.760
have cravings for.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.630
What do you want?

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.590
What are the wantings?

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:32.000
Like, that little guy going
wanna, wanna, wanna.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.120
Nothing wrong with wanting.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.840
Many people need to have
that activated.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.880
It helps us engage more
fully in life.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.590
But what's the deeper yearning
underneath that?

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:41.430
What is it trying to tell you?

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.250
Because then, if we really
want to design our lives,

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.920
unlike the design your life
examples I gave you earlier,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.140
the normal design, if you really
want to design your

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.340
life, you design it to meet
those yearnings, where every

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.330
moment you yearn to connect, to
contribute, to matter, to

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.560
love and be loved, to touch
and be touched, to make a

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.310
difference, to be present,
to learn, to grow.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.360
Every single moment of your life
can be guided by those

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.390
deeper yearnings and bring a
high quality to every single

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.070
second of your life.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.470
And if you start designing
your life to meet that,

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.320
everything starts shifting and
you have their motivation to

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.550
go after things in life.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:22.050
But you know how to get the
satisfaction with that.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.320
And what happens then?

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.280
You have more consciousness,
more time, more money, more

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.800
productivity, more intimacy,
more meaning, more

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.840
fulfillment, better stress
responses, all the things--

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.620
your IQ is functioning
the way it should be.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.720
Your thinking is clearer.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.560
Your critical thinking
is better.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.660
All these tremendous results
come from being mindful about

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.540
our mindlessness and learning
what our system is

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.900
trying to tell us.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.290
So your assignment is to think
about some of your yearnings

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.520
and what can you put into your
life more fully than you

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:57.270
already are that would meet
those and also stay aware of

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.010
what is that you want, what do
you crave, and to be willing

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.930
to tell what it is you really
yearn for underneath and add

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:05.120
more things to your life that
meet those yearnings.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.040
And what happens when you do
that, the more you meet those

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.200
yearnings, your soft addictions
start to melt away.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.870
You don't have to worry so much
about white knuckling

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.850
through things because the
need is getting met.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.170
So the same desire isn't
there in the same way.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.790
So you'll still use all the
beautiful things you use.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.110
You'll use your technology.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.320
You'll have beautiful food.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.010
You'll have all the things
that you might

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.700
be attracted to.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.930
But you use it differently in
a way that fulfills you and

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.420
makes you even a greater
gift in the world.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.570
So that's the big stuff
underneath what

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.440
this yearning is.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.540
And in fact, we've done more
research since this.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.880
This is going to be coming
out in our new book.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.690
It's going to be out the
beginning of the year.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.100
And found out that yearning is
actually the beginning of a

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.940
whole cycle of what people
go through that really

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.210
transformed their lives to
live spectacular lives.

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:57.850
Every hero you've ever had has
based their life on yearning.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.060
And then there's several other
things we found after that we

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.625
need to do-- engage
in things that

00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:03.070
really meet those yearnings.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.410
So we all have them.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.230
And I'd like to encourage you to
go and meet them some more

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:08.850
because you'll be an
even greater gift

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.120
than you already are.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.950
And if we can support you in any
way, I'd love to do that

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.800
and I'd love to hear any
questions that you have in a

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.540
few moments.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.710
And also before you leave, if
you'd like, we've got some

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.700
assists and supports for you,
some downloadable products.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.680
And we have a training you
can go to complementary,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:26.440
all kinds of things.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.590
But if you're interested we
have little cards for you.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.060
You can give us a business card
before you leave today.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.700
And I'd love to.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.310
It's part of my yearning to make
a bigger difference and

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.080
to have more friends on the
planet who are living the way

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.700
that we're talking
about today.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.270
So I just want to thank you.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.230
Thank you for having this time
together and spending this

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.860
time meeting yearnings.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.450
So thank you.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.740
And thanks, Rachel, for
making this happen.

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.990
Thank you.

00:49:52.652 --> 00:49:56.564
RACHEL: Are there
any questions?

00:49:56.564 --> 00:49:57.814
Questions, questions.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.210
JUDITH WRIGHT: Yeah, go ahead.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.730
We use consciousness things.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.850
We set a timer or whenever
you have a moment.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.340
We look inside just
what am I feeling?

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.890
I'm feeling anxious.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.230
I'm feeling whatever.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.060
And so it's more
of a presence.

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.690
So let me know what you find.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.970
And things that really help
us with our stress--

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.250
under stress we're so prone
to soft addictions.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:25.540
The executive centers of our
brain shrivel under stress.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.920
Our habit formation brain
gets bigger and

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.680
blooms during that time.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.050
So what we really need are
things that actually help us

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:32.710
reduce stress.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:34.470
But it's not all the mindless
stuff we do.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.520
It's talking with a friend.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.850
It's listening to music.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.650
It's reading something
beautiful.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.610
It's exercising.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.620
It's being in nature.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.470
It's all the things that
actually reduce our stress and

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:46.640
bring our brain functions
back.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.470
So any other questions
or thoughts

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.880
that you want to share?

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.550
Yeah?

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:50.762
AUDIENCE: I'd like to know
a bit more about

00:50:50.762 --> 00:50:52.240
the avoidance ones.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.440
JUDITH WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.300
Yeah, if you look at it,
avoidances have meaning.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.860
There's a yearning behind
those as well.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.030
Oftentimes, procrastination,
there's a yearning for

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.160
comfort, a yearning for
security, a yearning for

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.390
protection.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.730
One of the reasons people
procrastinate is that they

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.710
know the minute they start
working on something they're

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:15.420
going to get driven so they
limit the amount of time that

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.270
they're going to work on it.

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:17.020
That's not everybody.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.170
But some people do that.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:21.100
So they're trying to protect
themselves from getting lost

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:21.710
in some way.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.790
So for each person the yearning

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:24.890
can be a little different.

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.130
But there is a different
yearning.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:27.990
How many of you are
procrastinators?

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.750
I have been one and am one.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.880
And it's really interesting
because it's hard to see

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.310
what's the positive, what's the
yearning underneath that.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:37.910
But often time it's a way that
we're trying to take care of

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:42.420
ourselves rather than adding
things to our life

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.870
that would calm us.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.270
Because procrastination,
we're usually scared.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:49.090
We may not have the information
we need.

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.650
We may need more help.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.140
It may feel like a big cliff
we've got to get over.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.770
And we need more help.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:56.820
We need more resources.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.330
We need more strategy.

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:00.520
And it's a clue for us to
prepare and take care of

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.730
ourselves rather than
just a push it away.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.770
Does that work for you?

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:05.590
Thank you.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.330
Yeah.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.580
OK, great.

00:52:13.656 --> 00:52:15.863
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, what
was it about the people

00:52:15.863 --> 00:52:18.089
you learned from, the people who
you were taking care of--

00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:19.043
disabled--

00:52:19.043 --> 00:52:22.382
that enabled them
to avoid these?

00:52:22.382 --> 00:52:24.770
Did they not have the time?

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:27.580
JUDITH WRIGHT: You know, it's
interesting because I'm not

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.510
sure exactly how to describe
what their

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:31.650
motivation was or whatever.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.890
But there was something about
they were so present in the

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.100
moment doing what they could
to learn and grow and take

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.450
advantage of the situations
that they had,

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:42.260
that it wasn't about--

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.300
they couldn't be under the
illusion that someday

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.730
it'll all be OK.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.180
Someday it'll all be perfect.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.210
So they weren't so--

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.130
there was a being present
and a genuineness.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.210
They couldn't hide
their mistakes.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.630
Like one guy I worked with,
he was deaf and he

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:58.820
had cerebral palsy.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.510
And he came to me one day
and he was laughing.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:02.600
I said, what are you
laughing about?

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.270
And he said, I was just at
the-- he used sign there.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.410
I was just in the cafeteria
and I was eating my lunch.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:07.370
You know, I've got CP.

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:09.040
So the food's flying
all over the place.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.860
And it's all over me.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.220
And I said, what's so
funny about that?

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.660
And he said, all the
kids were laughing.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.030
And I said, what's so
funny about that?

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.650
And he said, I can't
hear them.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.100
So wow, there was just this--

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.860
I'm not saying that everybody
was like that.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:25.090
But there was this just dealing
with what life had in

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:29.430
the moment, vulnerably, present
with feelings, with

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.710
the upset, the frustration,
the anger, the joy of any

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.455
small success that
was an experience

00:53:35.455 --> 00:53:37.790
that I wasn't having.

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:39.840
And the families that were
dealing with these little kids

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.700
with these disabilities, the
ones that went through the

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.480
tough work of mourning the loss
of the child they thought

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.765
they were going to have so they
could love the one they

00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:50.150
had, there was an appreciation
and acceptance of what was,

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.220
what is, that created a lot
more satisfaction and

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.800
happiness in those families
even after the so-called

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.890
tragedy and then before.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.910
So there's this facing a reality
and being genuine in

00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.670
the moment that was a quality
that I hadn't been having in

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:04.220
my own life.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:04.870
RACHEL: Thank you very much.

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:05.230
JUDITH WRIGHT: Great.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:05.880
Thanks, Rachel.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.480
Thanks all of you.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.980
Thank you.

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.230
Thanks.
