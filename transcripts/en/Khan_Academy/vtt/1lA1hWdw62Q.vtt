00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:02.215
- [Instructor] Olga was asked to find

00:00:02.215 --> 00:00:05.263
where f of x is equal to x
minus two to the fourth power

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:06.667
has inflection points.

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:08.379
This is her solution.

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.134
So we look at her solution
and then they ask us,

00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:12.170
is Olga's work correct?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.292
If not, what's her mistake?

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:17.428
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:19.219
Alright, let's just follow her work.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.664
So here, she's trying to
take the first derivative.

00:00:21.664 --> 00:00:23.093
So you would apply the chain rule.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:26.230
It would be four times x
minus two to the third power

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.165
times the derivative of x
minus two which is just one.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:30.998
So this checks out.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.265
Then you take the derivative of this.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.340
It'd be three times four which would be 12

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.496
times x minus two to the second power

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.694
times the derivative of x
minus two which is just one

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:40.360
which is exactly what she has here,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.848
12 times x minus two to the second power.

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:46.151
That checks out so step
one's looking good for Olga.

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.539
Step two, the solution
of the second derivative

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.946
equaling zero is x equals two.

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.046
That looks right.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.835
The second derivative is 12
times x minus two squared

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:58.992
and we wanna make that equal to zero.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:02.623
This is only going to be
true when x is equal to two.

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:05.155
So step two is looking good.

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:09.171
So step three, Olga says
f has an inflection point

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.743
at x equals two.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.343
So she's basing this just on the fact

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:16.364
that the second derivative is
zero when x is equal to two.

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:18.205
She's basing this just on the fact

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:21.513
that f prime prime of
two is equal to zero.

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.391
Now, I have a problem with this

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.593
because the fact that
your second derivative

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:26.983
is zero at x equals two,

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.594
that makes two a nice
candidate to check out

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:31.224
but you can't immediately say

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.591
that we have an inflection point there.

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.657
Remember, an inflection
point is where we go

00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:38.194
from being concave upwards
to concave downwards

00:01:38.194 --> 00:01:40.475
or concave downwards to concave upwards

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.634
and speaking in the language
of the second derivative,

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:45.689
it means that the second
derivative changes signs

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.336
as we go from below x equals
two to above x equals two

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:51.560
but we have to test that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.123
because it's not
necessarily always the case.

00:01:54.123 --> 00:01:56.159
So let's actually test it.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.056
Let's think about some intervals.

00:01:59.056 --> 00:01:59.889
Intervals.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.519
So let's think about the interval

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.130
when we go from negative infinity to two

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.069
and let's think about the interval

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.636
where we go from two to positive infinity.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:13.163
If you want, you could
have some test values.

00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:16.137
You could think about the sign,

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:18.554
sign of our second derivative

00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:23.976
and then based on that, you
could think about concavity,

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.226
concavity of f.

00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:29.966
So let's think about what's happening.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.312
So you could take a test value.

00:02:31.312 --> 00:02:33.474
Let's say one is in this interval

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.309
and let's say three is in this interval

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.637
and you could say one minus
two squared is going to be,

00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:41.819
let's see, that's negative
one squared which is one

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.585
and then you're just going to,
this is just going to be 12

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:48.090
so this is going to be positive
and if you tried three,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.781
three minus two squared is one times 12.

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.534
Well, that's also going to be positive

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:55.591
and so you're going to be concave upwards.

00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:57.177
At least in these test values,

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.002
it looks like on either side of two

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.291
that the sign of the second derivative

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:03.163
is positive on either side
of the two and you might say,

00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:05.892
well, maybe I just need
to find closer values

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:08.094
but if you inspect the
second derivative here,

00:03:08.094 --> 00:03:10.335
you can see that this is
never going to be negative.

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:14.028
In fact, for any value
other than x equals two

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.930
and this value right
over here since we're,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.868
even if x minus two is
negative, you're squaring it

00:03:18.868 --> 00:03:20.660
which will make this entire thing positive

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.899
and then multiplying it
times a positive value.

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.409
So for any value other than x equals two,

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.860
the sign of our second
derivative is positive

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.319
which means that we're
going to be concave upwards

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.558
and so we actually don't
have an inflection point

00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:37.207
at x equals two because
we are not switching signs

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:41.119
as we go from values
less than x equals two

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.518
to values greater than x equals two.

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:46.820
Our second derivative
is not switching sides.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.781
So once again, this is incorrect.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.349
We actually don't have an
inflection point at x equals two

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.077
because our second derivative
does not switch signs

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:55.831
as we cross x equals two

00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.331
which means our concavity does not change.
