00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.260
The modern world is wonderful in many ways
(dentistry is good, cars are reliable, we

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.990
can so easily keep in touch from Mexico with
our grandmother in Scotland) – but it’s

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.100
also powerfully and tragically geared to causing
a high background level of anxiety and widespread

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.810
low-level depression. There are six particular
features of modernity that have this psychologically

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.500
disturbing effect. Each one has a potential
cure, which we will only collectively put

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.260
into action when we know more about the disease
in question. Here are the six: 1. Meritocracy:

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.890
Our societies tell us that everyone is free
to make it if they have the talent and energy.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.650
The down side of this ostensibly liberating
and beautiful idea is that any perceived lack

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.960
of success is taken to be not, as in the past,
an accident or misfortune, but a sure sign

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.079
of a lack of talent or laziness. If those
at the top deserve all their success, then

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.629
those at the bottom must surely deserve all
their failure. A society that thinks of itself

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.040
as meritocratic turns poverty from a problem
to evidence of damnation and those who have

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.530
failed from unfortunates to losers. The cure
is a strong, culturally endorsed belief in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.299
two big ideas: luck, which says success doesn’t
just depend on talent and effort; and tragedy,

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.439
which says good, decent people can fail and
deserve compassion, rather than contempt.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.390
2. Individualism: An individualistic society
preaches that the individual and their achievements

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.079
are everything and that everyone is capable
of a special destiny. It is not the community

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.270
that matters; the group is for no-hopers.
To be ‘ordinary’ is regarded as a curse.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.750
The result is that the very thing that most
of us will end up being, statistically speaking,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.140
is associated, with freakish failure. The
cure is a cult of the good ordinary life – and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:13.460
proper appreciation of the pleasures and quiet
heroism of the everyday. 3. Secularism: Secular

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.930
societies cease to believe in anything that
is bigger than or beyond themselves. Religions

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.170
used to perform the useful service of keeping
our petty ways and status battles in perspective.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.680
But now there is nothing to awe or relativise
humans, whose triumphs and mishaps end up

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.519
feeling like the be all and end all. A cure
would involve regularly using sources of transcendence

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.349
to generate a benign, relativising perspective
on our personal sorrows: music, the stars

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.959
at night, the vast spaces of the desert or
the ocean would humble us all in consoling

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.879
ways. 4. Romanticism: The philosophy of Romanticism
tells us that each of us has one very special

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.519
person out there who can make us completely
happy. Yet mostly we have to settle for moderately

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.299
bearable relationships with someone who is
very nice in a few ways and pretty difficult

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.719
in many others. It feels like a disaster – in
comparison with our original huge hopes. The

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.829
cure is to realise that we didn’t go wrong:
we were just encouraged to believe in a very

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.830
improbable dream. Instead we should build
up our ambitions around friendship and non-sexual

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.999
love. 5. The Media: The media has immense
prestige and a huge place in our lives – but

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:47.269
routinely directs our attention to things
that scare, worry, panic and enrage us, while

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.790
denying us agency or any chance for effective
personal action. It typically attends to the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.379
least admirable sides of human nature, without
a balancing exposure to normal good intentions,

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.540
responsibility and decency. At its worst,
it edges us towards mob justice. The cure

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.159
would be news that concentrated on presenting
solutions rather than generating outrage,

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.730
that was alive to systemic problems rather
than gleefully emphasizing scapegoats and

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.150
emblematic monsters – and that would regularly
remind us that the news we most need to focus

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:30.080
on comes from our own lives and direct experiences.
6. Perfectibility: Modern societies stress

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.970
that it is within our remit to be profoundly
content, sane and accomplished. As a result,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.100
we end up loathing ourselves, feeling weak
and sensing we’ve wasted our lives. A cure

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.890
would be a culture that endlessly promotes
the idea that perfection is not within our

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.910
grasp – that being mentally slightly (and
at points very) unwell is an inescapable part

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.750
of the human condition and that what we need
above all are good friends with whom we can

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.810
sit and honestly discuss our real fears and
vulnerabilities. The forces of psychological

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.690
distress in our world are – currently – much
wealthier and more active than the needed

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.680
cures. We deserve tender pity for the price
we have to pay for being born in modern times.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.500
But more hopefully, cures are now open to
us individually and collectively if only we

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.160
recognise, with sufficient clarity, the sources
of our true anxieties and sorrows.
