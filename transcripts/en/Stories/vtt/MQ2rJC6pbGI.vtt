[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:06.890
LAURA LING: You're
a philosopher.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.140
You've been described
as a Timothy

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.430
Leary for the viral video age.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.702
What sorts of things are you
waxing poetic about these days?

00:00:15.702 --> 00:00:17.160
JASON SILVA: Pretty
much every time

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.030
I stumble upon an idea that
captures my imagination,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.250
something articulated in
a counter intuitive way,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.490
a different spin on
technology, a different spin

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.150
on the future of humanity, that
kind of gets my motors going

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.270
really, really fast.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090
LAURA LING: Tell me about
your series "Shots of Awe."

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.131
JASON SILVA: So "Shots of
Awe" came from a desire

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:44.030
to use media, to use cameras
to immortalize inspiration.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.923
I refuse to accept
that these moments had

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:47.040
to be passing moments.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.230
I was like no, no, no.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.172
I choose to film them, to
record them, to capture them.

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:53.630
And it was a way of gaining
control over these experiences.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.160
And I could create an
intersubjective communication

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.930
with somebody else,
because I actually

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.510
got to show you what it
was like to be in my head

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.815
when I had this epiphany.

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:06.790
So "Shots of Awe" are
philosophical espresso shots,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.830
this condensed
trailers for ideas.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.610
What they hint at
is the exception,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.116
a vision of something more.

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:15.740
LAURA LING: Tell me
about your process,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.840
your ritual, how you
are able to come up

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800
with these stream of
consciousness riffs?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.140
JASON SILVA: I started getting
into this idea of flow states

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050
because I read this
article that talked

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.350
about doing brain scans
on freestyle rappers

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.570
when they were improvising.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.111
And then they did
brain scans on them

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:35.670
when they were reciting
memorized lyrics.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.830
And what the studies
found, a part

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.820
of the brain that is responsible
for our self-editing, our sense

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.510
of self-consciousness, that part
goes dim during the freestyle.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.430
So essentially, you're
getting out of your own way.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.135
It's like that line
in "Black Swan" that

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:52.210
say perfection is not
just about control,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.540
it's also about letting go.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.425
So I can have all my
notes and my thoughts

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:56.896
and my ideas and this and that.

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.020
But then I go for the walk.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.830
I go into the woods.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.079
I go to Sea Ranch, California.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.080
I go to Big Sur.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.910
I go to some park.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.110
And just the stroll and the
disconnection from distraction

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.000
gets your brain daydreaming.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.504
When you're in
daydreaming mode, you

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:12.545
start to do a little bit
of the lateral thinking.

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:14.760
So you start connecting
this to that and this.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.725
So you start to go
through the aha moments.

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:20.325
And if you are lucky enough
to have the camera around,

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.945
you're capturing
that real time flow.

00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.130
It's creativity
happening in real time.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.490
I mean it literally
feels like channeling.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.580
So for me, I figured out
how to create my flow state.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.640
And the results tend to be these
riffs that people really love.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.160
And they're like what,
there's no script.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.250
That was a completely
extemporaneous stream

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.120
of consciousness?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.120
I'm normally kind of an
introvert and kind of shy

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.050
in most social situation.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.680
But if the conditions are
right, like a flame it emerges.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000
We never have a true,
accurate rendition of reality

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.780
because it's all about our
perception, our projections,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.800
our longings.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.570
Our romantic partners
are creations

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.190
and we are the creators.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.120
LAURA LING: So you said if you
can create that flow state,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.540
how do create it?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.770
JASON SILVA: I have found
that the best way is to take

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.606
yourself out of context,
so a new experience,

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:17.650
a new space in a new place so
that I transcend what Michael

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.110
Pollan calls the been there's
and done that's of the adult

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.560
mind/ And I can enter the
consciousness of the child.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.025
I can be in wonderment.

00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:26.980
I can be curious
about everything

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.210
around me-- so rest,
relaxation, novel spaces, novel

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.996
environments,
disconnection, disconnection

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.370
from the every
day, disconnection

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.745
from your daily
responsibilities,

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:38.480
disconnection from
your trivialities,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.060
just a daydream space,
a space to dream,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.130
to fuse cognition and dream.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.276
LAURA LING: What happens when
you don't achieve that flow?

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:48.650
JASON SILVA: If
it's not working,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.090
I become highly anxious.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.260
Actually, irritable is
probably the best word.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.420
I just kind of retreat.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.490
I just withdraw.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.410
LAURA LING: Can you describe how
it feels to be in that state?

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.180
JASON SILVA: It feels like
unbelievable lucidity, instant

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.010
recall, just this capacity to
explain what you're feeling

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.020
and what you were
thinking effortlessly.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.510
Do we love the harder?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.420
Do we squeeze tighter?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.480
You just feel your best,
and you perform your best.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.230
The minute you choose one
thing you've effectively

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.260
said no to everything else.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.910
And there's a gnawing anxiety in
realize that you can't possibly

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.740
have it all.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.270
I'm like a reality hacker.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.320
I'm like literally hacking
my ontological reality.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.670
And I'm studying how to trigger
certain moods and modalities.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.810
I'm literally playing
with my consciousness

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.782
so that I can feel how I want
to feel when I want to feel it

00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:47.964
as often as possible.

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:49.630
LAURA LING: How
important is this ritual

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.860
of achieving that flow state?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.520
JASON SILVA: Hugely important.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.630
You are building the
foundations for something

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.670
magical to happen.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.100
The ritual is as important
as chopping the wood

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.880
and making sure it's dry
before you light the fire.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.160
It's providing the
necessary ingredients

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.550
for you cognitive salad.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.590
It's very, very,
very, very important.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.430
Almost, I would say
that it's everything.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.990
LAURA LING: I hope
you were inspired

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.702
by Jason Silva's ritual and
discover your own flow state.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.410
This series is so
special to me because I

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.330
learn something new from
every person we future.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.590

stuntman prepares

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.715
to get lit on fire.

00:05:54.715 --> 00:05:56.590
JAMES ARMSTRONG: If I'm
about to do something

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.890
and I feel my heart
thumping or my hand shaking,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.190
then I'll close my
eyes and I breathe,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.032
[INHALING]

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.990
JAMES ARMSTRONG: There
is no other distraction,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.890
no other thought.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.940
It's just this absolute pinpoint
focus of the task at hand.
