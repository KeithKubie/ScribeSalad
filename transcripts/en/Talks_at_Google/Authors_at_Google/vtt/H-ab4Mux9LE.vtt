&gt;&gt; Welcome to another Authors at Google event.
I'm very excited to introduce Tyler Shores.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.150
He was a former Googler and also works on
Authors at Google program. Today, he'll be

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.029
discussing his contribution to the book, "Heroes
and Philosophy," which is the first book to

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.820
examine the philosophy behind the hit show
Heroes. Before Heroes, he studies another

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.039
hit show, The Simpsons. At UC Berkley were
he received his undergraduate degree in English

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.380
and Rhetoric, Tyler used the Simpsons as his
primary case study to teach a class on Postmodern

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.530
Parody and Subjectivity in Mass Culture. If
you're like me, you'll be excited to here

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.980
that Tyler has three more books coming out.
So keep watching your favorite shows, you'll

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.260
definitely have an intellectual justification
for watching them. While not writing, Tyler

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.739
is a project manager for the Center for Civic
Education. Please join me in welcoming Tyler

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.790
Shores.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: All right. Well, thank you for

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:03.070
that. It feels very nice to be back here and
also a little disorienting, I think, because

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.459
I can--I can't even count the number of times
I've been on the other end of this author's

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.709
talks and secretly fantasizing that, boy,
I wish, you know, one day it would be me speaking

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.340
at the podium. So, here I am now and, hopefully,
I don't blow this. And I also want to say

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.520
that, you know, I think it's safe to assume
I'm not anywhere near as rich and famous as

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.189
pretty much anyone who has ever done an author's
talk. So I think it's okay for me to say that,

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.659
like the first time I saw, you know, something
I've written on the BookShelf that Barnes

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.240
and Noble ordered, it was pretty cool. I took
a picture of it and I think I may post it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.469
on Facebook because it was pretty exciting.
And I'm going to share one funny story and

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.130
get down to the, like more interesting stuff
that--because it's too good of a story not

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.729
to share. Apparently, a previous Authors at
Google, a guest, said during the course of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.599
his talk that women who would go on dates
with him, with it, inevitably do a Google

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:09.530
search on him, and he remarketering, during
his talk that, oh the YouTube talk with the,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.750
you know, inevitably be one of the search
results that is, his stalkers in waiting with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.621
the, would see on there.
So, assuming there's anyone else in the world

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:28.360
besides myself who Googles my name, I'd kind
of like to test theory so--we'll see, okay.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.431
See the sad part is I could tell jokes and
funny stories like probably the whole time

00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.930
but actually took notes that I can say more
on topic because the reason why I'm here of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.391
course is talk about Heroes and Philosophies.
So first of all why a book, why a book on

00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:47.330
the "Heroes and Philosophy"? And I want to
answer that question by touching briefly on

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.180
some specifics and then speaking more generally.
One of the things that makes heroes specifically

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.430
such an appropriate fit for a book about philosophy
is that there's a number of very philosophically

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.540
interesting themes that are kind of in a woven
through the, excuse me, the course of the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.710
narrative of the show, or if not themes that
we use topics that are, you know, lend themselves

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.690
very easily that philosophical reflection.
For example, you know, we have a show that

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.150
is about Heroes and Villains at Core which,
you know, therefore, it leads us to questions

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.960
on the nature of good and evil, which I'm
going to talk about more in a little bit.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.760
The character such as Hiro Nakamura and/or
Sylar represent good and evil in the very

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.550
straight forward sense with characters like
Heroes say people and characters like Sylar

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.820
who kill people. We have many other characters
in the show that are painted with much subtler

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.420
with shades of gray. We have like, you know,
Nathan Petrelli and Noah Bennett who--they

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.080
do make us ask this question about like, what
exactly is a hero or villain on the show?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.510
And that's one of the things for people who
followed it from season one through the upcoming

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.750
season four. They've, you know, they've done
something interesting with this. The show

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.330
is kind of question, just kind of moral uncertainty
of the status and some of the characters.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.030
So that's one of the philosophical, you know,
underpinnings of the show that I want us to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.680
talk about a little more. And another thing
I think that is probably worth mentioning

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.650
is that philosophy is not just something that
philosophers do. The argument is thatâ€”well,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.550
I would say that philosophy is something that
we all do all of the time. It really just

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.379
becomes a question not so much if we're doing
philosophy but rather, that what degree of,

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.139
you know, like how cognizant are we of the
philosophy that we're already doing. When

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.319
we think about the ultimate meaning of something,
whatever it is, we're doing philosophy. When

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.169
we question the rightness or the wrongness
of a person's actions, we're doing philosophy.

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.460
When we--we wonder to ourselves what kind
of person we are or why we find something

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.369
meaningful, we're doing philosophy. So, a
book that combines a popular culture in philosophy

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.169
kind of--hopefully, it will make us more aware
of the fact that philosophy is much closer

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.909
to us in our everyday lives than we normally,
usually realize. So, let's talk specifically

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:24.020
about how Heroes and Philosophy works though.
I would think that good stories and good philosophy

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.529
are alike and that they carry a certain resonance,
like they touch upon certain elements of the

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.900
human condition and human existence that like,
you know, they begin to take on aspects of

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.809
the universal. We can't help but relate to
these things and that's, you know, one thing

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:50.259
that Heroes is a good story, is a good show,
is inherently interesting to us in this way.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.460
There's something about Heroes and I'll talk
about this in a little more detail, but like

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.589
you know, on--in almost like archetypical
level, like there are certain like, you know,

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:02.009
like very fundamental questions that I think
we try to--we've tried really hard in the

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:09.150
book to kind of bring out and discuss a little
more. But one of the reasons why I think Heroes

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.169
and Philosophies such a cool topic is--the
whole notion of the superhero, [INDISTINCT],

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.139
kind of represents our own modern day mythology
when we're really start to think about it.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.839
If you think, for instance, like of ancient
Greek and ancient Roman Mythology we have

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:29.259
these larger than life figures. But at the
same time, we have these characters that--on

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.110
the one hand we want them to be beyond the
scope of, you know, like human lamentation

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.789
and human potential, but at the same time,
we want them to be deeply flub, we want them

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.849
to have their own, you know, shortcomings
and then in that way we kind of see more of

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.120
ourselves in these characters. So we want
them to be both above us, you know, like you

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.099
know, beyond the can of human limitation but
at the same time, we don't want them to be

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.599
any better than us, so that's kind of like
the--if we think about mythological figures,

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.550
that is sort of in a way what, like the superhero,
[INDISTINCT], kind of does for us if you think

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.490
of the help--excuse me--like any of the characters
nowadays like, you know, Spiderman or any

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.509
of this other characters. You know, the other
superheroes and they have their, you know,

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.229
their things that make them super but, they
certainly have things to make them very, you

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.680
know, human too and that's something that
I think heroes does very well. Like we have

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.360
these characters who were really supposed
to be like, you know, the promise of the show

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.139
is what if ordinary people were just to wake
up with super powers one day and like, you

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:30.430
know, it brings you through that process,
and philosophically gets kind of interesting.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:37.430
Hiro, Hiro Nakamura is a great character for
a number of reasons and like he fits this

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.990
per--first of all, his name is Hiro. But the
second of all like, you know, just think about

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.939
it for a second if you've watched the show,
he struggles to do the right thing, he struggles

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:49.809
to like, you know, find himself and try to
like fulfill his destiny of what it is he's

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:56.649
trying to do. That makes it inherently more
relatable to us. People in real life can be

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:02.369
brave, they can be bold, they can be decisive
but, in real life, people are just as likely

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:06.850
to be cowardly and indecisive and make the
wrong decisions so there's that element too.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:13.930
There's the fact that we want heroes who can
do the right thing but struggle to do that.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:19.289
The characters make for interesting drama
in the show because of these flaws. Like,

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:24.599
there's something oddly, comforting about
valuable heroes I think. And when we imagine--I

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:29.309
think this says something too about the way
in which we kind of imagine like our heroes

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:37.810
fragilities, it says something about us too.
On a deeper level, we kind of want imperfect

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.800
heroes. We want heroes, we don't have it easy
because we are not, we are imperfect and we

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.620
don't have it easy and we see some--it's easier
for us to see more of ourselves in this kind

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.500
of struggles. For those of us that have been
regular viewers of the show, that first season

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.030
was appealing to me for some of these reasons
that I'm just talking about. I think season

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.090
one was a very good season of, you know, television
period. The idea of taking, you know, like

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.910
I said, seemingly ordinary people and like
putting them in this contexts were they have

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.720
to discover that they're not as ordinary as
they thought and they have to discover that

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.400
they're different than who they thought they
were. This is, you know, these are things

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.480
that are not hard for us to imagine like,
you know, forget the super powers thing but

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.680
it's not hard for us to imagine that we have
to, you know, we're putting a position were

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.860
all of a sudden we're unfettered from our
normal context and we have to think in terms

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:35.740
of who are we and, you know, why are we doing
these things. So there are some like interesting

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.940
things, like these larger issues that I'm
talking about. But, speaking of interest,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.430
I want to talk specifically about what I wrote
in the Heroes and Philosophy volume, and the

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.380
topic was on time and meaning in Nietzsche
and heroes. Time to me is such a philosophically

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.030
interesting topic. I--our understanding of
time on the most like fundamental levels really

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:07.600
does inform a lot of, who we are as people,
as human beings. Many philosophers have argued

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.560
that, you know, man or woman is essentially,
a temporal being that we define our existence

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:21.260
and/or identity in terms of time. On a less
like you know, lofty level like, we can pretty

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.320
much say that we are obsessed with time. Like,
to see how this possessiveness plays out,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.470
we just need to look at, you know--like think
about for a second, like the language that

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.210
we use when we're talking about time. We're
always aware of the ways in which we spend

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.930
our time. When we're enjoying ourselves, we
say that we're having the time of our life.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.990
When we are disappointed with the outcome
of something, we say that was a waste of time.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.900
When we're at work, we say that we're on the
clock. When we are not at work, we say that

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.090
we're taking time off or we're on vacation
time and so on and so on, you like the idea.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:57.460
But like time has that, like omnipresent sort
of feature on our everyday lives, just count

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.090
for instance the number of ways that you can
tell time, I've got my clock, I've got my

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.570
phone, I've got--there's a little time were
up here, but just think about in your home

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:09.570
or your office, or your apartment or whatever
like the ways to tell time, the ways to measure

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.661
time, or ways to be reminded of time are everywhere
on our--in on everything. So it's interesting,

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:20.620
it's interesting to think about and, you know,
underlying that cause, it's almost like--I

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.530
don't know what it's called, it almost like
in uncertainty or a feeling that if we're

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.760
not paying attention to time, we're worried
that something is going to happen to us, or

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.040
some--that something is going to happen to
time, so there's that--that omnipresent awareness.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.330
The only two places that you can't see reminders
of time, at least the ones that I could think

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.320
of were the post office and casinos so the
places that you're wasting time the most are

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.450
the places where you don't want to be reminded
of time. But anyways, that's sort of like

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.330
mindfulness of time and meaning is kind of
what, where I decided to write about and that

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:56.531
it's certainly a major theme within Heroes.
Hiro, the character, you know, his super powers,

00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:01.391
the ability to stop time and to move backwards
and forwards through time. So there's that

00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:07.570
kind of, you know, sci-fi thought problem
that we can sort of, sort of play with. There's

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.880
a moment in the show when Hiro--very early,
it's like the second or third episode. He's

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.380
trying to explain how his powers worked to
his friend Ando, and he said, "People think

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.440
that time runs in a straight line," he draws
a straight line but he actually runs like

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.020
this, in a circle. So, that is extremely significant
to me I think in terms of, when I talk about

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.900
in the chapter on Nietzsche--the general premise
of Nietzsche's ideas is what he calls the

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.710
eternal recurrence. That time isn't whinier,
the time doesn't necessarily run in a straight

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:45.330
line but he wants us to think that time can
run over and over again in the fashion of

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:51.720
like a circle. He uses his idea of the eternal
recurrence ask us to imagine that our entire

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.490
life would recur over and over, and over again
in an endless loop of kind of this, you know,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.139
undifferentiated sameness. So, he ask us to
like actually think about this for a second,

00:13:02.139 --> 00:13:05.280
"What would you think like what would you
do, what would you response to this sort of

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.170
situation?" It's not like this is supposed
to be something that could or would happen,

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.980
but he wants to do like, think in terms of
like, you know, how you view your life? Like,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.050
you know, if everything would repeat over
and over, and over again for all eternity.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:23.971
It supposed to be a thought problem and the
eternal recurrence--what Nietzsche's means

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:27.840
by this is that, everything that has happened
and is happening and will happen, will happen

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:37.650
over and over, and over, and over again. When
we start to think about it in a minute, we're

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.970
actually supposed to realize that this is
a horrible, horrible thing. In example from

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:48.690
the show that I could illustrate this is at
the end of season two in hero--for those of

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:54.180
you who have seen the episodes, he traps Adam
Monroe in a coffin. Adam Monroe is like the

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.450
bad guy in season two but he's a person who,
you know, like his super powers is to live

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.180
really long, so he's several hundred years
old. But, when you think about that for a

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:07.050
second, being alive but stuck in a coffin
basically forever doing the same thing over

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.040
and over again which is nothing, that is pretty
much the eternal recurrence in a nutshell,

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.150
that's like the--the awful weightiness that
Nietzsche wants to impress upon us. It's supposed

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:21.150
to be awful, it's supposed to be that feeling
of unmitigated, you know, lack of change and

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.430
no hope of there ever being a change. So,
it's a thought problem, it's kind of a downer

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.290
but that's what philosophy is sometimes. So,
Nietzsche and like I want to quote one of

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.730
his works directly from the Gay Science, he
describes the situation in the following way.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.420
"There will be nothing new in it, but every
pain and every joy and every thought, and

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.240
every sign, and everything and honorably small
and great in your life will have to return

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:52.120
to you all in the same succession and sequence."
So, time and repetition are prominent themes

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.470
in the first season. When you think about
the--like the tag line, for what the show

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.410
first became famous for, save the cheerleaders,
save the world, I mean the basic idea behind

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:07.710
that was that, the future mustn't repeat itself
in the present. They saw this like, you know,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.240
post-apocalyptic thing that happens, New York
City blows up, and then they're supposed to

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.850
go back into the present to stop the future
from happening. So again, this time and repetition

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.690
themes were very prominent in the show even
they're not necessarily spelled out in that

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.980
way. So it's clear in the show why we don't
want things to happen like that, why we don't

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.920
want things to repeat. We don't want New York
City to blow up, so Hiro travels back in time.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.710
But for Nietzsche he puts to us the question,
"If we could change things to be other than

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.410
they were, what does that tell us about ourselves?
Why would we want to do that? Why do we want

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:48.570
thinks to change?" And I'm going to come back
and like try to offer an explanation for the

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:55.570
answer. But, the way when we answer this question
kind of serves as, a way of providing some

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:00.350
sort of insight to ourselves about how we
view our lives and how we view the sort of

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.070
way everything should be connected. For Nietzsche,
we understand that a single moment can be

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:10.791
like a fundamental measure of time. We find
moments, if you think about, you know, any

00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:16.000
moment in particular, moments are so valuable
because they are so pleading and so transient.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.901
Some people spent their whole lives trying
to pursue a lost moment or waiting for a moment

00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:27.000
that never happens. But the idea of the eternal
recurrence is that, what would you--how do

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.270
you feel about that moment? That, whatever
it is that you have schemed so highly, if

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.051
that same thing were to happen over and over,
and over again, could you possibly like, you

00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:40.420
know, care as much about it were to repeat?
No, you couldn't, that's--by definition, it's

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.250
that finitude that sense of, you know, fleetingness
that we find so valuable in which we derive

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:52.720
the meaning and, you know, contentment from.
So, it--like, as a thought problem this idea

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.560
of everything recurring over and over again
is actually a very interesting one when you

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.470
start to apply it to, you know, different
moments in time and different moment from

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:06.470
your life. There's a clear parallel I think
in this regard that Nietzsche's philosophy,

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.839
any events that's unfolds in the first season
of Heroes. From the season's final--final

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.579
episode which is called "How to stop an exploding
man?" The entire future does seem to hinge

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:21.790
on this one moment when, you know, the ultimate
future that they though was going to happen,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.870
it doesn't happen and it's because of that
one thing that happens without spoiling too

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:30.820
much people; we're interested in the show
but haven't seen it yet. And you know, basically,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:36.540
things are very different afterwards as results
of that. And approve that, I wasn't like making

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:41.570
all of the stuff up. If you look closely in
one of the episodes from season three, Arthur

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:47.660
Petrelli who's, like he's the bad guy of the
show in that season. He's actually holding

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:53.590
a copy of one of Nietzsche's books: "Thus
Spoke Zarathustra". It's none insignificant

00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:00.450
detail, and given the stuff that cover in
the chapter on Nietzsche but, the point is,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.130
the philosophy is there if we care to look
for it. Usually the philosophy isn't quite

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.690
as transparent as the character like actually
holding the book--actually it's never that

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.840
obvious. Is like a character holding a book
and saying like, you know, this is the philosophy

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.210
that we're talking about, but it shows that
philosophy is present in a lot of ways if

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.630
we, you know, cared to look for these things
and observe like those sort of details which

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.751
is nice and that's why, you know, the approach
of, you know, not only Heroes and Philosophy

00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:31.290
but, a lot of similar popular culture in philosophy
books that are, are part of the series. In

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.900
the end, the reason for bringing up all this
question about time and repetition, and meaning

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.059
is really just to have us consider like if
we think of things purely in terms of--oh,

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:44.210
this is a good moment or this is a bad moment,
do we only think of things in those terms

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.790
is/or sometimes can we actually see like a
larger sense of inner connection like, you

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:53.280
know, see that one moment is actually necessary
for another moment, like that's not always

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.710
an easy thing to do. There's another very
interesting moment in that first season when

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.260
Hiro's future self the--like the bad ass version
of himself, was like the goatee [ph] in a

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.570
ponytail and the sword and everything. He
has the string map like it's this very interesting--I

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.780
forgot what he calls it other than like, like
this map of advance for like these things

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.160
happen in time and he's got--oops, he's got
like strings attached to each of these things

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.590
and he says like, you know, this is a map
of time and you can trace like different events

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.190
and different people, and where things fell
together, where things fell apart. So, that,

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.020
like it's a very fitting analogy I think for
what I'm trying to talk about in the--in the

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.650
Nietzsche chapter that there is the sense
of like, you know, one single moment can be

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:38.140
very interconnected. And a lot of times it's
impossible for us to kind of discern like,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.390
you know, how these connections happened but
it's just--like as a metaphor, I just want

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.280
you to think about that image of this like
string map with all of these different things.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.720
What would your life look like if it were,
you know, like little push pins and strings,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.990
and like you connect people in events and
times, and everything together? Like I think

00:19:53.990 --> 00:20:00.230
that's a very, very appropriate way to kind
of understand what Nietzsche is talking about.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.010
So that's one of the things that, in terms
of philosophical questions that Heroes and

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:09.530
Philosophy discusses. Another thing we should
dealt more into that I mentioned earlier is

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.470
the question of good and evil. Are the heroes
really good? That doesn't really--I mean it

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:20.640
sounds like a really obvious and banal question
but right around season three, things start

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.040
to get less black and white. Heroes can become
villains and villains can sometimes become

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.650
heroes before quickly turning back to villains,
so there's that kind of, you know, again like

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:37.570
more uncertainty and then now, or rather a
nice way I think is presented in the show

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.500
is the logo. I'm ripping this off from one
of my co-authors but he'll forgive me. The

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:47.520
Heroes' logo is--in eclipse of the sun, right,
and in Plato's Republic, Plato describe the

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:53.660
sun as basically as symbol for goodness and
knowledge, and like, you know, the intelligibility

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.890
of goodness through like, you know, the light
of reason and all these things. If you think

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.170
about an eclipse for instance, like the sense
of like, you know, there's something obscuring

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.960
the sun, like it suppose to symbolize, could
symbolize, you know, like this sort of like

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:11.380
moral, uncertainty and ambiguity that happens
in the show. So, it's a very fitting metaphor

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:18.920
I think. Without getting to, I think college
electuary for everyone, there--I would just

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.040
quickly say there are a number of ways that
philosophers have kind of dealt with this

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.640
issue of, you know, good and evil, and like
in a ways which has been conceptualized. Socrates,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.420
for one felt that evil was basically, simply
resulting of insufficient knowledge that,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.309
you know, like everyone--anyone who really
understood what it meant to be good and to

00:21:37.309 --> 00:21:42.660
do good, would do good. Like evil and badness,
and more of wrongness was really just, you

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:48.500
know, insufficient and understanding of what
good really was, that was Socrates'--that's

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:54.820
a thumbnail sketch what Socrates, you know,
felt was the, kind of the moral philosophy

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.740
there. So, you know, evil wasn't so much evil
in the sake of evil but it was the, the results

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.550
of the imperfect knowledge. Nietzsche and
another one of this were is called Beyond

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:10.570
Good and Evil, asks us to think about why
we think of good and evil the way we do. And

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:16.090
what he means by that is maybe definitions
of good and evil are as set as we think they

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:23.760
are. He asks us just for the sake of argument
to consider a time when maybe evil meant then

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.040
what good means now, that there is this inversion
of swords between terms. Maybe there could

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.500
be an evolution from like, you know, like
what--he's asking us to consider what exactly

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.930
is the goodness of good and the evilness of
evil. One of the things that he talks about

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.001
without getting into too much more detail
about this was the, Nietzsche suggest that

00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:49.190
good and evil could possibly have started
from just like, you know, this means of differentiation

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.880
that good and evil without any sort of like
moral evaluation would just simply be a way

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.441
of saying, you know, goodness and evilness
could have been a term of like, you know,

00:22:58.441 --> 00:23:03.210
me-ness and you-ness. I call myself good,
therefore I call you bad because you're not

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.400
me. So in a very like simple like, you know,
kindergarten level, like we understand intuitively

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.070
why that could have been the way things were.
In season one, to kind of pick up the theme

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:19.630
again of like more on uncertainty and sort
of like these shades of gray. There's a very

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:26.390
sort of Watchmen like plot for anyone that
seen the movie or the, read the graphic noble

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:32.260
by Alan Moore, which again like I said results
and the blowing up in New York City. There

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.130
are a few people who know that this is going
to happen but they choose not to do something

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:43.010
about it. The moral justification is that
they're uniting humanity against the common

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:48.150
threat and that's very Machiavellian sort
of--and to justify the means. And, at one

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.660
point, one of the character says, "People
need hope but they trust fear" so this idea,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.320
and one of the episodes that's really good
and really kind of chilling and creepy is

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:03.620
called .07%, and the idea is that .07% of
the human population is an unacceptable lost

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.110
until I can ensure against like, greater like
you know catastrophe. So this idea that you

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.250
blow up New York City and your, you know,
letting this many people to get blown up but

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.960
and then, you know, they are going to go to
that spoiling episode that they're saving

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.260
more lives in the process like for the future.
It's good, it's a really good episode and

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:26.130
again, like the first season is--it touches
on like a whole slew; very philosophically

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:32.130
interesting theories were all making for very
good drama I think. Interesting questions

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:37.990
in moral ambiguity that, for me, that shows
you know narrative threat the first three

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:43.210
seasons. And there's a difference I think
between moral ambiguity which is what I've

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.801
been talking about and moral compromises.
That's another thing that one of the chapters

00:24:46.801 --> 00:24:52.550
in the book talks about Noah Bennett, who's
the horn-rimmed glasses guy. He does some

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.780
pretty terrible things, including like torture
and murder, in the service of what he says,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.220
he's protecting his family which, you know,
like if you follow his character like, you

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:07.870
know, that's very important to him is like,
you know, being a good father but it is a

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.799
compromise. He's sacrificing some things like,
you know, like killing people and torturing

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:18.330
people if it means protecting the people he
cares about the most. Angela Petrelli, justifies

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.059
lighting--New York get blown up for the simple
reason that she considers it a greater good

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:28.980
that's going to result in a better future
for everyone. Nathan Petrelli who's the son

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:35.360
of Angela suggests that super power people's,
like, concentration camps would be a good

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.180
idea. It would be a good thing to protect
everyone else from themselves. So there's

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.590
this question that's a very politically freighted
argument obviously that liberty can be exchanged

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.450
for security. So there's, you know, there's
a very interesting issues here, and on the

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.400
one hand, some of these examples--some of
these are very whacked out examples. Some

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.100
of them are not as whacked out as others which
make them disturbingly close to home. What

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.679
this has to do with us, however, is this notion
again of like moral compromise is not unfamiliar

00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:09.650
to us in our every day lives. Maybe not these
specific instances but we understand intuitively

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.900
what we, you know, we make trade offs in small
decisions where we're deciding one set of

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.130
moral values for another, and that's inevitable,
that's what we do in life whether we realize

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:28.559
it or not. Heroes is also interesting to us.
One of the things, the reason for that is,

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:32.000
in this book--and again, I'll talk about these
kind of shades of gray, this is kind of like

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.580
ambiguity between dark and light, black and
white, is that we take for granted this like

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.440
black and white, these things between heroes
and villains, and good and bad. One of these

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.520
moral sorts of question which I think is kind
of a neat one is: What effect do superpowers

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.410
have on society? You know, it's kind of a
silly question but it does like, you know,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:58.210
it has intellectual merit I think because
if you think about, and we're not even talking

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.130
about super powers anymore. How would you
act when you could do things that no one else

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:09.510
could do and no one would be able to stop
you? Asking this kind of questions get some

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.650
of the nature of morality, were we no longer
to have like the traditional suicidal checks

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.960
of like, you know, discipline and punishment
and this sort of things. Then all are really

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.100
is at that point is this moral obligation
to do what we think is right or what we think

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:29.559
is wrong. What would that look like in the
world of Heroes? There's an episode were they

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:34.350
talk about this, but the idea that I'm kind
of hinting out here in short, is the idea

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:40.390
of another philosopher, John Locke, not the
Lost character but the 17th century British

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:46.220
Philosopher and his idea of the social contract.
The social contract basically says that, you

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.280
know, Locke means to say, "We live in an orderly
society for a certain reasons." We have certain

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.210
rules which we obey because in turn, you know,
we get protection from being innocent in our

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.690
society, we're not killing everyone and stealing
each other all the time, that's the balance

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.669
[ph]. You're sacrificing some amount of personal
freedom in order to get like the larger protection

00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:09.300
and the larger benefits of being part of a
society. Thomas Hobbes talks about this issue

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:15.040
in his state of nature which is very similar
to this idea of the--the outcome of which

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.450
is the social contract. Where Heroes comes
in, I mean just for the sake of argument is

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.020
what happens to the society when, you know,
let's say, what happens to the society and

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:32.030
its rules when people--some people were no
longer need that, that protection or no longer

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:37.970
have those rules of the society apply to them.
If such people like, you know, where do exist,

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:42.840
like how they would exist, you know, forget
super power for a second but just think. If

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.260
they didn't need society in the way that the
rest of us need society like, you know, would

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.280
or should, I mean for there, you know, from
their personal standpoint, will they need

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.660
to abide by the same rules that we do? It
gets in the questions, in a criminal justice

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:01.540
and all these other things. But philosophers
like Hobbes and Locke, you know, when they

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.929
speak about society, they bring up the fact,
the premises of the society is like there's

00:29:04.929 --> 00:29:09.370
a need for it. There's a need for society
because we are really more equal than, you

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.250
know, sometimes we care to realize or care
to admit as like, you know, living human beings.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:19.910
In one episode of the show which is called
I Am Become Death, I think this is the fourth

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:26.250
episode of the third season, and it's really
one of the neater episodes of the show. A

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.610
super power formula kind of--is distributed
through in this kind of like alternate scenario

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:36.060
and in effect everyone get super powers. And,
essentially, what happens, the result of this

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:41.049
is just a very dark future for everyone. Power
for everyone is much more a blessing than

00:29:41.049 --> 00:29:46.460
a curse--at least, that's the thesis that
that episode is sort of putting out there.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.360
Many of us have heard the often-used quote
which is from Lord Acton that power tends

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.150
to corrupt--power tends to corrupt; absolute
power corrupts absolutely. And this seems

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.450
to be, you know, kind of the case that, you
know, Heroes is, you know, suggesting in some

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.570
of these episodes, similar episodes to the
one I just talked about. But power without

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:12.260
the sort of like moral checks and balances
that society ensures is an extremely dangerous

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.580
thing. Some of us would adhere to a moral
code just because that's the way we are and

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.390
some of us would not, it's like, if this were
to be the case. Some of us would do whatever

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.830
it is we wanted to do simply for the fact
that, you know, we could do it and get away

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.080
with it. But it says something about like--you
know, these are questions of human nature

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.100
and these are questions about, you know, why
society is important and why society functions

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:38.179
the way it is. So, again, like the--the idea
here is that there are interesting scenarios.

00:30:38.179 --> 00:30:43.710
Like, they seem very, you know, farfetched
sometimes. When we start to actually think

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.490
about it, we can see some of these issues
and like, you know, it causes us, like, you

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:53.460
know, hopefully it causes us to reflect on
some of these deeper things. Speaking of ethics

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.210
and this question of right and wrong, there's
one more topic I want to talk about in terms

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.960
of Heroes before we kind of open it up to
questions and everything. Really, like, I

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.490
think devotees of the history of the show
will probably be familiar with this. This

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:12.280
is the question of Heroes as a show and the
question of originality. People have said

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.070
in, like, you know, in the past that, "Oh,
the plot for Heroes is like, you know, the

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.850
issue of Uncanny X-Men number 143," where,
like, you know, there's, like, dystopian,

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:25.120
like, you know, history where--excuse me,
not history--future, alternate future were

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.580
everyone dies and then someone has to go back
in time to save them. I mean if you follow

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.030
the first, like, you know, first, second and
third season of the show, like, you know,

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:39.270
yeah, that kind of is the show in a nutshell.
Like there is this, like, you know, premise

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.900
that is very much like, you know, other comic
book plots that have been done before Heroes.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.220
On the one hand--so the issue that we're getting
at is again like creativity versus originality

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.230
here. Many people have wondered why there
are so many similarities between Heroes and

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.830
the X-Men. This is one of the chapters of
the book and it's kind of fun chapter to read.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:05.039
Many of the powers in the show are similar
to X-Men. Claire's healing powers are like

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:11.380
Wolverine's healing deal. There's like a guy
who, you know, controls metal like Magneto

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:16.610
does. There's Sylar's like, you know, power-stealing
thing just like Rogue from the X-Men. It goes

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:25.210
on and on and on. So we can also argue--and,
like, this is the other side of the coin--that

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.480
old stories can be told and retold in different
ways and possibly new and illuminating ways,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.809
and, you know, such is the nature of stories.
They're told and told again and perhaps something

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:41.620
is added or something is taken away. So, this
question about originality and, like, you

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.520
know, whether this is, you know, like a form
of plagiarism or something, like on one level,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.290
like a very, like, a basic functional level
is interesting and, like, you know, I'll be

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.071
honest, I wouldn't be happy if someone, like,
took my ideas in writing and, like, passed

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:59.110
it off as their own which, you know, is nowadays
what they call academic writing--I'm just

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.390
kidding. The question is not that straightforward
though. It's actually more than like, you

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.950
know, when we get past this later of like,
oh, this is just a rip-off of the X-Men, we

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:13.200
start to really think about deeper issues
and one of the things that the chapter talks

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.360
about is this question of epistemic responsibility
which is--it's a fancy way of saying, like,

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.860
you know, do we--what responsibility do we
have to know things, like to have knowledge

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:27.580
and to, like, you know, be more knowledgeable
about things that we should know about. So,

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.570
you know, example, like if you're writing
a show on superheroes, should you know something

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:37.701
about the superhero genre. If you're creating
a show like Heroes, does that--does it seem

00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:41.630
a little disingenuous to say, like, I don't
read comic books because I'd be worried that

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.190
someone had already thought of my own ideas
and I don't want to know that. That's not

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.220
exactly what the show's creator Tim Kring
said, but it's kind of close. So that's his

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.110
argument. I mean, it's interesting without
getting into too much of the specifics of

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:03.520
it, but this idea again of like epistemic
responsibility is sort of like what responsibility

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.410
do we have to know about the things that we
care about. Like, you know, these are difficult

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:12.970
issues to answer especially when there is
no clear-cut answer like this. You can certainly

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.800
argue one way or another but, on a deeper
level, like, you know, and this is--it becomes

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.520
a very personal question is, you know, like,
to what extent do you feel responsible for

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.560
the knowledge that you have or don't have.
Again, this is like where the philosophy part

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:33.899
of the show comes in. So I suppose the last
example kind of indicates that, you know,

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:40.919
this whole question of like creativity and
originality, it indicates towards that challenges

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:46.169
that comic book heroes and villains kind of
confront, and how that sort of represents

00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:53.160
the real-life problems that we have, like,
you know, we deal with in our everyday lives.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:00.230
The moral decisions that comic book characters
confront regarding their superpowers are not

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.420
all that dissimilar from my own struggles
to kind of, you know, make the right moral

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.040
decisions in a world that we wish were a little
more black and white. The more we can relate

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.890
to the shortcomings of, you know, this sort
of characters, like I've said, the more we

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.420
can perhaps relate to this larger than life
figures because they represent, you know,

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.860
the best part of ourselves. That's the idea,
like, I think, the appeal behind Heroes and

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.570
hence why we enjoy stories about them. You
know, again, to take this back to the idea

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:30.680
of like modern mythology, and why we keep,
you know, repeating these patterns whether

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.510
it's like, you know, through, you know, ancient
Greek and Roman figures, or dating back before

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:42.790
those characters or, like, you know, in modern
day. The last point I wanted to make before

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.349
we kind of open up to questions is that, you
know, philosophy isn't something that, you

00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:52.859
know, just began in a book, although it certainly
is in this book which is available on bookstores

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:57.500
and Amazon now. But, like, the idea is that,
philosophy is something that can be found

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.710
everywhere if we know what it is we're looking
for. So the approach of the book is that once

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.270
we know to, you know, look for these sorts
of philosophical things, we can start thinking

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.631
philosophically and, you know, for a lack
of a better way to put it, like, you know,

00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:14.650
the--like when you no longer have that television
show as a point of reference for being into

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.230
philosophy at that point, maybe you're so
interested in philosophy that you start, you

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:24.290
know, like, looking for those things, you
know, in other aspects of your life. So that's

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:29.490
more or less what I wanted to talk about.
I want to ask a few questions because what's

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:34.170
really interesting to me besides, you know,
hearing myself talk which I really do like

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:40.109
very much; but I do want to ask you guys also,
you know, some questions that--you know, like,

00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:44.820
we're curious about what you think about some
of the stuff we've written. So I'll stop talking

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.010
in a minute, but let me just ask these questions,
you know, that you can either answer now or

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.849
just think about them like, you know, if you're
at home watching this, like, think about this

00:36:53.849 --> 00:36:59.740
question as like the last thing that you hear
from this talk. The first one is that since

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:04.440
I've offered suggestions about how the show
can be philosophically interesting, I'm kind

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.520
of curious of, like, the fans of the show,
what is it about the show that's interesting?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.099
Like for me, the show is interesting because,
you know, it's entertaining and I thought

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:15.430
the first season was, you know, very interesting
from a narrative and, like, you know, a philosophical

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.609
standpoint but, you know, why is it that we
find the show like Heroes interesting? Like,

00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:23.230
what is it? You know, if it's a simple answer
like, you know, such and such character is

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:27.030
cute or if it's something like, you know,
like if there are other, you know, like underlying

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.770
things, it's worth stopping to think about
every once in a while. The other question

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.730
and some more general question is that--one
of the things I said at the beginning was

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.630
that philosophy is something that's eminently
relatable. This book is kind of an example

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:44.010
of that. What are people's conceptions of
philosophy? I'm especially interested for

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.420
people like, you know, who maybe like haven't
had much experience with the subject matter

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.520
or like really are like outsiders looking
in. Like, I kind of want to know, what does

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.619
philosophy--what does the word philosophy
mean to those people? Like, I've heard it,

00:37:56.619 --> 00:38:01.310
you know, used in a lot of different ways
but I'm curious. So I'd ask just, like, you

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.160
know, think about those things, think about
those, like, two questions and that's all

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:18.540
I have to talk about. And yes, if you have
any questions, let me know. Thanks.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:25.250
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean when I think of Heroes and
Nietzsche in the same, you know, area--the

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:31.560
first thing that comes to mind for me is Nietzsche's
whole philosophy of the Ubermensch. So my

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:39.110
question for you would be: Which character
do you think would be Nietzsche's favorite--like

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.500
most characteristic of the Ubermensch, or
at least his least unfavorite?

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.370
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay.
&gt;&gt; I mean, and a few characteristics and the

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.661
reasons why.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay. Yeah, I like that question

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:57.220
a lot actually. I think, you know, and it's--I'm
prefacing it by saying, you know, here's what

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.970
I think Nietzsche would think but, like, you
know, the idea for other people who are curious

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.750
about Nietzsche's concept of Ubermensch basically
is that this is an individual who has sort

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:14.099
of gone beyond, like, you know, like the normal
standards of ethics and morality, and it sort

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:18.060
of, like, almost like evolves into a different,
like, ethical being, someone who's like, you

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.450
know, is self-creating and therefore like,
doesn't have to listen of what other people,

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.440
you know, like tell them who's right and wrong,
but is actually creating those values for

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.650
themselves. So, like, potentially, it sounds
very good. Like in theory, it sounds very

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:35.330
good. In practice, sometimes, it's not quite
so simple. So, you know, the question about

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.950
like which character might exemplify like,
you know, the Ubermensch, like, you know,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.740
Sylar is a good example. Sylar, like, you
know, he's the superpower, like, you know,

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.670
serial killer guy who slices people's, like,
brains open and kills them to take their powers.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:54.560
But, you know, he is an interesting character,
like not, you know, like, beside the stuff

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.099
that he does, but like his rationale for doing
that. At one point he says, you know, that

00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:03.330
like normal rule shouldn't apply to him because
he is like the next stage in evolution. Like,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.180
you know, for X-Men fans, like that's pretty
much like their thing. They called mutants

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.570
which are the people, the superpowers, like
Homo sapiens superior. So there is this idea

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:16.980
that mutants aren't like, you know, some genetic,
like, you know, whatever like a blip on the

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.580
radar screen but they're supposed to be like
the next stage in human evolution. So Sylar

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.440
is supposed to represent, at least in his
own mind, that sort of like stage and like,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.040
you know, moral evolution--why should, you
know, like, those kind of, you know, this

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.160
like old human morality like apply to him
if he represent something else. Like, another

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:38.300
further example would be like for those of
us that aren't vegetarians--I'm not but, you

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.450
know, I understand the argument here that,
you know, like, if you think about what Sylar

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:47.150
does and he's like killing these people to
like, you know, provide nourishment to him,

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.900
it's not that dissimilar from like, you know,
how vegetarians argue, Peter Singer, like,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.839
you know, his ethics on animal care and these
sort of things, that, like, you know, we don't

00:40:56.839 --> 00:41:01.619
apply the same human rules about killing other
people than we do to killing other animals.

00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:04.911
Like, they are living things. Why don't we
think about that? So, like, the idea is that

00:41:04.911 --> 00:41:09.400
Sylar, you know, is basically applying that
like thought process that he sees other normal

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.180
people who aren't like him as, like you know,
animals, like a cow. So like I'll treat you

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.650
the same way that, you know, I treat a cow
that I wanted a hamburger from. That's like

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:22.460
Sylar's kind of like, you know, like moral
standpoint. And the other question about--I

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.160
don't--I have to think about that one. Like,
which would be Nietzsche's like least favorite

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.460
character?
&gt;&gt; The least favorite.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:34.599
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Oh, okay. It would have to be--that's
a tough one. Like, I don't know if it's the

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:38.620
best answer but my guess would be like, you
know, Noah Bennet, who is the horn-rimmed

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.849
glasses guy, like, I mentioned some of his
things and his, like, moral certainty, but

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:48.349
he's sort of acting on and just sort of like,
almost self-deluded kind of, you know, like

00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:51.930
kick here or, you know, I'm doing bad things
but I'm doing them for the purpose of like,

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.580
you know, some other good thing. But is that,
like, you know, really the reason or you just

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.609
actually like killing and torturing other
people and this is like a convenient sort

00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:03.200
of like, you know, like, you know, story to
spin on yourself. So there's that angle, like,

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.680
you know, it could fit within like, you know,
Nietzsche's world view. I don't know if it's

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.541
perfect but it's an interesting question.
It's a good way to like, you know, think about

00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:15.570
like some of these characters and how they
relate to the show and the philosophy so...

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.519
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay.

00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:21.380
&gt;&gt; So my first one is--so I love watching
Heroes because when I watch each episode,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.850
I kind of reflect on, you know, myself and
kind of what you asked. What would you do

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:29.040
in that scenario? And I kind of see bits of
myself in, you know, every character. And,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.210
sometimes, I wonder if because I'm reflecting
on my sense of self through the framework

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:38.070
of the Hollywood writer, if that sense of
self is somehow perverted or less legitimate

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:44.260
or shallower than, say, you know, a sense
of self I developed from a book. So I just

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.480
think it's very interesting because, you know,
I watch more TV now than I read a book and,

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.230
you know, a lot of my ideas probably come
from the media, and I wonder if the book kind

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:58.230
of reflects on how our views of the world
and ourselves change with media. That's my

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.869
first question.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay. I think I could answer that

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:04.460
one because I like that question. I think--the
first thing I thought of was that, you know,

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:08.060
yes, there are--there's no one writer that's
like, you know, you're getting your world

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.390
view from if you're like, you know, reflecting
on these things in the show. Like, you know,

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.869
there's a lot of, you know, like hands on
the pot for the creative process. Especially,

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:20.250
now, having done the book process, it's not
that dissimilar. Like, you know, you got editors

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.950
and you have like publishers who sort of,
like, you know, are changing things. Your

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.920
translators too who like--you know, translation
is a big deal too. It's like, you know, a

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.940
single word can change like the entire thrust
of like an entire like, you know, passage

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.830
or an entire book even. So there are those
decisions and there are decision makers in

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:43.220
that process, so I don't know. Like, you know,
I guess--because I'm going to be a--you know,

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.070
I still think of myself as a lit person, like
a literature person. Like, yeah, I'm sort

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.700
of biased towards books just because, like,
they, you know, it gives you more time to

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.420
reflect on certain things and it's a slower
pace. That's all I'm advocating in terms of

00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:00.030
like books as a way to like, you know, derive
like that sense of self, but it's not--books

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:06.220
and television aren't that different sometimes--not
always--and, in fact, not all shows everywhere

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.230
for all time but, like, you know, there are
certain TV shows that, again, like I said,

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:14.250
they carry a certain resonance because like
television shows are still stories. Like,

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:18.900
books are stories and they like, you know,
they cause us to reflect on, like, you know,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.940
certain issues. So it's kind of--like that's
my--does that answer the question?

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.990
&gt;&gt; Yes, I liked that answer.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay. All right.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:29.270
&gt;&gt; And my second question is if you can tell
us a little bit more about the three books

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.260
that are coming out and which shows should
we be aware of?

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.730
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay. Let's see. Well, the first
one is--I don't think it's a secret now so

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:41.560
I can just say the--the first one, it's coming
out I think in December or, I don't know,

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.869
my publicists can, you know, like, correct
me if I'm wrong, the Alice in Wonderland and

00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:48.849
Philosophy which is going to be kind of a
cool one. So it's based on the book by Lewis

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:52.740
Carroll. But, of course, Alice in Wonderland
is now being made into a movie by Disney.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.780
Tim Burton's directing it and it's going to
be kind of this, like, you know, this new

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.770
different take on Alice in Wonderland which,
you know, looks potentially very interesting.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.810
So, that's one book that's coming out, you
know, at the end of the year and then following

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:12.810
that one right afterwards is one of my favorite
shows of all time, Arrested Development and

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:19.820
Philosophy, and that one's coming out earlier
next year. But it's--that's a very smart show.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.240
Like, it's funny and I wish that, you know,
people--more people would, you know, watch

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.941
it and it would still be on air right now.
But Arrested Development is also coming out

00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:32.660
with a movie and, you know, it's--not un-coincidentally,
this book is coinciding with their release

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:37.460
of the movie so that people can get re-interested
in the show in like different ways. And the

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.660
most recent one which I'm still writing right
now is 30 Rock and Philosophy which another

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.510
show that I like very much, not just because
I love Tina Fey, which I want, in YouTube,

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:52.260
I want people to know that but, like, also
because the show is like very clever, like,

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.920
you know, from a narrative standpoint, from
like a construction of like, you know, stories

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.740
and things like that. Like, it is a very good
show and it, like, it deals with a lot of

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.390
topics not, you know, in a very--it's a comedy
for one thing but it deals with a lot of very

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.930
interesting topics like Heroes does. So, like,
the philosophy again is there if you know

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:14.130
how to look for it. So those are the three
for now.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:20.710
&gt;&gt; Just to debate possibly your choice of
the Ubermensch character, I think you should

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:25.940
also take into consideration on Nietzsche's
ideas about magnanimity and how the Ubermensch,

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:34.760
even though he is all powerful, well, at least
in the sense of creating his own values, he

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.830
does not need to express his power by destroying
others unlike people who are weaker and the

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.690
way that they feel that they can--you know,
the only course of showing--the only option

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:48.280
of showing their power is by destroying other
people. So, that's really all I have to say.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.580
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Okay. No, I agree with it. Can
I ask you a question? Just out of curiosity,

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.520
like, which characters do you think like,
you know, would be your choice for like the

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.200
Ubermensch or the--oh, okay. All right. Fair
enough. But you can read the book and kind

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.710
of like get a good, like, jumping start on
that. But no, you're right about the--it's

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:11.690
good to point out that like aspect of the
Ubermensch too which--Ubermensch, like, you

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.800
know, like roughly translated is like "over
man." So it's this idea again, like, we've

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.570
been talking about, like, you know, mutants
and Homo sapiens superior, it's that idea

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.780
that this is somehow someone who has like
evolved to, like, you know, over like, you

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:31.609
know, what normal, like, you know, man--human
morality is. So, yeah, I don't really have

00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:34.431
anything to add to what you said other than
you're right and I agree, and I think it's

00:47:34.431 --> 00:47:37.801
an interesting way to, like, you know, keep
thinking about the--like the tie-in between

00:47:37.801 --> 00:47:42.380
Nietzsche and the show.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Tyler, thanks for coming.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.350
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Yeah, thanks.
&gt;&gt; I have a question about the statement you

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:55.180
made from Socrates that evil is just another
way of saying misinformed. Why do you think

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:59.869
it is then that all of the evil characters
are positioned as more intelligent or more

00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:02.450
informed?
&gt;&gt; SHORES: That's...

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:08.220
&gt;&gt; They're always sort of the CEOs of the
evil companies or the masterminds and the

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:13.090
good people are always sort of bumbling around
and not--and unaware.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.550
&gt;&gt; SHORES: No, that's a good question. Like,
I was actually thinking about that while I

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.369
was talking about it and there was more I
wanted to say. So, like, I'm glad you brought

00:48:19.369 --> 00:48:24.941
that up, which is I think there is a difference
between, like, you know, not necessarily like

00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:30.061
ignorance or like lack of knowledge so much
as moral ignorance. Moral ignorance is a different

00:48:30.061 --> 00:48:33.340
thing. Like, it's this idea. And, like you
know, like you've mentioned, like the show

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.130
is, like the villains of the show, the people
who are doing the worse things, like always

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:41.050
seem to be in this position where like, you
know, it seems like they do know better, like

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:46.690
they are the decision makers. Like the original,
the company which is kind of like this--I

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:51.161
don't know what it's called--like, you know,
the CIA type of--no, that's not right. Like,

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:56.700
just like a, you know, secret group of, you
know, superpower people who are--who decided

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.980
that they're going to be making the decisions
that, like, are going to be secretly shaping

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.971
society. So they've decided that because they
have powers, all of a sudden, they have like

00:49:04.971 --> 00:49:10.670
this sort of moral certitude as well and,
like, you know. And at some point in the first

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.910
season, they're kind of talking about it that,
you know, this group of people, it was great

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:17.151
for awhile. It was like the super-friends.
Like, you know, they're doing all this things

00:49:17.151 --> 00:49:20.940
that was--that were right and good, and then
somewhere along the way, you know, it's--things

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.460
started to gray. Like, you know, people started
to lose their way and then things got really

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.060
bad and then, like, you know, now, it became
this in-fighting sort of thing between, you

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.240
know, like the people who think they know
right versus the people that, you know, like,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:37.280
they think they know right. So...
&gt;&gt; So maybe it's just a shift of moral framework

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.470
from greater good and smaller good. I mean,
if they're doing what they think is right

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:47.410
in the greater good sense, in the smaller
good sense such as blowing up New York City,

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:51.050
not so good.
&gt;&gt; SHORES: Yeah, I mean, yeah, not so good.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:55.359
It's kind of like, you know, again, the thing
I keep thinking about is that, you know, the

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:59.300
people who do the worst are the ones that
think they're doing the best good. Like, that's

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.510
sort of--you know, that's interesting from
the whole point of the show. It's like it

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:07.340
says something about like, you know, the sort
of like moral, like, you know, blindness that

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:11.670
sometimes we have. We feel that we're really
right about something. Like, it should be

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.760
a cautionary tale. "Cautionary Tales" is one
of the names of the episodes. So like these

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.180
are, like, you know, things that Heroes wants
us to be aware of, like, you know, when we're,

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.660
you know, like when we get past the point
of just enjoying it, it's like a dramatic

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:25.770
tension sort of thing. Like, we understand
it from this point of view. Like, you know,

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:31.160
how can--like I certainly have, like, you
know, how can we wonder to ourselves, how

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.849
can we not wonder to ourselves like you know,
how can I be so wrong about something that

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:42.180
I feel so right about? Like that's kind of
the, like the thing that many of those characters

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.180
have. Many usually get to that point of asking
that question but, you know, I feel like that's,

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:48.570
you know, something that, if at least, you
know, if we take that away from the show,

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.420
like, you know, at least, we're slightly in
a better position for having seen that. Is

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.130
that kind of your...
&gt;&gt; Last point I want to make is it's nice

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:04.210
to have a show that makes it so gray because
I wonder if in real life, it is as gray. I

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:12.250
mean when you think about overseas tyrants,
pirates, scammers, I'd say a large percentage

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:18.300
of the amount of evil that's done in the world
is done knowingly and not from this sort of

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.251
morally gray characters that think they're
doing right but aren't. I don't think that

00:51:23.251 --> 00:51:27.410
kind of conflict exists in real life. It's
a creation or fabrication of...

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.950
&gt;&gt; SHORES: No, your right. That's also why,
like, you know, it's fiction at the end of

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.589
the day, right? So, like, you know, fiction
is kind of comforting in that sense where,

00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:38.490
like, you know, we want to believe that people,
like, you know, bad people do struggle, you

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:41.339
know, with things. We want to believe that
it's like, you know, it's sometimes black

00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:45.650
and white or there is gray. But, yeah, sometimes,
you know, bad people are just bad people in

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:52.090
real life but, like, you know, it's--the whole
idea of the show is that you want to believe

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.090
that there's this, you know, like this chance
that bad people can be stopped and bad people

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:56.120
can be recognized and, you know, like pointed
out as villains, and in real life, it doesn't

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.380
always work that way so...
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:08.089
&gt;&gt; SHORES: All right. So we're out of time.
So thank you again for everyone for your attention.
