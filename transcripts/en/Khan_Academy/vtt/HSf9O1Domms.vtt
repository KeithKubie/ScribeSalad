00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
- [Voiceover] So we want
to figure out what 1/4

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.585
plus 3/5 minus 3/10 is.

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:06.960
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.555
and see if you could figure
this out on your own.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:11.760
All right, I'm assuming
you've had an attempt,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.460
let's work through this together now.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.455
So the first thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.760
is look, I have these fractions

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.760
that I'm adding and subtracting,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.665
but they all have different denominators.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.855
So in order to add and subtract
them in a reasonable way,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.630
we'd want to rewrite them so they all have

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.220
the same denominator.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.260
So what we really want to
do is find a common multiple

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.380
of four, five and 10.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.020
And like I always say, we
can use any common multiple,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.120
but we simplify things
a little bit if we use

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.555
the smallest common multiple,
or the least common multiple.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:42.240
And one way to find the
least common multiple

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.550
is take the largest of these numbers

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.490
and look at their multiples
and keep increasing

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.990
the multiples until you find one

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.115
that is divisible by the other two.

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:53.755
So for example, I could start at 10.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:57.460
10 is divisible by five but
is not divisible by four.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.185
So then we can go 20.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:02.285
20 is divisible by both five and four,

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.285
so the least common multiple
of four, five and 10 is 20.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.720
So let's rewrite all of these fractions

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.060
as something over 20.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.055
So let's start with 1/4.

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:16.620
1/4 is what over 20?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.320
Well, to go from four to 20,
you have to multiply by five,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.720
so you have to do the same
thing to the numerator.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.055
You have to multiply it by five.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:26.750
One times five is five.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.495
One over four is the same thing as 5/20.

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.210
Four is four times one,
20 is four times five.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:39.760
Then we want to think about,
well, what happens to 3/5

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.720
If I write it as something over 20?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.425
Well to go in the
denominator from five to 20,

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.090
you have to multiply it by four,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.430
so you have to multiply the
numerator by four as well.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.375
So three times four is
going to be equal to 12.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:58.020
And then we're going to subtract 3/10,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.050
but how do we write that
as something over 20?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.730
Well, to go from 10 to 20,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.620
you multiply the denominator by two,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.985
so if we want to have the same fraction,

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.580
we need to multiply the
numerator by two as well.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.155
So three times two is six.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:13.885
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:15.460
Well now I have 5/20

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.810
plus 12/20 minus 6/20.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.745
So what is this going to be?

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.995
Well, there's a bunch of ways
you could think about it.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.020
You could say, well,
this is just going to be,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.540
this is going to be 5/20

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:36.230
plus 12/20 plus 12/20

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.460
minus 6/20, minus 6/20.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.690
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.950
the way I just wrote it here,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.955
five plus 12 minus six,
all of that, over 20.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.885
This is how many 20ths
are going to result.

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.950
So what is that equal to?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.660
Well that's going to be
equal to all of this,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.460
we are counting 20ths, is
one way to think about it.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.250
So five plus 12 is 17

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.195
minus six is 11.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:06.645
So we get 11/20.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:10.320
I have 5/20, I add 12/20
and I take away 6/20,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm going to be left with 11/20.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.645
Let's do one more example of
this, just for good practice.

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:22.520
So here I have 4/9 minus 1/6 plus 1/3.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.350
And like before, I encourage
you to puase the video

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.200
and see if you can work this out.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.485
Well, what I want to
do is I want to rewrite

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:29.860
all of these fractions so that they have

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.155
a common denominator.

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:33.795
And to find a common
denominator, you need to find

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:38.310
a common multiple of nine, six and three.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.275
And like I did before, what I could do is

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:42.385
I could start with a nine and say okay,

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:44.830
nine, it's not divisible by six.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.125
It is divisible by three,
but that's not good enough.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:50.525
I want to find the common
multiple of nine, six and three,

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:52.790
and as small as one as possible.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.745
So let's look at the next
multiple of nine, we get to 18.

00:03:55.745 --> 00:04:00.160
And 18 is divisible by nine
of course, six and three.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.505
So let's go with 18.

00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:04.210
Let's write everything
as something over 18.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.120
So 4/9 is what over 18?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.230
Well, nine times two is 18,

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.655
that's what I did to the denominator,

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:12.755
so I have to multiply the
numerator by two as well.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.720
So this is going to be 8/18.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.530
Well, what's 1/6 over 18?

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.920
Well, to go from six to
18 in the denominator,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.420
I have to multiply it by three,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.895
so I have to multiply the
numerator by three as well.

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:28.490
So one times three is three.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.960
And then last but not least,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.820
what is 1/3 as something over 18?

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.055
Well, three times six is 18,

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:39.220
so one times six is going to be six.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.790
Or you could do it another
way, you could say,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.220
well, what's 1/3 of 18?
It's going to be six.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.695
What's 1/6 of 18? It's going to be three.

00:04:45.695 --> 00:04:48.725
4/9 of 18? That's a little bit
harder to think in your brain

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:50.295
but that's going to be 8/18.

00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:52.995
Either way, I've just
rewritten these fractions,

00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.695
and I've rewritten them in
the corresponding color.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.820
So this up here is the exact same thing

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.820
as 8/18 minus 3/18 plus 6/18.

00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:05.525
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:07.925
It's going to be a
certain number of 18ths,

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:11.190
and so if I have 8/18 minus 3/18,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.395
that's going to be 5/18,

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:18.360
plus 6/18 is going to be 11/18.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.525
And we are done.
