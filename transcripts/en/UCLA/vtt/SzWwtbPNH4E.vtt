00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.790
- [Presenter] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.940
Welcome to tonight's event.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.080
We ask that you turn off all cell phones

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.720
and electronic devices at this time.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.390
Still photography, video
and audio recording

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.870
are not permitted.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.310
Please take a moment to look around

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.790
for the available emergency exits.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.350
In case of an emergency,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.903
calmly proceed to the
nearest emergency exit.

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:29.800
AA100 10 Questions is now in session.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.390
Please welcome Brett Steele,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.053
Dean of the School of the
Arts and Architecture.

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:37.324
(applause)

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.070
- Thank you everybody
so much for coming in

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.710
for week three of 10 Questions.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.353
And this evening's
question, what is beauty?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.310
As I've said before in
these introductions,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.780
Cathy Opie, one of the
world's greatest photographers

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.240
and a colleague of ours
here in this school at UCLA,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.723
has said it this way:

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.330
ideas always start with questions.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.390
And as I think we all know today also,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.060
the asking of questions
is what drives research

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.230
in almost any human form today,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.660
across the humanities, in the sciences,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.810
in medicine and indeed as
a predicate to this course

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.890
in what we think of as the arts.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.340
If you'll allow me to
take just a few minutes,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.510
I'd like to briefly introduce the course

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.410
for those of you that
are new to this evening

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.030
in our public audience.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.940
And after that, we'll have
the honor and privilege

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.860
of introducing our four terrific guests

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.560
who will get on with the conversation

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.030
around tonight's question.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm Brett Steele, Dean of the School

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.940
of the Arts and Architecture
and, like many of you,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.930
very much a student of this course

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:52.480
and everything that's
coming out of it so far.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.440
You are joining us for a
very special experiment

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.510
in higher education today
in which a combination

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.700
of students and members of the
larger public come together

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.910
for a rolling program that will look at

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.720
each of the weekly questions
that we've set as an agenda.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.160
This is very much a combination
of a student audience.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.720
We have 80 students that
are enrolled from across

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.020
the entire campus and not just here

00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:19.840
at the School of the Arts and Architecture

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.340
and those of you who have come
in from beyond the borders

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.640
of the campus this evening
to enjoy this event

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520
and everything it offers.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.140
I'd like to say as a part
of my introduction today,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.740
something briefly about the materials

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.807
that we also have available,
as some of you have come

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:37.000
and asked about that after some
of our previous discussions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
We are striving here to make
the state of art education

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.110
very literally more viable and visible

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.570
to a larger audience of
people thinking about

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.250
the state of the world today.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.783
We're working to make the
university more porous,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.010
to bring down some of the borders between

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.710
highly specialized forms
of knowledge and expertise

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.840
that make up UCLA, like many other

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.310
research institutions today.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.230
And more than anything, for
your students in the audience,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.190
to find a way to make the work you do

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.000
in not just this classroom or this class

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.480
but also in the various performance halls,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.480
seminar spaces on the
stages and in studios,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.500
more open and available to
larger audiences around our work.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.650
This is very much a course about the work

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.603
that all of you are doing as students.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.330
In addition to what I've
already said about trying

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.900
to make the work we're
doing here at the university

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.230
more accessible, a point
to, make tonight especially

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.920
in our attempts to
broaden the conversation,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.750
and this follows on from a couple of weeks

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.780
of looking up and
periodically seeing a laptop

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.510
or a mobile phone in operation,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.520
is that we encourage you to do that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.220
and to do it in real
time during this session.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.530
For those of you that are interested

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.260
and have immediate responses
and ideas and thoughts

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.770
about some of the things being said,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.890
simply go online and do that.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.660
We've got all sorts of portholes

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.100
and access places to do that.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.100
Please try and use, if you
can, the #ucla10questions.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.570
It's yours, make use of
it and get the work out.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.570
You can also of course be sure to visit

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.000
arts.ucla.edu/10questions,
which is like how

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.080
machines talk today.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.280
I think if you just ask Google or Siri

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600
to go to UCLA 10 Questions,
you'll get there.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.970
The course materials, including
these terrific presentations

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.640
that our guests are
arriving with every week,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.740
are available to all of
us and on that website.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.020
Please, please make use
of it and understand

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.280
that to be a part of any audience today

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.690
is to be a part of multiple audiences.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.830
And indeed, that's very
much one of the premises

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.570
that this kind of a course
is testing and learning from,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.620
which is how it is we
all operate and think

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.430
and live across multiple domains.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.030
Over these 10 weeks, 10
Questions bring together

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.450
40 terrific faculty from
across our entire campus.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.200
Students enrolled in the
course also include majors

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.300
of the School of Arts and Architecture,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.780
but many other departments
across this entire UCLA campus.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.010
In addition to being
here Tuesday evenings,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.190
our students meet weekly

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.580
with their graduate teaching assistants

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.290
to discuss these questions and create

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.125
their own responses to them in a variety

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.860
of forms and formats and to reiterate

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.940
the kind of conversation
that's taking place

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.250
up here on the stage this evening

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.380
in their own interesting
and individuated ways.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.700
Each of the questions
being asked in this series

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.960
is drawn from a critical
engagement of arts practitioners.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.450
Our questions are central
to artistic practice today.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.240
This we know because we
shaped and curated this list

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.980
from an ongoing conversation

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.980
with artists across this school
and others here on campus.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.520
By sharing these inquiries
with not only artists

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.280
but also scientists,
scholars and activists,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.970
we believe that we are
building a firmer foundation

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.850
here at UCLA for understanding both

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.920
the disciplinary forms of knowledge

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.740
essential to research and creation today,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.910
but as well the different
individuated perspectives

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.030
that experience and live lives and careers

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.663
within those fields.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.580
A couple of short thanks please

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.020
in advance of me introducing
tonight's guests.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.460
10 Questions, this course,
its format, its design,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.333
its impetus is very much
the work of Victoria Marks,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.366
a choreographer...

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:43.330
(audience cheering)

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.070
A choreographer and Associate Dean

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.970
in the School of the
Arts and Architecture.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.630
Victoria has developed this initiative

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.070
alongside Anne Marie Burke
and her terrific team here

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.280
within the school who
have worked with Victoria

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.550
and with Marilyn Pace here at the School

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.530
of the Arts and Architecture
for her considerable expertise

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.540
in the running and organizing
of courses here on campus

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.920
to make sure this initiative in this form,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.830
as both public and academic activities,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.690
could go forward in the way it has.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.808
Please join me in thanking
all of them for that effort.

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:17.910
(applause)

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.780
As I have done before,
we need also to thank

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.610
World Arts Culture/Dance for allowing us

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.470
to use this terrific room and venue here,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.470
not only for making the room available

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.550
but for the accommodation of
technical expertise and magic

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.120
that make sure things like
lights and microphones

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.130
and cameras, air heat, electricity

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.445
and all of that stuff works
in the way we need it here.

00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:41.400
And thank you everybody in the department

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.850
for making that possible.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.170
So with that as a broader introduction,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.790
let me just briefly introduce
each of our four guests

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.290
who have agreed a running order.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.070
And in the form that we've done
this in the previous weeks,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.190
we'll each begin this
evening's conversation

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.580
with a short presentation themselves.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.280
Come on out here, our guests
are here tonight already.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:05.729
(applause)

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:06.562
Thank you.

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.833
Thanks.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.160
As was the case in the first two sessions,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.820
we have four guests with us this evening.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.930
Just to briefly introduce them
to all of you, J.Ed Araiza

00:08:24.187 --> 00:08:27.270

he founded with Anne Bogart

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.550
and Tadashi Suzuki in 1992.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.030
He has a long and accomplished career

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.580
working on multicultural,
cross-disciplinary projects

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.303
as writer, director and performer.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.760
Paul Barber
(applause)

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.690
is an evolutionary
conservation geneticist.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.600
As professor in the Department of Ecology

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.170

oceanography and geology
to understand the processes

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.520
that promote speciation
in marine environments

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.670
creating marine biodiversity hotspots.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.501

our immediate neighbor
to the east of here,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.570
although I've lost track
of east in this room.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.420
It's right there.

00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:38.690
At UCLA since 2001.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.210
Marla is a curator and
scholar of African arts.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.510
Her work focuses primarily

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.110
on the arts of northeastern Nigeria.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.498
Marla is a three-time Bruin.

00:09:49.498 --> 00:09:53.680
She received her
undergraduate, graduate and PhD

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.100
in art history degrees from here at UCLA

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.940
and specializes in African
art and was director

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.280
of the University Art Museum

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.780
at the University of
California Santa Barbara

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.460
before coming here to the Fowler.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.352
And finally, Kathleen McHugh

00:10:09.352 --> 00:10:11.602
(applause)

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.600
is a feminist, media theorist and critic.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.630
Kathleen teaches in the
Department of English

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.020
and in the Cinema and
Media Studies program

00:10:21.093 --> 00:10:22.920
in the Department of Film, Television

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.970
and Digital Media at UCLA

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.690
where she currently serves as chair.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.690
From 2005 to 2012 and
again in 2013 and 14,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.870
she served as Director of the UCLA Center

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:36.980
for the Study of Women.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.689
Please join me in welcoming
all four of our guests.

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:40.522
(applause)

00:10:40.522 --> 00:10:42.283
Thank you everybody so much for coming in.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.600
We have agreed in advance a running order

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.130
for this evening's presentation,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.000
which I need to bring up on the (mumbles)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.340
and Paul will begin this
evening's presentations.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.190
Thanks everybody.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.500
- So I'm a biologist
and when I thought about

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.240
what beauty is in biology,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.540
I thought about perhaps
talking about biodiversity

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.930
and all of the amazing,
different forms of life

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.123
that are out in nature.

00:11:21.984 --> 00:11:26.810
And I also thought about perhaps
talking about complexity,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.360
because these ecosystems
that these organisms inhabit

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.810
and that we share with them on this planet

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.633
are incredibly complex.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.650
But I thought instead
I'd focus on the idea

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.783
of beauty being simplicity.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.710
And this may seem a little
odd to have diversity

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.570
and complexity and simplicity
in the same sentence,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.930
but it's simplicity that
gives rise to complexity

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.183
and creates diversity.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.320
Now you can see this by
watching origami be made.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.480
You can start with a
single piece of paper.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.470
And through the simple
action of simply folding

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.630
that piece of paper, you can, over time,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.673
create a very complicated an
object like this little fox.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.710
Impressively, it gets even
more complicated than that.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.783
This is a single piece of paper.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.923
As is this.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.993
And this.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.450
Now there's natural origami as well.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.190
So this is a ladybug extending its wings

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.710
from underneath its carapace.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.710
And this ladybug, the wings
have to be flexible enough

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.710
to be folded, to be protected
underneath its carapace,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.840
but it has to be strong
enough in order to be able

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.933
to support flight.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.970
And it's the complexity of
something like the folding

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.150
of these ladybug wings that scientists use

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:18.150
and engineers use to guide the development

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.190
of new technology and new
approaches to technology

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.790
such as this folding and expanding

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.413
solar array on a satellite.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.060
Now there's an entire
field of study where people

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.890
are developing new math
and new tools to understand

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.263
how to create different
shapes through folding.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.423
And yet this ladybug
doesn't need that math.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.520
The ladybug's figured
it out all on their own.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.513
So how did this happen?

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.270
Well, it's through simplicity.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:03.070
And what I wanna introduce
you to is a simple idea

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.400
that was first put forward
by Sir Alfred Russel Wallace

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.550
on your left, and Charles
Darwin on your right.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.260
And they proposed a very
simple idea of evolution

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.613
through natural selection.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.480
And natural selection
is a principle by which

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.220
each slight variation of a
trait, if useful, is preserved.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.470
Now another way of phrasing this is that

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.100
individual organisms that have traits,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.600
that are better suited
to their environment,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.220
have a higher probability of surviving

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.770
and in that, have a higher probability

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.463
of leaving more offspring
that carry those same traits.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.030
Now an example of this, a classic example

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.840
comes from peppered moths.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.540
Peppered moths are found in Britain

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.140
and they live on the bark of trees.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.730
And as you can see, this
light with dark modeling

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.850
of this particular moth
makes it particularly

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.270
well camouflaged on this bark.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.360
This is what trees looked like before

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.753
the Industrial Revolution in England.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.900
After the Industrial Revolution,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.093
through the emission of
smoke from burning coal,

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.610
the bark looked like this.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.710
Now suddenly that moth that was incredibly

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.640
well camouflaged sticks
out like a sore thumb.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.440
However, you should
notice up to the right,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.350
there is a darker colored moth.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.000
And it is through the
process of slightly darker

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
colored moths being less
susceptible to predation over time

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.073
that will yield that darker form.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.850
Now we can see this experimentally,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.640
people have done experiments
where they've raised birds

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.230
and they've only allowed the birds

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.870
with the largest beaks to reproduce.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.870
And over 20 generations,
what you see is the beak size

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.110
that you start with ends
up being much smaller

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.140
than where you end up.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.140
And what is amazing about
this very simple process

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.500
is that by these minor variations

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.500
occurring over long
periods of time gives rise

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.650
to diversity and complexity.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:41.650
So if we look at
something like a seahorse,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.130
this is the standard shape of a seahorse.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.330
But there are also amazing
seahorses that look like this.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.170
The leafy seadragon
evolved from a seahorse

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.760
that looked like the first
one that I showed you.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.180
But over time, because it lived

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.180
in a kelp forest environment,
it began to develop

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.593
a morphology that closely
resembled the kelp.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.470
This is a tree frog common to Arizona.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.470
And this ancestral form over
many, many years of evolution,

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:28.720
through natural selection,
gave rise to a form like this

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.150
that looks like a piece of granite.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.010
And for those of you that can't see it,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:38.890
it's right in the middle
facing this way, all right?

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:43.890
So natural selection
amazingly can converge

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.400
on a common solution, even
though it's a random process.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.400
So all three organisms here
have a very similar morphology.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.650
They have a very similar shape.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.930
So the shark represent fish.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.723
They evolved about 420 million years ago.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.390
In the middle is an ichthyosaur.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:10.160
This is an extinct group of
reptiles that actually evolved

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.770
from a terrestrial group of reptiles

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.980
that re-entered the sea.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.140
And as it re-entered the sea, it began to,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.410
over long periods of time, change in a way

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.010
to resemble a similar morphology.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.943
Similarly with the dolphin there.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.520
Those ancestors to the
dolphins came from land,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.710
and they re-entered the sea.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.990
And through natural selection,

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.440
acting in very similar ways across these

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.460
very different groups of organisms,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.450
we end up with very similar forms.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.490
This is true in plants as well.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.490
A well-known example is
in cactus and euphorbs.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.220
And the most recent common
ancestor to these two plants

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:06.820
is 130,000,000 years
ago, and yet they look

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.230
strikingly similar
through the small changes

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.670
of natural selection acting
over long periods of time.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.940
And one of the cool things
about natural selection

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.250
is that there is this
aspect of randomness.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.790
And so you can get
uniquely bizarre creatures

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.530
like the platypus that
are like a cross between

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.910
a beaver, an otter and a duck.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.990
And there's no rhyme or reason,

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.990
but the simplicity of natural
selection acting in a way

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.810
to create something as unique as this.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.910
So what I'd like you to
think about when you look at

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.850
the diversity out in our world

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.250
and you look at all of the amazing animals

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.810
and you see the complexity
of these ecosystems

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.820
on this planet of which we are stewards,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.470
what I'd like you to think
about is that all of this

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.390
happened through the very simple process

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.440
of natural selection.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.433
And through this simplicity is beauty.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.699
Thank you.

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.949
(applause)

00:20:28.216 --> 00:20:30.693
- No transition, I guess I'm up.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.493
Good evening.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.223
Good evening.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.990
Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.310
- Good, I'm hoping that we can have

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.150
a dialogue and a conversation.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.380
Thank you for being here tonight.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.880
I know it's evening, it's
Los Angeles so it probably

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.960
took you a bit of an effort to come here,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.710
so I'm very grateful for your time.

00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:54.690
I'm a performing artist,
so let me begin by saying

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.290
that the opinions expressed here tonight

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.290
reflect only myself and
not the School of Theater,

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.093
Film and Television, and
especially the Theater department.

00:21:02.093 --> 00:21:02.930
(audience laughter)

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.570
Okay.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.620
As a performing artist and educator,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.320
my view is necessarily
informed by the work

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.000
to which I have devoted my life.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.890
So tonight, with your indulgence,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.730
I'm interested in discussing beauty

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.720
in the laboratory of
art, specifically the art

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.330
of performance, which
is inclusive of course

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.860
of also directing, writing and design.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.970
I wanna discuss beauty and the concept

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.767
of craft and discipline as a search for

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:34.180
and an appreciation of beauty.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.830
I'd like to share an
appreciation of the preparation

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.800
and the rigor it actually
takes to make art

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.800
look easy, simple and
sometimes accessible.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.760
I recently performed with my
company, the SITI Company,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.580
a performance, a show that ran for a month

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.620
at The Getty Villa.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.850
And then after that, I just came back,

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.010
we took it to the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in New York.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.940
While we were in rehearsal at the Getty,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.590
a crew came out from BAM
and did a short promo

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.000
of which I'm gonna show
you a bit of an excerpt.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.990
Bear with me, it's about a minute, 45.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.963
I may talk over it.

00:22:13.773 --> 00:22:15.230
(percussion music)

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.450
- We have long wanted to do the Bacchae,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.730
but we have also been terrified of it.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.202
It's a story that is both
simple and complicated.

00:22:25.202 --> 00:22:27.750
- (mumbles) Here, we're very, very excited

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.493
that we'll be taking it directly
to the BAM Harvey stage.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.270
- Are you trying to spoil me rot?

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.530
- The god, Dionysus,
comes back into Thebes

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.260
disguised as a human
to, among other things,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.880
proselytize and spread his religion.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.850
He's been provocated to seek revenge

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.850
on the house of Pentheus,
the young, newly seated king

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.990
because Pentheus's fierce
denial of this new religion.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.310
Through many machinations,
Dionysus gets Pentheus

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.930
to go up to the mountain to
spy upon his band of Bacchans,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.580
but the ultra plan is
that he's going to have

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.433
Pentheus murdered by
his own mother's hands.

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:19.208
(drum beats and horn bellows)

00:23:19.208 --> 00:23:21.410
- The violence of the
action, what that would be

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.370
is much wilder in our
imaginations than it could ever be

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.423
in any other form.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.950
But the humanity of that moment,

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.370
when Agave has this realization

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.360
that she has done this thing

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.900
is something that we want to experience,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.600
channel through an actor.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.300
- Part of our background
comes out of our DNA

00:23:48.187 --> 00:23:49.020
by being in association with

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.460
the Suzuki Company of Toga in Japan.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.150
In many ways, that training
came about in an attempt

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.600
to bring a contemporary
body up to the demands

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.040
and the parameters that
the Greek plays demand.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.590
- Every day before
rehearsal, we not only train

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.020
with Suzuki training, but also viewpoints.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.000
And the viewpoints is an
improvisation in which the actors

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.510
actually essentially can
look at the play out of time.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.800
In other words, they're
not performing it in order,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.260
with the characters in order.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.040
They're in a sense hyper-texting
on the ideas of the play.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.520
Dionysius says, and
Thebes, you are in danger

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.390
of shutting down and becoming smaller

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.310
and becoming hegemonic and
becoming a kind of dictatorship.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:39.530
- Greek theater was, we're
living in a society right now

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.770
that has really important
questions to come...

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.870
- So you notice that, that was a bit

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.778
of the rehearsal process.

00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:50.210
It's not a finished project.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.950
There wasn't any big
costumes, not a lot of lights.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.560
I wanted you to get an idea of
the tremendous amount of work

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.790
it takes to put something.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.530
When you go see a show,
it's an hour and a half,

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.713
maybe two hours.

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:06.170
If it's abstract, maybe three hours.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.910
But it takes a tremendous amount of time.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:13.590
If we're lucky, four to six
weeks, eight hours a day,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.590
six days a week, 48 hours
times six times six,

00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:21.120
however many hours that
is, to present to you,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.460
not including all of the research

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.920
that we all do individually,
the rigor of the research

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.060
to put the 90 minutes that
you might see on the stage.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.640
So one of the reasons I didn't
show you the finished project

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.650
aside from the fact that
most stage productions

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.100
look terrible on film and video,

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.260
and especially in our
SITI Company productions,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.990
they can either be very
loud and jarring...

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.813
Will that work?

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.440
Or they can be very still
and quiet, like that.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.940
So rather than talk about
the beauty or lack of beauty

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.330
of a finished theatrical process,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.080
I'm gonna talk to you, share some thoughts

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.043
about the rehearsal process.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.560
While I love and I was first drawn

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.580
into the performing arts
by a sense of community,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.987
joy and cast parties (audience chuckling),

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.400
for myself, the rehearsal process,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.133
and please don't get me wrong,

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.110
the rehearsal process is
actually more exciting,

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.100
meaningful and creative
than the actual performance.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.700
And don't get me wrong, I am
both thrilled and terrified

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.150
by performing live on
stage like I am tonight.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.390
I'm a little terrified to be here tonight.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.290
And I also understand that without you,

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.470
without the audience, a play
as I love and understand it

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.480
can't be complete.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.830
Oh, and I wanna challenge
you as an audience,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.010
and sometimes I want to, maybe
often I want to confuse you

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.230
as an audience, but still I understand,

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.190
as the comedian Sarah Bernhardt says,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.170
without you, I'm nothing.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:01.230
Without an audience, the
work that I do doesn't exist.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.460
A rehearsal is only a means to an end.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.387
The end is the act of
communicating with an audience.

00:27:08.387 --> 00:27:12.963
And that communication involves
a sense of rigor and craft.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.030
Most audiences don't know or understand

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:19.153
the rigor of a good rehearsal
process, and you shouldn't.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.430
Good technique is hidden technique.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.060
We don't want you to see how we do it.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.890
We just want you to see the characters

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.920
in an extreme circumstance
telling you a story

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.470
that I hope perhaps is important for you.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.600
By nature, I'm a profession,
I'm a storyteller.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.700
And often, while my work as
a member of the SITI Company,

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.020
which is based in New York
where the work that I do

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.300
with the SITI Company is I
often practice and create

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.273
in the abstract world, in the
modern or postmodern world.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.360
Even though I often work
in these kind of wacky,

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.280
postmodern and postmodern
world, I'm constantly

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.363
asking myself what is the story?

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.700
What am I saying?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.083
And most importantly, why am I saying it?

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.030
Why should I say it and
why should people care?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.890
Why should people come and,
if we're lucky, pay money

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.740
to come see what we're trying to say?

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.650
So I don't work only exclusively
in the abstract world,

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.540
but I work in a large
part with the SITI Company

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.463
and in my own work as well
in the abstract world.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.910
I believe that you,
the viewer, the hearer,

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.460
the shared experiencer,
you might not completely

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.990
or at all sometimes understand the story

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.420
that I'm trying to share with you,

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.120
but I personally feel I
have to know and understand

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.710
the narrative that I'm
trying to share with you

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.940
even if you only get abstract imagery.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.330
Does that make sense?

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.100
The more abstract the story is,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.420
the more I have to understand what it is

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.890
I'm trying to share with you
so that you have a sense,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.060
maybe not exactly of
what I'm trying to say,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.830
but you get a sense of a point of view.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.510
You get a sense of something important.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.870
You get a sense of
something that you might

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.073
wanna pay attention to.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.960
And that takes rigor.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.770
So what does all this
have to do with beauty?

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.763
What is beauty?

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.750
For me, I believe that quite simply,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.020
and it sounds rather simplistic,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.433
beauty is the search for beauty.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.900
For myself at this juncture in my life,

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.590
beauty has become a sense
of art and artisanship,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.900
of craft and discipline.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.710
And while beauty might be
in the eye of the beholder,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.090
for myself as an artist
based in performance,

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.200
as a director, a playwright,
an actor and an educator,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.183
I look for beauty in the
attempt of virtuosity.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.843
Bad acting is easier to talk about,

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.067
easier to criticize than good acting.

00:29:57.067 --> 00:30:00.110
And we all do it, we all
criticize bad acting.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.950
But good acting, harder to talk about.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.360
You know what you liked.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.620
Why did you like it?

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.970
I'm not sure, but something about that

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.700
touched me, reached me, moved me.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.480
And in theater, it's very
ephemeral, good and bad.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.480
The bad stuff you do in theater,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.510
unless there's a critic
in the audience, gone.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.740
The good stuff that you
do, that's gone too.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.860
So if you go to see a play
and you find something

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.200
that moves you, something
that's of interest to you,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.740
something that you love,
count yourself lucky

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.103
because no one is ever
gonna see that again.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.193
What is beauty?

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.970
Beauty in performance
and beauty in rehearsal.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.740
For me, it's the beauty of preparation.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.630
The process, the ritual that
connects artists through time.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.880
Preparation of the space, of the body,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.350
of the tools of the trade.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.030
By space, I mean still.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.480
I find, I take it as an
honor with my students,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.140
with myself, with people
I work on in our company.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.110
We still make sure the place is clean

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.140
and ready to start to work
because we work a lot,

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.000
you might have noticed,
in rehearsal we work a lot

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.650
in bare feet or in socks.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.532
You might have noticed that in the film.

00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:12.110
So we make sure that the room is prepared.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.480
We prepare our bodies.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.670
We do very rigorous physical training

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.310
before every rehearsal.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.320
We do it before every show,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.010
and we do rigorous preparation

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.190
in terms of research, deep research;

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.410
and also in terms of what it
is that we bring every day

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:28.903
to the rehearsal process.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.170
So part of that rigor is
not only being well prepared

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.450
but being able to let go of it,

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.150
let go of whatever you
thought you were going to do.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.200
Let it go because of what's happening

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.250
into the room that day.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.490
Because the actor that
you're working with tells you

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.010
something that you've heard
five times or six times

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:50.110
or 25 times but says
it in a different way.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.840
But the rigor, to be in the moment,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.160
to be able to express yourself
back and to really listen

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.910
to what that actor is saying to you

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.293
takes training and rigor.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.630
Where am I?

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.940
So yes, the beauty of rigor,
the beauty of preparation,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.390
the beauty of expressing
yourself through exhaustion,

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.240
pain and discouragement
because that is a large part

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.960
of the life of a performing artist

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.960
in singing, in the world of
dance and in performance.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.690
It's a lot of disappointment.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.910
They say, I don't know if it's true,

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.120
this is an anecdotal story,
we say it in the theater

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.070
so maybe dancers say the
same thing about dancing,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.990
but in theater I've heard it said often

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:38.990
that three of the most
nerve-racking professions

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.990
are landing, and my father-in-law
was a Navy jet pilot,

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:51.100
landing a jet at night
on an aircraft carrier

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.510
going up and down, one;

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:55.330
second thing that they
say is a brain surgeon

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.393
performing brain surgery;

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.415
third thing, an actor on opening night.

00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:03.740
(audience chuckling)

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.790
It's terrifying, and yet we keep doing it.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.510
Why do we do it?

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.843
A sense of love, a sense
perhaps of a search for beauty.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.440
The beauty, the connection
of the deepest self,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.750
what drives one to the current moment.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.670
Why do we do this?

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.030
Why do we want to be in that moment?

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.420
Because that moment is
important because we're trying

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.210
to say something to the world.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.630
And for me as an artist, for
the students that I work with

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.500
at UCLA that I'm privileged
to work with here at UCLA,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.030
its challenging ourselves to be present

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.690
in the world that we live in now.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.750
I don't find that beauty or art

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.030
is a distraction from the world.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.660
I don't think that art is different

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.660
or separated from the world.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.990
I think that my art puts me
in the middle of the world.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.310
I try to find beauty in having to say

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.823
terrifying difficult
things to an audience.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.920
Some of the things I say on stage,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.890
some of the things I ask
my students to do or to say

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.073
are very difficult.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.530
Well, we say them for a reason.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.510
I just finished a Greek play,

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.660
I just finished the Bacchae
by Euripides in where,

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.580
how are we doing on time?

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.810
Okay, great.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:18.643
Oh, is that over?

00:34:18.643 --> 00:34:19.670
Am I way over?

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.080
Great, okay, I'm so sorry.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.570
I didn't look at that.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.803
I'll wrap it up very
quickly, my apologies.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.130
In the Bacchae, it's
basically about the battle

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.120
between opposing powers,
old power, new power,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.290
religion and the state,
ends up with a woman

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.980
ripping the head off of her son

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.430
while in an ecstatic,
besides yourself, state.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:42.263
Why?

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.390
To keep asking the questions
of what is the meaning

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.640
of power and what is the meaning of god.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.970
I think those are
questions that we can still

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.483
continue to ask ourselves now.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.110
Let me finish up by saying this.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.260
I'm going to close by echoing something

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.320
my new colleague, Paul Barber
said and wrote recently.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.720
Beauty is simplicity,
complexity and diversity.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.780
That's something that I long
for, search for constantly

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.790
in my own work.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.050
Simplicity, complexity and diversity.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.230
In rehearsal, I look to
discover and explore that.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.520
And then on stage, I
try to artfully recreate

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.353
that moment of discovery
eight times a week.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.680
I can only do that by
relying on the techniques

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.480
that I've learned through exploration

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.193
of rigor and preparation.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.580
Thank you.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.830
(applause)

00:35:40.215 --> 00:35:41.938
How long did I go over?

00:35:41.938 --> 00:35:43.840
- Lights down for the slides a little bit?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.673
Thank you.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.550
Good evening everyone.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.500
Thank you, Brett; thank
you, Vic, for inviting me

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.443
to participate in this program.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.950
Clicker?

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.950
- [J.Ed] It's right here.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.030
Thank you, my apologies.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.863
- Okay.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:13.180
Ideals of beauty are socially
and culturally constructed

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.823
and are used to express difference.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.270
Although rarely practiced today,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.740
for many ethnic groups
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.380
arts of the body rendered women and men

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.340
attractive at the same time they served

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.753
as powerful expressions
of identity and belonging.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.150
Skin is a highly mutable
and expressive medium.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.760
And for many cultures around
the world, including our own,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.450
it's irreversible transformations

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.170
and very particular patterns

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:53.000
of modification and
ornamentation possess beauty,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.443
as well as profound social
and spiritual significance.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.080
It is not surprising that in most cases

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.290
these programs of
scarification begin before

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.140
or during puberty so that
their completion and stages

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.810
coincides with the physiological
and social transition

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.810
from childhood to sexual
maturity, marriage and childbirth.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.420
Only by completing these age-based changes

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.793
does a woman become
beautiful and marriageable.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:36.010
Anthropologists have considered
it likely that the skin

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.300
was the first canvas of humanity,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.190
a threshold between self and others

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.070
that implies interaction and exchange.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.940
The use of the body for
encoding symbols is ancient

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.080
and is attested by cave art

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.750
in the Tassili region of the Sahara

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.663
from over eight to 9,000 years ago.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.650
African cultures have
incised and sculpted skin

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.070
to create patterns of
meaning and identity,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.460
which relate to ethnicity, kinship,

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.663
social status and gender.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:17.360
Scarifications were done by
lifting the skin with a hook

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.040
and then making shallow
and deft cuts across it,

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.040
which were then irritated
with soot or red iron oxide

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.500
or other substances so that
the scars stood in sharp relief

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.103
against otherwise smooth skin.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.110
As illustrated by these two photographs

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.030
of Bamileke women from Cameroon,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.190
the geometric designs formed
by meticulously cut rows

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:50.190
of scars enhance the natural
curves and flowing lines

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:54.140
of a woman's young and fecund body,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:58.243
producing what have been
called marks of civilization.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:06.330
The Tabwa of southeastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.980
covered themselves head to
foot with scarifications.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.060
And one observer in the late 19th century

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.320
wrote that they did so
in the most artistic

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.670
and symmetrical manner, with raised spots

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.290
and lines of relief.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.470
My colleague, Alan Roberts,

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.100
a professor here in the
Department of World Arts

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.310
and Cultures/Dance and a foremost scholar

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:35.170
of the Tabwa describes this
practice of scarification

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.170
as seeking to perfect the
body through a system of signs

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.853
ready to be read.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.420
These scars were highly tactile

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.200
and considered highly erotic,

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.450
especially when a woman was young

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:54.460
and the scars were fresh,
aiding in conception,

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.733
parenthood and continuity.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.720
My own research was in
northeastern Nigeria.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.533
And I show you a map,

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.920
and I'm gonna see if I
can handle a laser pointer

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.120
with my other hand here.

00:40:17.308 --> 00:40:18.141
I guess I can't.

00:40:19.597 --> 00:40:20.930
Are you seeing it?

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.930
Anyway, the three groups with whom I did

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.750
long-term field research

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.230
are the Ga'anda, the Bena and the Yungur.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.430
And this is a rather
remote part of the country,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.690
very different from the
highly urbanized south.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.330
It was a place that no one else had done

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.600
any kind of sustained work in until I came

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.243
to do that research in the early 1980s.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.650
The landscape was stunning.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.100
It was part of the savanna.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.400
Communities were small.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.730
Villages were also not very large.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:59.490
Houses were made of mud and
sometimes concrete block

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.760
and corrugated tin, but it was a place

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.700
that stood outside of time.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.460
And so when I did my work,
it was just at the end

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.440
of body scarification being practiced

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.830
because it was prohibited

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.420
by local government officials in 1978.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.470
As you can imagine between
the onslaught of missionaries

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.000
and Christianity,
colonization, new governments

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.920
in the post-independence era,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.390
making these marks was
not considered modern,

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.850
not considered appropriate.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.050
But I did study the women at the time

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.720
who still bore the marks
of full-body scarification

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.340
in these highly elaborate programs

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.860
that were actually
transacted over many years,

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.990
sometimes in six stages, sometimes more,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.600
always beginning when a girl was young

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.300
and the first marks
always made over her navel

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.470
to mark that part of her body

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.800
that would be the guarantor

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.340
of community survival and continuity.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.710
The marks were then done sequentially,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.230
leaving areas empty so that
certain design patterns

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.170
stood out as discrete entities,

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:20.810
so that those designs became
templates for their use

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.220
on other things, making the woman's body

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.160
that kind of template for meaning

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.923
as it moved across different categories.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.640
These are two Ga'anda
brides who were presented

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.390
to their community after
they should have completed

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.710
all of their body markings
but had only done so

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.890
with the marks that were over the navel

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.110
and down the center of the torso

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:52.150
because it had been prohibited.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.880
And they came out, they were ornamented,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.220
they were transformed,
they became beautiful.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:03.110
And the important thing
about undergoing this process

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:06.100
is that it's not only a
form of beautification

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.320
but it's also marking the fact

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.760
that these permanent
modifications to the body

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.760
coincide with the irreversible
forward march of physiology.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.140
That you move from childhood to adulthood

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.970
and then you become a
proper member of society.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:28.990
And by doing so, you must
look like an appropriate

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.263
perfected Ga'anda person.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.630
This was a neighboring
group called the Bena.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.610
I'm sorry that, I don't
know if you can dim

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:42.080
the lights a little
because her body shows you

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.080
these marks, all these
tiny meticulous cuts

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:51.750
that these programs of
marking were highly regular,

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.820
highly symmetrical and highly specific.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.190
And maybe later I'll talk about why it is

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.690
that this young woman
doesn't look very happy

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.230
with my photographing her,

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.330
because it was something
I was very intent to do.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.630
I was trying to document
this wonderful practice

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:15.440
that was now outlawed
and would soon be gone.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.430
But she's showing us most of her body

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.980
and the designs that you see conformed

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.693
to the diagram that I've created.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.320
What became extremely interesting to me

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.350
in doing the research in these communities

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.090
and asking people about
all the kinds of arts

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:39.190
that they made, was to look
at how, as I mentioned,

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:44.190
the body designs moved from a woman's skin

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.570
to the surfaces of pottery,

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.480
to the decorations and gourds,
to paintings on architecture,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.480
and especially the way that
the most important spirit pots

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.660
were marked as appropriate containers

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.010
and receptacles for the supernatural

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.050
and for those spirits
that even made it possible

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:12.213
for those cuts to scar
beautifully and not otherwise.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.800
And if you look at the scarring,

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.450
and you can actually see it here,

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:23.220
you can see how the scars
become these tiny light areas

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.070
against the skin, the body of that pot

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.930
which is named in Ngum-Ngumi,

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.700
this is the Ga'anda's culture hero,

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.370
they followed this perambulating
pot to where they live.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:38.570
The pot becomes a bearer of memory,

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.913
and the pot only looks
right and the spirit

00:45:41.913 --> 00:45:44.867
will only enter the
receptacle so that people

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:48.850
can interact with it
when it looks perfected,

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.530
just like a woman's body.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.530
And so this interesting way
that the bodies of women

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:01.050
became equal to the bodies of spirits

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.390
as represented by objects that humans make

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.390
is really a powerful message
about how these signs

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:12.290
are signs of belonging,
of collective memory,

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.680
of history, and really of the future.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.820
And of course, if we think
about the fact that these women

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.730
are no longer being marked,
it's at least important to know

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.450
that the memory of that design system,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.750
that program of beautification,

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:35.370
has been retained in the
objects that will indeed last.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.330
The objects that will keep going

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.170
and become those permanent
records of history

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.390
and memory and the way people find access

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.990
to expressing beauty.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.140
And I hope with this discussion,

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.110
that we can think about,
even in our own culture,

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.860
what it means when we mark ourselves,

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.050
when we mark ourselves
permanently with tattooing

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.320
and piercing and all other kinds of ways

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.380
and how we do so with dress.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.260
And I think it's important
to acknowledge and respect

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.500
that these systems of decoration
are not unlike what we do,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.150
they're just different;
and how important it is

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:22.050
to value that difference and that way

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.750
in which other people
express what's important

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.140
to them in their lives.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.624
Thank you.

00:47:27.624 --> 00:47:29.874
(applause)

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.103
- Hello.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.160
My remarks today will move from meditation

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.260
to critique to aspiration.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.800
So my question, what is beauty?

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.800
I think of beauty as a capacious,
empty, conceptual space

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:58.190
filled endlessly by
objects, persons or things

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:02.393
that give their viewer or
perceiver a rush of pleasure.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.630
Indeed, we say this or that
person or thing is beauty full.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.860
But what is it that they are full of?

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.900
Beauty is in an object or person,

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.910
but it is also in the eye of the beholder.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.910
Thus, beauty is a relationship
between eye and object,

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.070
between sensation and quality,

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.280
between internal and external,

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.043
between beholder and beheld.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
In the Western tradition,
women frequently embody beauty.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.710
Poets, painters and philosophers,

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.880
frequently men, have
tried to answer what it is

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.043
that she is full of that
so compels their pleasure?

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:00.910
In words, paint, ink and
stone, they craft symmetry,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.720
pleasing shape, color or form
according to the parameters

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.910
of their desire.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.610
Their work captures, freezes beauty,

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.643
renders it still and timeless.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.510
Beauty is a woman whose
radiance poets compare to

00:49:21.704 --> 00:49:25.507
"roses, sun, alabaster and pearls."

00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:30.987
For painters, beauty
required that the hair

00:49:30.987 --> 00:49:35.987
"be long, fine and blonde;
cheeks gleaming white;

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:41.557
"teeth even and gleaming white;

00:49:41.557 --> 00:49:46.047
"and the neck, round,
slender and gleaming white."

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.850
In the Western tradition then,
beauty tends to the feminine,

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.020
blonde and gleaming white.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.970
It is race and gendered.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.840
We can sometimes forget that
beauty is a relationship

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:07.480
and understand it as
objective or subjective.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.540
Objectively understood, beauty can be

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.593
judged, evaluated, determined.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:18.030
This is the realm of criticism, the canon,

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.893
beauty pageants, the market,
art and film history.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.490
Subjectively understood,
beauty is relative.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:31.220
My sense of beauty, my
eye is like no one else's.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:36.080
What stirs my pleasure
or awe is singular to me.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.160
This is the realm of the
personal, the authentic,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.073
idiom, spirit, transcendence, love.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.690
But three elements make up
the experience of beauty:

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:52.370
subject, object and affect.

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:56.770
The pleasure, attraction
or awe the perceiver feels

00:50:56.770 --> 00:51:00.800
at the sight, touch or
sound of the beautiful

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.503
object or person.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.470
Beauty's pleasure moves
the perceiver to act

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:11.660
upon the object, to
define it, replicate it,

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.470
judge it, own it, purchase it, sell it,

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:20.150
contemplate it, want it,
seduce it or love it.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:24.103
For the object, there is
only one role: to be it.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.770
I would like now to turn to these roles

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.110
as they have been
understood in the cinema.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.280
And this is the critique.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.280
Cinema, a mass popular art,
comes later to the other arts

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:42.050
to questions of beauty and the human form.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:47.050
In mass media, beauty's
pleasures are variously used.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.110
Representations of erotic beauty

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:56.110
manufactured by cinematic
craft, technology and casting

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:00.410
provide a popular commercial draw.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.080
Beauty sells.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.820
We all know this.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:07.170
Critiques of commercialized
visual pleasure

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:10.520
and in the cinema, beauty is relatedness

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.520
termed visual pleasure, note
the race and gendered nature

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:20.653
of erotic cinematic
beauty and its production.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.550
For the most part in
the Hollywood industry,

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:30.550
on screen and off, white
men act, have agency, look.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.160
And white women are
looked at and acted upon.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.340
People of color partake of
only the smallest sliver

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.393
of the screen on screen, on and off.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.080
While writing this presentation,

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.750
I recalled that the first
undergraduate essay on film

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:55.750
that I ever wrote was
tangentially about beauty.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.410
My essay analyzed the tagline

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.830
for Roman Polanski's film, Tess.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.470
Tess was the first film
Polanski made in Europe

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.860
after fleeing rape charges in the US.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.280
The tagline for the film was,

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.603
Tess, a victim of her
own provocative beauty.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:20.960
Here, beauty's object provokes

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.070
brings sexual victimization upon herself.

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:26.483
It's a tautology.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:31.590
Here, beauty provides an aesthetic alibi

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.660
for entangled, exploitive,
on-screen, off-screen

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.500
sexual misbehavious, and worse,

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.303
that the Me Too movement has
recently addressed and exposed.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:49.300
Cinema also recounts what beauty excludes.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.793
In John Stahl's 1933 Imitation of Life,

00:53:53.793 --> 00:53:57.100
a film about two mothers
and their daughters,

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.970
one pair white, the other black,

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.080
a scene features the
black teenage daughter

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.630
played by the stunning
actress, Fredi Washington,

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.810
looking into a mirror.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:13.810
Gazing at her image, she
says why can't I be white?

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:16.900
The black woman in classical cinema

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:20.760
cannot even ask the
somewhat abject question

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.460
that white women ask of their mirrors.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.710
Why can't I be beautiful?

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.590
Beauty's traditional affiliation

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.863
with whiteness and light excludes her.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.990
Hollywood cinema favors erotic beauty

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:40.990
for its commercial draw,
shaped by standards and norms.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.800
Beauty that instantly pleases,

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.333
beauty that is familiar,
beauty that is easily consumed.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.170
We can say that what
Hollywood's beautiful object

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:55.860
is full of is shaped
by cultural priorities,

00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.860
values and biases; a
consensus of the popular.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:07.270
Yet the forces of critique,
demographics and talent

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.940
change what counts as beauty,

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.330
as we can see in the greater
and greater diversity

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:14.973
on screens today.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.850
To conclude, I will turn to the personal,

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.430
and here's the aspirational.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:23.930
I pose myself the question:

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:27.030
what are the most beautiful
films I have seen?

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.470
Answering the question
that's often asked me,

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.330
what's my favorite
film, I find impossible.

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:37.030
But I decided I would just
ask myself the question.

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:39.960
And several films came to mind.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.680
Jane Campion's The Piano.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.380
Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.770
But the film that came
to me first and foremost

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.800
and most powerfully was Charles Burnett's

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.463
1978 Killer of Sheep.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:59.900
Burnett made the film for
$10,000 when he was an MFA

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:02.720
directing student at UCLA.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.820
It was his thesis film.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:06.910
Because of the music rights,

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.840
it wasn't officially released until 2008

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.280
and was immediately
designated a national treasure

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.850
by the Library of Congress.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:21.160
Set in Watts, the film follows
an African-American family,

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.750
Stan, a slaughterhouse worker, his wife,

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:27.170
young children and friends.

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:31.000
Beyond everyday incidents,
not much happens.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
The film is laconic.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.410
It conveys its meaning
primarily through spare,

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:39.400
beautiful, black-and-white images.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.330
Here is one.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.490
A group of boys aged eight to 12

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:48.170
leap from the second-storey
roof of one apartment building

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.280
to another immediately adjacent.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.040
The camera is below as
we see one after another

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.940
make the jump, and we're
looking up at them.

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:02.290
The boys are exuberant,
laughing, having fun.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:07.260
The shots capture their joy,
the beauty of their bodies

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:12.260
and the precarity inherent to their play.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:15.800
A friend asked me why, given a somewhat

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:20.783
depressing subject matter,
I find this film beautiful.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:25.320
I do so because of the
singularity of the images

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.950
the film gives us to contemplate.

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:31.640
Because I have not seen
these images, these framings,

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.860
these subjects before.

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:38.860
I do so because of the beauty
the film finds in precarity

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.610
without a hint of pathos or condescension.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:48.500
I do so because the film is full of...

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.690
I'm sorry, I do so because
what the film is full of

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:58.690
does not rely on conventional
priorities, values or biases;

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:02.240
is not familiar or easy.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.280
Killer of Sheep's beauty
showed me something

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.280
I had not seen before, taught
me something, did something.

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:13.040
Its object was active.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.700
The pleasure it gave
me was active, bracing.

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.660
It knocked me back in my seat,
took my breath away, awed me.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.540
I share this film with you on streaming

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.650
for the course website.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:31.650
And Killer of Sheep gave me
the occasion to speak tonight.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.840
See it if you get the chance.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.149
It is beauty full.

00:58:37.149 --> 00:58:38.661
Thank you.

00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:40.911
(applause)

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:47.050
- Thank you, thank you so much Kathleen

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:49.983
and all four of you for
terrific, terrific presentations.

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:54.880
And if I were to call them
beautiful presentations

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.390
on the topic of beauty, I'm
wondering if that's a tautology

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:59.770
or an aspiration, and I'm not yeah sure.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.768
But the one thing I know
is it's a beautiful set

00:59:01.768 --> 00:59:04.553
of four presentations together.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.780
And I'm very struck by
the way in which an idea

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.220
of the body comes up
in very different forms

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.730
in relation to your own fields of work,

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.093
but that runs as a kind
of theme through these,

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.420
which we might tease out in a minute

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.730
in an extended conversation
around the ideas you bring up.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.900
But my first question to open this up is

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.060
before receiving an email
and an invitation from us

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.790
to address a question of beauty,

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.800
have you asked the question
of yourself sometime recently

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.540
or regularly in your own work,

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.280
and when did you, do you have a memory

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.200
of that first coming
up in your own research

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.140
and thinking about the kind of ideas

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.320
that you presented here?

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.803
What is beauty?

00:59:45.803 --> 00:59:47.190
Have you asked yourself that in the past

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:48.360
or did you wait for us to come in

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.663
from the outside and prompt you?

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.140
- Speaking for myself,
I can't say that I never

00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.823
consciously thought of that.

01:00:02.106 --> 01:00:06.050
And that made the
assignment that much more

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.450
interesting and challenging.

01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:09.794
- Yeah, Marla, you (mumbles)--

01:00:09.794 --> 01:00:12.753
- Well, I think in the work that I do,

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.670
I think we're considering
beauty all the time

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:21.470
because when looking
at sculpture or objects

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.850
that are made by other people,

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:27.740
those kinds of aesthetic
evaluations are always at play.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.710
And I think that in my training as someone

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:36.510
who's tried to look at the art of others,

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:40.190
using criteria that are
not strictly my own,

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:45.190
it's interesting how I find consistency,

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:48.020
consistency in those aesthetic criteria

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.370
in the sense of symmetry.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:54.450
And when you see a beautiful sculpture

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:57.763
from a culture, say, in West Africa,

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.610
the women possess the
same kind of qualities

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.680
that we might value in ourselves.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.940
And so there's something
that's interesting

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.490
in that universality,
but I refuse to believe

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.350
that there is a universality
because of course

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:16.320
that goes directly against my saying

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.110
that ideals of beauty are
culturally constructed,

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.600
which I believe they are.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.930
But still, there's something
about the human being

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.580
that is the thing we share,

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.130
that has features that are common

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.930
that I think lend themselves
to those judgments

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.253
that are similar.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.730
- [Brett] Yeah, fantastic.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.123
Kathleen or J.Ed?

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:42.280
- Well, I hadn't asked myself

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.590
the question of beauty.

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:48.590
Aesthetics comes up in
film primarily with regard

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.163
to film form, because
the question of beauty

01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:57.000
of the human body or figure

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:00.630
I kind of came in with Laura Mulvey's

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.440
Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.440
So the idea of visual
pleasure and aesthetics

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.020
vis-a-vis bodies was very much
about a critique of gender.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.910
So this sent me back to my complet roots

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:20.140
and thinking about the tradition

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.623
and how to, but I ended up
with the critique anyway.

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:27.090
- [J.Ed] I think about
beauty all the time.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.810
The difficulty or the challenge,

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:32.420
my work is all about
obstacles and challenges

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.000
and how to work with them,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.540
and that's where the joy comes out of.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.110
For me, the challenge, the obstacle was

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:42.610
could I make my remarks
and my point of view

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:46.023
accessible to the people that
were gonna be in the room?

01:02:47.353 --> 01:02:49.470
I'm an observational artist.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:52.410
I think most artists are,

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.030
particularly in performance art,

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.640
as well as in fine and graphic arts.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.260
So I'm looking to find the beauty

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.720
in how this young lady is bent over

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.968
and writing down in her notebook.

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:08.630
So I believe so much in what you said

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:12.370
that it starts, beauty starts
from taking something simple

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:13.683
and making it complex.

01:03:14.998 --> 01:03:18.040
That, to me, is everything about art.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.710
So I look for beauty everywhere,

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:25.570
and then I try to see how
I can make the invisible

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:26.960
more visible to an audience.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.310
I also think that's what
we try to do on stage.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.347
- Your observation, Kathleen,

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:35.970
that beauty is a kind of relationship

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.900
sometimes between different subjects,

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.523
between a subject and audience.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.620
There's a striking kind of relationship

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.590
one can imagine in that
to the idea of beauty

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:49.340
as a form of difference making

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.740
and that that's a kind of process.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.490
And that's another thing that comes across

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:54.700
in the presentations in different ways,

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.130
that it's a sort of unfolding in time

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.410
of difference, either within a culture

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:02.798
or between species and their environment

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.460
but that in each case,
this body that comes up

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.350
is in relation to something
outside of itself.

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.390
It might be the local culture,

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.420
it might be the environment

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.310
as you as a scientist describe it.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:14.990
But that kind of, the
importance of a sort of

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:18.860
relational or process-driven
account for what beauty is,

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.820
is teased out in very
different and interesting ways

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.260
between the four of you.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.740
And at a certain level, one
can imagine wanting to spend

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.160
a great deal of time understanding

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.060
what that larger context is

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.280
for these individual
objects or performances,

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.170
whether it's an audience
or a natural environment

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.620
or a small part of a larger environment

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.490
or the local communities that
these cultures evolve around.

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:46.230
And to a certain level,
though I'm struck by how

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:49.710
those environments are, the
larger settings aren't being

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:53.630
spoken of as much as
the individual members

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.030
or examples within them.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:57.650
And I'm wondering if
they become a means then

01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:00.485
to try and understand these larger worlds

01:05:00.485 --> 01:05:02.993
that these species or
cultures operate within.

01:05:04.223 --> 01:05:07.940
- Well I think cultures
or people are highly aware

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.780
of everything they see in front of them.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.790
I mean, that's what we do
all the time, all day long,

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:16.170
is take in people, look at their faces,

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:19.010
think about what we see, what people wear.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.250
And it goes on almost without thinking,

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:27.250
these judgments, these
calculations, these assessments.

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:29.910
It's just part of being in the world.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:34.910
And sometimes, you think
about them in terms of beauty.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.250
You don't like to judge
people, but you do.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:40.470
So it's kind of how we live in the world,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.990
and I think the great deal of difference

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:48.250
that we're allowed in,
say, our Western tradition

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:51.710
of people having individuality,

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:55.060
in a way that I would not have
seen in a Ga'anda community

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.630
where individuality was
not valued in the same way

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:02.830
as we might, produces a
different visual universe

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:05.410
because conformity, for us sometimes,

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:08.640
seems not something you aspire to,

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.363
whereas elsewhere it's
something you do aspire to.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:17.030
- Yeah, you were thinking
in terms of performance

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.270
on that front.

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:22.440
- You know, I think whereby
nature, we're narrative animals.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.910
If we hear a noise at
night in the other room,

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:30.910
we go, oh, that's the cat
jumping off to get some water.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.820
We look up at the stars
and we connect the dots

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.993
and go oh, that's a belt that Orion is in.

01:06:36.864 --> 01:06:40.890
So we tend to try to
explain things for ourselves

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:45.320
so we can survive an onslaught of stimuli.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.898
So I think in terms of the differences,

01:06:48.898 --> 01:06:52.990
I tend to try to look at differences

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:54.940
and see how they're related to me.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.650
I try to look at the differences

01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:01.323
and find the things, as
in nature, are so related.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.160
Diversity is what allows (mumbles)

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.870
correct me if I'm wrong, professor,

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:12.200
diversity in nature is what allows nature

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.260
to continue to grow and
to evolve and to prosper.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.260
And I think that, that's
something that we can,

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.160
perhaps as human beings,

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:21.523
take a little more acknowledgment of.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.220
- And certainly, we call
it, at a certain level,

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.135
is about the building of models

01:07:28.135 --> 01:07:29.523
that account for those differences.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:36.210
- Yeah, some of the things
that have struck me here

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.880
is Kathleen talking
about this idea of desire

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:48.510
and Marla talking about
these cultural differences

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:50.153
and beauty being cultural.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.640
And yet people can go
into a different culture

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.140
and say, go into a market in Africa

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:07.140
and you can see some
piece of local craft work

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:14.030
and you find it just intrinsically
beautiful and desirable.

01:08:17.457 --> 01:08:22.457
And in fish, I mean there
are examples in biology

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:28.410
where you can do these
mate choice experiments

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.350
to look at the attractiveness
of certain features.

01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:37.260
And a really good example of
this is there are these fish

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.450
called swordtails and they have
different lengths of swords,

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.240
these different lengths of projections

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.600
off of the caudal fin.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.243
That's the back end fin.

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:54.910
And you can artificially
attach a longer fin

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.190
to a particular fish.

01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:01.460
And even to a different species,

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.630
it will find it more attractive

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:07.800
than an individual from its own species.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.770
And so one of the things I
find remarkable in all of this

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:14.020
is there really is so much individuality

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.830
in terms of what we find desirable,

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.940
what we find beautiful.

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:24.940
And yet there's those individual,

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.970
those individual differences can coalesce

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.910
into these cultural differences,

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:33.020
but we still have the
ability to bridge them.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:38.020
And it just shows how
how plastic it all is.

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:41.590
- And plastic in time,
(static noise drowns dialogue)

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:43.563
touch on that in different ways,

01:09:43.563 --> 01:09:45.580
the sort of evolving whether
it's the continuous rehearsal

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.720
of a piece to leave with
a final presentation,

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.920
the evolution of the
scarification over time

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.007
at a moment of which that's
changing dramatically.

01:09:56.007 --> 01:09:58.890
And it sort of begs
questions around the extent

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:01.354
to which that's conscious
as a part of these events

01:10:01.354 --> 01:10:05.210
or consequences that are
being observed by all of you

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:07.813
in your own work as you're doing it.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.280
- Well, Paul, to your point,

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.280
I think that there's a real
tension between sort of beauty

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:21.810
or the response to
beauty of the individual

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.820
and then the culture industry
and what the culture industry

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:28.560
has produced for us 24/7,

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.960
in film and all the ancillary products

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.590
and advertising and so on so that

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:37.480
no one feels beautiful, right,

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.880
if they're measuring themselves

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.713
against these cultural norms.

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:46.630
Anyway, but it does change, right?

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.960
It does change, it is changing.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.350
We're seeing many different
kinds of bodies now presented

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.790
as desirable or beautiful.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:00.120
But there is the tension between
what culture is giving us

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.770
and what we feel and how
what we feel is shaped

01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:08.010
by those very pervasive images.

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:12.120
And some things are up on
the, are in blockbusters

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.310
and some things really aren't.

01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:20.310
- So if you step back in
time and go into these

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:26.680
indigenous societies where
the other isn't media,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.800
there isn't film and
advertising and a whole industry

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.680
built around this notion
of defining and creating

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:39.680
what is beauty, how
does it differ in these?

01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:43.190
Do you have that same sort of phenomenon

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:45.370
just without the technology?

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:49.460
Or is it something that really evolves

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.360
much more organically
without any real intention?

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.080
- Well, I think it's a kind of a falsehood

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:01.110
to imagine that communities
living even in a remote part

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:06.110
of Nigeria don't change and
don't change all the time.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:10.430
I think that we presume
that that isolation

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:15.250
is a kind of a restricting,
but it's not because

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.260
you have ideas coming in all the time

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:22.300
even before everyone had
their own cell phones

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.650
and all the things that have now actually

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:27.420
opened up the world to people

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.170
that they had no idea about before.

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:34.000
Because as soon as Europeans
came and brought cloth

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.280
and people began to
incorporate these new things,

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.310
but as they did, they were building

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:43.030
on their original
aesthetic and adding to it

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:45.910
with the new things until, as I said,

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:48.790
the old things become prohibited.

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.540
And then you figure out
how do we do without them

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.540
but still have the same systems
of expressing who we are

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:00.010
and what are the limits
of that as things change?

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:03.510
Do they broaden, how do they alter?

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:08.010
- I think in general, we're, as a species,

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:11.130
attracted and intrigued by difference

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.820
until we feel threatened.

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.250
And I don't know when that
happens, that it changes

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:19.090
from an attraction, intrigued by something

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.860
that's different and then it
becomes something threatening.

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.080
But that idea, no matter
what the isolation,

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.668
there's always something that's
coming in that's different.

01:13:29.668 --> 01:13:33.130
We have to keep, human beings anyway,

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.255
and then most animals probably,

01:13:35.255 --> 01:13:37.000
from a certain amount of inbreeding.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.090
There needs to be a difference.

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:40.460
And I think that's maybe genetic.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:44.270
We're attracted to the
difference to keep us changing

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:45.820
and developing as human beings.

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.610
So I think beauty, I would say then,

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:53.190
beauty, whatever your definition
of it is, can be healthy.

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:54.860
I really do believe that.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:58.450
I think we sometimes allow
ourselves to be dictated to

01:13:58.450 --> 01:14:00.960
what a concept of beauty might be.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.920
But for me, the idea
that beauty is noticing

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.150
and appreciating something
different, I think,

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.988
is a very healthy thing.

01:14:07.988 --> 01:14:09.360
- I mean, a bit like
Kathleen's observation

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.200
about the idea of visual pleasure

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.740
figuring into an account to beauty,

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.810
you're touching on attraction and fear,

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.600
also brings the question of
emotion into the conversation

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.570
in an interesting way,
that beauty, as a concept

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.420
as we wrestle with it, has that dimension

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.470
built into it in some way.

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.230
It's a thing experienced

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:31.475
and we experience through
emotion in some degree

01:14:31.475 --> 01:14:34.753
and not just observation
in a more distanced way.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.730
- Beauty is very sensory.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:42.360
It's all about the senses.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.360
It's tactility, it's olfactory,
it's everything combined.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.870
It's not just one thing or the other,

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:52.670
it's what we see, it's what
we feel, it's what we smell,

01:14:54.572 --> 01:14:56.130
all those things come together

01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:59.560
to make for an experience
that's pleasant or pleasurable

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:02.070
but defined by oneself.

01:15:02.918 --> 01:15:04.240
- Terrific, terrific.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.010
We're gonna open up the floor.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:07.650
We have microphones as always.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:12.090
We want to extend the
conversation out into the room.

01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:15.030
And if our microphones are available,

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:17.600
we've got a question right up front here.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.720
- Thank you all so much, this
was really very inspiring.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.720
I have a question about
any definitions of beauty

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:28.450
that are universal.

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:30.570
We've talked about relative beauty.

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:33.660
We've talked about sort of
personal definitions of that.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.380
But have any of you, in
your various disciplines,

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.653
come across a more universal
definition of beauty?

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:46.540
- I would say this personally,

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:49.490
I don't know if I've come
across a definition of it,

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:54.490
but I would say that the sense
of rigor and craftsmanship

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.870
as a partial definition
of beauty, I think,

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:04.843
is fairly universal in my opinion.

01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:11.600
That's what I think.
(audience laughing)

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.433
- Anyone else wanna take that?

01:16:14.965 --> 01:16:15.973
(laughs)

01:16:15.973 --> 01:16:17.880
They're looking at one
another, I'm not sure.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.723
- I avoid universals, I don't know.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.410
- Okay, questions?

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.663
Right up in the middle
here in the audience.

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:30.060
We're just bringing a
microphone around, sorry.

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.440
- Thank you, I have a
question about something

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.260
that hasn't been mentioned
about terror and beauty

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.753
and terrifying beauty.

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:52.220
Images that we find terrifyingly beautiful

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.363
or Baudelaire, Fleurs du mal.

01:16:55.387 --> 01:16:56.903
Can you comment on that?

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.333
- On terror and beauty,
the sublime, right?

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.830
- [Woman] Or images, for example, of 9/11

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:10.893
that many people have found
terrifyingly beautiful.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.530
I know that's an extreme,
but there is that edge

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:20.123
that one encounters in beauty.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.910
- Well I think one way,

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:25.920
I don't know how to immediately respond

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.270
but one way is to think about,
again, the affect, right?

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:32.273
Because with the sublime,

01:17:34.068 --> 01:17:39.068
you're floored to your being
and there is terror in it.

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:42.333
But maybe you can't take
your eyes off of it.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.635
I don't know much.

01:17:47.635 --> 01:17:49.478
(overlapping dialogue)
- It seems to me

01:17:49.478 --> 01:17:51.570
that's a really important
component of beauty

01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:53.413
in our culture these days as well.

01:17:55.157 --> 01:17:56.333
- I think there's also,

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.320
just to use your specific of the 9/11,

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.390
is there's a distance of time

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:09.200
that allows the viewer
to look at the image

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.200
as an image itself and not
as a symbol for an event.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.260
And I think that that
might make a difference.

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.780
I think not all the Greek plays

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.810
but a lot of the Greek plays are,

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:24.620
the tragedies are extremely terrifying

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.660
and deal with terrifying acts.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.180
And I bet that they had
a very different reaction

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.730
to the people watching them
there than they do now.

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.390
- Tying back to what
J.Ed was saying earlier

01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:42.050
about beauty eliciting
an emotional response,

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:47.050
I think that the kinds of images
that you're talking about,

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:50.960
they are very emotional.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.850
And I think that it does
sort of tie into that

01:18:55.850 --> 01:19:00.850
same sort of emotion pleasure center

01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:06.110
that makes us think of things as beautiful

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:12.510
and whether that is essentially just

01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:20.920
evolutionary crossed
lines where it happens

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.800
to trigger the same sort of system,

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.083
or whether there's actually
some sort of evolutionary

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.600
advantage to that sort of
emotional trigger, there may be.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.940
Because those images being
so captivating and powerful,

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.300
they really do leave an impression.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:48.970
And so it may actually influence how

01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:51.310
you live your life in the future

01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:55.663
because those images just
stay with you forever.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.973
- And evolution in a way,

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.700
while being beautiful,
is also very terrifying.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.310
I mean, if you're not the
fish that's got the big

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.270
caudal fin in the back
that makes you good-looking

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:12.270
to other fish, so there is
something necessarily terrifying

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.400
about evolution if you're not the one

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.823
that gets to go forward.

01:20:18.976 --> 01:20:19.809
(audience chuckling)

01:20:19.809 --> 01:20:21.363
- Perfect. Right up front here.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:24.970
- We're getting to grad school.

01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:27.790
- It's kind of a personal
question for all of you guys.

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:32.723
Since beauty can be very
empowerfully attractive,

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:37.630
when was the first time
you experienced beauty

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.380
in your particular field of study?

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.230
And what was the emotional response

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:44.710
that drew you into a life
pursuing your careers?

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:52.885
(overlapping dialogue)

01:20:52.885 --> 01:20:55.410
- Mine is pretty cheesy.

01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.290
(audience laughing)

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:57.230
- [Brett] So much the better.

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:01.610
- I'm from San Antonio,
Texas deep in the heart,

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:06.610
and I grew up in a very low-income family.

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:09.100
I'm the first generation college graduate

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.950
and very proud of that.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:15.950
And in my house, we
mostly watched telenovelas

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.560
on our black and white triple console,

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:25.980
because that's what
we, anyway but one day,

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.790
switching around when no one was home,

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:29.550
this is a true story,
it sounds really hokey

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:34.100
but it's really true, I came
across the local PBS station

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.910
and I saw, I swear to God,
I didn't know anything

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:39.710
from theater ever and I
never even thought about this

01:21:39.710 --> 01:21:42.310
for 15 years later that it might happen,

01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:47.310
but I saw a Great Performances
theater in America piece

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.170
and it was about puppets.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.780
It was puppets, but it
was this virtuosic man

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:56.120
telling all these stories with puppets.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.370
And I just sat there and thought

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:00.590
how beautiful it was.

01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:04.280
And it wasn't until later, as
I watched the ending of it,

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.220
that it came out that it was one man

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:08.180
who had done all the
voices and all the puppets

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.820
and that I didn't even
know what virtuosity was

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.190
but I was just blown away
that something so beautiful

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:17.340
could have happened on my television.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.750
True story.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:22.110
- I think my experience was here at UCLA

01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:25.860
as an undergraduate
student in art history,

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.800
taking my first course
on the arts of Oceania,

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.720
which was, first of all I
wasn't sure what Oceania was

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:37.360
or what kind of art, I thought
well art from under the sea.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.136
How cool is that?

01:22:39.136 --> 01:22:39.969
(laughs)

01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:40.970
But it was actually a course

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:42.770
about the arts of the Pacific

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:47.430
and it was taught in a large auditorium

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.020
that's now actually in Broad,

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:52.670
and it was taught by a person,

01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:54.420
a professor named Arnold Rubin

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:57.390
who actually became my mentor.

01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:01.490
And he showed us images of masqueraders

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:05.863
coming out of a men's
house in Papua New Guinea.

01:23:08.873 --> 01:23:12.750
And these masquerades
extended the human body

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:19.270
to a tremendous height and
they kind of poured out

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:22.570
of this darkness into the light.

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:25.500
And the images, the slides
were projected very large.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.130
And in those days, you
didn't often get rooms

01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:32.180
where they could throw a
slide far enough to get that.

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:36.170
And I just thought, I can't
believe people do this.

01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:38.820
I've never seen anything like it.

01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.820
It was so stunning, a
little terrifying to imagine

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.780
that these kinds of things
were going on in the world

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:50.710
as you know, a little
girl from Los Angeles

01:23:50.710 --> 01:23:52.350
never saw anything like it.

01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:54.070
And it totally changed my life

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.750
because I probably would have ended up

01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:58.710
studying Impressionism or something.

01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:03.710
But instead, I was completely
riveted by this idea

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.200
of exploring the unknown
and finding beauty

01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:13.110
and excitement about what that meant

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:14.660
and what I could learn from it.

01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:18.930
- It's a great question.

01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:21.670
And my experience, a little anomalous

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:24.333
as I'm thinking about it, but it was,

01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:28.950
when I was an undergrad and
I took a film theory class

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:31.900
and it was very dense and
we were reading a lot of

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.760
Marx and Nietzsche, and I
would have this experience

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.190
during lectures where I would be following

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:46.030
what the lecture was, both
conceptually but with images.

01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:49.770
Images would run through my
head and the relationship

01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:53.663
between images and thought in film,

01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:58.240
both the ideas you attach to images

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.890
but also how images attach
themselves to thought.

01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:05.170
And it was kind of an amazing experience.

01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:07.583
So here I am.

01:25:13.364 --> 01:25:15.430
- So most of my life I actually,

01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:18.643
or most of my youth I thought
I was gonna be a musician.

01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:23.510
And it was much later actually,

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:28.510
after I'd gone to grad
school and was visiting

01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:34.460
my mom at home that my former
first grade teacher came over.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:37.340
And we all did these
assignments in first grade,

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.480
it was the one assignment
she kept from every student

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.953
which is, what are you
gonna be when you grow up.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:44.680
(audience chuckling)

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.843
Mine was I was gonna be a scientist.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.150
So something happened very early on

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:55.150
before I was really
conscience of this path

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:58.433
that I ultimately took.

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:01.180
But there's certainly been,

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.480
like going back to that
musical side of things,

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:07.800
there have been many moments in my life

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.740
where I've heard a piece
of music for the first time

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.130
and one immediate example
that comes to mind

01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:20.650
when I first got a recording
of Philip Glass's Solo Piano,

01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:25.650
which kind of goes with the
complexity and simplicity thing

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.830
because melodically it's very simple

01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.623
even though it's incredibly busy.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:36.210
And I couldn't, I put it on
and I couldn't go to sleep.

01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:38.100
I just listened to it over and over

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:43.100
because I had such an incredible
emotional reaction to it

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:46.960
and I was trying to figure out why.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.200
And I didn't sleep at
all, I just listened to it

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.083
over and over all night long.

01:26:53.519 --> 01:26:54.843
- [Brett] Fantastic.

01:26:56.557 --> 01:26:58.165
- What was it?
- Yeah, what was it?

01:26:58.165 --> 01:27:00.070
- What's that?
- Philip Glass?

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:02.940
- Yes, Phillip Glass, Solo Piano.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.930
- Amazing, fantastic.

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:05.883
More questions?

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:08.580
Let's go up to the top,

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.880
there's a question right
in the middle there.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.910
And then we're gonna come down.

01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:14.353
Students, if you've got
any questions down here.

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:17.770
Just right in the middle
of the top row there, yep.

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:24.231
(distant indistinct muttering)

01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:25.640
It's a traveling microphone.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.943
- It's a communal act.

01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:35.268
- My question is for the scarification

01:27:35.268 --> 01:27:39.240
reminds me of like
foot-binding in Asian China.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:41.620
So it was like the
beauty center at the time

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:45.230
by apparently caused harm to your body.

01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:48.370
I think the same applies
for tattoos, piercing,

01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:50.520
also even the wearing of high heels.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.700
So my question was what's your attitude

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.560
toward the fact that we sometimes say

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.660
there's a price we need to pay for beauty?

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:02.510
English is not my language,
so I hope I say clear.

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:03.820
Thank you.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.310
- That's a very good question,

01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:08.810
and I didn't actually speak about this

01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:12.610
but of course all of
these transformations,

01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:15.520
whether it's foot binding
or body scarification,

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.770
are all about pain.

01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:20.090
And it's about a test of endurance.

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:23.640
It's about the price you pay to belong.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.240
It's like, we all suffer for beauty.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.280
How many of us have worn stupid shoes

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.320
and they look really great,
but you break your feet?

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.620
I mean, that's a much
more superficial thing

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.050
than actually modification of the body,

01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:42.130
but I think that there's a side to it

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:46.070
where you wonder if this
is violence against women,

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:50.310
the binding of feet, the cutting of skin.

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:54.280
How do we feel about that
looking at it as Westerners

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.840
from the outside,
because that's a question

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.410
that you have and you certainly think it.

01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:04.150
But it's also a kind of
test of personal empowerment

01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:08.560
that you can actually endure and overcome

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.960
because the result is
worth the price of pain.

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.897
So I think it's complicated,

01:29:14.897 --> 01:29:19.580
and I definitely think it's
part of what it takes to belong.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.770
It's part of what it takes to grow up.

01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:25.040
And we suffer in our own
lives in different ways,

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.070
maybe not as radically as these,

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:28.870
but I think that was part of it.

01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:31.910
It was, how do we test you to make sure

01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:35.140
that you've got the
muster to be one of us?

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.187
And those were the tests that,

01:29:37.187 --> 01:29:40.090
and for the boys where I work,

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.810
they had initiations where they were going

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:46.050
into a remote location and being subjected

01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:49.300
to all sorts of ordeals
that they had to overcome,

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.900
and it was the same kind of thing,

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:55.140
it just did not leave the
indelible markings on the body

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.950
because I think women's
bodies are more powerful.

01:29:57.950 --> 01:30:00.420
They are the containers of the future.

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:03.450
So that's partly why they're marked

01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:04.863
or women's feet are bound.

01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:09.230
- Building on what Marla was saying,

01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:11.230
sorry I just like threw myself in there,

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:17.250
I wonder if the audience could talk about

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:21.593
the psychic, aside from
shoes that give you,

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:27.460
I don't know, blisters,
what the psychic price

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:31.943
of beauty is in your own experience.

01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:39.390
- Yeah, so that actually
segways really well into,

01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:41.840
I have a comment and
then sort of a question.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.740
I kind of wanted to push back on the idea

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.940
of like prizing
individuality in our society

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.460
because I think there's a
lot of Eurocentric Western

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.110
ideals of beauty that a lot of women,

01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:56.150
especially non-white women
actually have to undergo

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.820
in this culture, that
our body modifications,

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.930
for example extensive hair removal,

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:02.763
often permanent hair removal;

01:31:03.853 --> 01:31:06.810
and then also men, some
men all over the world

01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:09.380
undergo circumcision, which is also

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.310
a ritualized form of body modification.

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:15.120
So I would say that in that case,

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:17.710
I mean there are movements,
feminist movements especially

01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:19.370
that encourage women to
keep their body hair,

01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:22.430
but I definitely have
suffered my entire life

01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:24.510
from being of Middle Eastern descent

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:27.790
in having more body hair
than like white woman would,

01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:30.370
so I just wanted to add that.

01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:33.940
And then I wanted to ask
you all what your idea

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:38.180
of ugliness is, which I
mean I guess is the opposite

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:40.710
of beauty, or maybe not ugliness but just

01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:42.710
the opposite of beauty and if you think

01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:44.293
that is also subjective.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.832
- That's a great question.

01:31:49.832 --> 01:31:54.510
And one of the directions
that a study of beauty goes

01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:58.070
is to what's excluded?

01:31:58.070 --> 01:32:00.160
Because beauty always excludes.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.090
There is who is not beautiful,

01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:05.880
and what are their qualities
or characteristics?

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:10.880
And I think that one of the ways

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.800
that we can think about what is excluded

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:17.693
is anything that's not normative.

01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:24.470
Non-symmetrical faces, people
who are differently abled,

01:32:26.404 --> 01:32:29.654
that their embodiment is not normative.

01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:38.980
And beauty can be very destructive.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.750
Can be a very destructive idea

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.460
when we think about its opposite.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.890
We think about ugliness, we
think about you can't get in,

01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:49.920
you can't be in this space of beauty.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.830
And Toni Morrison, the famous novelist,

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:56.390
she once said that she thought that beauty

01:32:56.390 --> 01:33:00.870
and romantic love were
the most destructive ideas

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:03.040
in the Western tradition

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.900
because they always,

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.450
because there are people who are in

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:10.100
and people who are not.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.523
So that's how I respond to
the question of ugliness.

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:21.390
- All three are really
tremendous questions

01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:24.750
and it's also tricky for me to be honest

01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:28.693
to talk about some things now as a male.

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:34.840
But I'll say this.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.940
What's interesting to me perhaps is that,

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:44.160
why the question is, for
me, really more interesting

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.200
is because it's not a
question that you actually

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.183
deal with a lot with men.

01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:56.370
That imposed notions of
beauty, and yes that is you do

01:33:58.650 --> 01:34:02.500
accept some things, you do accept,

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.360
how did I write this down?

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.910
Is it imposed?

01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:07.073
Is it an imposed,

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:11.700
is it something that is imposed on you

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:14.390
to be accepted or to be
whatever you consider

01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:16.110
might be beautiful, or is it something

01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:18.160
that you accept and you take on?

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:23.160
And I think that, and I'm
almost treading on thin ice,

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:25.760
but I think that that's an issue where,

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.760
because of the dominance where more things

01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:33.153
are imposed on women than are men.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.530
There are men who have scarification

01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:41.530
and who have things that
change their appearance,

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:44.640
but it's not the same for men.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:46.873
For a woman, it's very different issues.

01:34:48.487 --> 01:34:52.613
I think that, that's a big
part of it in terms of,

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:56.573
does that make sense,
what I've said so far?

01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.130
There's a lot less things that we as male,

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:02.640
and I'm a person of color
but still, as a male,

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:05.360
there's a lot less things in terms of my,

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.250
and I do have to worry about
my self identity still,

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:11.680
but there's a lot less
things I have to worry about

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.233
than people who are not men.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.830
Secondly, in terms of what is ugliness...

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.340
(distant indistinct muttering)

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:25.345
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:35:25.345 --> 01:35:27.190
(distant indistinct muttering)

01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:29.030
She thinks it also depends on what culture

01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:30.873
or group that you are a part of.

01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:34.500
In terms of the concept of what is ugly,

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.920
and again this is just my opinion,

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.830
it does not reflect the School of Theater,

01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:39.773
Film and Television or theater,

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.860
and this is simplistic,
but I find very little

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.403
in nature to be ugly.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.233
I really do.

01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:55.740
It's handmade in positions
that turns something

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.300
that might be beautiful
into something that's ugly.

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.970
Nature is chaotic, but
even the chaos of nature

01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:05.420
in its destructive paths,
whether a lava field flowing down

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.630
or after a hurricane, if it's just nature,

01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:10.640
there's an odd beauty to it.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.040
But you can look at like the lushness,

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.820
I live in upstate New York

01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:16.200
even though I live in California now.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:17.953
It's very lush and beautiful.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.710
You look at a tropical rainforest,

01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:22.260
it's very, very beautiful.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:25.910
You look at a desert, whether
rocky desert in West Texas

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:28.660
or whether high desert in California

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.620
or whether large sand
deserts like the Sahara,

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.660
they're all still beautiful.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.120
There are different visions,
but they're all beautiful.

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.680
But then you take that beauty
and you put something in it

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.790
that man has made, whether
it's debris or debris,

01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:43.630
and it changes it.

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:45.000
I don't know if that makes sense,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.820
but that's how I feel.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.193
I feel like there's very
little in the natural world

01:36:49.193 --> 01:36:50.723
that is really ugly.

01:36:53.172 --> 01:36:56.350
We as human beings tend to
mess things up and make it ugly

01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:57.830
and sometimes by putting our perceptions

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:59.777
of what beauty is we turn
something that's beautiful

01:36:59.777 --> 01:37:02.270
and different into something ugly.

01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:03.540
- Marla, Paul?

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.373
Any of you?

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:10.130
- I was just responding to
Judith and thinking that

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:15.330
in cultures elsewhere, the
men are the pretty ones.

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:18.330
There are men that, I
mean, they do the hair

01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:21.720
and I mean, there are all kinds of ways

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.750
that the gender thing flips.

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:27.170
And we haven't talked about hair.

01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:29.400
I mean we have, it was brought up by you,

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.610
but in fact the ability to manipulate hair

01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:36.610
is a major capacity that humans have.

01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:39.540
And if you look cross-culturally,

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.280
you can see the extraordinary things

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.320
that people have created
just by using mostly

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.663
the hair on their heads.

01:37:48.533 --> 01:37:51.740
But it is either gone or it's there,

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:53.863
but it's part of norms of beauty.

01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:03.750
- So I guess I wanna go back just briefly

01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:07.533
to this idea of like the scarification

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:13.820
or the foot binding,
imposing some sort of burden,

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.800
and just point out some
examples in the animal world

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:27.800
where this is actually quite common.

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.800
So if you look at the antlers
of something like an elk,

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.700
that's 35 pounds of calcium
that gets acquired, extruded

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.620
and shed on a yearly basis.

01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:52.620
And the males are identified
as being more attractive

01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:55.270
by the larger the antlers.

01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:59.120
And the evolutionary
theory behind this is that

01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:04.880
it is displaying the ability to deal

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.830
with quite an imposing burden

01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:13.830
and that if an animal
like that can withstand

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.400
such a burden, it must
be a really good mate

01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:22.420
because it has really good genes.

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:26.710
Because a weaker animal would
not be able to survive that.

01:39:26.710 --> 01:39:31.710
And so I think sometimes
we have a tendency

01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:39.310
to differentiate ourselves from animals

01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:44.310
a little too much and forget
that some of these behaviors

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.900
that have evolved for
hundreds of millions of years

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.340
in all sorts of different animals,

01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:54.917
that some of those behaviors and ways

01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.540
that pleasure centers are
triggered, they still exist.

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:05.540
And so I don't think it's unfair to view

01:40:08.472 --> 01:40:11.180
some of these things in terms of a burden

01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:16.043
that's being imposed on women.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.003
I also think that,

01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:26.714
if you look at it from
the perspective of men,

01:40:26.714 --> 01:40:29.690
they may not be doing the foot binding

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:31.940
or the scarification as much,

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.623
although they do in some places,

01:40:35.298 --> 01:40:40.298
but a lot of what are imposed
on men often are behaviors.

01:40:40.650 --> 01:40:45.650
So you look at whether
it's ritualistic combat

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:52.310
in Papua New Guinea or actual combat,

01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:57.070
or you can look at something like Masai

01:40:57.070 --> 01:41:01.260
where it used to be the
way that you became a man

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:05.260
as a Masai was you slayed a lion.

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:10.260
And so there's a lot of
behaviors that we undergo

01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:18.060
because it is displaying our,

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.240
it's a way of manifesting
our attractiveness

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:26.220
and our reproductive virility because

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:29.310
if you can deal with that,
if you can deal with being

01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:33.930
cut thousands of times,
that must mean that

01:41:33.930 --> 01:41:37.870
this is a very strong individual
that's gonna have offspring

01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:39.920
that are more likely to survive.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.770
And even if someone's not thinking that,

01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:47.150
it's probably somewhere
programmed deep in our DNA

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.010
that triggers some sort of

01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:53.543
pleasure center towards attractiveness.

01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:58.410
But then going back to
the question about ugly,

01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:01.123
I'll just give a one
word answer: intolerance.

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:03.360
Simple as that.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.193
That's ugly.

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:07.573
- Terrific.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.030
Sorry?

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:12.088
(distant indistinct muttering)
Final statement.

01:42:12.088 --> 01:42:14.270
I'm sorry, we've just come to a close.

01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:16.183
Our time has run out so we'd like to end

01:42:16.183 --> 01:42:18.020
each of the sessions to see if any of you

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:19.370
have a final statement you'd like to make,

01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:21.210
if there's something
that might have come up

01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:22.560
in the course of the conversation

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.369
or in the questions from the audience.

01:42:24.369 --> 01:42:25.842
- It's like the 30-second
rant at the end--

01:42:25.842 --> 01:42:27.340
(audience chuckling)

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:29.190
- We wanna give you that opportunity.

01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:33.690
- I just think it's been
great to have all of us

01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:36.740
from different disciplines
meeting in the middle

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:41.740
and hearing you talk about
how sort of physical power

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.680
is about survival and
reproduction and continuity

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:51.920
in ways that I don't think about.

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:56.263
But of course it's very
parallel to even the kind of,

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.810
we haven't talked a lot
about conceptual systems

01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:02.560
and the mystical and all these other ways

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.130
in which people understand
themselves in the world

01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:08.640
that also have to do with beauty,

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.163
but that's left for another day.

01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:14.317
- I was gonna talk about all of that,

01:43:14.317 --> 01:43:16.987
but I ran out of time
so I'm terribly sorry.

01:43:16.987 --> 01:43:18.700
(audience laughing)
I just wanna say this.

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.280
I do wanna thank you all
sincerely for coming tonight,

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.970
and my new colleagues, it's a pleasure

01:43:23.970 --> 01:43:26.020
to spend time and space with you.

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.673
I also wanna say this.

01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:33.310
It's complicated, life is complicated.

01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:35.920
The notion of what is
beauty is complicated.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.920
The notion of what is taken
on or imposed is complicated.

01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:44.700
I think it's wonderful, and
this is one of the great things

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.970
that we do at UCLA is we
begin the conversation.

01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:49.502
We don't end it, there is no answer.

01:43:49.502 --> 01:43:52.030
It's a conversation that's ongoing.

01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:54.940
I do wanna say this as well,

01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:57.630
is that in my work I
deal a lot with theme.

01:43:57.630 --> 01:43:59.443
What's the theme, what is it about?

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.570
And I always believe that every theme

01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:04.460
also contains its opposite.

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.563
So if you talk about Romeo and Juliet,

01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:10.520
what's the meaning of love?

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.010
It also contains the
opposite as what is hate?

01:44:15.010 --> 01:44:17.870
So I think the notion of what is beauty

01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:22.870
also contains its opposite of
what might not be beautiful.

01:44:25.150 --> 01:44:28.760
And I think in the last five minutes,

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:31.160
we opened up just the beginning, right?

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.910
My head is spinning talking about things

01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:36.790
that are complicated and really difficult

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:39.310
to speak about, particularly
in an open forum,

01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:43.360
but I'm so happy that we're able to talk

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.690
in terms of tolerance because intolerance

01:44:45.690 --> 01:44:48.440
also includes its difference of tolerance,

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.090
to be able to have these kind of,

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.120
I don't wanna enlightened and
I don't wanna say educated

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.590
but just have this kind of
meaningful conversations.

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:59.340
And so thank you for allowing
me to have that conversation.

01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:00.780
- [Brett] Thank you. Kathleen?

01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:03.470
- I'd like to wrap up just
by thanking the audience

01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:07.240
for the really great
questions and comments

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.060
thinking about the sublime,
thinking about memory

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:15.060
and thinking about how we
inhabit standards of beauty

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:19.710
with our own bodies and
live with that or not

01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:23.390
and the sort of challenges that causes.

01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:26.286
So I wanna thank the audience, yeah.

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:28.536
(applause)

01:45:30.053 --> 01:45:31.720
- [Brett] Thank you.

01:45:34.410 --> 01:45:38.040
- So I guess what I'd
like to leave you with is

01:45:39.010 --> 01:45:44.010
to really think about, we
were forced to think about

01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:49.743
what beauty is, and I
think that too often,

01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:55.930
in our very busy world, we don't
stop to think about things.

01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:01.060
And I think that within our society,

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.290
there is so much that is
wrapped up in the notion

01:46:04.290 --> 01:46:09.290
of what is beauty that it
seems like it merits some time

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:13.490
to really think about
that and try to unpack it

01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:17.770
and think about what is beauty to you

01:46:17.770 --> 01:46:20.520
and why do you think the things

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:21.600
that you think are beautiful?

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.230
Why do you think that?

01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:28.230
And some of it could be
something intrinsic to yourself.

01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:34.230
Sometimes it could be things
that are coming from society.

01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:39.230
And some of those, some
of that can be innocuous,

01:46:41.210 --> 01:46:43.630
and some of it can be damaging.

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:48.630
And so I think if we all
just spend some time,

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.110
think about it, ask yourself.

01:46:51.110 --> 01:46:55.353
And I think if more people did that,

01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:01.340
we wouldn't maybe have so much baggage

01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:02.703
that's associated with it.

01:47:04.153 --> 01:47:05.260
- Perfect, thank you.

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:06.360
And for all of you who came in today,

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.223
thank you so much for joining us.

01:47:09.264 --> 01:47:10.097
(applause)

01:47:10.097 --> 01:47:14.090
In addition to the suggestion
being made to think hard

01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:17.070
and to think on from the
conversation that started here,

01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:20.540
do the other thing I suggested
earlier in the introduction.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.260
Record that thought for us.

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.093
Go online.

01:47:23.093 --> 01:47:25.640
If you live in a world of hashtags,

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.120
which I understand many of us do,

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:31.230
record that thinking
immediately in real time.

01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:32.063
Respond to it.

01:47:32.063 --> 01:47:34.630
Students, as you upload
your comments and feedback,

01:47:34.630 --> 01:47:36.990
you gain access then to everybody else's

01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:38.690
thinking on this topic.

01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:40.020
Thank you everybody for coming in,

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.380
we'll see you next Tuesday.

01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.630
Please join me in thanking our guests

01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:45.230
for taking their time in coming in today.

01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:47.937
Thank you all.
(applause)
