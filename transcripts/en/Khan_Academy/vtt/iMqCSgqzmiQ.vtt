Hey everybody, it's LeBron here.

00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:07.696
I've got a quick brain teaser for you.

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:11.076
What are the odds of making 10 free throws in a row?

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:13.971
Here's my good friend Sal with the answer.

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:18.005
That's a great question, LeBron, and I think the answer might surprise you.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.065
So, I looked up your career free throw percentage

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.100
and you are right at around 75%,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.760
which is a little bit higher than my free throw percentage.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
And one way to interpret that: if we have a million LeBron Jameses,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.760
and you can imagine any large number

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:34.983
of LeBron Jameses taking a free throw.

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:36.859
Let's say, this line represents all of the

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.990
LeBron Jameses that take that first free throw.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.955
Let's call that free throw number 1.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:48.633
We would expect, on average, that 75% of them would make that first free throw.

00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:53.061
So, let me draw 75%. So this is about halfway, this would be 25.

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:55.753
This would get us to 75. So we would expect

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.600
75% of them would make that first free throw.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.740
And then the other 25%, we would expect on average,

00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:07.742
would miss that first free throw.

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:10.700
Now, what we care about are the ones that keep making the free throws.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.479
We want ten in a row!

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.450
So, let's just focus on the 75% that made the first one.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.681
Some of these 25% might make some free throws going forward.

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:19.996
But we don't care about them anymore.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:21.750
They are kind of out of the game!

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.180
So, let's go to free throw number two.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.119
What percentage of the Lebron Jameses

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.988
that made that first free throw,

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:34.027
what percentage would we expect to make the second one?

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.025
And we're going to assume, whether or not you made the first one,

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.652
has no bearing on the probability of you making the second,

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:41.706
that this continues to be the probability

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.552
of a Lebron James making a given free throw.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:49.464
So we would expect 75% of these Lebron Jameses to also make the second one.

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:53.118
We are going to take 75% of 75%.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.400
So this is about half of that 75%; this would be a quarter,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.880
this would be three fourths, which is exactly 75%, right over here.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.639
So this represents: of the ones that made the first one,

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.462
how many also made the second one?

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.774
So you could say that the percentage of the Lebron Jameses

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.366
that we would expect on average

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.498
to make the first two free throws.

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:21.263
This length right over here is 75% of 75%.

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:24.567
75% of this 75% right over there.

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:27.560
And I think you might began to see a pattern emerging.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.606
Let's go to the 3rd free throw: free throw number 3.

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.599
So what percentage of these folks are going to

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.606
make the third one?

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:41.820
Well, 75% of them are going to make the 3rd one!

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.460
What is this going to be?

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.914
This is going to be

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:49.416
75% of this number,

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:56.964
of this length, which is 75% of 75%.

00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:59.914
And if you were to go all the way to free throw #10,

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.568
and I think you see the pattern here,

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:05.710
if we were to go all the way to free throw #10, so I am just skipping a bunch,

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.194
we are going to get some very, very, very small fraction

00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.335
that have made all ten.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.480
It's essentially going to be 75% x 75% x 75% 10 times.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.860
75% being multiplied repeatedly 10 times.

00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:23.541
So this is going to be what we're left off with,

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:27.024
this is going to be 75% x 75%

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:33.500
And let me copy and paste this, so it doesn't take forever...

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.140
I will put the multiplication signs on later.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.240
So that's four, that's six, that's eight,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.020
and then that is ten, right over there.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.660
Let me throw the multiplication signs in there.

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.298
So this little fraction that made all ten of them

00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:05.389
is going to be equaled to this value right over here.

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.940
75% of, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.940
75% being repeatedly multiplied 10 times.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.380
Now, this would obviously take me forever to do by hand.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.755
And even on a calculator,

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:20.101
if I were to punch all of this in,

00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:20.924
I might make a mistake.

00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:24.004
But lucky for us: there is a mathematical operator

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:26.605
that is essentially repeated multiplication.

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.551
And that's taking an exponent.

00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.914
So another way of writing that,

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:33.136
we could write that as:

00:04:33.136 --> 00:04:37.313
75% to the tenth power.

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:40.377
Repeatedly multiplying 75% ten times.

00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:42.292
These are the same expression.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.300
And 75%, the word "per-cent"

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.698
literally means "per hundred."

00:04:50.698 --> 00:04:52.832
You might recognize the root word, "cent,"

00:04:52.832 --> 00:04:54.163
from things like "century,"

00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:57.472
100 years in a century, 100 cents in a dollar.

00:04:57.472 --> 00:04:59.218
So this literally means "per hundred."

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:03.594
So we could write this as: 75 over 100 to the 10th power.

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:09.801
Which is the same thing as 0.75 to the tenth power.

00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:11.074
Now let's get our calculator out

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:13.127
and see what this evaluates to.

00:05:13.127 --> 00:05:18.091
So, 0.75 to the tenth power,

00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.536
gets us to: 0.056.

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:23.559
And I'll just round to the nearest hundreds,

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.228
so if we'd round to the nearest hundreds,

00:05:25.228 --> 00:05:29.555
that gets us to 0.06.

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:36.594
So this is roughly equal to (if we round to the nearest hundreds): 0.06

00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:39.134
which is equal to, roughly when we round,

00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:41.172
a 6% probability of

00:05:41.172 --> 00:05:43.651
making ten free throws in a row!

00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:45.855
Which even though you have quite a high free throw percentage,

00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:48.047
this is not that high of a probability.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:51.774
It's a little bit better than a one-in-twenty chance.

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:55.160
Now: what I want to throw out there for everyone else watching this,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.299
is to think about how we can make a general statement about anybody,

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:01.122
if that anybody has some free throw percentage,

00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:02.530
and they want to say: what's the probability of

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.230
making 10 in a row?

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.084
How can we say that?

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.324
Well, I think we saw the pattern right over here.

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:14.183
The probability of making, let's call it "n,"

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:16.483
where "n" is the number of free throws we care about,

00:06:16.483 --> 00:06:21.108
n free throws in a row.

00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:24.224
For somebody, and we are not just talking about LeBron here,

00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:28.265
it's going to be their free throw percentage,

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:30.812
and this case, Lebron's was 75%,

00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:34.078
to the number of free throws we want to get in a row.

00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:35.917
So to the, nth power.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:38.396
For example: you might want to play around

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:39.696
with your own free throw percentage.

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:41.396
If your free throw percentage is, let's say,

00:06:41.396 --> 00:06:44.208
60%, which is the same thing as 0.6.

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:46.488
So let's say you have a 60% free throw percentage,

00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:47.788
and you want to see your probability of

00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:48.980
getting five in a row,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.125
you would take that to the fifth power.

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.625
And you'd get, what looks like,

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:54.525
if you round it to the nearest hundreds,

00:06:54.525 --> 00:06:56.087
would be about 8%.

00:06:56.087 --> 00:06:57.879
So I encourage you to try this

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.687
with different free throw percentages,

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:01.387
and different numbers of free throws

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:04.340
that you are attempting to get in a row.
