<i> (Karen)
 Margaret, thank you
 for welcoming us</i>

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
on this fantastic research
vessel, the<i> Melville.</i>

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.180 align:start position:0% line:28%
<i>My pleasure.</i>

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.950 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
I want to ask you about
something I heard about.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.586 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
You recently were in Paris
last year

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.589 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
and took a team of
students and researchers

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
from the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:03.062 line:0%
How was the conference and what
were you trying to accomplish?

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.331 align:start position:0% line:0%
I wasn't in Paris
for shopping.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:10.102 align:start position:0% line:0%
I was there for the Conference
of the Parties, COP 21.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:13.973 align:start position:0%
This is the place where the
climate negotiations take place.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:19.345 align:start position:0%
<i>We have been the head
of the UC delegation</i>

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:23.716 size:81% position:41%
<i>for as long as we've been
parties to the conference,</i>

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:26.619
and we are involved with this

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.189 align:start position:0%
because of our long-term
research on climate.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.192 align:start position:0%
So Scripps Institution
of Oceanography

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.895 align:start position:0%
has been one
of the premier institutions

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.498 size:84% position:42%
in detecting climate change

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.668 align:start position:0%
and being able to attribute
climate change

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.369 align:start position:0%
to the various causes,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
<i>how much are we
responsible for,</i>

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.642 align:start position:0%
<i>how much is happening
as a result of natural change,</i>

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:54.848 align:start position:0%
<i>and also we've been very
involved in modeling climate</i>

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.483 align:start position:0%
<i>to be able tell
what will happen</i>

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
<i>as a result of increasing
greenhouse gases.</i>

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.022 align:start position:0%
<i>It's only natural
that we would go.</i>

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:07.893 align:start position:0%
We really had three focuses
of attention for this meeting.

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:13.566 align:start position:0%
The first was that although
the oceans are 70% of the globe,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.235 align:start position:0%
the oceans
were not even included

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.804 size:88% position:44%
<i>in the climate negotiations.</i>

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
<i>Yes. I hope everyone
can see your eyes.</i>

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.708 size:88% position:56% line:78%
Startling.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.708 align:start position:0%
<i>Yes.</i>

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
And that was really
because the primary focus

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start position:0%
had been on
what was happening on land

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.218 align:start position:0%
and what the impacts were
on land.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.588 align:start position:0%
But over the 21 years
that we've been negotiating,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:39.291 align:start position:0%
we've found profound impacts
on the ocean.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.193
The ocean is becoming warmer.

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.030 size:88% position:44%
<i>We have five decades of data</i>

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.032 align:start position:0%
<i>that shows how much warmer
the ocean is.</i>

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:51.036 align:start position:0%
It's actually taking up
90% of the heat.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.372 align:start position:0%
The second is
that many people

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:55.774 align:start position:0%
have heard of
ocean acidification,

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:59.645 align:start position:0%
the ocean becoming
slightly more acidic.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.481 align:start position:0%
That's also a result
of the CO2.

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:05.084 align:start position:0%
CO2 is dissolving
in the oceans.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
And then
the third thing is that,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.656 size:84% position:42%
as a result of both warming

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:14.694 align:start position:0%
and the ocean acidification
and other changes,

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:19.331 align:start position:0%
the oxygen content
in the mid-waters of the ocean

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.666 align:start position:0%
is decreasing.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:24.036 align:start position:0%
So as we say,
the ocean is becoming hot,

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.705 size:81% position:41%
more sour, and breathless.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.340 align:start position:0% line:0%
We wanted
to call attention to this,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.344 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>the fact that oceans
have to be included.</i>

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:33.979 align:start position:0% line:0%
<i>I'm pleased to say
that they are.</i>

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.417 align:start position:0%
<i>We were successful with others
who were focused on this.</i>

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:42.688
<i>We also were focused on other
parts of the climate system.</i>

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:46.292 align:start position:0%
<i>For example, although
we talk a lot about CO2,</i>

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:50.062
there are lots of other gases
that contribute to warming.

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.930 size:78% position:39%
Some of them are methane,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.503
even all the particulate soot
that comes from burning forests

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.506 align:start position:0%
and coal and so forth
contributes to that.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.209 align:start position:0%
So we also wanted
to remind everybody

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.814 align:start position:0%
to be conscious of those factors
as well as CO2.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.483 align:start size:66% position:34% line:0%
Is Scripps
and the United States

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.118 align:start size:59% position:41% line:0%
really pushing then
this awareness

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:15.387 align:start size:53% position:47% line:0%
and the need
to educate people

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:18.024 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
about the environmental
health of our oceans?

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.693 align:start position:0% line:0%
Absolutely,
and this is a big focus

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.729 align:start position:0% line:0%
of the U.S. role
in the negotiations

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.366 align:start position:0% line:0%
and, of course,
of Scripps Oceanography's role.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.735 align:start size:88% position:13%
It must have been an amazing
experience for students

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:33.172 align:start size:78% position:22%
that went to
this conference in Paris.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.809 align:start position:0%
Yes, and all
of the graduate students

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:41.113 align:start position:0%
<i>had a chance to speak
in one of the side sessions.</i>

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:43.616 align:start position:0%
<i>We also had
an informational booth</i>

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.252 align:start position:0%
<i>to tell people about
what was happening</i>

00:04:46.252 --> 00:04:48.287 align:start position:0%
<i>and to provide
more information.</i>

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:51.156 align:start position:0%
<i>The students
helped us man the booth.</i>

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:53.459 align:start size:72% position:28%
So I want to know about

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.095 align:start size:72% position:28%
how people find
their passions in life.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.098 align:start size:84% position:16%
Clearly, you have a passion
for ocean science

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.533 align:start size:78% position:22%
and environmental health.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.970 align:start size:81% position:19%
I know you went to
the University of Illinois

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.438 align:start size:81% position:19%
and did undergraduate work
in geology.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start position:0% line:78%
That's right.

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start size:34% position:66%
So tell me,

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:13.212
from geology, when did you get
interested about the oceans?

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.347
It really was through geology.

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:17.649
I never lived near the ocean,

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:23.089
and I'd only seen the ocean once
when I graduated from college.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.294 align:start position:0%
But many of the rocks that
I studied formed in the oceans,

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:31.697 align:start position:0%
and as long as they were
talking about rocks

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:35.635 align:start position:0%
that formed on beaches
or rivers or close to land,

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:39.405 size:88% position:44%
<i>that they had really great
models of what was happening</i>

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.408 align:start position:0%
and when they said things
that made sense.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:46.245 align:start position:0%
When they started talking about
rocks from the deep ocean,

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.881 align:start position:0%
there was
a lot of hand waving,

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:53.018 align:start position:0%
and it seemed that what I should
do is study oceanography,

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:56.389 align:start position:0%
then I'd bring all that
knowledge back to geology.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.027 align:start position:0%
But although
I'm a geological oceanographer

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.729 align:start position:0%
and study geologic processes
in the ocean,

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.365 align:start position:0%
I never went back
to land geology.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.267 align:start size:75% position:25%
I heard the name paleo--

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.236 align:start size:78% position:22%
paleontology
and oceanography blended.

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:13.106 align:start position:0%
<i>Paleoceanography,</i>

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.175 align:start position:0%
the study of the oceans
in the past

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:20.379 align:start position:0%
and how they evolved,
what was happening in them.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.082 align:start position:0%
And that also led me
to paleoclimate,

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.351 align:start position:0%
what was happening
in the climate

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.619 align:start position:0%
and how that
affected the ocean.

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:30.656 align:start position:0%
That's how I got interested
in climate change.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:34.092 align:start size:78% position:22%
And your PHD was done
in Rhode Island, correct?

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:39.198 size:88% position:56%
Did you spend time on a ship
like this for your research?

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.066 align:start position:0% line:78%
Absolutely.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.066 align:start size:59% position:41%
What was that like?

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:44.437 align:start size:63% position:38%
I have to ask.
How many other women

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start size:81% position:19%
were in the field with you
studying oceanography

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.443 align:start size:59% position:41%
or marine science
in graduate school,

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:54.213 align:start size:78% position:22%
and how many other women
were on a research vessel

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.415 align:start size:59% position:41%
taking measurements
of the ocean?

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.917 align:start position:0%
I was very fortunate.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:02.422 size:84% position:42%
I started my graduate work
at Oregon State University,

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:06.893 align:start position:0%
and my first cruise was
two months after I arrived.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.661 align:start position:0%
There were three women
on the cruise.

00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:11.730
We were all graduate students.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:17.069 align:start position:0%
There weren't any female faculty
in geological oceanography.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:23.141 align:start position:0%
So I really had companions,
female companions on the ships.

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:27.346 align:start position:0%
And my second cruise
was the next summer,

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.982 align:start position:0%
and that was
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
There were other
female graduate students,

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:35.320 size:88% position:44%
most notably Kathy Sullivan,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.457 align:start position:0%
<i>who is now
the administrator of NOAA.</i>

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.926 align:start position:0%
<i>That was her first
oceanographic cruise,</i>

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
<i>my second.</i>

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.897 align:start position:0%
<i>And we still are
very close friends.</i>

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:49.968
It often happens, the people
you are graduate students with

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:52.737 align:start position:0%
become your friends
and colleagues for life.

00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:55.007 line:0%
Do you know the current data?

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.509 align:start size:78% position:22% line:0%
My background is physics,

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.646 align:start size:75% position:25% line:0%
and it's come a long way
since I went to school.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.981 align:start size:75% position:25%
Still physics, computer
science, and engineering

00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:04.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
are highly underrepresented
with females--

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:07.453 align:start size:81% position:19%
eighteen, nineteen percent
females getting

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:10.089 align:start size:81% position:19%
bachelor's of science
degrees in those subjects.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.357 align:start size:78% position:22%
What about marine science
and oceanography?

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:15.294 align:start position:0% line:0%
It depends on
the field of oceanography.

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:20.098 align:start position:0% line:0%
So in biological oceanography
and marine biology,

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:24.236 align:start position:0%
<i>half of our entering class
of graduate students</i>

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:26.605
<i>have been women for some time.</i>

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.707 size:78% position:39%
<i>In physical oceanography,</i>

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:32.511
the circulation of the oceans
and currents and so forth,

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
the percentage is less,

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:38.917 align:start position:0%
as it is in geological
oceanography or geophysics.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:43.655 align:start position:0%
So there are many more women
entering the field now

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.158 align:start position:0%
and entering study
of oceanography

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.426 align:start position:0%
than there ever
have been before.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:52.431 align:start position:0% line:76%
But still, there's some
differences amongst the fields.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:52.431 align:start size:22% position:78%
<i> Right.</i>

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.735
You've also spent your career as
a researcher and administrator.

00:08:56.735 --> 00:09:01.673 align:start size:91% position:9%
Have you noticed a difference
in your female colleagues

00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:04.777 align:start size:75% position:25%
as you've changed from
the research environment

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:06.579 align:start size:66% position:34%
to the administrative
environment?

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:11.884 align:start position:0% line:76%
I think that I was really
in the first wave.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:11.884 align:start size:31% position:69%
Right.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.887 align:start position:0%
And so now, as I said,
Kathy Sullivan,

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.290 align:start position:0%
who was a graduate student
at the same time,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.159
is the administrator of NOAA.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.929 align:start position:0%
Another person that was
a graduate at the same time,

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:27.633 align:start position:0%
<i>Marcia McNutt, is the editor
of</i> Science magazine.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
<i>Some other people that I went
to graduate school with</i>

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:37.376 align:start position:0%
are senior administrators
in the U.S. Geological Survey.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:43.816 align:start position:0%
One of them is a dean at
University of Texas, Austin.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:46.886 align:start position:0%
<i>So now there are
quite a few women</i>

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.588 align:start position:0%
<i>who have not only
been doing research</i>

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:52.958
and have been very successful,
but are also administrators.

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.827 align:start size:69% position:31%
So you were with women

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.829 align:start size:69% position:31%
that were trailblazers
for the women to come,

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.632 align:start size:75% position:25%
<i> which is very exciting.</i>

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.702 align:start size:91% position:9%
<i> As director of Scripps
 Institution of Oceanography,</i>

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:06.471 size:84% position:58%
you'll be welcoming a new
vessel into the fleet soon.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.874 align:start size:53% position:47%
Can you talk
about that vessel

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.977 align:start size:72% position:28%
and how different it is
than the<i> Melville</i>

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:15.013 align:start size:69% position:31%
and what the plans are
for that vessel?

00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:18.717 align:start position:0%
Our new vessel
is the R/V<i> Sally Ride,</i>

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:23.789 align:start position:0%
<i>and it is a 248-foot vessel,
50 feet wide.</i>

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:28.694 align:start position:0%
<i>It will have space for
24 scientists to be on board</i>

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:30.629 align:start position:0%
<i>and 20 crew.</i>

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:36.435 align:start position:0%
<i>And this ship was paid for
by the Office of Naval Research</i>

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:39.004 align:start position:0%
<i>and the Navy,
Department of Defense.</i>

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:44.109 align:start position:0%
<i>The new ship is built
by a shipyard in Washington,</i>

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:48.780 size:78% position:39%
<i>but under the supervision
of both Scripps and Navy.</i>

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.151 align:start position:0%
<i>So it's a partnership
between Scripps and the Navy.</i>

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:56.856 align:start position:0%
And it is part of a new class
of oceanographic ships

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:59.591 align:start position:0%
that are all named
after astronauts.

00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:04.163 size:88% position:44%
<i>And we're so delighted that
this one is named</i> Sally Ride

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.166 align:start position:0%
<i>because, of course,
Sally is from this community</i>

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.468 align:start position:0%
<i>in San Diego.</i>

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.037 size:78% position:39%
<i>She was a PhD in physics,</i>

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:15.340 align:start position:0%
<i>and when she finished
her very distinguished career</i>

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.776 align:start position:0%
<i>as an astronaut,</i>

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:20.145 size:84% position:42%
<i>she came back to University
of California, San Diego,</i>

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
<i>as a physics professor.</i>

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.452 align:start position:0%
<i>So this is really an honor
for us to have the</i> Sally Ride,

00:11:27.452 --> 00:11:30.789 align:start position:0%
<i>and it's so appropriate
for this community</i>

00:11:30.789 --> 00:11:33.092 size:81% position:41%
<i>to share that distinction.</i>

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:36.862 size:88% position:56% line:0%
<i> Sally was the first female
 astronaut from our country.</i>

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.900 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
Her maiden voyage in space
was in 1983.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.903 align:start size:72% position:28% line:0%
I was a grad student
at that time

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
in a field that was very
underrepresented with women.

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:49.909 align:start size:59% position:41%
I never aspired
to be an astronaut,

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:53.945 align:start size:94% position:6%
but when that happened,
I realized that she's opened--

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:58.083 align:start size:97% position:3%
paved the way for women to
believe they could do anything.

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:01.687 align:start size:81% position:19%
Where were you when she
first launched into space?

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:06.325 line:0%
I had a similar experience.
I was a junior faculty member

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:08.560 line:0%
at University of Rhode Island,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.997 align:start position:0% line:0%
and it happened that
all of my graduate students

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.900
and my technicians were women,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.036 align:start position:0%
and we used to celebrate
everything.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:21.473 align:start position:0%
We celebrated when we got
a scientific paper published.

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:23.742 align:start position:0%
We celebrated
when we got funding.

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:25.310 size:75% position:38%
We celebrated birthdays.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.181
The way that we celebrated
was we would drink champagne,

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:33.819 size:88% position:44%
and we would take the little
metal container for the cork

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:37.589 align:start position:0%
and put the cork in it
with a little label.

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.758
We had acoustic tile ceilings,

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:42.828 align:start position:0%
and we would
put the cork up there,

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.363 size:88% position:44%
commemorating what happened.

00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:49.768 align:start position:0%
And the day that
that launch took place,

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:53.172 align:start position:0%
one of my technicians brought in
a portable television,

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.874 size:88% position:44%
and we all watched it on TV.

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:57.542 align:start position:0%
We drank champagne,

00:12:57.542 --> 00:13:02.614 align:start position:0%
and we put a little tag on
that champagne cork that said,

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:05.417 align:start position:0% line:76%
"Sally Ride
was representing us all."

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:05.417 align:start size:16% position:84%
<i> Wow.</i>

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:09.922 align:start position:0%
They were in that lab
for a long time after I left.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:14.059 align:start position:0% line:76%
I like to say she broke
the ultimate glass ceiling.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:14.059 align:start size:31% position:69%
Exactly.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.595 align:start size:81% position:19%
Naming the research vessel
after her,

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:19.431 align:start size:63% position:38%
it's one of the most
fitting honors.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:23.635
After her death, she was awarded
the Presidential Freedom Medal,

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:26.739 align:start size:72% position:28%
but I think,
if she was alive today,

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:30.141 size:84% position:58%
knowing that there was an
exploration ship going out,

00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:33.211 align:start size:69% position:31%
and she was a believer
of making sure

00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:35.514 align:start size:56% position:44% line:76%
<i> all students were
 STEM literate--</i>

00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:35.514 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:38.183 align:start size:56% position:44%
<i> I'm sure you have
 the same beliefs.</i>

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:41.520 align:start size:69% position:31%
People should be aware
of what's going on

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.056 align:start size:59% position:41%
in our oceans,
in our environment,

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:48.294
so it's our duty as educators
to provide that knowledge.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:51.863 align:start position:0%
Right, and we're very dedicated
to students participating,

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:56.334 align:start position:0%
so I can't think of a cruise
that doesn't have

00:13:56.334 --> 00:14:00.205 align:start position:0%
graduate students
as part of the scientific crew.

00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:03.309 align:start position:0%
They're really responsible,
very responsible,

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:07.580 size:81% position:41%
for tremendously expensive
and complicated equipment

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.248 align:start position:0%
that they bring on board
and deploy.

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:14.620 align:start position:0%
We even have whole cruises
that are just student cruises,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.490 align:start position:0%
and we have funding
from the state of California

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.062
that's available to all of the
UCs for students to participate

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:28.066 align:start position:0%
and to propose to do
research on the ships.

00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:33.205 size:78% position:39%
We've even had them meet
the ship in foreign ports

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:36.241 align:start position:0%
and do research
in the Indian Ocean.

00:14:36.241 --> 00:14:39.811 align:start position:0%
A group proposed
to use the ship

00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:43.815 align:start position:0%
in the western Pacific Ocean
this next year,

00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:48.953 size:88% position:44%
so it's very much a research
experience for our students

00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
and for all of the students
that participate.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.595 align:start size:97% position:3%
You've been director at Scripps
for two or three years?

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:58.530 align:start position:0%
Two and a half years.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.434 align:start size:72% position:28%
Do you have have plans,
say, a five-year plan?

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:05.470 align:start position:0%
Well, it's not my plan.
It's Scripps' plan.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.975
About a year and a half ago,
all the faculty and researchers

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:14.145 align:start position:0%
went off on a retreat
for a day and a half

00:15:14.145 --> 00:15:18.650 align:start position:0%
to talk about, not so much
every little thing that we do,

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.385 align:start position:0%
but the big ideas,

00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:24.722 align:start position:0%
the ones that require
a whole group of people

00:15:24.722 --> 00:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
and that would really
require the institution

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:29.427 align:start position:0%
to get behind the idea

00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:32.698 align:start position:0%
as well as just
the individual researchers.

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:37.302 align:start position:0%
We have a whole group
of those ideas.

00:15:37.302 --> 00:15:41.407
Some of the highlights are
certainly related to climate,

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:46.811 align:start position:0%
the impact of climate
on the oceans, on us, on land,

00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:49.080 size:78% position:39%
how we can adapt to that.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.784 size:81% position:41%
We're also very interested
in hazards like tsunamis

00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:56.488 align:start position:0%
and earthquakes and drought
and flood

00:15:56.488 --> 00:16:01.593 align:start position:0%
and how our research
can help people

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:04.763 align:start position:0%
be more resilient
in the face of hazards.

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:09.701 align:start position:0%
<i>We're world experts in the
development of new technology,</i>

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:15.006
whether it's measurement devices
or whole platforms of equipment

00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:18.143
or even systems of observation.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:23.315
And so that will certainly be
a continuing area of effort.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.617 align:start position:0%
And then we're also
very interested

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.919 align:start position:0%
in human health
and the oceans.

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:31.056 align:start position:0%
How does the ocean affect
our health?

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:35.427 align:start position:0%
Whether it's pollution,
whether it's seafood safety,

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:41.499 size:81% position:41%
whether it's the sea spray
that affects our health.

00:16:41.499 --> 00:16:45.303 align:start position:0%
Are there drugs from the ocean
that we can develop

00:16:45.303 --> 00:16:49.875 align:start position:0%
that will help us with
any kind of health problem?

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:54.345
Those are a few of the exciting
areas the faculty identified

00:16:54.345 --> 00:16:56.548 size:78% position:39%
that we'll be working on.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:17:01.119 align:start position:0% line:76%
Most of them require
the use of the ship.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:17:01.119 align:start size:50% position:50%
<i> Right, right.</i>

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:04.789 size:81% position:59% line:0%
We talked about Paris and
your team educating people

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:09.260 align:start position:0% line:0%
not only about the atmosphere
with increased carbon emissions,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.796 align:start size:63% position:38%
but also the oceans.

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:15.266 size:88% position:56%
You said that there has been
change in the mindset now,

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:18.269 align:start size:81% position:19%
and people understand that
ocean health is important.

00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:21.707 align:start size:81% position:19%
Do you think young people,
during your career,

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.476 align:start size:81% position:19%
that this current
generation of young people

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:26.945 align:start size:56% position:44%
are more aware
of the environment

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.948 size:84% position:58%
and are more concerned with
protecting the environment

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:33.318 align:start size:91% position:9%
and taking care of our planet
for the future?

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.821 align:start position:0% line:0%
Definitely.
When I was growing up,

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.490 align:start position:0% line:0%
people were interested
in the ocean,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.761 align:start position:0% line:0%
and people my age, as a young
student, were interested,

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.330 align:start position:0%
but it was really
more curiosity.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.999 align:start position:0%
What's out there?
How does it work?

00:17:47.999 --> 00:17:51.903 align:start position:0%
How can we get
to understand it?

00:17:51.903 --> 00:17:54.306 align:start position:0%
Now that we do
understand more,

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:58.810 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of the ways
that humans impact the ocean,

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.713 size:88% position:44%
in spite of it being so big.

<i>I think one of the sort of
strange things is</i>

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:09.488 align:start position:0%
when you look at the ocean
from land or ship,

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:12.724 align:start position:0%
it looks the same
as it always has.

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:15.060 align:start size:66% position:34% line:78%
Beautiful blue water.

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
<i>Beautiful blue water.</i>

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.197 align:start position:0%
And one of the things
about the ocean is, of course,

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:22.567 align:start position:0%
most of the life of the ocean
is underneath,

00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:24.837 size:88% position:44%
so we don't see it changing.

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:28.773 size:81% position:41%
The chemistry of the ocean
is not something you see.

00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:31.776 align:start position:0%
The currents are not
something that you see.

00:18:31.776 --> 00:18:34.913 align:start position:0%
The temperature
is not something that you see.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:38.917 align:start position:0%
But now I think
that we've done a better job

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:43.921 align:start position:0%
of conveying to people
what's actually happening.

00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:49.961 align:start position:0%
There's a lot of interest in how
is this going to influence us

00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:55.133 size:78% position:39%
and what do we need to do
to adapt to the changes,

00:18:55.133 --> 00:19:01.373
what do we need to do to protect
the ocean from greater change,

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:05.209 size:84% position:42%
and are there other changes
that we don't know about

00:19:05.209 --> 00:19:06.811 align:start position:0%
that are happening.

00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:12.083
Is there anything that you feel
like you haven't accomplished?

00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:14.920 align:start size:69% position:31%
You've done so much
through your research,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.688 align:start size:88% position:13%
through your time at
National Science Foundation,

00:19:17.688 --> 00:19:19.958 align:start size:50% position:50%
now ending up
here at Scripps,

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.795
you been in research vessels,
you've been around the world.

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:28.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
Is there anything you feel
you need to do in your career?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.104 align:start position:0%
You always feel
like you need to do this.

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:34.205 size:84% position:42%
One of the exciting things,

00:19:34.205 --> 00:19:37.041 align:start position:0%
especially for this community
in San Diego,

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:41.713 align:start position:0%
is what a rich community it is
for the maritime economy.

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:45.150 align:start position:0%
That is something that we're
looking at at Scripps,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
and how can we partner
more effectively

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.258 align:start position:0%
with all of the companies
that are developing technologies

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:56.261 align:start position:0%
and capability with,
for the ocean.

00:19:56.261 --> 00:20:00.698 align:start position:0%
A lot of people are interested
in biotech and the ocean.

00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:03.668
How can we partner with them?

00:20:03.668 --> 00:20:06.704 align:start position:0%
<i>So there are always
new frontiers</i>

00:20:06.704 --> 00:20:09.908 align:start position:0%
<i>and new capabilities
and new excitement.</i>

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:15.180
There is not a single day that
I go into the office and say,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.785 align:start position:0%
"Oh, ho-hum.
It's another day at the office."

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:22.787 size:88% position:44%
It's a really exciting time.

00:20:22.787 --> 00:20:23.956 align:start size:63% position:38%
Thank you, Margaret,

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.823 align:start size:53% position:47%
for your time,
your inspiration,

00:20:25.823 --> 00:20:29.961 align:start size:75% position:25% line:76%
and for being a lifetime
leader in ocean science.

00:20:25.823 --> 00:20:29.961 align:start position:0%
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:32.597 align:start position:0%
We look forward
to welcoming the community

00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:36.101 align:start position:0% line:76%
to visit the<i> Sally Ride</i>
this summer.

00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:36.101 align:start size:31% position:69%
