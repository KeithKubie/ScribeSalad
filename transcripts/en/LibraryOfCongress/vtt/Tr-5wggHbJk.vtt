00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:19.070
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.670
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: All right, everyone.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.380
Welcome to the Library of
Congress in our Mumford room.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.800
My name is Rob Casper I'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.820
and literature center here
and I'm thrilled and delighted

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.740
to welcome you to the first ever
US Canada capitol poetry exchange

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.410
featuring poets Suzanne Buffam,
Liz Howard, and David O'Meara.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.690
Before we begin, let me ask you
to turn off your cell phones

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.050
and any other electronic
devices that you have.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.170
I'm going to make sure
that minor turnoff.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.370 position:56%
That might interfere with the event.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.870
Second, please note that this
program is being recorded

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.940
and by participating
you gave us permission

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.940
for future use of the recording.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.030
Let me also tell you a little bit

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.610
about the poetry and
literature center.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.000
We are home to the poet
laureate consultant in poetry,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.720
and we put on 30 to 40 public
programs like this one every year.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080
In fact, next Monday we honor
the Library of Congress prize

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.700
in American fiction
winner, Marilyn Robinson

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.530
with a high-powered panel
discussion on fiction,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.720
faith, and the imagination.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.010
On Tuesday we feature poet
Dana Levin in conversation

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.010
with Washington Post book world
editor and video star, Ron Charles.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.200
To find out more about these and
other programs here at the Library

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.370
of Congress in and around DC you

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.780
out there on the foyer and you
can also visit our website,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.620
www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.430
And now on to this
afternoon's event.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.670 position:56%
You can read about each of our
Canadian poets in your print program

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.530
which should be on
your seats next to you.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.660
They will each read for 10
minutes in alphabetical order

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.020
and then they will engage

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.370
in a moderated discussion
with Monty Reid.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.610
We will leave time at the end of
the program for your questions

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.970
and afterwards we hope you buy
copies of books by our readers

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.270
which are for sale in the back

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.870
and I'm sure they would be
happy to sign them as well.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.870
I would like to give a special
thanks to the Canadian embassy

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310
and now Cronin counselor of the
embassy for supporting this event.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.490
Our neighbor to the north is
currently celebrating its 150th--

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.230
the 150th anniversary
of its confederation.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.780 position:56%
We have great little pins outside in
the foyer which you should pick up

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.930
and help us in celebrating
this great anniversary.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.780
And finally, back to our moderator,
the inimitable Monty Reid.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.520
Monty is the driving force
behind not only this event,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.940
but the whole concept of an
exchange of Canadian and US totes.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.860
He is also a celebrated
poet himself of more

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.720
than a dozen poetry collections
including a collection of new

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.300
and collected poems, Crawlspace
published by House of Nancy in 1993

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.890
and metataccio placentae [phonetic]
published by Brick in 2016.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.880
A three-time nominee for the
governor general's award for poetry

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.280 position:56%
and three-time winner of the Stephan
G. Stephansson Award for poetry,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.070
Monty is the festival
director at verse best,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.910
auto was international
poetry Festival.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.670
And now here's my little
punny [phonetic] moment.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.180
I'm delighted to the core of
my constitution that Monty

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.850
and I can connect our
work to promote poetry

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.120
in our respective capitals and
in so doing gave a federal boost

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.170
to the currency of the arts.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.510
Please join me in welcoming
Monty Reid.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.370
[ Applause ]

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.820
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Well, thank
you very kindly for that.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.920
I am of course very
pleased to be here.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.100
And thank you all for coming
out and on a busy afternoon.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.540
I'm here representing verse best

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.520
which is auto was international
poetry Festival.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.580
It is as Rob said,
we've just finished.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.250
Just a few days ago
our seventh festival

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.670
and it's been a huge success.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:42.110
And we were trying to build on that
success by expanding our activities

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.230
and making sure that we can
attract international guests

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.920 position:56%
to the festival including Americans.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.000
We have always had Americans at the
festival but it's always a stretch

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.150
for us to be able to afford it
and the possibility of working

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.250
in conjunction with
the Library of Congress

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.400
over a protracted period is
really very beneficial to us

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.830
and I hope to the library as well.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.630
I don't have too much
to say other than that.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.970
Other than I'm delighted to be
here in the company of three--

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:28.180
I was going to say young, but
youngish Canadian poets all

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.950
of whom have a substantial
track record but probably aren't

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.160
that well-known here in Washington.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.320
And who have some very, very
interesting and provocative poetry

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.680
for you here this afternoon.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.880
So, they are in your
programs I'm just going

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.180
to turn it right over to them.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.340
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Hi.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.640
You can hear me, I think.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.960
Things are well organized here.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.380
I'm Suzanne Buffam.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.480
Thank you very much for having me.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.700
It's a great honor to be here
and I feel like I should--

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.570
there should be more flashes
from what I've seen but anyway,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.220
I'm going to just impose upon you.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.050
I promise my daughter I would
document the attendance.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.780
So there's actually
more than I expected.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.890
Thank you so much for coming
I'm going to jump right in

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.860
and set the timer so
I don't exceed--

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.800
All right.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.100
I'm going to read from
a book that just came

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.570 position:56%
out last spring called a pillow book

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:53.410
and it's a book length somewhat
narrative poem about pillows.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.940
Among other things.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.630
I should say it is a poem
but mostly it's in prose.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.840
So there are little pros
paragraphs with lists

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.790
that interspersed throughout
the unfolding.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:16.370
Among the oldest living pillows in
the world today is a smooth block

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.320
of unpainted wood with a wide
crack running through its middle

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.560
and a shallow indentation
on the top.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.290
It was found in the tomb
of an Egyptian mummy

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.540
in the fourth dynastic
town of Abilene

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.870
on the banks of the Nile River.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.520
If you came across it in a field,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.210
you might assume it had
just fallen from a cart.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.480
If you found it by the sea,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.510
you might suppose it
had been knocked loose

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.890
from a sailboat in a storm.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:53.960
You might kick it or pick it up and
toss it like a bottle off the dock.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.020
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote lists.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.250 position:56%
Abraham Lincoln took midnight walks.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.860
Tallulah Bankhead paid a series
of young caddies to hold her hand

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.070
in the dark as it did
Marcel produced.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.420
Thomas Edison invented the light
bulb so he could read after dark.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.620
I put a piece of paper
under my pillow at night

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.680
and when I could not
sleep I wrote in the dark.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.950
Wrote Henry David Thoreau
who once spent a fortnight

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.010
in a roofless cabin with his
head on a pillow of bricks.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.870
There are two kinds of insomniacs
those who fall asleep easily only

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.450
to wake up hours later to toss on
the pillows until Don and those

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.410
who toss on their pillows
from the start only

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.320
to drift off just long
enough to be roused at dawn

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.880
by the crows a little game I like
to play when I crawl into bed

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.130
at the end of a long day
of anything these days,

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.940
is to guess which kind
tonight I will be.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.120
And then there's a list of
books I'd like to read someday.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.300
Which I never imagined
reading in this library.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.950
"I and It" by Martin Buber.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.820 position:56%
"Queen Leer" by William Shakespeare.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.640
"Moby Dick" by Gertrude Stein.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.860
"Endgame" by Dr. Seuss.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.390
"Complete Poems" by Sappho.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:57.880
"The Interpretation of
Dreams" by Jorge Louis Borges.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.850
"Koffka

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:07.170
for Dummies" by Franz Koffka.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:15.370
"My Mistake" by Laura Bush,
which seems quaint now.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.850
"What Would Jesus Do"
by Jesus Christ.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:26.040
Sei Shonagon's pillow book which
has passed the last several nights

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.400
in the dim glow of my pet cell
tokina II [phonetic] headlamp set

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.020
on low provides an exhaustive
catalog of petty grievances

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.360
as pressing today as they
were a millennium ago.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.960
One has gone to bed and is about
to doze off the lady complains

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.290
in her protracted lift
of hateful things.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.940
When mosquito appears announcing
himself in a reedy voice.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.550
One can actually feel the
wind made by his wings

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:04.120
and slight though it is, one
finds it hateful in the extreme.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.530
I would add to this list as I often
feel it incumbent upon me to do,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.200
the endless intermittent tingling
through the half open window screen

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.860
of one's deaf neighbors wind chimes
the predawn post amorous blather

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.770
of young robins from the rooftops

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.980
and one's husband squinting
peevishly from his pillow at night

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.100 position:56%
when one turns on the bathroom light

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:35.720
to fish one's dripping
headlamp from the toilet bowl.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.670 position:56%
Kings and commoners alike have known
the value of a good pillow forever.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:46.640
From Quito to Cairo to Chicago
to Jan Yang examples can be found

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.800
in museums all over the world.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.500
During my sleepless
hours some nights I try

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.360
to imagine the whole collection.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:11.430
Melatonin, Lunesta, NyQuil,
Z-Quill [phonetic], Ativan, Ambien,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:21.000
Lorazepam, trazodone, warm
milk, hot baths, counting sheep,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.570
counting backwards from 1000
in French still I toss and turn

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.120
to the night with a pillow on
my head and another clutched

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:36.460
like a mule between my knees.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.270
Sei was her father's name.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.520
Shonagon her father's rank.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.000
For a brief span of time at
the turn of the 10th century,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.160 position:56%
we know that she spent her nights
behind a thin paper screen recording

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.800
her fugitive [inaudible] by
candlelight with an ink stick

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.430
on rice paper behind the
bolted high end gates.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.580
We know that she slept
when she managed to do

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.250
so on a small hollow pillow
made of polished bamboo.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:18.410
Things to buy, things to fix,
things to fold, things to freeze,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:25.680
things to paint, things to unpack,
things to order, things to renew,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.290 position:56%
things to revise, things to discard,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:34.200
things to dismantle,
things to destroy.

I'll begin with a poem
called Boreal Swing.

My mother hunted moose as a child

open chest fix her toes along the

ledge of two ribs and with a kick

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.200
to the bull's left shoulder,
he sent her swinging.

the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.870
because I'm going I'm going
up next, but I was listening.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.720
Suzanne, I'm going to steal
your prepared water here.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.020
I'll trade you.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.110
I'll give you my later.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:25.080
I'm going to start with a new poem.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.780
Which is a dangerous thing to
do because this is recorded.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.340
I'll edit it and then
I'll say what happened?

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.440
I think we've all may be
experienced the futility

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.360
of using a humane trap for a mouse.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.420
But this is called "I Carry a Mouse
to the Park Beside the Highway".

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.760
I couldn't smash a gray life.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.120
Believe it and violence under
the hammer slap of the wire.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.200
That poor change purse of
bones who jingled for crumbs

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.140
on our kitchen counter all summer
from a station behind the stove

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.040
where no one could reach or
follow through a dime sized hole.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.320
I portioned the aged cheddar
and un-snapping the lid

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:20.470 position:56%
of the trap rigged with a humane
weight triggered one-way ramp placed

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.350
the bait inside.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.050
Dressed in a jacket before
dawn, I forced myself

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.010
to be a cartoon still wet.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.210
In sneakers, I rented
30 minutes from time

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:37.470
and lifted the tin palanquin
quivering mouse inside its brief

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.070
flight a bump to spirit level
across the vacant intersection

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.680
through an underpass almost
too early for joggers.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.030
Since each hour is a
sickle of a fighting chance,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.550
I tested fates etiquette and
flattered the cat's mercy.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:00.470
I was thinking of the grasses
traffic as I tripped the trap

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.830
over between thin shoulder and
passing headlights near park gates

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:10.560
where the mouse is positive typed
into a green verge of tomato vines.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.410
While all that hour the sun's
creeping bleach became a chandelier

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.540
and I turned for home
morning other alarms.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.440
The bustle of wage and email.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.690
No less or more than
fear and boredom.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:33.760
The Iliad of our quiet lives.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:37.970
I feel obliged to read
my only Washington poem.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:42.890
Mainly because a few of
the things it refers to are

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.990
within the very close
proximity of here.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.060
The subject of this home is
William Safire who I'm sure many

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.650
of you are familiar with who
wrote a very popular column

00:28:53.650 --> 00:29:00.270
in the New York Times for a number
of years before it was failing.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:05.890 position:56%
And it was called-- it was etymology
serious called on language.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.720
But he was also a speechwriter
for Richard Nixon.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.990
And during the moon launch
the Apollo 11 moon launch,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:18.150
they realized the biggest
window for a disaster was not

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.610
when the rocket was being
launched from Earth but in fact

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.420
when the lunar module-- lunar
lander was going to be launched off

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.360
of the moon after the
mission was almost complete.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.370
Because they never had been
able to properly test it.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:38.870
They had created you know different
conditions to try to simulated

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.400
but not to ever actually do it.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.320
So, they asked Safire to write
a speech that Nixon would read

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.310
to the American people
if something failed.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.230
And he wrote a speech which is now
in the national archives called

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.370
"In Event of Moon Disaster".

00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:00.180
And Nixon would read it on
television and they would the

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.250
astronauts on the moon, obviously..

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.500
So I-- you know, being
one who suffers

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.420
from writers block I thought this
would be an interesting subject.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.710
So the poem is also called
"In Event of Moon Disaster".

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.560
After Borman, NASA's liaison calls

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.750
and urges some alternative posture
should things go south unforeseen

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:27.020
glitch, miscalculation,
technical, whatever.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.910
Leaving Armstrong and
Aldrin stranded on the moon.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.940
Does Safire walk or
run to the Oval Office?

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.640 position:56%
The president's aides Russell around
the furniture the minds touchy

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.250
and tentative like
bees in a Dispatch.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.920
You can imagine Dick's face when
advised, cut all communication,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.310
commend their souls to the
deepest of the deep like a burial

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.510
at sea and call their wives.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:59.100
As for text, it's left to
Safire to get the spirit right.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.470
Christ, this will be out
of the speech of his life

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.890
or words that are never uttered.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.280
But he's no pacer.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.270
There he goes on Penn Avenue
ditching the ride into a deli

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.320
with a government driver insisting
he'll take the few last blocks

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.620
on foot.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.090
He wants the air of a summer
night and an uncluttered sense

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.130
of the Quotidien [phonetic].

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:27.170
The stars might pull at time like
taffy out there exhaling light

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.710
but it's reassuring to know

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.680
that in the suburbs someone's
washing dishes, a curtain is lifted

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.470
by the breeze and surely, there's
a midget team looking for a homer

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:40.050
under a bug infested
ballpark lights.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:44.450
At the meat counter he watches
them shave a sheaf of pastrami

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.400
onto the wax sheets pop bread
and many packs of mustard

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.190
into paper sacks provisions for
what's going to be an all-nighter

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.670
in a toe to toe with a typewriter.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:00.570
If only he could peel
back the top of his head

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:04.560
to reveal slick words laid
neatly and glistening like a cash

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.740
of silver found when a sardine
key gets twisted around.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.210
But all he can see our two dead
astronauts canned in welded metal.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.260 position:56%
Their ingress above the modules
ladder like Jacobs climbed to heaven

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.910
and everything a question

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.480
of how anyone would spend
their last few hours.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.540
Would you stay inside?

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.510
Waiting until the oxygen
goes critical?

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:35.410
Tapping the dead switch for the
Ascent engine and lonely Morse?

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.730
Or rather pull and
[inaudible] and wander

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.080
out into the cold for
one last stroll?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.350
The whirling white like tickertape.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.060
Safire is slow.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.930
Slow is the thought of it.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.640
All night he'll haunt his office
taunted by shades of scenario.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.090
The moon's milky glow hung
in its pure potential stalled

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.130
like those satellites of paper
balled up into the waste.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.970
The future and empty shape still
left to fill with explanation.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.340
I've never been to
Washington before,

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.930
so I hope there's a deli
on Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.960
Otherwise that poem is
lacking in real research.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:29.330
This is another potential
disaster poem.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.630
It's called "The Game".

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.320
The trees skitter past.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.130 position:56%
A rush of verticals at the roadside.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.150
I'm 15 in the rearview off

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:46.080
to play the softball
tournament at Golden Lake.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:50.000
There's Tommy, Trevor, and me.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.550
And Trevor's older brother Kevin

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.560
who shit-grins [phonetic] behind
the steering wheel getting us there

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.190
for the 10 AM pitch.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.700
Somewhere down these back
routes just for kicks,

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.450
he guns the rusted chassis
at rising humps in the road.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:11.030 position:56%
He did trying to Jimmy us loose
from gravity and slip a fat envelope

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:15.290
of air between our
wheels and the earth.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:19.000
Each time we landed, our
tailbones jab the vinyl seats

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.690
and the stitched gloves jostle

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:26.590
in our laps their punched palms
a darker tan than last summer.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.790
Kevin's loving the morning
breeze forced through the rolled

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:34.070
down windows, but especially
the looks of panic

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:39.690
on his passenger spaces as if we
were clean plush cushions he'd been

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.800
itching to knock the stuffing from.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.390
Watch this, he says.

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:49.090
Pushing the gas pedal to the dusty
Matt then charges the wrong side

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.900
of the next blind hill.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.840
Our heads are numb.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.960
Our stomachs roll in clutch.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.570
I catch my own eye in the side
mirror giddy with a look of death.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.600
Every bit as close
as it might appear.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.130
And I'll read two quick short ones.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:14.970
Can't do a Canadian poem
reading without some snow.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.020
This is a poem about not being
able to write a poem which is

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.320
about as postmodern as I get.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.040
It's called "The Tennis
Courts in Winter".

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.200
From Christmas to the end
of March I have been trying

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.050
to find some clever way
to start a poem called

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.830
"The Tennis Courts in Winter".

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.130
I passed them every day

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.880
on my snowbound lurch
up Delaware and Cartier.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.040
The Eastside court
still posting rules

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.440
of play the stiffened board off
kilter with a zip tie snapped.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.550
But every chance I get
to jot the title down,

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.140
was stopped by white below.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.120
My unwritten poem had
become the tennis courts.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.440
Frozen to a stop inside a
chain-link fence blocked and blank.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.450
The obliterating snow
like Revelation in reverse

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.180 position:56%
which of course, is just forgetting.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.320
But I don't forget.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.810
I don't know why the
title haunts me.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:22.670
It might have something
to do with potential.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:26.300
Yesterday I thought of it
again though it's been years

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.470
since I moved away to this other
neighborhood and the snow has come

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:35.310
and gone at least 100 times that.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:40.900
And another new one
called "I Travel".

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.720
And thank you so much for
listening and coming out.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.270
And thanks much to
everyone involved.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.560
This has been wonderful and
it's a real honor to be here.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.860
"I Travel".

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:59.850 position:56%
If I was told I would have to go
then I would very much like to stay.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.360
No mystery thriller
this, but the trail dries

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.760
up as the evidence amasses.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.330
The road goes out as whining, long,

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.450
but that's an old song
someone else can sing.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.610
Even when it isn't, isn't
it always the weather?

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:23.700
It is always the sky
viewed three square.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.570
I was hoping to own what
I gathered around me

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.640
like any ticket it
wasn't only the event

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.550
but the guaranteed entry I needed.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.690
And it was not what I
loved or how though I came

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:45.580 position:56%
to it finally wiled immense but
muted like a snowstorm on the ocean.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.340
There is no truth to our land
only the terms of going there.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.230
So I could rush the stage
because I don't want

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.320
to wait here waving my arms.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.510
Thanks so much.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:22.370
[ Applause ]

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.940
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: I can see I
made the wrong choice here.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.320
It's probably going to be
better if I actually sit down,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.150
to which means I need
to steal that mic back.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.300
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: I
thought you meant

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.730
about the poets you
made the wrong choice.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.030
[laughter]

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.330
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid I've been known

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:39.650
to make wrong choices,
but with poets too.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.950
[laughter]

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.320
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Dave
was a totally bad idea.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.620
[laughter]

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.110
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: This is a
discussion part of the program.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:55.810 position:56%
And you are certainly welcome to ask
whatever questions you might wish.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:03.490
I do have a couple myself and
I'll start off by asking them

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:09.580 position:56%
and you can certainly join in or you
can follow-up however you choose.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:15.770
One of the things that Canadian
poetry is always been accused

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:24.920
of is being exceedingly rural
and very much not as involved

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.220
with urban life as it might be.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.000
That's clearly changing.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.990 position:56%
But I see particularly in Liz's
work a real interest and involvement

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:42.150
in the natural world again
except it's a new natural world.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:47.980
The nature in Liz's world is I mean
it's got Bush and rock and lakes

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.990
in it but man, it's
got-- it's electric.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.920
And I'd like you to
comment just a little bit

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.570
about nature in your work.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.540
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: So I grew up in

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.490
rural northern Ontario.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.500
So very much right in the Bush

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:14.040 position:56%
and that landscape just made a
really deep psychic impression in me

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.550 position:56%
as I was you know developing in
that landscape and so it's something

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.180
that I always carry with me.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:29.280
And in terms of working out
my relationship to that land

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:37.490
through poetry, through language,
I wanted to play with this idea

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:42.850
of making the familiar
somehow unfamiliar.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:53.460
Making nature seem something new
again and sort of dark and charged

00:40:53.460 --> 00:41:01.810
which was sort of more
reflective of my experience of it

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.180
because you know, the woods like
the wilderness is a really gorgeous

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:14.290
beautiful place and it can be
a site for you know, personal

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.130
and spiritual reflection
but it's also a place

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.970
where you can quite
easily find your death.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.450
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: You could die.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.750
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.050
Quite easily.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.350
Quite easily.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:30.870
So I wanted to convey that
sense of wilderness as well

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:37.060
and different relationships
that people in the north have

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:43.240
with animal beings and the bodies
of animals and just wanting

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:49.140
to convey the fullness and
problematics [phonetic]

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:57.180
and visual kind of--
striking the striking sort

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:02.740
of visual imagery that
that can create.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:08.010
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: I think you've done
that really very successfully.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:14.800 position:56%
Like I said before the natural world
that's there is not the natural

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.680
world you would have seen in
Canadian poetry in the 70s even.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.680
It's remarkably different and
remarkably charged as you say.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.000
Another thing that I think is--

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.860
I've seen all of you working
with is existing texts.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:39.050 position:56%
I mean David you in your most recent
book you've got Socrates among other

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.110
people and Sei Shonogon

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:48.160
in "The Pillow Book" is a
very strong background text

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.820
and even the song of Hiawatha
could be seen as a kind

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.340
of a haunting text
in your work, Liz.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:02.450
I don't know if that suggests a
kind of historicism in the poetry

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:07.460
or whether it's just a matching
up of existing material.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.680
So I'm curious to know how you
use earlier texts in your work

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:18.160
and what is it that
attracts you to them?

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.460
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Suzanne?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.760
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Sure.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.230
Yeah. Well, yeah, so my book is
really quite directly you know,

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.130
invokes this character and
historical figure, Shonogon.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:34.540
Which you know, the book is
about not sleeping and much

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:40.700
of those hours are spent and have
been spent in my life reading.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.260
And I think probably
the true of all poets

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.860
that that comes into
the conversation.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:54.760
Or into one's own internal
conversations.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.370 position:56%
So, yeah. I mean in a way the book--

00:43:57.370 --> 00:44:02.090
my book is kind of
written through her book

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.880
and to her in a certain respect.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:14.740
And that book helped open up formal
possibilities for me that I wanted

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.020
to be in conversation with.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.850
You know the question of
writers block what does one do

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.690
when one meets up but read you
know turn to other books and that's

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.990
for me always where
inspiration comes

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.030
from above everything else
is other people's language.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.100
And so yeah, the history
behind the long history--

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.400
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: It's 1000 years old.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.700
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: --
the long history of text.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.870
[inaudible] And sometimes
really old texts can open

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.800
up new things in new context.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.320
And that for me also
was part of the pleasure

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.560
of it was finding this
thousand year old form

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.280
that actually works beautifully
and you know the [inaudible].

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.180
You know the Internet blogs
and listicals [phonetic]

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.390
and all these things that are very
contemporary also actually kind

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:03.450
of existed in this form a thousand
years ago in Japan that seems

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.490
like the sort of earliest blog.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:11.120
So it adapted to new
you know material.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.130
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: I
just fall in saying

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:17.360
that I think you know you're
always in conversation with texts

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.480
from the past whether it's 10
years ago or thousand years ago.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.040
And as a writer you're always drawn
to you want to find some tension

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.090
and you want to-- and
sometimes that's a question

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:32.700
of deconstructing a prior
text or mashing it up.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:37.160
The thing that Monty was referring
to is there's a dialogue in my book

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.290
between Socrates and Sid
vicious from the Sex Pistols

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:43.160
and they both find themselves in
the afterlife and they were sort

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.190
of both figures of the dissent--
of dissent in their societies

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.380
and I just I was curious
to see what would come

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.030
about when they would have a
conversation and what conclusions

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.800
or arguments they would
get in about that.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.750
So a certain kind of hopefully,
and you know by rubbing two things

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:08.540 position:56%
that don't seem necessarily the same
together can hopefully create a fire

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.020
of some sort I would think.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.320
And that's why we do it.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.520
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Questions?

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.820
Comments?

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.830
Well, we can keep going.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:36.760
One of the other things I think is
well one of the things we should do

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:44.760
since we are Canadians here
in Washington is to poke

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.500
around a little bit at the
issue of is there anything

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:54.820
that distinguishes Canadian
poetry from our American friends?

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.210
I'm not convinced there is anymore.

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:03.590
Everybody reads so widely
and so much across borders

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.430
so much materials online it's

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:09.450
so easy I'm not convinced there's
much difference between Canadian

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.050
and American poetry anymore.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:17.850
But I'd be interested to
hear what you guys think.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:23.200
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Well you know
I will say that I would put

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.100
out that maybe 20 years ago a lot

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:30.720
of Canadian poets read
English Irish poets more.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.390
But in the last 20 years there
is a far more of an interest

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.940
in American poetry in the sense
of what influences can happen.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.240
And now it's a mix.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.710
And when we were at the airport
I was talking about Emily Berry

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:47.670
who is an English poet on what I
find interesting about her work is

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:52.460
that now I think English poets
are looking at American poetry

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.360
and trying to do something
contemporary rather

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.320
than you know rhyming
quatrains etc. So following

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.260
up on what you're saying I do think
that it's a much more global sort

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.880
of interest in where
people are going.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.180
You know? And in the same way,

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.840
there is some Canadian
stuff that influences thing.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.110 position:56%
Like I mean and Carson is an example
of someone who everyone is trying

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.250
to write like to some degree
or is looking at you know?

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.560
So I think it's become
much more of a-- you know--

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.130
a mix of people just trying to
find a different way into a poem

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.370
and creating something
interesting or new.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.670
Yes? Wrong?

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:30.970
Right?

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.270
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Yeah, no.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.570
I think that's true.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:35.650
We're not studying creative writing
a thousand years ago in Canada.

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:44.130
I-- a lot of the texts were more
British and-- and or postcolonial.

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:49.340
And looking to-- I had a teacher
who taught a class on postcolonial

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.760
that was you know Commonwealth
kind of stuff and that looking

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:57.100
to other sort of peripheral
texts thinking of Canada

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.620
as having a history that
peripheral both to a British center

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:08.650
and to an American center and I
think that probably is changing.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:13.090
I haven't lived in Canada
for almost 13, 14 years now.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.390
So--

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.690
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Well, yeah.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:16.990
I know. And so you're almost

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.290
in a privileged position
to talk about that.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.890
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Because
you've seen you're immersed

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.190
in both of those traditions.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:23.490
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Yeah.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.790
Yeah. I guess so.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:26.450
I mean you are an example.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.240
Liz is an example of a
poet younger than I am

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.530
who has come up and
who is new to me.

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:39.650
You know, and expresses a much
more like complex relationship

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:45.770
to literary past than a lot of
Canadian poets of my generation

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:51.660
who were more-- somewhat more
exclusively influenced may be

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:57.290
by a British tradition and so
I do think that's you know--

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.530
of a generation where access

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:04.920
is just so much greater and there
are so many more small presses

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.280
and so many more online forums

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.680
to be cross pollinating
and pollinated from.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.370
That-- is that-- I mean--

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.670
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.580
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Did you-- have
you found that you are doing a lot

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.550
of your reading online
and finding access

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.960
to international stuff that way?

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.260
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Oh yeah.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.560
Oh, certainly.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.730
And as best I can answer
the question is

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:31.640 position:56%
that I've found myself sort of
emerging from this sort of this sort

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.180
of this dense interconnection
of influences

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:41.280
that in many instances do
have their roots in America

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.490
like the language poetry movement
Black Mountain school New York

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:52.940
school poets having influences
on poets you know sort

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:59.310
of North you know coming north
through SUNI Buffalo to Toronto

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:05.370
and also a lot of the connections
between the West Coast poets

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.010
and the CUNY school of writers--

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.310
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Yeah.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:09.610
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: -- with
black [inaudible] college

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:12.930
and Charles Olsen, Robert
Creeley-- Robert Duncan.

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.230
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Yeah.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.530
Well and that's where
a lot of it's like--

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.830
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.130
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: --

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:19.430
early experimentation
in Canada [inaudible]

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:20.730
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Well,
early experiments-- yeah.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:22.030
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: --
influencing across the border

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:23.330
on that sort of strip up--

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.630
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:25.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: -- in the coast--

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.230
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:28.530
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: -- that
is its own kind of culture.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:29.830
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.130
So like my poetics I-- the
genealogy of whatever my poetics is

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.430
at present is sort
of coming informed

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:42.080
by that also you know the feminist
poetics and texts and writers

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.430
who are coming out of the
80s and early 90s in Canada.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:50.490
And also a bit of crossover
influence from sound poets

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.930
like the four Horsemen and
more recent individuals

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.890
like Angela Rawlings
who is sort of--

00:51:55.890 --> 00:52:01.340
and Margaret Christakos who really
put an importance on the music

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.810 position:56%
of language and sort of not always
necessarily going for direct meaning

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:11.480
but just for sonorous
you know exaltation.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.440
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: But another
thing that's been important

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.890
for you is I think is science.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.190
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yes.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.490
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: I mean you
have a science background.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.290
She has a degree with distinction
from the University of Toronto

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.360
and actually works
in a research lab.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.660
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yes.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.990
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: And I think
we're seeing a trend--

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:33.990 position:56%
trend is too big a word-- but
certainly a number of Canadian poets

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:37.820
who are directly involved
with science and their work.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.520
I mean I think [inaudible]
who is also a scientist--

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.820
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.900
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: -- and people like
Christian book and Adam Dickinson

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.110
and other folks who are making use

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:54.460
of fairly rigorous
science within their work.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.120
How do they fit?

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:02.900
How does the science and
the poetry mash together?

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.680
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: In my
experience, it's just--

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.720
it's been a different well from
which to pull to pull language.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.020
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Yeah.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: And also [inaudible
speaker] and also the general theory

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:16.370 position:56%
of how to work a bit with structure.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:23.830
One-- I sort of loosely applied a
few sort of like theories of memory

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.860
and memory formation and memory
as being this constructive

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:32.120
and reconstructive and more so of
a dynamic process by using a lot

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.540
of repetitions and
reemergences [phonetic]

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.860
of beings and phrases in my work.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:43.200
So you have the prior experience
of reading that and then also

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.170
in the present you are
re-experiencing it.

00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:50.460
So there's this dynamic charged
field between present experience

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.870
and recollection that both inform
each other forward and backwards.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.400
At least that's the intention.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.340
I don't know if that
actually happens.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:06.190
So there's an example and
in my studies you know,

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.790
you know I've always
said you know a student

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:13.590
of English literature might be
pulling from Milton or Beowulf

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:19.840
or Shakespeare and sort
of my pool from which--

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:24.670
my well from which I draw is
you know Kandel's principles

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.330
of neuroscience.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:31.430
That's was sort of like my
text so I really love using all

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:37.660
of these neuron anatomical and
scientific and medical language.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.630
I just find it aesthetically
pleasing.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:43.440
So that's how it works in my work.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.500
But I think you know--
Adam Dickinson is like--

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:51.280
his work, he has this whole book
called "The Polymers" which is all

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.630
about plastics and their
effect on the environment

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:58.260
and on the human body and so
he has all this whole sort

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.880
of extended project.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.630
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Well and I would
add that to that I think poets

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:07.580
and maybe physicists have in common
a fascination with pattern, right?

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.540
And variation of pattern.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.840
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.770
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: And there's
actually probably endless overlap

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:17.880
in the kinds of fascinations
of physics and poetry.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.180
[inaudible]

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.480
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: And I think yeah,

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.190
it's directly influenced
how people write,

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.060
too as they've been writing these
fractured patterns to sort of look

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.480 position:56%
at how modern-- you know like to try

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.540
to I don't know match a
sense of-- it's interesting.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.460 position:56%
And that's not just Canadian poetry.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.310
That's across the board.

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.850
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: I'm not sure if
it was beforehand but I know

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.960
that Christian Book really
brought forward the notion

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.170
of [inaudible] physics.

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.030
This-- which was created
by-- was it part of--

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:45.330
was it involved with [inaudible]?

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.630
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Well--

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:47.930
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Is it sort of--

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:49.830
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: -- I think
McCaffrey and bpNichol [inaudible]

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.130
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Okay.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.220
They were-- okay.

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.520
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: In Canada, anyway.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.820
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: In Canada.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.120
Okay.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.420
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: It did
not originate in Canada.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.720
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: No.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:04.660
No. My-- that's-- that
part of my reading

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.150
and research is really dusty.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:07.760
So it's very--

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.010
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: That
goes back a ways, too.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.310
&gt;&gt; Liz Howard: Yeah.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.610
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: I was wondering

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:15.640
since this is a capitol poetry
exchange, if you might be able

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.170
to talk a little bit about
Canadian government support

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.470
of poets and poetry.

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:25.510
And how different it might be from
support here in America [inaudible]

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:31.370
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: I
can talk about that.

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:32.670
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: Sure.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:34.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: Because I've
been a beneficiary of both, actually

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:39.790
and I'm immensely grateful
and I can say that you know,

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:48.020 position:56%
the Canadian government is vastly
more supportive of the arts in terms

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:52.390
of the way they fund
artists, practicing artists.

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:57.200 position:56%
Not only do practicing artists have
healthcare, but they also get access

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.090
to a lot of grants that
have been totally--

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:05.830 position:56%
for me essential during early years.

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:09.160
In the United States
there is a great--

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:14.310
there are great programs with
the NEA that I received a grant

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:18.290 position:56%
from which enabled me to finish
that book and I'm very grateful for.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:21.430
I wouldn't-- I had to be at a
certain place in my career in order

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:25.580
to qualify for that in the
first place whereas in Canada,

00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:28.570
there are a lot more-- you
probably have been given grants

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.010
as young writers.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:34.150
There's a lot more support of
that lower level which is really--

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:39.880
has been very essential
to cultivating talent

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.390
that otherwise can't
invest-- you know there's--

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:49.370
I think access here to create a
writing program which is a kind

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:54.370
of way that people get that
time to write there's a higher--

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.560
there's a more privileged category
of people who can even just go

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.040
to those schools and take out
the loans to do graduate study

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.280
and then you get access
when you're young and--

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.820
or you may be get funding

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.590
when you're young through
and MFA program.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:14.620 position:56%
In Canada I think the benefit of the
way that funding is structured is

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.790
that you don't need to
already be privileged enough

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:21.030
to attend a graduate
program for higher learning.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.940
You just submit a proposal
and some work

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:27.540
and so it levels the playing
field socioeconomically I

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.410
think considerably.

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:31.710
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Yeah.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:33.020
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: You
probably both received funding--

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.320
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Yeah.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.620
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Buffam: --
early on in your career.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Yeah, at different
points in the career and yeah,

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:41.060
your work is being
judged by a jury of--

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:47.160
by someone who might have one
book or 20 and it's about the work

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:52.060
and you have an equal chance to get
a grant to continue the project.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.840
You know Canada is
very good at that.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.170
They're not as good, actually,
which is why this is great is--

00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.470
of exporting their culture.

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.960
There are things like travel
grants if you get invited

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:05.810
to an international festival
which I've used a few times

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:10.760 position:56%
but you know there are I know that
I work with Monty with this festival

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.470
and when we're bringing
in Irish poets

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:15.030
or Scottish poets you know the
things like culture island,

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.630
creative island where you can
apply as a festival and bring

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:20.170
in people from that nationality.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:24.640
And Canada doesn't quite have
this corresponding program is that

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:29.070
and it could do more I think to get
our artists whether they are poets

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.180
or visual artists, etc. may be

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.800
out these different
events across the globe.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.210
So-- but it's helpful, for sure.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Monty Reid: When we hear that the
national endowment for the arts is

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:53.060
on the block, and you just may not
survive it comes as a shock to us.

00:59:53.060 --> 01:00:00.170
And a real sadness for
us because we know many

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:04.660
of the people in the institution
who will be affected by that

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:10.410
and for those who are arguing

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:15.870
against that elimination we
do wish you all the best.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:20.800
I know it doesn't amount to much
to sit here, but I do know it's--

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.910
it will create a great
deal of difficulty

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.700
for writers in the states.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:35.970
We have been supported in our
visit here by the Canadian embassy

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:41.760
and that's-- although it never
seems like there's enough,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.610
the Canadian government has over
the years been very faithful

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.980
and very good in its
support of the arts.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.830

I thoroughly enjoyed your readings
and the poetry and this discussion.

I would like to know what are
you reading now, poetry or prose?

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:32.320
And also you know there's been
much talk in the US in past years

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.390
about poetry being hijacked by
the Academy and I was wondering

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:40.030
if there's pushback
against that now but is

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.600

there a perception of that?

right left and center.

But currently what I'm probably
reading is an Emily Barry book

in like all the poetry sort

more of the case here from what I--

is happening in Canada right now

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.030
I think that is definitely
more the case here.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.040
There's far more institutions here.

With large-- you know many with far
more money available to pay people

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:32.570
and I do-- you know, I do think
that that is partly a product of--

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.860
it gives-- you know, the Academy
gives young poets a place to hang

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:41.560
out for a couple years and write
poems which I think is connected

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.760
to Rob's question about funding
and how do you stay afloat

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.160
when you are young uncredentialed
poet looking for you know some kind

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.430
of roof over your head
if you can get funding

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.670
from a university program
to spend a couple

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.400
of years doing an MFA or a PhD.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.500
It's a place to write your
first book and I think

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:07.070
that happens a lot more here for
a lot of reasons to do with money.

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.450
You know? Yeah.

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:11.750
&gt;&gt; David O'Meara: Yeah.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:14.010
I mean there's a lot more
opportunities to take program--

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:20.630 position:56%
do programs and MFA's etc. and-- you
know, I've taken workshops before

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:23.130
and I've taught them as well.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:30.570
And I feel that it's good to take
them because it forces you to look

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:33.500
at your work on a kind of an
editing level and get some feedback

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.710 position:56%
but I also feel like if you do it
too often certain programs will sort

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:41.440
of chisel you down to sound like
a lot of other stuff and I think

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.070
to be successful at taking
the most from that is kind

01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:50.860
of like getting a bit of it and
staying away from it as well

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:54.550
because I think if you're immersed
in it then your voice becomes sort

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.100
of a collection of a lot of
different people's opinions

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.630
and you kind of lose that
individuality and that can happen

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:04.610
in a program to, I
would imagine, you know.
