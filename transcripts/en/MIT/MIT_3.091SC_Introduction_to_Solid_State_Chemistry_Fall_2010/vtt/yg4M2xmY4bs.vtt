00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.380
JOCELYN: Hi.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.370
Jocelyn here.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.000
Today, we're going to go over
fall 2009 final exam problem

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.680
number five.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.110
As always, we're going to start
by reading the question.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.010
The skeletal structure of the
amino acid alanine is given

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
below as it exists in its
neutral zwitterion.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430
To the right is shown
its titration

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.520
curve in aqueous solution.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.270
The abscissa expresses
concentration in terms of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.460
degree of protonation so
that a value of 0.5--

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.390
that the neutral ion is the
only species present.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.150
At a value of zero, alanine is
totally deprotonated and at a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.220
value of one, alanine is
totally protonated.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.240
So let's move to part A.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.630
What is the hybridization
of each of the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.720
three carbons in alanine?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.180
So to begin with this one, I
would start by rewriting the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.350
structure of alanine because as
it's written now, it's not

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.130
as clear what the hybridization
of the alpha,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.800
beta and gamma carbons are.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.320
So starting with the
alpha carbon,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.570
connecting the beta carbon--

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.204
and here is the gamma carbon--

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.020
and of course, we don't want
to forget the amine group.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.520
So this looks fairly similar
to what is on the page, but

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.920
I've kind of expanded the
structure so that it's more

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.420
straightforward for us to
determine the hybridization.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.870
The alpha carbon is the central
carbon here and we see

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
that it has four bonds and
four electron domains.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.780
If we go back to the beginning
of the class, we learned that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.280
when you have four electron
domains around a central

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.550
carbon, we have Sp3
hybridization.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.510
Going to the beta carbon here,
we see that it also has four

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.700
bonds, but one of them is
a double bond to oxygen.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.920
So we need to remember from our
earlier lessons that the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.830
double bond only counts as
one electron domain.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.606
Therefore, this carbon has
three electron domains.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.520
And going back to our
hybridization rules, we know

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.660
that this gives us an
Sp2 hybridization.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.500
Lastly, we have our gamma carbon
and it gives us one,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.790
two, three, four bonds and
four electron domains.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.800
Therefore, our gamma is
also Sp3 hybridized.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.630
This problem on the final was
dealing with first beginning

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.940
material, but then in part B and
C, we're going to move on

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.330
to the material we've learned
more recently.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.050
So moving to part B--

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.780
we are now are dealing with the
titration curve that is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.080
given to us.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.990
So this looks hopefully fairly
similar to what is on your

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.690
page and the question-- it's
asking us to indicate on the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.030
titration curve--

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.470
one, the PKA for protonation
of the zwitterion.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.650
Two, the PKA for deprotonation
of the zwitterion.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.360
And three, the isoelectric
point.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.180
So before we start that, let's
talk a little bit about this

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.770
titration curve here.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.800
What is it showing us?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.660
What is it depicting?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.600
What I like to do is--
we see that we have

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.640
two buffered regions.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.720
That right off the bat should
tell you that there are two

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.900
different equilibriums
going on.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.980
There are two different
protonation/

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.880
deprotonation reactions.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.690
So I'm going to split this right
down the middle here.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.770
And that way we can think about
the two protonations/

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.980
deprotonations separately.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.930
So on the left side here, we
have the more acidic portion

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.360
of our titration curve and
even if you didn't quite

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.810
understand his description of
the abscissa, we know that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.050
because this side--

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.210
the solution has a lower Ph,
it's going to be dealing with

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.790
the more protonated species
of the alanine.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.300
This--

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.490
on the right side, we have the
higher Ph, so we're going to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.100
have a more deprotonated
alanine on this side.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.980
And he already told
us that we had the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.960
zwitterion in the middle.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:22.240
So next to 0.5, we're going to
write a generic term for a

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.130
neutral acid.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.810
If we look back to
our structure,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.010
we see that we have--

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.770
the neutral zwitterion has one
acidic proton here on the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.220
amine group and it has
a neutral charge.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.030
So that's why I'm going to
depict that zwitterion as HA

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.320
Moving to the left, more
acidic portion of the

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.620
titration curve, we have--

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.970
we know that there's a
protonation going on.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.920
So I'm going to write that as
H2A plus because whenever we

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.820
add a proton, we're adding
a positive charge.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.240
And then, at the more basic
side, we have doubly

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.310
deprotonated alanine and so we
have just our backbone, which

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.580
I'm going to call a and
a negative charge.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.420
So from the question,
we should know that

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.500
this is true, correct?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.780
Because he told us that we have
the totally protonated

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.310
alanine on the left side.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.160
We have the zwitterion in the
middle at 0.5 and we have the

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.320
totally deprotonated
on the right side.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.470
OK.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.050
What else can we know from this
titration curve or what

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.930
can we add to it so that
we can understand it

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.600
a little bit better?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.580
Well, let's write down the
equilibrium reactions that are

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.350
happening that make this
buffer region here.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:03.830
On left side, we have the doubly
protonated alanine

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:17.500
going to proton plus
the zwitterion.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.780
And that's what's creating
this buffered Ph region.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.460
On the right side here, we
have the zwitterion in

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.750
equilibrium with--

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:38.310
again, a proton and the doubly
deprotonated alanine.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.390
These are things that
are true for any

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.830
titration curve you see.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.350
Depending upon the number
of protonations--

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.600
the number of times a buffer
region might change, but for

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.750
each buffered region, you
can always determine an

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:02.400
equilibrium constant that is
causing that stability in Ph.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.760
OK.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.460
Now let's go to the question.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:15.970
We need to indicate on the curve
the PKA of both this

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.170
equilibrium equation and this
equilibrium reaction.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.790
So to do that, we hopefully
will remember the

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.790
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
and that gives us a

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:32.470
relationship between the Ph of
the solution and the PKA of

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.430
the acid that's in solution.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.500
So writing down the

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.875
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation--

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.450
we have--

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.150
not the Ph--

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.270
and this is the same equation
that Professor Sadoway derived

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.520
in lecture.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.740
And here, I've written it in the
most generic form, but no

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.560
matter what our equilibrium
species are, we just know that

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.390
we put the more basic species
on top and the acid that got

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.360
deprotonated on the bottom.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.550
So for the first point of this,
we are looking for the

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.210
PKA of the protonation
of the zwitterion.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:46.420
So we know that it's an
equilibrium between the doubly

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:57.340
deprotonated and
the zwitterion.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.770
That is the equation
we're looking at.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.300
So let's write down our
Henderson-Hasselbalch for that

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.295
and I'm going to call this PK1
just to keep them separate.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.020
Remember here, my Ha is on
top because we have--

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.510
our doubly protonated species
is the acid in this case.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.060
Now in order to put on the
titration curve where the PKA

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.060
is, we look at the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:45.390
and see that where the Ph equals
the PKA is when the

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.190
concentration of the acid and
its conjugate base are

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.190
equivalent.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:11:04.240
because if Ha equals H2a plus,
the log term goes to zero and

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.300
we have our Ph equals PK1.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.740
Going back to the titration
curve, we see that the

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.590
concentration between H2a
plus and Ha is equal

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.050
right in the middle.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:26.040
We can assume that this is
a to-scale concentration

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.290
abscissa here.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.750
And so there we go up and we can
say, OK, this point on the

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:38.880
titration curve here corresponds
to our PK1.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.070
So from the
Henderson-Hasselbalch

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.080
equation, we can see that given
the titration curve,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.360
this is where our PK1 is
and it's about two.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.710
For our purposes, that's--

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:02.090
we weren't asked to estimate it,
but if I had to, I'd say

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.160
it's around two.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.940
Now we have to do the same thing
for the other side of

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.620
the titration curve.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.800
So if you haven't done that
already, maybe you can stop

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:19.970
now and try that on your own
because it's the same process.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.830
OK.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.390
So it's do of the second one--

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:30.630
which again, is just the Ph is
equal to the PKA when the two

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.676
species are equal, except for
now we have different species.

00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:36.670
So basically we're
looking for--

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.130
our new Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation is--

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:52.530
with using the new equilibrium
reaction, our doubly

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:59.650
deprotonated alanine is now on
top and our zwitterion is on

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.200
the bottom.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.550
So this might be a little
confusing because we have the

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.120
same species going from the
top to bottom in our

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.950
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,
but remember that

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.350
we're always talking about the
acid is in the denominator and

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.440
the conjugate base is in
the numerator here.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.740
But either way, we again want
to look for where the Ph

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.230
equals the PK2 and so our
zwitterion concentration will

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.760
equal our doubly deprotonated
alanine.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.675
And that occurs right here.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.040
So the last part of this
question is to indicate where

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.810
the isoelectric point is and the
important thing for this

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.840
part of the problem, of course,
is to know what the

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.610
isoelectric point meets--

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:04.010
and it's where the dominant
species in the solution is the

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.590
neutral zwitterion.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.035
And Professor Sadoway already
told us where that is and it

00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:12.830
is where we're at 0.5 here,
which we've already indicated

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.670
as where the zwitterion
is dominant.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.040
And so we just can go up here
and circle that and we can

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.510
call that number three.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.980
So you didn't have to go through
all of the work I did

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.047
and if you were familiar with
the titration curve, you could

00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:37.500
have simply put these down, but
understanding where these

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.260
points come from is quite
important for understanding

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.670
acid base chemistry and
how amino acids work.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.130
All right.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.380
So let's move to part C.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.360
In part C, we're asked to draw
the skeletal structure of

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.330
alanine when it is solvated
in an aqueous

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.420
solution at extreme acidity--

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.390
ie, Ph less than one.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.010
So I'm going to write that down
and then we can go back

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.720
to our titration curve and see
where that is because we've

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.850
already spend a lot of time
understanding our titration

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.480
curve and that tells us a lot
about the acid base chemistry

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.790
of alanine.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.780
So at the titration curve, we
see that at a Ph less than

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.990
one, we're going to have mostly
our doubly protonated

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.440
zwitterion.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.090
That said, now we need to go
back and look at the structure

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.780
of alanine and we can put
in the protonation.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:16:00.980
So we're given the zwitterion
form of alanine, but at very

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.660
low acidity--

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.270
sorry-- high acidity, low Ph.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.680
This carboxy group is going
to be protonated.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.450
And so we have both of our
acidic protons are on the

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.580
alanine and this would be a
structure of alanine at a Ph

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.830
less than one.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.473
Now moving to part D--

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.250
we are asked for an aqueous
solution of alanine--

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.700
calculate the ratio of the
concentration of neutral

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.750
alanine zwitterion to the
concentration of deprotonated

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.100
anion when the Ph is 8.091.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.540
So a couple things I
would write down.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:58.510
Ph equals 8.091 and we are asked
for the ratio of the

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:05.710
concentration of the zwitterion
to the doubly

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.040
deprotonated anion.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.960
When we're asked for this,
hopefully you think first,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.110
Henderson-Hasselbalch--

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.730
I can use that.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.840
We're given a Ph.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.780
We can find the PKA and we're
asked for the ratio and

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.070
concentrations.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.050
So let's write down the

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.580
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.590
And because we're asked for the
ratio, we don't need any

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.030
more information except
for the PKA.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:54.580
Luckily, from part B, we know
what the PKA is of this

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.590
equilibrium between the
zwitterion and the doubly

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.151
deprotonated anion.

00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:04.850
So moving back to your titration
curve, we see that

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.000
the PKA is roughly 10--

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.850
doesn't need to be our--

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.690
our estimation doesn't need to
be exact, but if it's in the

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.760
ballpark range, then you
have the right idea.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.370
So I'm going to write that.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.607
We can plug that in
just down here.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.310
Log of our concentration.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.740
That's a log term.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.430
And from here, it's
just algebra.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.460
So simplify a little bit.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:50.460
If we bring the 10 over to
this side, we get -1.909

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.131
equals the log of
a minus over--

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.210
I'm sorry.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.750
I'm getting a little
bit crooked here.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.270
And then if you take both sides
of the power of 10,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.520
we'll get--

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.250
the ratio equal to this.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.840
And if we take the reciprocal
of this,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.020
we'll get a nicer answer.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:36.800
We'll get HA over A minus
and it won't be a

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.650
fraction over here.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.030
So I suggest that you do that
and you'll see that our final

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.280
answer is--

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.830
let's put it right here.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.200
81.1:1--

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.820
the ratio of our zwitterion to
the doubly deprotonated anion.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.290
And then you've answered all
parts of the problem.
