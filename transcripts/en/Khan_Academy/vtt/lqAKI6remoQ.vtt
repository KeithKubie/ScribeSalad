00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.490
- [Narrator] In this
video, we're going to think

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.170
about the concept of
minimum efficient scale

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.690
and then how that impacts
market concentration.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.970
And we're going to make sure we understand

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.790
what both of these ideas are.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.600
So first of all, minimum efficient scale,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600
you can view it as the smallest scale

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.540
at which we stop getting
economies of scale,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.660
or another way of thinking
about it is the minimum scale

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.740
at which we are no longer,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.070
our long-run average total
cost curve is declining.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.200
So in this example, let's see,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
when we talk about our taco trucks,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.530
when we were at about 80 units,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.270
we're not at minimum efficient scale yet

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.570
because our long-run
average total cost curve

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.650
is still declining as we add
more and more and more units.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.980
We're getting economies of
scale all the way until,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.550
at least in this example,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.770
it looks like our long-run
average total cost curve

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.630
stops declining around 200 units.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.140
So in this example,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.670
that would be our minimum efficient scale,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.797
which is sometimes abbreviated as MES.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:08.300
And one way to think about it
is this is the minimum scale

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.620
at which an operation needs to run at

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.740
in order to be very competitive,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.480
in order to be truly efficient
out there in the market.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.460
Because you can imagine,
if some operators are able

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.050
to achieve minimum efficient
scale of, let's say,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.240
getting to the 200 tacos a
day while others are not,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.940
let's say they're only able
to stay at 100 tacos per day,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.077
and if the market were
to get very competitive

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.730
and the price of a taco were to go down

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.320
to, say, 55 cents per taco,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740
the people who are at
minimum efficient scale

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.420
could still operate and still make money

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.350
while the people who are not
at minimum efficient scale,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.380
well, they're not going
to be able to participate

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.600
in the market.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.660
And most well-functioning markets,

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.500
it gets quite competitive.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.850
And so economists like to think about

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.190
what the minimum efficient scale is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.840
and compare that to
the entire market size.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.970
Now, what do we mean by market size?

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.660
Well, it depends on how you
are defining the market.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.880
In our example of our taco trucks,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.250
it might be the market for tacos,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.340
market for tacos

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.400
in our city.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.290
And of course, you can
define different markets.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.880
You could define it as the market

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.340
for food trucks in our city.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.345
You could define it as the
market for tacos in our state

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:29.533
or our country. But let's say if we were

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.600
to say the market for tacos in our city,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.710
and let's say that that market is 10,000,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.830
10,000 tacos

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.320
per day.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120
Well, in this reality,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.030
our minimum efficient
scale is 200 tacos per day,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.580
and it's a very small
fraction of the total market.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340
And so that means that you could have

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.240
many different competitors,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.980
each at that minimum efficient scale,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.260
so they're able to produce
tacos at that 50 cents per taco.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780
And because of that,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.000
you are likely to have many competitors.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.220
So when this,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.020
when our minimum efficient
scale is a small fraction

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.450
of the total market, that is
going to lead to fragmentation.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.930
So here, we're going to have a fragmented,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.010
fragmented market.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.850
So if this circle were to
represent the 10,000 tacos

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.490
that are sold per day,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.960
if you're able to have
a lot of competitors,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.740
each operating at minimum efficient scale,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.560
in fact, there's no real advantage

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.620
to operating above minimum efficient scale

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.400
because then you start
getting diseconomies to scale,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.500
well, then you are going to
have maybe 50 competitors

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.630
who are splitting this market.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.890
So I won't take the trouble of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.340
making this into 50 different chunks.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.900
So one competitor has
that part of the market.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.200
Another competitor has
that part of the market.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.880
Another competitor has
that part of the market.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.620
And you could imagine we're
going to have this market

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.770
fragmented into maybe
50 different players,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.150
and so that's why it's called
a very fragmented market.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.290
But let's say that the
minimum efficient scale

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.820
was pretty close to the market size.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.910
So let's say instead of a
market for 10,000 tacos per day,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.910
let's say that the market
in our city is for 400,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.360
400 tacos

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.520
per day.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.780
Well, then the market is going
to be smaller, like this.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.240
And so then it makes sense for,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.110
if someone's able to get to
the minimum efficient scale,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.850
they can take up a lot of the market.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.350
In fact, they could take
up half of the market.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.120
So this type of market might only be able

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.100
to really support two
players in this market.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.030
So this is considered to
be a far more concentrated,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.960
concentrated market.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.250
And you could go to a reality

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.060
where your minimum efficient
scale is at the market size

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.830
or is even larger than the market size.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.530
So let's say that the market
size is not 400 tacos per day,

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.690
but let's say we had a market,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.036
let's say we had a market of

00:05:01.036 --> 00:05:04.520
195 tacos per day,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.983
per day.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.470
Well, in that world,
whoever can get to 195 tacos

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.380
is going to produce most efficiently.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800
They're not even getting to
the minimum efficient scale.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.390
But the more, the closer that
you can get to that number,

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.880
you're going to have the
lowest average total,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.600
long-run average total cost of production,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.180
and so it's going to be very hard

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.550
for anyone else to compete with you,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.640
especially if you're taking
up most of the market.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.460
No one else is going to
be able to get to scale,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.110
so they're going to be operating out here

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.350
on the long-run average total cost curve.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.170
And so in that world, you
might only have one player.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.830
And when you have one player,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.110
where the market dynamics make it

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.650
so that it is actually
efficient for only one player,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.240
this is sometimes referred
to as a natural monopoly.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.260
There's other dynamics that could lead

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.700
to a natural monopoly.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.340
But one way to think about it is,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.510
is if you keep getting economies of scale,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.850
up to the market size,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.290
well, then whoever can get
to that market size first

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.093
is going to be the most
efficient producer.
