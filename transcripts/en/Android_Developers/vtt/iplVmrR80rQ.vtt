[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:06.560
DAN HILL: Robinhood's
an investing platform

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.890
that lets users buy and sell
stocks, cryptocurrencies,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.335
options, and ETFs,
all commission-free.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:14.460
Robinhood believes that
everyone should have access

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.418
to the financial markets,
so we built Robinhood

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:18.420
from the ground out
to be fast, simple,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.030
and easy for all investors.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.060
People love Robinhood's simple,
beautiful, intuitive design,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.245
and they love that they're
able to place trades on the go.

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:27.620
JINYAO CAO: Here
at Robinhood, we

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.383
have a team model of the
less code we have to write,

00:00:30.383 --> 00:00:31.800
the less code we
have to maintain,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
which means the
better off we will be.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.280
So that goes hand-in-hand with
adopting Jetpack components

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.710
to be able to do
a lot more things

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.250
that we, as a small team,
would not be able to do.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.500
Jetpack, in particular,
is really great

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.770
because the libraries are
really reliable and really

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.080
well-tested, they're
actively being maintained,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.010
and they solve a problem that
the Android community often

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.700
have.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.070
One component we were
really excited about

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.520
was definitely Room.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.460
It's probably one
of the libraries

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.770
that best utilizes
annotation processors.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.400
It just hooks up to our UI.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.480
Our UI can listen to the
Room database changes,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480
and the network layer
can be abstracted away.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.080
It also allows us to
reduce a lot of boilerplate

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
around database serialization,
decentralization.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.030
One of the newer libraries
we adopted was Work Manager.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.100
And in fact, we have
been using Work Manager

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.410
ever since the very first
alpha because it solves

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.090
a pretty big problem for us.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.600
Prior to Work Manager, we
had quite a few periodic jobs

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.880
that we want to do, and
we decided to not do them

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.340
because it was just a
huge pain to maintain.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
With Work Manager, it offers us
a very simplified and unified

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.970
API and allows us to define
exactly what do we want

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.980
and have everything just work.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.610
As a developer, I think writing
clean, and maintainable,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.330
and readable code can be
poetic, so it's definitely

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.950
like one of the joys
I get out of my work.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.450
DAN HILL: The Android
team at Google

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.150
was always been super-involved
in the community.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.870
Jetpack is a perfect
example of responding

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.880
to what the developers
have been asking for,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.060
and making our lives easier
by letting us focus on just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.418
our core business challenges.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.460
Robinhood has more than
doubled our customer base

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.730
since launching on Android, and
we hope to continue growing.
