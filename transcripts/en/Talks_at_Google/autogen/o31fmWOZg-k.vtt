[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.960
SPEAKER: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.810
Today we are excited
to welcome the founder

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.470
and CEO of DO Cookie Dough
Confections, Kristen Tomlan.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.980
Welcome.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.063
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Thank you.

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.660
SPEAKER: In 2014, Kristen
decided to officially launch

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.550
DO, as she uncovered a
market of cookie dough lovers

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.800
in the world just like herself.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.360
The increase in
demand soon prompted

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.700
Kristen to open her first
brick-and-mortar experience

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.100
here in New York City in 2017.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.400
Since, Kristen has been a
nominee of Crain's 40 under 40,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.130
and received brand praise among
publications such as the "New

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.520
York Times," "O, The
Oprah Magazine," "People,"

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.330
and across shows such as
"Today" and "CBS This Morning."

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.580
Today Kristen has developed
over 100 hand-crafted flavors,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.200
including top sellers such
as signature chocolate chip--

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.950
which is my favorite--

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.710
cake batter, heavenly,
and confetti,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.350
some of which she will
showcase here at Google today.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.580
So how did DO start?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.520
Like where did this
idea come from?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.410
KRISTEN TOMLAN: So I
had been a cookie dough

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.600
lover my entire life.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.210
I learned the ins and
out of the kitchen

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.450
from my mom, who is
a baker and a chef.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.860
I grew up in St. Louis,
so from the Midwest.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.640
And we made everything
from scratch.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.260
And so cookies
were no different.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.220
I would love sharing just
anything sugary with others

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.750
for birthdays or any occasion.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.510
And any time that we
baked cookies at home

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.320
it was a requirement to
save my dad a Tupperware

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.756
container of cookie dough.

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.130
So that when he came home and
saw the fresh-baked cookies

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.959
on the counter, he
immediately went to the fridge

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.000
and got the cookie dough.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.940
And even though you weren't
supposed to eat cookie dough

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.550
it was worth the risk
for me growing up.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.170
And it just continued to be kind
of a secret obsession of mine.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.100
Throughout college I always
had a tub of Toll House

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.200
or whatever I could
get my hands on.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.190
And even after college I
was continuing to bake.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.860
I was working here
in New York City.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.310
And I treated cookie dough
like it was ice cream.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.590
So I would some in my
fridge at all times

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.620
and take it out by the
spoonful-- a little bit--

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.060
and then stick the
container back.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.370
So that was my experience
with cookie dough.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.350
But I came up with
the idea for dough

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.020
when I was with a
bunch of girlfriends.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.920
We were visiting a friend in
graduate school at Villanova,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.530
and we happened to go
to this cookie shop.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.890
And they had a ton of
fresh-baked cookies,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.420
and all sorts of flavors.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
And I had wandered over
to their freezer section,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.730
and they were selling their
cookie dough and chocolate

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.340
chip for you to, of
course, go home and bake.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.570
But I turned to my
friends and said,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.610
hey, will anybody
split this with me.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.330
I kind of just want
the cookie dough.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.060
SPEAKER: I'm sure
no one said no.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.309
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Of course not.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.900
So everybody decided to
just walk out of there

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.420
without buying anything
that was actually baked.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.760
And at that time
it wasn't really

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.550
acceptable like sit in
their cute little shop

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.980
and eat the cookie dough
from the container.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.710
So we sat in the car,
and then we continued on

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.630
with our shopping or
whatever we were doing.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.690
And we were thinking,
are we going to get sick?

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.954
Or are we going to
feel terrible later?

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:09.870
We didn't really care.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.150
We just finished
the whole thing.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.800
Just licking our fingers.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.230
No shame.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.261
Good girlfriends.

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.260
And that was the moment.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.320
We were in the car.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.530
And I thought, why
isn't this a thing?

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.490
Why can't you go to a store
and just eat the cookie dough?

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.975
We all just wanted to do it.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.100
SPEAKER: Everybody does it.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.240
KRISTEN TOMLAN:
Everybody does it.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.020
SPEAKER: I don't know anyone
that's actually gotten sick.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.090
KRISTEN TOMLAN: I
don't know anybody

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.540
that doesn't like
the cookie dough,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.123
or doesn't try it
when they're baking.

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:38.010
And so that was the
moment-- like kind

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.720
of the light bulb
for me that was like,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.920
maybe this could be a thing.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.000
Maybe cookie dough could
be a dessert on its own.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.530
And so that started me on my
quest to develop this brand,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.920
and develop this product that
was completely safe to eat,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.150
and bakeable.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.280
So you have the
option to do both.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.155
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:03:57.155 --> 00:03:58.530
KRISTEN TOMLAN:
So then I decided

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.830
to launch the business online
to just test the market first,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.690
because I had no idea
how to start a business,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.580
let alone run a retail store,
which was the original idea.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.630
So I launched it
online to test it.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.092
And then from there,
once that was successful,

00:04:15.092 --> 00:04:17.550
and I saw that there really
was this market of cookie dough

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.690
lovers that I knew coming
out of the woodwork,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.240
I decided to open
up a store in 2017.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.007
And that kind of catapulted
the business to the next level.

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.090
SPEAKER: And I remember I
ordered some for my team

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.770
and we waited six
weeks to get it.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.060
I ordered it online.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.250
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.550
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.430
KRISTEN TOMLAN:
You're so patient.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.730
Thank you.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.270
SPEAKER: And it was
gone in a second.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.180
I was dying to try it.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.150
KRISTEN TOMLAN: I always
find the people that say--

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.900
especially when we
first opened-- like oh,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.460
I waited three hours in line.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.406
And I know they
waited in the cold,

00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:44.530
or they waited in the rain.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.342
SPEAKER: I was too
lazy to do that.

00:04:46.342 --> 00:04:48.800
KRISTEN TOMLAN: And I always
tell people thank you so much.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.270
I'm so happy that we have such
great fans, and supporters,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.860
and so many cookie dough lovers.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.030
SPEAKER: What are we
going to make today?

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.821
KRISTEN TOMLAN: OK.

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.290
So today we're going to make
one of our most popular flavors.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.040
It is our brookie dough, which
you guys have in front of you.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.070
It's a combination of
a cookie and a brownie,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.365
so that's why we
call it the brookie.

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:08.240
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.381
You can't go wrong.

00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:09.880
At all.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.160
It actually started
as a seasonal flavor.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.590
So we have 20 different
flavors at our shop.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.247
And for those of you
who haven't been--

00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:17.580
who don't want to wait in line--

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.430
it's set up like an
ice cream experience.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.120
So I wanted to create something
that was familiar enough--

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.910
so everyone knows when you go
into an ice cream store you can

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.970
get it by the scoop,
you can add toppings,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.860
you can get it in
a cup or a cone.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.810
You can even make a
milkshake out of it.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.560
Whatever you want to do.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.580
But instead of ice cream
it is all cookie dough.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.950
And two of the flavors
change every single month.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.680
And we love to have fun
spending on the season,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.350
and trying new flavors,
and always taking requests

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.070
from fans about
what we should have.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.950
And we decided to have
this flavor, brookie dough,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.080
as a seasonal for the month.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.810
It's just our chocolate
chip and our brownie batter

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.760
swirled together in one.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.679
And it was immediately one of
the most popular flavors, which

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:03.220
doesn't always happen
with a seasonal

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.650
because chocolate chip is like--

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.720
usually people go
for the classic ones.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.720
And we took a vote on
social media and everyone

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.640
wanted brookie to
stay on the menus.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.802
So we decided to keep it, so
now it's on our regular menu.

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:17.260
So I'm going to
show you guys today

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.280
how to make these two
flavors, how to combine them.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.430
And then actually, the
brookie dough originally--

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.720
since we opened the shop--

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.890
was a bar.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.260
So it is a brownie
on the bottom,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.240
it's chocolate chip
cookie dough on top,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.140
and then it's topped
with chocolate ganache.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.340
So that was kind of the
inspiration for the flavor

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.812
in the first place.

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:39.520
So we're going to make
the dough version,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.760
we're going to make
the actual brookie,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.490
and top it with
chocolate ganache,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.420
and then fill you guys
with all sorts of sugar.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.920
All right.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.700
Well, I'll let you--

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.783
SPEAKER: How's that sound?

00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:50.800
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Good.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.070
Thank you guys for having me.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.600
Thank you for coming.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.980
I hope you are ready to
eat some cookie dough

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.160
and have some sugar
for breakfast.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.700
I want this to be
very interactive,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.870
so if anyone has questions
at any time grab the mic

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.460
and ask away.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.980
For me, cooking and
baking is an experience

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.720
that I fell in love with because
I got to share it with others.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.957
I love baking and cooking
with others in the kitchen,

00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:18.040
and then sharing those
treats and seeing the smile

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.331
that it puts on people's faces.

00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:22.870
So please, if you guys have
anything, want to get involved,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.640
get your hands
dirty, let me know.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.150
But yes, like you
said-- thank you

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.910
for the introduction-- my name
is Kristen Tomlan, the founder

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:31.900
and CEO.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.990
I started the
business in 2014 when

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.410
I was still working full-time
at a brand consultant

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.440
here in New York.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.880
So my old job, which I
used to call my real job

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.040
and then this was my
fake job, and then

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.430
now it's kind of
switched, I used

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.730
to work in brand
experience design.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.280
So I was a designer
for a consultant,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.850
and I got to work
with amazing brands

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.560
like BMW, and
Samsung, and Walmart.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.740
And I was developing
their customer experience.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.570
So innovating that
experience and really

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.050
working through how to
stay new and different.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.270
And I really used that expertise
as I was developing this brand

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.970
to understand what are the
unique points of the customer

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.090
journey, what are
all the interactions.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.730
So a lot of people assume that
I went to business school,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.480
or had investors or
any sort of thing.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.410
I had no idea how to
start this business,

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.780
and I did it by trial.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.580
And the only things I
knew in the beginning

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.830
were about branding and about
baking so I started there.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.490
The first recipe
I ever developed

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.380
was our signature
chocolate chip.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.710
All of our recipes come
from old family recipes

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.232
that have been in my
family for years and years.

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:48.940
And then we've modified
them to make sure

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.450
that they're safe to eat, and
that they're also bakeable.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.296
So should we get to it?

00:08:54.296 --> 00:08:55.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.289
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Awesome.

00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:58.580
We're going to start with,
like I said, chocolate chip,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.220
which every one of our
cooking doughs-- except

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.300
for the vegan flavors-- start
with good old-fashioned butter.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.720
We use 100% real butter.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.960
We don't use any sort
of margarine, or Crisco,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.890
or anything fake.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.790
Butter is better.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.929
Always.

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:17.720
It gives your cookies
and your cookie dough

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.380
a really rich flavor,
which we like.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.600
And also is-- for me--

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.400
makes every cookie--
you can really ta--

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.691
I like that buttery taste.

00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.940
So that's exactly what we use.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.250
We use unsalted butter.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.210
So a lot of people don't know
that actually salted butter

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.619
typically has a higher moisture
content because of that salt.

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:44.660
And you don't want that
moisture in your cookies.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.520
You want it to be
super fudgy and dense.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.040
So don't use the salt--

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.730
salted kind.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.040
You also have more control
over how much salt you

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.590
put in your cookie dough,
which is exactly what you

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.610
want when you're baking.

00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.990
This has been softened, so I've
just left it on the counter

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.147
to get to room temperature.

00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:04.230
This is going to be the
base of what we're making.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.090
So we want it to be
nice, and smooth,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.977
and creamy before we add
any other ingredients.

00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:10.560
So I'm just going
to leave it in here.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.930
If you read a recipe that
says cream the butter that's

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.790
exactly what we're doing.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.980
I always recommend
using a mixer.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.630
If you don't have a stand
mixer use a hand mixer.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.880
It just makes your
life a lot easier.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.070
Then it will allow the flavors
to really come together,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.301
and make sure that the
butter and the sugars

00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:30.300
are creaming which are
incredibly important when

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.216
you're making cookies.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.830
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:43.200
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.741
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:46.740
So I've always--
like whenever I watch

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.210
the cooking shows
or the restaurant

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.650
shows one of the most
interesting things

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.180
is like the sourcing
of ingredients.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.880
Because the chefs get up at
like 5:00 AM and go to the--

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.090
well, that's even pretty late to
get up-- go to the fishmongers,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.567
buy these fish that you can't
ever buy as a home cook.

00:10:59.567 --> 00:11:01.650
And so what I'm wondering
is like even with things

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.560
like butter there's 1,000
different brands of butter.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.081
How do I, as a home chef-- or
how did you in your role source

00:11:09.081 --> 00:11:11.580
your ingredients and say, oh,
this is the best better for me

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.910
to use/ Not that other
brand of butter or whatever.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.785
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:18.690
So a lot of testing goes
into all of our recipes,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.930
and even from the beginning.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.840
So the type of butter that we
did use is an American butter.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.970
It's not a European butter.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.710
It depends on how much
fat content you want.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.090
Unfortunately, we're not going
to the farmer's market fresh

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.020
and getting the cultured
butter that's from the farmer.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.950
I wish we could.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.890
But butter, for me--

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:46.237
anytime that we can do local,
organic, we try our best.

00:11:46.237 --> 00:11:48.320
And then it was just a
matter of a lot of testing.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.861
So there's a ton of
different sugars,

00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:53.450
a ton of different flours
that you can add in baking--

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.050
vanillas, extracts,
all of that stuff.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.956
And I'll talk through
some of the importance

00:11:56.956 --> 00:11:58.830
of the other ingredients
as we go through it,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.240
and why we chose certain ones.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.200
But because our cookie dough
is edible and bakeable,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.900
it's a lot about the texture
of how things come together

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.090
when you're eating it raw
and when you're baking it.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.990
It's not just one or the other.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.230
And then also for us,
and any food business,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.020
perishability is
obviously something

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.950
that we need to think about.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.750
So making sure that our
ingredients are top quality,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.090
to make sure that they
will last for consumers

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.670
in the fridge, and in the
freezer, and all of the ways

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.480
that we recommend cooking
them or eating them.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.622
So we got the butter--
the best part.

00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:34.080
Next, we're going
to add the sugar.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.590
So this particular
recipe uses a combination

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.390
of white sugar,
which is granulated

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.280
sugar and brown sugar.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.230
For those of you who
don't know, brown sugar

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.750
is white sugar with
added molasses.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.330
More molasses you have
a darker sugar, so dark

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.610
brown sugar just
has more molasses.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.790
For this, we're going to
use light brown sugar.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.120
And it uses 75% brown sugar.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.080
So the brown sugar is
typically what people mostly

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.480
associate with eating
chocolate chip cookie dough.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.810
It's that molasses-ey
flavor that most people

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.050
love and is super nostalgic.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.450
So we really up the
amount of brown sugar

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.160
that we use in this recipe.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.040
We use 75% brown sugar
and 25% white sugar.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.520
The white sugar is going
to help things spread,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.920
and the brown sugar is going
to be an acid in this recipe.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.390
And it's going to
mix with a base

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.640
that we're going to add later.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.650
So cooking is a little
bit of chemistry,

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.630
or baking at least is a
little bit of chemistry.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.930
It's not as easy to just
dump a little bit of this

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.994
and a little bit of that, and
substitute here and there.

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:39.410
So what we're doing is just
creaming the butter and sugar.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.840
We want to just let this
go and get nice and smooth.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.490
We want it to be all one
color and all one texture.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.422
The sugar are these
little granules--

00:13:48.422 --> 00:13:49.880
and what you want
to do when you're

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.671
making cookie dough is
you want to envision

00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:54.900
just coating each one of
those little things of sugar

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.620
with butter Read
and just making sure

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.970
it's a nice smooth texture.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.330
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.050
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yes.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.799
AUDIENCE: Since you've
had so much success

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.500
from your first
store opening in 2017

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.690
do you have any
plans to franchise?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.420
KRISTEN TOMLAN: We get
thousands of requests

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.790
to franchise, especially since
we've opened, which is amazing,

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.600
because it just means that
so many other people relate

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.000
to this concept and can
see it being popular

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.090
in their city or their town.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.900
Right now we are so
busy, and my team

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.900
is so busy, that I don't want
to take a minute of our time

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.700
to figure out the franchising.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.180
I think we'll do a few more
company-owned stores before we

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.670
actually franchise it out.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.770
This is very much like my baby.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.790
And I have a very hard
time letting go of--

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.540
handing it over to somebody else
to just kind of run with it.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.030
And that would always be
my worry with franchising.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.630
But I will never say
never to anything.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.250
I'm always keeping options open.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.770
So I certainly
think that it could

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.481
be a possibility down the line.

00:15:01.481 --> 00:15:01.980
OK.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.750
So we got the butter and sugar.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.060
The next ingredients
that we're going to add

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.349
are liquid ingredients.

00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:09.640
And I want to talk about
these for a couple of reasons.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.940
One, going back to
your sourcing question.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.750
Our vanilla.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.790
We use a 100% vanilla--

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.110
pure vanilla extract.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.730
It comes from Madagascar.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.590
We have tested a ton
of vanilla-- some

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.810
from Mexico, some from Tahiti.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.140
And Madagascar, for us, is
really the best of the best.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.470
So I always
recommend when you're

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.850
baking, and for at-home chefs,
to go for the good vanilla.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.280
It will yield a
better smoother flavor

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.450
in whatever you're baking.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.340
And typically a
bottle of it at home

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.900
will go a long way
because you only

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.770
use a teaspoon or a
tablespoon here or there.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:50.310
So it is expensive, but
it is really worth it.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.620
We use even more
vanilla in this recipe

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.060
because we like
that flavor-- how

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.880
it mixes with the brown sugar.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.460
So that is why this
is-- liquid is brown.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.400
The other ingredient
in here is our egg.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.620
Most people assume that
because our cookie dough

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.370
is safe to eat--

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.786
I'm just going to
very slowly pour

00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:10.650
this in to avoid it
spraying up in my face

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.720
and giving me an egg facial.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.937
Good.

00:16:13.937 --> 00:16:15.270
The other ingredient is the egg.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.030
So most people assume
that our cookie dough

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.097
is safe to eat-- we
just eliminate the egg

00:16:20.097 --> 00:16:21.430
and therefore you're good to go.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.890
You can just eat
it from the bowl.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.999
That's actually not
the case at all.

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:26.790
There are other
ingredients in cookie dough

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.910
that I'll talk about in a
bit that can make you sick,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.060
besides just eating raw eggs.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.440
In the United States,
as many of you know,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.390
salmonella would be
the bacteria that you

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.970
could get from eating raw eggs.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.340
But our eggs are
completely safe to eat.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.200
They're good in
this cookie dough

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.150
and you could put
it in your smoothie

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.410
if you wanted more protein.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.000
It's been pasteurized.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.400
So that means it's been heated
to a specific temperature

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.820
to kill the bacteria, and
then cooled back down.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.200
And it retains its normal
properties of an egg.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.620
So if you were to stick
this in a hot saucepan

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.020
it would make scrambled
eggs, which people are always

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.610
surprised about.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.010
But in cookie dough we don't
want to make scrambled eggs.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.349
We want it to be used
as a binding agent.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.490
So it's going to keep
everything together.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.150
It's also going to add some
extra flavor that you otherwise

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.470
would miss.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.910
When I was recipe testing I
tried every egg substitute out

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.630
there.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.680
And every single time
it never stood up

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.440
to the real egg, the real deal.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.860
So I decided to scrap
all of those substitutes

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.760
and find an egg that was
completely safe to eat.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.050
So that is our egg.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.150
That's the liquid ingredients
which we just added.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.070
And now we want to
just whip it until it's

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.810
really light and
fluffy to make sure

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.020
that all gets incorporated.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.650
This mixer is great.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.750
I'm not having to scrape it
down at all because the bowl is

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.440
really high.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.940
But sometimes when
you're baking you

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.250
might have to stop,
scrape things down, just

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.886
to get it all incorporated.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.250
So when I originally started the
business, I was-- like I said,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.980
I was working full-time.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.520
And I think that--

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.490
I think I was nervous because no
one else had really done this.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.200
We get so many people now that
are like, oh, why didn't I

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.783
think of this?

00:18:18.783 --> 00:18:19.910
This is such a great idea.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.850
Like, you know, everybody's
been eating cookie dough.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.860
But when I first
started the business

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.190
I didn't know, honestly, if
it was really going to work.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.169
I thought maybe somebody--
this hasn't been done before

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:32.210
because it can't be done.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.793
Maybe people won't
respond to it well.

00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:35.900
Maybe there is this
stigma that even

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.400
if with-- through
education people

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.560
won't be able to get
over the egg thing,

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.620
or the worry of getting sick.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.590
It's just a completely different
model from an ice cream

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.180
store or a traditional bakery.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.450
So it was difficult as I was
working on this business plan

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.600
to try and figure out
how it would work,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.736
and what would be popular,
and what wouldn't be popular.

00:18:58.736 --> 00:19:00.740
So that's why I decided
to start it online

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.210
and just take baby
steps-- kind of

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.100
get my feet wet
with the production,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.470
and understanding what
the market looks like.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.010
And luckily, the market
was amazing almost

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.820
from the beginning.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.260
I think with the
power of social media,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.360
and people sharing
what they're doing,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.560
especially this like
foodie culture in New York,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.150
it really worked
to our advantage.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:26.930
And it's been a really
crazy ride, but really fun.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.430
Next ingredients
we're going to add.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.150
So it's a small amount of
questionable white powder.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.430
It's all legal substances.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.470
The first thing is really
easy to understand.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.880
It is our sea salt.
So we use sea salt.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.020
It's a less refined
salt so it has

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.830
a little bit of mineralities
in it which we like.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.370
And Additionally, it is
going to be baking soda.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.250
So baking soda is the base
in this specific recipe.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.350
It's going to mix
with the acid that

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.640
is the molasses and
the brown sugar.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.490
It's going to create
carbon dioxide.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.730
Without boring you, it will help
your cookies rise in the oven.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.040
If you put too much baking
soda in your cookie dough

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.270
it's going to taste
like a bar of soap,

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.867
or like baking soda
toothpaste, which is the worst.

00:20:09.867 --> 00:20:12.200
So you have to really balance
how much you're putting in

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.783
to make sure that it's reacting,
and make sure you don't taste

00:20:14.783 --> 00:20:16.730
it in the actual cookie dough.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.470
And then the third ingredient.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.210
One of our secrets is a
little bit of cornstarch.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.040
So cornstarch is going to be
also used as a binding agent

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.050
and as a leavener.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.250
So we like our cookies when they
bake to be extra super soft.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.610
I'm not a thin crunchy
cookie kind of gal,

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.220
and you won't find thin
crunchy cookies at DO.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.060
You will find nice and thick,
kind of crispy on the outside

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.372
with that golden brown
outside, and nice,

00:20:44.372 --> 00:20:45.830
and gooey, and
chewy on the inside.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.780
And that cornstarch
in the cookie dough

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.600
will allow you to get that
soft-baked cookie texture.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.210
So I'm going to just
add these in now.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.390
You can whisk it
together with your flour,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.250
but I'm going to
just do it first just

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.779
to make sure it's really well
incorporated in the dough.

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:03.320
Because it is a
small amount of stuff

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.403
you just want to make sure
it's evenly distributed

00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:07.010
so that those
reactions can happen,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.277
and all of those flavors
are really coming together.

00:21:09.277 --> 00:21:10.610
AUDIENCE: So I'm really curious.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.500
You're sort of targeting
both, you know,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.210
making them delicious
when they're baked,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.980
and making them delicious
as cookie dough.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.570
And are there trade-offs
here, where you could maybe

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.390
make more delicious cookie dough
by not making them as good when

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.624
they're baked or vise versa?

00:21:22.624 --> 00:21:25.040
KRISTEN TOMLAN: So when I was
experimenting-- or actually,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.700
when I was--

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.890
before I even came
up with the idea

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.600
there were specific
recipes that we would

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.900
make at home with my mom that
were really good as cookie

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.200
dough, and not as good as
cookies, or vise versa--

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.540
really good as cookies and
not as good as cookie dough.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.540
But my dad wanted
the good stuff.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.240
And we always baked it
and we always kept it raw.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.380
And so we found a recipe that
was the perfect mix of both.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.090
And so that is
kind of the recipe

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.660
that we went off of
for the development.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.970
I think that there
could be ways depending

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.220
on how rich you want it or the
consistency that you want it.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.680
But for me, what
was important is

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.040
to really give people a full-on
cookie dough experience.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.820
So a lot of people when they
eat our dough with a spoon

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.570
they're surprised.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.580
Like, oh, this tastes
just like cookie dough.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.676
And I'm like, yeah,
it is cookie dough.

00:22:16.676 --> 00:22:18.630
It's exactly what it is.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.100
It's much more rich
than an ice cream.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.270
It's more dense.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.820
So if you were to stick any of
our cookie dough in the oven

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.690
it would bake.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.490
So I always tell
people if you save it

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.800
for later if you can't
finish it it will last

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.060
in the fridge or the freezer.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.520
You can always take
it home and bake it.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.650
Or mix it with ice cream.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.330
That way you don't have to--

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.060
I was always the one picking
around the ice cream,

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.430
and just eating the cookie
dough out, and then leaving

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.260
the rest for my
husband to basically

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.730
have a pint of vanilla ice
cream, which no one actually

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.660
wants.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.410
Next ingredient.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.150
So I'm going to talk
about the flour.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:01.010
So as most people know, eating
raw eggs could be harmful.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.300
There could be salmonella.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.920
Don't eat cookie dough.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.920
We've heard all of that.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.370
What a lot of people don't know
is that raw flour could also

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.020
harbor bacteria.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.470
So if you think
about it, flour is

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.330
a raw agricultural ingredient.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.600
So it's grown in
the field somewhere,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.550
and there's really
not a ton of control

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.410
over what birds fly over, or
what critters may or may not

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.520
crawl in.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.770
And typically during
the milling process--

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.430
when you harvest the wheat
and you make it into flour--

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.410
there isn't a step
in that process which

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.620
kills any potentially harmful
bacteria that those critters

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.710
could have left behind, which
is gross to think about.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.830
It then goes to you, sits on
your counter for six months.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.190
That bacteria
continues to harbor.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.660
But as soon as you
cook it-- you bake it,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.720
you fry it, you
heat it in a pan.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.550
Whatever you're doing
that's the kill step

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.980
that kills that potentially
harmful bacteria.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.680
So you don't even know if
your flour had bacteria

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.930
or not because you heated it.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.610
But with the rise
of people eating

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.310
cookie dough, and brownie
batter, and cake batter,

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.200
more people are
licking the spoon.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.140
And the bacteria is
not from the egg.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.850
It comes from the flour.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.890
So that obviously poses a
risk for people at home.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.910
So we did such an extensive
amount of research

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.570
we actually were one
of the first people

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.380
to bring this to
the New York market.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.420
So some of the large cookie
dough and other manufacturers

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.970
were using heat-treated flour
when I started this business

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:38.120
in 2014, but it was nearly
impossible to get as a small

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.930
producer that
might-- our minimum--

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.810
we didn't have room to have
pallets and pallets of this,

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.910
let alone go through it all.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.070
So that was one of
the biggest challenges

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.940
as I was starting the business--
is finding a distributor

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.330
to carry the product, bring
it in specifically for us

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.640
so that we could make our
cookie dough safe to eat.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.450
So the flour that we're using
is a heat-treated flour.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.730
It's been through the process,
like the pasteurization

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.820
process, to make sure
that all of that bacteria

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.030
no longer exists.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.250
It's tested like the egg is
tested before it comes to us.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.750
And then, again, it's
just like a normal flour.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.510
So you can use it
in your cookie dough

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.330
and you don't have to
worry about getting sick.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.670
The other unique thing
about this specific flour

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:25.260
is that we make our
own blend of AP flour.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.640
So there are a ton of
different flours out there.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.050
Two basic ones mostly
boils down to a hard flour

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.916
and a soft flour.

00:25:34.916 --> 00:25:36.540
And the difference
between those flours

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.623
are about where they're
grown, when they're grown,

00:25:38.623 --> 00:25:39.750
and when they're harvested.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.660
And how much gluten
is in those flours.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.720
So all-purpose flour
is a mix of both.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.910
Soft flour is also
known as cake flour

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.280
and is really great
for anything that you

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.600
want to be light and fluffy.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.280
Like French pastries or cake.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.400
The other kind, hard flour,
has a higher gluten content

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.430
and is great for
breads and pizza dough.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.680
It's going to give you that
stretchiness that everyone

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.020
loves to kind of bite into.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.850
And for cookies you just want
to use a mix of both of those.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.570
So that your cookies aren't
too dainty and crumbly,

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.190
and you also--

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.250
they're not too
tough or stretchy.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.070
So we mix our own
proprietary blend

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.530
of all-purpose flour in house.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.550
It was a process that
we tested extensively

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.300
to have the exact texture that
we want for the cookie dough

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.302
and for the cookies.

00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:33.510
So that is what we have here.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.030
It is our blend of AP flour.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.920
It's heat-treated.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.370
And I'm just going to add
this in little by little.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.920
You don't really notice any
sort of taste difference

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.900
in the heat-treated.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.290
You might notice
if you smell it.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.135
A little bit of
a toasted flavor,

00:26:51.135 --> 00:26:53.010
because that's essentially
what they're doing

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.440
when they're heat treating it.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.750
But when it's mixed with
all of the other ingredients

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.420
and cookie dough you would
never notice any difference

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.900
whatsoever.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.540
So add this little by little.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.740
This is the final step.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.630
The recipe that we're
making technically

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.690
is in the category of cookies
called a drop cookie recipe.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.344
And a drop cookie
recipe is a recipe

00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:18.260
that most people make
at home, and most people

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.110
are used to eating.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.970
Or sneaking from the bowl.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.660
It's the kind of cookie that you
drop on a sheet and then bake.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.372
You don't have to roll it out.

00:27:28.372 --> 00:27:29.580
You don't have to cut it out.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.496
You don't have to do all
of these other things

00:27:31.496 --> 00:27:32.640
that some other cookies--

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.270
pipe or anything else.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.760
And drop cookie recipes
are great because they're

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.740
pretty easy to go
together once you

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.130
have all of the ingredients
measured out, which

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.270
is half the battle.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.500
You just throw it in the
mixer like this, similar to--

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.060
you always start with the fat.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.280
In our case, butter.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.530
Then you do sugars,
liquid ingredients,

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.770
and then dry ingredients.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.320
And the good thing is that
it all comes together,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.780
and you really--
it's hard to mess up

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.380
if you've measured correctly.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.160
The only thing you
can do is over mix it.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.020
So once it's like
good you can just

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.880
keep going along
with the process.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.620
And especially once
you add the flour in,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.690
because the flour
adds the gluten.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.120
Once it's mixed you
can just be done,

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.540
and you don't have to let it
keep going forever and ever

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.640
like you would potentially
with a meringue,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.440
or with whipped
cream or something.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.690
You don't need to
add any extra air

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.280
because we want our cookies to
be nice, and dense, and fudgy.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.770
And the more you mix it the
more it activates that gluten,

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.694
and your cookies can get tough.

00:28:36.694 --> 00:28:38.610
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Did you
have another question?

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.430
KRISTEN TOMLAN: What's
your name, by the way?

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.320
AUDIENCE: My name is James.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.153
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Hey.

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:42.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.657
So you've came in
with the recipes

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.240
from when you were
growing up and also

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.710
through developing
them as you started

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.090
thinking about the business.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.548
And you had the
marketing knowledge

00:28:52.548 --> 00:28:54.080
from your previous work.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.240
But one of the things
I've always heard

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.750
is that one of the hardest parts
about building a restaurant

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.050
is the actual business--

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.560
the accounting.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.640
Are we actually making
a profit right now?

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.962
How do we control costs, and
get the right number of workers,

00:29:09.962 --> 00:29:10.920
and so on and so forth.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.420
So where-- you just picked
that up as you've gone along?

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.800
Or did you have some previous
experience in running business?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.880
KRISTEN TOMLAN: No previous
business experience.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.420
Luckily, my husband did
go to a business school,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.150
not that business school teaches
you how to run a business.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.550
He always says-- he's like,
this taught me nothing.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:36.620
But it is helpful to kind
of have a sidekick in that

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.004
has at least been to school.

00:29:40.004 --> 00:29:41.420
Not that I didn't
graduate college

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.780
and all of these things.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.740
But to be honest,
for me, it was a lot

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.870
of just figuring out as I go.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.200
I always tell people,
especially new entrepreneurs,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200
there's never a point that
you feel prepared or feel

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.420
ready to start any
sort of business.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.580
Like you're never going to
have it all figured out.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.220
So just do something to move
forward and you will learn.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.160
If you are smart, if you
are a hard worker, if you

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.760
have a network of people that
you can ask-- and honestly,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.910
google.com is like your
best friend, literally.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.980
There's so many resources out
there to find information.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.310
And for me, it was
incredibly helpful to start

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.150
with baby steps.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.520
So starting online
first, figuring that out,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.580
learning-- hiring a
few people and learning

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.140
how to manage that.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.070
And manage production,
and ordering, and online

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.920
before I even opened the store.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.330
And that's part
of the reason why

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:43.220
I launched online-- was because
the thought of opening up

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.980
a restaurant in New York City
without any business experience

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.410
or operation experience
was incredibly daunting.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:53.330
And I was looking
at-- the investment

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.290
was going to be insane.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.170
And I didn't want to be one of
those businesses that opened,

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.060
and then--

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.380
or restaurants that
you see all the time--

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.230
that it's a great location,
it's a great idea,

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.570
maybe the execution
is even pretty good.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.351
But it just-- six
months later the doors

00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:09.350
are closed because they
just can't make it work.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.220
It's incredibly difficult.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.340
But I did use the experience.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.170
I launched in 2014 and
then didn't open the store

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.380
until 2017.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.580
But even then, when we
first opened the store

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.690
I had no idea about
the popularity,

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.100
or like really an expectation.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.460
I thought it was
going to be popular.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.870
Like I told my old boss--

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.870
I was like, maybe this could be
the next big thing in desserts.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.110
Like cupcakes have
kind of come and gone.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.160
When I was working on this
idea in 2012 it was like--

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.230
so I was like maybe this
could be the next thing.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:50.630
And I didn't know--

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.960
the story is I had five
full-time people when

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.550
I moved to the new store.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.280
And they all were
working in the kitchen.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.550
And one other like
assistant who did

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.160
a little bit of
everything-- business,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.794
and kitchen, and everything.

00:32:04.794 --> 00:32:06.460
And then when I opened
up the store-- so

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.980
we basically were
moving our kitchen.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.980
And then we had this new
front of house element.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:17.410
And so I thought, OK, I'll
hire five more people to help--

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.400
just work as hourly
employees in the front.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.340
And then all of us-- the people
in the back, and me included--

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.442
can pop in and out, and work
up front, and just make sure

00:32:27.442 --> 00:32:28.900
that everything's
running smoothly.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.120
Like I'm fine checking
people out or doing

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.890
whatever we need to do.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.140
My husband was like, you
can't afford five people.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.280
You can only hire four.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.160
So I'm like, fine.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.660
OK.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.910
I hire four people.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.170
And even then, we spent
essentially all of the money

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.180
that we had made in
the first two years

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.790
on this new lease, new
build-out, new equipment,

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.052
new everything.

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:52.510
Because for me, I
was like I'm just

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.920
going to go big or go home.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.810
Like I didn't want
to keep doing what

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.050
I was doing with just
the online orders,

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.810
and like this really
small business.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.480
I really wanted to see where it
was going to go and just kind

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.394
of give it my all.

00:33:05.394 --> 00:33:06.560
AUDIENCE: Sounds terrifying.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.434
KRISTEN TOMLAN: It was
incredibly terrifying.

00:33:08.434 --> 00:33:09.860
Yeah.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.900
And so we hired
these four people.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.880
And when we opened there
was a line down the block.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.190
And I was like, how
do these people--

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.210
like what's going on?

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.960
You know?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.960
And then I just thought--

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.646
I think there was a news
article in "New York "Magazine."

00:33:26.646 --> 00:33:29.270
So I was like oh, they probably
learned about it through there.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.250
And then as soon as
these people come and go

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.950
it'll be like quiet--
which it was, for

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.900
like a small amount of time.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.480
People like trickled in all
day when we first opened.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.070
We opened on a Wednesday?

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.520
Wednesday.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.649
I don't even-- geez.

00:33:44.649 --> 00:33:46.190
That whole time is
like a blur to me.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.074
I don't think I
slept for months.

00:33:49.074 --> 00:33:50.240
So we opened on a Wednesday.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.930
And then my family came to
visit that first weekend

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.830
to kind of celebrate
the opening.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.800
And in my mom's
typical fashion she

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.150
had theater tickets, and dinners
planned, and all this stuff.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.510
And on Thursday we opened up
and the store was like slammed.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.310
Wednesday we ran out
of a ton of stuff.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.409
We were staying up all
night trying to remake

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.737
it to open on Thursday.

00:34:11.737 --> 00:34:13.070
And I called my mom on Thursday.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.810
I was like, cancel
all your plans.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.860
Like I need you guys to
help work in the store.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.920
Like I don't know what's
happening, but like--

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.830
I just need help.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.260
And my family is--

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.800
they're all bakers, and cooks,
and good Midwestern folk.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.800
Like they'll roll their sleeves
up and get their hands dirty

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.120
any time.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.900
So they came on I
think Thursday night.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.650
And immediately I
put them to work.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.800
And so it was the four
employees that I hired,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.280
my dad, my brother, my
brother-in-law, my two sisters,

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.260
my mom.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.254
And we all took turns.

00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:49.670
Like part of us
were in the front.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.628
Part of us in the back.

00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:52.670
We were just making
cookie dough.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.080
My brother-in-law did
dishes for eight hours

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.719
straight-- the poor guy.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.670
Love you, James.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.930
And my parents-- my dad
scooped cookie dough.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.180
They had like carpal tunnel
by the end of the weekend.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.800
And they're like, we
have got to get out.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.460
And that was the weekend that
there were four-hour lines down

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.320
the block and around the corner.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.270
And we didn't know
what was going on.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.080
And that was just
the very beginning.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.652
We ran out of all
of our ingredients--

00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:21.860
like all of our cookie dough.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.810
Anything that was
edible was gone.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.370
And anything that was--

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.490
we just ran out of
every single thing.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.270
We had no flour.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.520
And our flour-- you can't
just go to the grocery store

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.230
and get our flour or our eggs.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.340
So we had to wait.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.260
This was the weekend.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.160
So we couldn't put an
order in until Monday,

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.950
so we had to wait until
Tuesday to get everything.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.910
So-- I'm going to start on the
next one while I'm talking.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.810
So it was kind of-- to
be honest-- a shit show.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.810
But I learned a lot in
those first few weeks.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.590
And then we closed the store
because we didn't have anything

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.650
to sell for the first couple--

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.510
for a Sunday and a Monday.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:03.120
And I put up as
many ads as I could.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.889
And then just-- people would
walk in and I'll be like, OK.

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:08.930
Do you like cookie dough?

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:09.800
Do you know anything
about cookie dough?

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.300
OK.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.630
You can speak clearly.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.430
Great.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.900
Are you available?

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.400
Great.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.660
You have availability.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.860
Can you scoop cookie dough?

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.070
OK.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.700
Show me that you
can use your hands.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.380
You're hired.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.940
Like that was
basically the process

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:27.990
in the beginning, which worked
for a time, and was great.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.420
But obviously, we have
such a great staff

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.550
now that we're like
settled and established.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:41.540
But that team of 10 I guess,
or nine, went immediately to--

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.150
within the first
four weeks after

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.790
we opened-- to about 60 people.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.640
We started running
multiple shifts.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.530
We were basically in
the kitchen from 5 AM

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.780
until midnight or 1:00 AM.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.490
And then we were cleaning
from two to four.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.710
And then the team would
come back at five.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.800
And it was just like around
the clock and really--

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.140
it was a struggle
for many, many weeks

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.150
until we were able
to get our facility

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.940
in the Bronx open and running.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.870
Because not only did we
not have enough people,

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:19.160
we didn't have enough space.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.554
Like we didn't have
enough refrigeration.

00:37:21.554 --> 00:37:22.970
We didn't have
enough of anything.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.462
So we had to kind
of move off site

00:37:24.462 --> 00:37:26.420
and immediately start
looking at other options.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.650
What I'm making now
is our brownie batter.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.980
So what I just put in
was melted chocolate--

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.980
semi-sweet chocolate and butter.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.480
That's going to be
the base of this.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.410
So this one is super fudgy.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.980
Really like a chocolate
lover's dream.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.140
And I'm just mixing it
with the brown sugar again

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.950
and the white sugar.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.550
So this is going to be the base
of that brookie, and then also,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.310
obviously, the brownie
part of the recipe.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.530
This one is dangerous,
because this

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:02.980
is a recipe that I can sit
and eat like so much of.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.150
And suddenly I'm
like, what happened?

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.660
Who ate it?

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.350
Where did it go?

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.810
You'll like scrape the bottom
of the container, especially

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.300
when it's nice and warm.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.970
And it disappears in an instant.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.370
So I guess my love
for unbaked things

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.390
goes far beyond
just cookie dough.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.210
I also love brownie batter.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.290
I love cake batter.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.020
Anything that is
not fully baked,

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:33.010
kind of gooey in the
middle, is like my jam.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.510
Actually, when I
was babysitting--

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.010
I used to do a
ton of babysitting

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.930
when I was growing up.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:43.810
And this family I babysat down
the street they had five kids.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.150
And it was like
madness at all times.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.820
I usually have one of
my siblings with me.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:55.690
And the one way to occupy their
attention was to make brownies.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.610
So I would get two boxes of
brownies, sit the kids down,

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.000
we would have a mix.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.770
One box would not
have the egg in it.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.620
At this point this was so long
ago no one really kind of knew

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.080
about the flour thing.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.507
And I would make one
box without the egg,

00:39:11.507 --> 00:39:13.090
and just put it in
bowls, and the kids

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.370
would eat the bowls
of brownie batter.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:18.370
And then the other box I would
actually make into brownies, so

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.920
that when the mom came home
there was like something

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.470
nice and fresh-baked.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.149
And also just a--

00:39:25.149 --> 00:39:27.190
even though sugar probably
wasn't the right thing

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:32.440
to give a bunch of rambunctious
kids, it was just our routine.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.300
Every Saturday or
whenever I would

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.330
babysit we would make two
boxes of brownies and--

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.460
so this recipe, even though
it's a cookie recipe,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.320
it is very much like the
brownie texture and flavor.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.470
It's super fudgy with
that melted chocolate.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.580
Other ingredients are
going to be cocoa powder.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.790
And then those leaveners again.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:58.667
And the sea salt. So this is
all gonna go in the mixer.

00:39:58.667 --> 00:39:59.833
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:00.330
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.460
AUDIENCE: It seems like you've
kind of built a cookie dough

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.170
market in New York that
didn't exist before,

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.170
which is really awesome.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.150
But now that you proved
the concepts, other--

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.524
I noticed a competitor down
the street kind of sprung up.

00:40:09.524 --> 00:40:11.622
So has that changed
your business at all?

00:40:11.622 --> 00:40:12.830
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Honestly, no.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:16.520
It hasn't really
changed the business.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.680
Obviously, we were the first of
our kind to make this concept

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.430
and show that it could really
work, especially in New York.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.310
And for us, we've been so
laser focused, and so busy

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.560
on growing the
business, and continuing

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.080
to expand in a number
of different ways,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:38.930
that I don't have time to really
pay attention to competitors.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.390
Of course I'm aware
that they exist.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.256
And for me, I think
that this concept,

00:40:43.256 --> 00:40:44.630
like I said, how
it could be kind

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.640
of the next big
thing in desserts,

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.030
I think that there's a lot
of the pie to go around.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.790
And because we have this
presence in New York, which

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.730
is amazing, I'm encouraging
other people and other cookie

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:59.100
dough lovers to obviously
follow their passions.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.570
And if they think that their
town could use a cookie dough

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.180
shop that only works better
for me, as I continue

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.332
to expand and more people learn
about this cookie dough trend.

00:41:09.332 --> 00:41:10.790
And people always
ask like, oh, are

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.640
you worried about the people
here, the people there,

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.220
or these people are
ripping you off,

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.500
or like they're
taking your this.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.105
I don't really have time to--

00:41:20.105 --> 00:41:21.230
like what am I going to do?

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.020
Copy the people
who are copying me?

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.490
Like a shittier
version of myself?

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.550
Like that is a terrible idea.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.831
Who has time for that?

00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:30.330
So yeah.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.610
We're continuing to expand.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.482
We are serving more
people than ever.

00:41:34.482 --> 00:41:36.440
I don't know if you guys
ever go to Mets games.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.814
We have a couple of stands at
Citi Field which are really

00:41:38.814 --> 00:41:41.782
fun, so you can get some
cookie dough at the ballpark.

00:41:41.782 --> 00:41:44.240
We're also doing a number of
different pop-ups this summer.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.460
So we've got our
Camp Cookie Dough,

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.270
which is at Chefs
Club Counter in Soho.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.630
It is a summer camp-themed
cookie dough store.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:42:01.280
So when we had this opportunity
to do something for the summer

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.621
there we thought, obviously
cookie dough is nostalgic

00:42:04.621 --> 00:42:06.620
and it brings everybody
back to their childhood,

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.286
and that's why I think
people are like--

00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:11.450
have this emotional connection
to what they're eating.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.820
People also have the same
nostalgia, especially

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.740
in New York, for summer camp.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.490
So we thought, why don't we just
kind of blow this concept up

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.950
and have all of the
desserts centered

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.360
around childhood favorites.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.280
All of them, of course,
include cookie dough.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.070
But all of them also include
soft-serve ice cream.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.355
And it's a really
fun experience.

00:42:30.355 --> 00:42:33.440
We have a pop-up in
Montauk for the summer--

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.020
if anybody is out east--

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.740
Washington, DC, and Chicago.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.400
All the summer.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.940
So all sorts of
fun stuff going on.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.800
And we just launched--

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.830
ta-da-- our new baking kits.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.260
So they're actually
coming out in August,

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.440
but we just debuted them at
Fancy Food the other week.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.200
And the three
flavors for that are

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.270
going to be chocolate
chip brownie batter, which

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.478
are the two I'm making today.

00:42:59.478 --> 00:43:00.670
And then sugar cookie.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.240
And that mix-- it comes
in a box like this.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.790
You just add two ingredients,
and then everything else

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.175
is ready to go.

00:43:08.175 --> 00:43:09.550
The nice thing
about this product

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.760
is that it's shelf stable, if I
were to ever start another food

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.100
business.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:19.270
Perishability is so-- and
refrigeration and freezing

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.400
is obviously
incredibly difficult.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.760
So this is nice because
it has a long shelf life,

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.630
it can go in grocery stores
across the United States.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.880
Obviously it has our
name all over it,

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.990
and is a natural kind
of brand extension.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.960
In addition, we continue to
shop online all over the United

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.240
States.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.530
And we have a pretty
robust catering and event

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:52.240
business in New York
that we ship nationwide.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.955
And then we also go to offices
and do little cookie dough

00:43:55.955 --> 00:43:56.455
bars.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.150
And then at our store--

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.900
one of the most fun
things about my job

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.970
is just like interacting
with customers,

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.865
and teaching people
all the things

00:44:08.865 --> 00:44:10.240
that I've learned
over the years.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.940
So we just started this
baking school program.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.140
It's called The Cookie Academy.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.140
And you can take cookie
dough making and baking

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.770
classes in our store.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.750
So I think we're almost good.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.540
What I'm going to do here
is just turn on this--

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.760
if I can get it.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.690
OK.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.940
So all I'm going to
make here is the ganache

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.265
to top this brookie.

00:44:36.265 --> 00:44:39.290
So what we've got is we've
got our brownie batter, which

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.030
is nice and gooey.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.980
Tastes exactly like
brownie batter.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.920
And we've got our chocolate
chip cookie dough.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.057
So in order to make the
brookie, what we would do--

00:44:49.057 --> 00:44:51.140
which we're not going to
do right this second-- is

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.900
we would take this, we would
press it down in a pan,

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.140
and we would bake it so the
bottom is a full-on brownie.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.350
Then we would add a layer of
chocolate chip on top of that

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.550
once it's cooled.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.080
And then stick that
back in the oven

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:07.160
until it gets nice and gooey,
and it's not fully baked.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.532
And then it gets topped off
with the chocolate ganache.

00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:11.240
So we're going to do
the ganache element.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.470
Ganache sounds fancy.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:13.180
It's not.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.810
It's very easy.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.850
But it's really also
super delicious.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.470
So all you're going
to do is you're

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.720
going to heat up heavy cream.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.570
If you can do it
in the microwave

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:27.767
it makes it even easier.

00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:30.100
And then you're just going
to pour it over the chocolate

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:35.000
chips and let it set, and
then we'll whisk it together.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.120
But to make the actual
brookie flavor what

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.710
we do-- since we
scoop the cookie

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.740
dough out of what looks
like gelato containers--

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.724
we would add dollops of both
of these different flavors

00:45:45.724 --> 00:45:47.890
in the same container and
then kind of swirl around.

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.723
So if you guys can tell
from the little jars

00:45:49.723 --> 00:45:52.630
we have in front of
you, that we like

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.570
being able to see the
chocolate chip cookie

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.320
dough and the brownie
batter cookie dough.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.330
So it's not like a full mix.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.950
It's really like
a swirl technique.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.280
So what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to fold in--

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.696
I'll do it in here
because it will

00:46:04.696 --> 00:46:07.480
be a little bit easier to see.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.390
I'm going to just take
some of this brownie batter

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:14.780
and just add a few
dollops in here.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.840
And then we'll just
swirl it around,

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.015
and we'll have some
fresh cookie dough.

00:46:21.015 --> 00:46:22.640
SPEAKER: When you do
the little cups do

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.115
you do equal parts
chocolate chip and brownie?

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:25.990
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.030
We do.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.591
Those cups are-- everything is
filled by hand so they might

00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:33.590
have-- some of them might
have a little bit more

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.881
of one or the other, but we
try to do it really evenly.

00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:38.380
And I only stirred it
one or two times and you

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.180
get this nice ribbon technique.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.340
And we would leave
it just like this.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.700
If we were going to bake this
into cookies all I would do

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.340
is refrigerate this cookie
dough, put Saran wrap over it,

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.950
stick it in the fridge
for as long as I

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.300
can-- at least 24 hours.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.716
And then I would
just scoop it out

00:46:53.716 --> 00:46:57.010
with a cookie scoop
right on a sheet tray,

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:00.010
and 350 in the oven
for about 10 minutes.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.604
They make really
delicious cookies.

00:47:02.604 --> 00:47:03.520
So that's what we got.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.110
We got our brookie dough.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.530
And then let's see how we're
doing with this heavy cream.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:08.030
OK.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:12.000
I'm just going to get this to
a boil and then turn it down.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.719
You guys have any
questions in the meantime?

00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:15.927
Anything else I didn't cover?

00:47:21.159 --> 00:47:21.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.990
In this sort of
health-crazed market

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.740
how do you sort of
combat that, or help

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:31.516
people to limit the amount, if
that's something you are doing?

00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:32.390
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:36.860
So obviously-- I get
that question a lot.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.980
Like everyone's like, oh,
it's not just gluten-free,

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.930
or vegan this, and
trying to be healthy.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.030
People are just
trying to eliminate

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.360
fats, and sugars, and all
those things from their diet.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.150
Certainly, we have gluten-free
flavors, and vegan flavors,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.760
and all of that, which
are equally as delicious.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.680
But I also think that
there's a moment in life

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.340
to treat yourself, and to
have a little bit of fun,

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.770
and indulge in something
that makes you happy.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.260
So you all work very hard.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.280
I work very hard.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.150
Everybody has--
there's a lot of stuff

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.720
going on in the world
that is not pleasant.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.369
And so if there's a
moment that you can just

00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:16.160
put a smile on your
face and treat yourself

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.494
to whatever makes you happy--
maybe that's a yoga class,

00:48:18.494 --> 00:48:20.160
maybe that's a spoonful
of cookie dough,

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.790
maybe it's an ice cream cone,
maybe it's none of those things

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.827
and it's like your
own personal choice.

00:48:24.827 --> 00:48:25.910
That's what I'm all about.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:28.160
It's like just making
sure that we're

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.170
putting a smile on
your face, and allowing

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:32.660
you to indulge in something
that you really love.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.330
So even with all the health
craze-- like trust me,

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:39.750
I have to go to SoulCycle
way too often because I

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.279
eat cookie dough all day.

00:48:42.279 --> 00:48:44.070
But I do think that
there is a moment where

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:48.760
you deserve a little treat
and something to smile.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.987
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for sharing your story.

00:48:50.987 --> 00:48:52.320
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah, of course.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.736
AUDIENCE: When was that tipping
point or that moment where

00:48:54.736 --> 00:48:56.930
you're like, I need to
make this my full-time job

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:00.500
and it's really time to
leave your brand background?

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.650
KRISTEN TOMLAN: So I--

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.010
so this is just really
coming to a slow boil.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.850
And as soon as you see those
bubbles you can take it off.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.716
And all I'm going to do is
pour it over this chocolate

00:49:10.716 --> 00:49:12.090
and just let it
sit for a second.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.130
So I was working full-time.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.210
I was living the
consultant life, which

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:24.220
was just a difficult life
because you're traveling,

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:27.080
you're on the site with
the client, et cetera.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.870
And so when I
started this business

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.430
my boss knew I was starting it.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:36.130
And so once things were kind
of taking off I went to him

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.470
and I was like, Randall--

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:40.120
I was like, I don't
know what the--

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.480
is going on but I
just feel like I

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.590
need to dedicate more
time to this business,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.520
and like trying
to figure it out.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.500
And I don't know at what point
people like quit their jobs

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.000
or don't.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.310
But like-- I don't know
that I want to quit my job.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.250
It was very conflicting for me.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:01.390
And so he was so nice,
and so encouraging.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:05.170
And so originally I went down
to working two days a week,

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.780
and had a really
flexible schedule,

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.010
which helped me dedicate
more time to the business.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:14.890
And I also was only on a
one final client commitment.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.670
And as that started wrapping
up still even working

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.930
two days a week was too much.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:24.080
And I found myself just really
wanting to work on the business

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.680
and it taking up
every hour of my day.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.330
And my poor husband
hadn't slept either.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.460
So I just went back and
I was like, look, as much

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.080
as I love my job,
and as much as this

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.700
has been such an
amazing experience--

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.530
I'd been there for five years--

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.800
I feel like now is the
time to kind of take a step

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.030
and see where this goes.

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.090
And I have never
looked back since then.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.420
But it wasn't easy.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:50.630
It was difficult.
Very difficult.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:54.713
That was about six weeks after
I had launched online so--

00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:56.186
SPEAKER: Let me join you again.

00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:57.061
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:50:57.061 --> 00:50:59.623
SPEAKER: I'll be wrapping up
and ask you a few questions.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.078
What about the people who
were kind of sceptics,

00:51:02.078 --> 00:51:05.520
and think this is a fad, and
how do you keep it relevant?

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.130
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yes.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.630
OK.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.820
So I always tell
people I obviously

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.110
did not invent cookie dough.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.380
So cookie dough has been around
for a very, very long time.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:20.330
And cookies, in general,
are such an American dessert

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.270
that people have
grown up with for--

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.790
since the 1800s, was like
when the chocolate chip

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.550
cookie really came to be.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:33.126
And so I'm not pretending like
I'm creating something new.

00:51:33.126 --> 00:51:35.750
But what I think I'm doing-- oh,
I'm making a huge mess is what

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:36.940
I'm doing--

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:43.360
is kind of reinventing it, and
making it new and different.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.710
And serving it in a different
way, obviously, which I think

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.980
has a lot of legs because
the nostalgia factor.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.610
So it's rare that
you find something

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.800
that so many people can
relate to on this like

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.870
emotional level
because it reminds them

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.400
of their mom, or
their grandmother,

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.170
and nostalgia goes a long way.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.220
But I also recognize
that fads come and go,

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.840
and desserts come and go.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.630
And so I think it's continuing
to listen to our customers,

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:14.240
and continuing to
innovate, and find

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.070
new ways to expand the brand.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.260
So I'm not really concerned.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.350
I don't think cookies are
going away anytime soon.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:23.058
I don't think cookie
dough is going away.

00:52:23.058 --> 00:52:24.890
So I think as long
as we're continuing

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:28.070
to stay relevant, and
be new and different,

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:32.990
and innovate the experience,
I think that cookie dough can

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.400
go a long way.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.453
SPEAKER: Well, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.610
It has been so great
to have you here.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.110
And--

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.280
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Thank you.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.690
SPEAKER: --we cannot
wait to eat this.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:42.170
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Yeah.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.699
Dig in.

00:52:42.699 --> 00:52:43.490
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.823
KRISTEN TOMLAN: Thank you, guys.

00:52:44.823 --> 00:52:47.320
[APPLAUSE]
