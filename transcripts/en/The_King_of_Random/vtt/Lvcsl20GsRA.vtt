00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey guys welcome back i'm Nate with the king of random and today

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.940
We're going to be doing a few small projects that let us take a look at the relationship between

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.389
Magnets and electricity growing up. I always love playing with magnets and over the years the quality of magnets available has improved significantly

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.599
These silver coloured rare earth magnets are very powerful

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.549
And you can do a lot of really cool things with them the purpose of today's video is to show you a few awesome tricks

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
That you can do with magnets and electricity using some easily available supplies here are the materials

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.320
we're going to need for today's projects aluminum foil some double-a and

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.679
triple-a batteries

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.148
Some strong rare earth magnets and you want to make sure that the diameter of the magnet is at least a little bit larger than

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.989
The diameter of your triple-a battery some coated copper wire I found this in the jewelry making section at a craft store

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.360
This is copper wire that has a thin layer of

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.399
Enamel paint over it it can often come in several different colors some uncoated copper wire

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.289
Electrical tape and a couple safety pins now the first thing that we're going to do is extremely simple

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.819
I have here a stack of these rare earth magnets and a roll of foil what I'm gonna do is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.909
I'm going to drop the magnets down through the tube to watch what happens. There's nothing in this tube. It's completely empty

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.029
Let's watch what happens if I just drop them without the tube

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.470
They fall straight down. Nothing's impeding them, but if I drop it through the foil

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.439
It goes way slower like that's not even half the speed it's amazing how much slower it goes

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.758
It's not rubbing up against the size of the tube or anything like that as far as I understand it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.349
Here's what happens when a magnet moves past metal it creates an electric field and when electricity is running through metal it creates a magnetic

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.970
field so as the magnet drops through the metal the metal becomes charged with electricity and then turns into an electromagnet itself the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.709
Electromagnet that is the foil is then repelling the magnet that's falling down through the tube

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.409
so it slows it down a lot and the more powerful the magnet the more powerful the electric field the more powerful the

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.559
Electromagnet and the slower it goes it's kind of confusing

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.759
But I'm going to try and turn it upside down when it's almost at the bottom and just keep it going

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840
Yes off you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.420
Well nope nope

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.039
That's crazy magnets, let's try the next experiment for this one

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.480
We're going to take a double-a battery and attach three of our rare earth magnets to the bottom of it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.420
Next we want to take about one foot of our bare copper wire bend your wire in half and use a pair of pliers

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.159
To pinch where it's bent now, let's bend the wire into a sort of a heart shape

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.499
You'll want to touch the bent portion of your wire to the top of your battery

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.108
Next we want to bend the two ends of our wire so that they will run directly across the middle of the magnets if you

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.199
Have excess wire sticking out too far trim that off

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.790
You'll also want to bend your wires to make sure that the two ends are parallel to each other

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:04.639
At this point we should be able to make a small motor by placing the wire on top of the battery so that the two

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.779
Ends of the wire are in contact with the magnets the wire should begin to spin

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.108
Now you can see that the wire did begin to move, but it quickly destabilized and fell off

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.690
So we're going to add a couple of curves on the bottom wires to hold it more securely onto the magnet by bending the wire

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.579
Around the battery we can create a sort of groove that will line up with the magnets and hold our wire in place

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.230
I'm gonna see if it worked any better with the magnets on the other side so the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.120
Little nib of copper doesn't have to balance quite so perfectly on the tip of the battery

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.359
Well now it just slipped off the other part of the battery

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.630
It still made contact right there on the little edge, so it's still I'll finally slow down alright

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.719
I keep having my little copper motor spin so fast that it falls off

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.249
And I'm trying to find ways to make it stay in place so I think what I'm gonna try and do is I'm going to

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.770
Try and put a tiny divot in the back of the battery that will give our little pivot point something to stay balanced in so

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.030
It doesn't fly off quite so easily

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.309
I have a nail with a slightly dull head

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.820
and I'm going to try and line that up with the very center of the back of the battery and

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.039
Lightly tap it with a hammer to give it a nice dent

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.069
I need to be careful of course that I don't stab into the battery

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.379
I don't know exactly what that would do, but I'm sure it wouldn't be good

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.520
All right, that's not bad, let's try that out and see if it's gonna work

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.920
That's working pretty well

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.580
Oh my gosh

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.879
And it's spinning so fast that it's inertia is causing the battery and magnets to rotate the other direction a little bit. That's pretty funny

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.610
There you have it seems that making a dent in the battery does a pretty good job of helping it stay centered

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.610
And it doesn't fall off as easily

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.760
Now let's make another kind of motor this one uses the same principles, but is a different design

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.619
We'll need our double-a battery a couple more magnets two small safety pins our

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.799
coded wire and some electrical tape the coated wire is copper wire that has a thin layer of

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.710
protective enamel on the outside of it the enamel prevents the copper from making contact with the battery so

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.520
Electricity can't flow through it unless we remove part of the enamel to start cut off about one foot of your coated copper wire

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.470
Leaving about two inches at the end wrap your wire around your double-a battery several times

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.070
Wrap the ends of the wire around the coil a few times to hold it all together

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.369
Now we want to trim the excess wires so that they extend about one centimeter beyond the edge of our double-a battery

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.419
Now that our wires trimmed we need to remove the enamel from one side of the wires

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.020
Take some fine grit sandpaper and remove the enamel from one side of the wire until you can see the copper beneath it you can

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.829
See the copper color that shows that the enamel has been removed from one side of the other

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.500
But it's still in place on the other side with the enamel removed from both sides of the wire our coil is ready

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.029
And it's time to assemble the rest of our motor with electrical tape attach the safety pins

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.309
So they are in contact with the two ends of the battery you'll want to be sure that the loops and the safety pins are

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.679
At the same height and lined up with each other

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.299
Secure your battery and pins to the table with the pins pointing straight up

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.839
Attach one magnet to the battery in between the two pins

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.919
Feed one wire from your copper coil through the loop in one of the pins

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.529
Feed the other wire through the loop in the other pin let go of your coil and it might start moving

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.129
If it doesn't take off on its own right away give it a little nudge

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.229
For the last experiment we're gonna need a little bit more copper wire

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.090
I have about 20 feet of it right here

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.860
And we're also going to need a triple-a battery

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.379
And four of our rare earth magnets it can sometimes be tricky to find copper wire without any sort of coating on it

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.380
The copper wire I'm using comes with a plastic coating around it

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.440
I just shave that off and it gives me some nice exposed copper

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.969
I'm gonna show you how I use a razor blade to quickly remove the plastic coating from this copper wire

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.110
Now that I've removed a thin strip of the plastic from the whole wire I can easily peel it off from the rest

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.630
Next we want a wooden dowel with a diameter slightly

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.959
Larger than our magnets what we want to do is tightly coil all twenty feet of this copper wire around the dowel

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.299
Now this seems like it's going to take a really long time

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.730
So I'm gonna try and speed it up using power tools

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.670
With the dowel now securely attached to the Chuck of the drill I can now start spinning it and wrapping the wire around it evenly

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.870
Remove your copper coil from the dowel and spread it out

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.500
Just a little bit

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.509
So there's a tiny bit of space in between each loop if there are any spots where the gap is too large

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.500
You can usually just push it back together

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.199
We now have a copper coil about one foot long, so let's take our magnets and attach them to our battery

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.119
Before you attach two more magnets to the other end you need to make sure that they're oriented correctly

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.810
Facing one direction the magnets are attracted to each other and will pull themselves together

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.130
But if you flip them around the magnets will repel each other in that same

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.140
orientation with the magnets repelling each other attach two more magnets to the bottom of the battery

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:48.268
At this point if you fit the battery and magnets into the copper coil something pretty fun should happen

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:57.719
Check that out the battery and magnets pull themselves through the copper coil like a little self-driving electric train, let's do that again

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:01.769
Mm-hmm there goes flies right through the whole coil

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.760
We

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240
Made it around the curve

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:22.199
Okay, so what is happening as our little train goes through its little tunnel when the magnets make contact with the copper coil electricity is

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:24.199
running through them and through the copper as

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:30.359
We know electricity running through the metal wire turns it into a magnet because we have our magnets facing opposite directions

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:37.110
The magnet of the coil is pulling on one side and pushing on the other running it through like a train

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:44.128
It goes all on its own, that's so fun I could probably just play with this thing all day

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.769
So cool so many neat things you can do with magnets and electricity a quick recap a

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:59.430
Powerful magnet drop through a tube of aluminum foil will fall very slowly because it's movement creates an electromagnet

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.599
Which slows it down this small type of motor was made by just bending a piece of copper

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.769
So it touched the top of the battery and the magnets stuck to the bottom of it it had some problems

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.810
Destabilizing until we flip the battery upside down and put a small divot in the bottom of it

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.639
Another type of small motor can be made by running electricity through a tightly wound copper coil

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.089
Rotating over a magnet a couple of magnets stuck to a battery in opposite directions will run through a copper coil like a miniature electric

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:29.008
Train there you have it now. You know a few small simple tricks you can do with magnets and electricity at home

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.759
