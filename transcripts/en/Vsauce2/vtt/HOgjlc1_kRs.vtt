00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.689
The Nereid Under Ice has just documented life
under the Arctic Ice and it consists largely

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.460
of translucent worms and slimeballs.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.090
And Hershey has unveiled the world’s first
public exhibit in 3D printing chocolate.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.009
Vsauce! Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.210
Scientists at Utrecht University have created
plastic eating fungus. Plastic is inserted

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.689
into cones of agar which the fungus then breaks
down and feeds on. The process only takes

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.910
several weeks which is significantly shorter
than the decades or centuries it can take

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.050
plastic to decompose on its own. And Livin
Studio is developing not only a prototype

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.350
for growing it but they’re also working
on creating different flavors so that humans

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.510
will want to then eat the plastic eating fungus.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.960
GENiSYSS allows you to store your DNA on a
flash drive. Built with varying degrees of

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.960
encryption you to store a single drop of blood
on patented Whatman FTA material at room temperature.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.190
And use the drive itself to store important
family information, photos, or video. So you

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.200
can fill one with emergency information about
your child to help EMT’s or create a DNA

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.540
family tree that tracks and could someday
prevent genetic disorders. Or clone yourself

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.540
later.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.060
Whale poop may help regulate the Earth’s
climate. When whales surface they poop large

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.820
amounts of iron and nitrogen from deeper parts
of the ocean as part of what scientists call

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.310
poo-namis. These poo-namis cause a surge in
the growth of krill and plankton, which in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.090
turn absorb large amounts of carbon. It’s
estimated that whale populations were once

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.380
responsible for removing tens of millions
of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.190
year. The equivalent of annually negating
the carbon emissions from millions of cars.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.100
A Japanese robotics company is developing
robotic action figures. Complete with motors,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.670
sensors, speakers, and wifi connectivity,
the company's vision is that someday you might

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.510
be able to sit down at your desk and have
a Power Ranger action figure give you a high

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.509
five and read you your e-mails. And the concept is an evolution of Japanese Karakuri, mechanized

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.479
puppets.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.069
The ninebot one is a motorized smart unicycle.
Fully electric it can reach speeds up to 12

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.209
MPH and can travel 18 miles before needing
to be recharged. You can customize it’s

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.120
outer shell, install headlights, training
wheels, and speakers, and use an app to alter

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.319
the color of its internal LEDs. It’s available
at select distributors in Europe, but not

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.340
currently in the United States, but there
is one in Canada.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.540
An Amsterdam based designer has invented a
lamp is powered completely by living bioluminescent

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.849
bacteria. The lamp was built to sway back
and forth to mimic the movements of the ocean

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.920
which stimulates the bacteria into glowing.
While not yet commercially available, researchers

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.760
are working on finding ways to get the bacteria
to live longer so that someday we may be able

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.420
to use non-electric bio light.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.300
Ring is a WiFi-enabled video doorbell. Utilizing
a 180 degree camera and a two-way speaker,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.459
it allows you to use your phone or tablet
to see who is at the door and talk with them

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.260
without having to get up off the couch, or
even be at home. It also comes equipped with

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.940
motion tracking technology so you can set
the device to warn you if something unusual

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.879
is happening around your house.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.870
Finally Sepios is an underwater robot inspired
by cuttle fish that can navigate thick tangles

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.760
of grass without getting stuck and observe
marine animals less intrusively.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.760
Scientist: There is a very big need in technology
for vehicles which can move with higher agility.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.959
With our system we’re recovering much of
the agility of these animals in their native

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.099
habitat which is many orders of magnitude
better than current technology.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.909
I’m gonna leave you with the autonomous
walking of a hexapod snake monster. And as

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.900
always - thanks for watching!
