Intro

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.210
There aren't many people who've only seen
a Disney movie once, but even on repeat viewings,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.420
some of the best kept secrets and details
can still be hard to spot.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.490
Allow us to fill you in.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.940
Here are 20 Hidden Secrets in Disney Movies
You Won't Believe.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.940
Beauty and The Beast

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.610
Younger fans might keep their eyes covered
in the movie's terrifying forest, but look

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.450
again: on the worn out road signs there's
an arrow pointing to Anaheim - the home of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.030
Disneyland - and Valencia - the hom of Cal
Arts, where plenty of Disney animators learned

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.040
their trade.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.480
The Little Mermaid

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.430
It's hard to forget the visual design of the
movie's villain Ursula, but her unlikely inspiration

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.820
deserves most of the credit: the 1970s drag
performer "Divine."

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.820
Wall-E

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.470
The movie may be set after the fall of the
Disney and Pixar universe, but it's named

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.800
for the one who started it: Wall-E, as in
Walter E. (for Elias) Disney.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Mickey Mouse

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.950
Disney's mascot has always had a sweetheart
in Minnie, but when his voice actor Wayne

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.720
Allwine met voice actress Russi Taylor a decade
into his career, real life sparks flew.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.860
The two were married five years later.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
A Goofy Movie

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
It may not get the same attention as other
Disney flicks, but A Goofy movie's famous

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.490
Powerline number has a great Peter Pan easter
egg backstage: Tick Tock, the Croc.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.490
Cinderella

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.359
Ever gotten a real "Wicked Stepmother" vibe
from Sleeping Beauty's Maleficent?

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.779
You should, since both iconic villain roles
were played by and modeled after the same

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:28.759
actress, Eleanor Audley.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.909
Tangled

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.209
During the lantern sequence, one of the thousands
floats down next to Rapunzel, who keeps it

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.340
from sinking and sends it back into the sky.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.470
Notice the royal emblem?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.109
It's the same one her parents sent out in
her honor.

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.109
Snow White

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.479
The movie made animation, and Disney overnight
sensations, but the artists took some clever

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.729
shortcuts to get there.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.389
To get Snow's skin looking just right, they
applied actual rouge to the animation cells

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:53.820
- clearly, it worked.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.329
As for the Dwarves, well the final seven were
just a few of dozens of potential names, like:

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.740
Baldy, Hickey, Jumpy, Wheezy, Puffy, Tubby,
Burpy, and Deafy.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.060
They made the right call - even if "Wheezy"
would be easier to remember.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.060
Hercules

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.430
The Musical Muses of the movie steal the spotlight,
but they also pay one massive tribute to the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.060
broken busts in Disney World's Haunted Mansion.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.060
Toy Story

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.140
Tom Hanks' performance as Woody helped make
him Pixar's mascot, but his lines were actually

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.770
performed during breaks from other films - mainly
Sleepless in Seattle and A League of Their

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.770
Own.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.930
With Terminator 2 releasing just years before,
the animators planned to have Buzz and Woody

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.130
rescued by their own Sarah Connor badass:
Barbie, in her toy Corvette.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.970
Mattel who owned Barbie refused, saying Barbie's
personality wasn't set - and because they

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.190
figured the movie would flop.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.819
Good call on that one.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.819
Toy Story 2

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.500
The team at Pixar clearly featured some Canadians,
with a magazine on sale on Toy Story 2 priced

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.200
at $5 America, but $50 Canadian, taking a
shot at the retail mark-up for imported products.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.370
Jessie's exclamation, "sweet mother of Abraham
Lincoln" upon meeting Woody may fit her characters,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.830
but it's also a joke at Tom Hanks' expense.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.150
The actual mother of Abraham Lincoln was Nancy
Hanks - a distant cousin to the actor himself.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.150
Zootopia

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.680
The animal cast includes a total of 64 species,
but also pay tribute to past Disney releases.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.800
Assistant Mayor Bellwether is a nod to the
lambs of "Melody Time" and "Make Mine Music,"

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.030
and Mayor Lionheart was designed after The
Lion King's Mufasa.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.370
The movie is all about Judy Hopps' journey,
but that wasn't the plan.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.220
Actress Ginnifer Godwin had already recorded
her lines for a supporting role to Nick the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
Fox's lead, until one of the vocal crew informed
her the script had been completely re-written

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210
with Judy as the star.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.490
The team tried to be accurate with their character
designs, even traveling to Africa to see native

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.890
species up close.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.011
But when they realized a talking rabbit's
upper lip would be split up to its nose, they

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.210
made an executive call, and stuck with the
classic - and inaccurate - talking rabbit

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.210
tradition.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.210
Frozen

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.400
The one-of-a-kind style and artwork in Frozen's
world might seem like a Disney animator's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.370
work, but it's actually known as "Rosemaling"
- a traditional folk art hailing from Norway,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.569
where the film is set and was used as inspiration
for Arendale.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.440
Most fans know that the movie started development
with Elsa as the villain, but when that was

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.910
the plan, her character design was based on
the late Amy Winehouse, with short, spiky

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.190
hair and blue skin.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.880
The movie's success is mainly due to the bond
shared by the starring sisters.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.690
That might be because unlike most animated
films, actresses Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.770
actually recorded some of their scenes together
- including the songs.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.770
Conclusion

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.539
Those are some of our favorite bits of trivia
and insider information, but what other Disney

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.560
secrets have we missed?
