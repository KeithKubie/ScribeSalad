Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcasts. And I'm just checking in on you. Checking into something like voices Juncker just did six shows up in San Jose

Speaker 1:          00:00:18       Cruz.

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       I've been for the Houston Astros. That was one of my favorite players. Yeah, my voice is going to be a little tight. It's give me a little rough, you know. Um, I did six shows up there to Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday, just like when I was in Phoenix to Monday to Tuesday to fucking Wednesday. I'm putting together my new a hour and I really felt by Wednesday of this week it had gotten to the point where we're starting to do, starting to take shape. And I was very happy and I want to thank everybody who came out, you know, on school nights. I know you guys all have to work unless you hit the fucking lottery. I assumed all he had to go to work the next day. So I want to thank everyone in San Jose who came out to go see me. And, um, thank you for sitting through the new jokes. I had a great time up there, worked with Dean del Ray.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Fucking crushed it, crushed it all fucking week. Um, had a great time working with them, you know, and dean like this is the funny thing about Dean when I worked with Dean Dean, you know, he doesn't party or anything like that. He's done all of that shit. So He's over it. So then, you know, I'm, I'm a fucking codependent jackass, you know what I mean? So I mean, to a point someone's doing coke and heroin, I'm like, Hey, I'm going to bed. Okay. Um, but it's when it comes to the booze was smoking cigars, right. That's why, you know, me and all my friends, I mean we're all codepen guys and we just fucking feed off of each other and it becomes fucking, you know, animal house. But, um, so he, he's, he doesn't do that. Right. So my eyes can be great, you know, I'm not going to spend any extra money.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Busan, no extra calories. I was hitting the gym, was doing everything great. But a, the thing about dean is he has impeccable taste and shit that I like old instruments, old cars. He was showing me this guy that fucking read does these Porsche nine 11 out here that would just fucking insane, insane. Like he has all like, you know, not a lot of stuff, but he has all top of the line shits. I was joking with them, I was like, all the money that I'm going to fucking not blow in a bar after my show. I'm then going to spend 10 times more that on fucking Ebay after I get done talking to you. But um, anyways, he murdered it all week. We had such a great time. And um, San Jose Improv, that's one of my favorite places because it's really, it's really, it's a small theater, you know, from the turn of the last century at the, believe it was built in the 1890s burned down back when Shit used to burn down all the time because it was made out of fucking wood, you know, as opposed to what now bill, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       We didn't, they didn't have sprinklers. That's what it was. When a houses man out of plastic bill, you know, you've been out in Hollywood so long, you plastic phony, you think everything's made out of well then they would melt, right? Plastic is it flammable but just cowers. You know what I mean? Like your friend who says, I got your back, I'm not going to fucking rat you out. And then all of a sudden the teacher comes walking in and he goes, you always had this idea. That's what plastic is. You know, why? Cause it's manmade. Um, anyway, so it burned down and then they rebuilt it in the early 19 hundreds and everyone from like Harry Houdini, Charlie Chaplin, they always bring up those two guys. Nobody ever says a, you know, fatty Arbuckle played here. Nobody gives a shit. Right. I love that name. Fatty Arbuckle. You know, that's back when you just, you said what the person was for better for worse.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       You know what I mean? You know, you could just say fatty Arbuckle. Why? Cause cause he's a fat fuck. You know? Sure. You had a first name. Nobody knows what it is, but people go, you know, back then it was great, you know, you fucking, yeah, but then people also walk around, drop for the fucking end work. You know, like they'll ask saying pass the sugar. But the upside to that was you, you knew who thought what as opposed to now wherever he goes, African American, homosexual, vericut, Japanese where cause and you have no idea who's what. Everybody's walking around and you feel like you're in the fucking invasion of the body snatchers. Who's thinking what? Right. Everybody's reading from the same book. It's not a good God damn thing. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about right now. Um, I literally got off, got on the earliest flight.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       I'm doing this thing now because I want to run home, rush home and see my daughter, my daughter. But I get home cause I take the earliest flight out and I'm fucking exhausted. Then I have to go to sleep. So I'm sucks. I came home, I think she has to remember who I am just three days away, three days away. Like as far as what percentage of her life she was looking at me like making this face like, who the fuck is this guy? She didn't cry. Thank God that would've broke my heart. But you know, it took me like 20 minutes to get a smile out of her. Um, what else am I going to do? Want to get again, nine to five job, you know, drive the fucking Chevy cavalier like, but what the fuck a lot of you guys are doing right now, stuck in traffic.

Speaker 1:          00:05:05       I know you don't want to do that, right? You got dream. Let me tell you something. You got to, you're going to find that dream and you got to go after it. I'm kidding. Um, do whatever the fuck you want to do. You know, there's a lot of times I look at somebody who's sitting in a cubicle and that will be great. I do, I just fucking sit there. I just, I, I go from here to right fucking there, right? I just send my chair spins from this to here. Right? That's my range of fucking motion. I get my job done and I go home and you know something at this country company goes under, I don't give a fuck. I've to just go to another one eight on me. You know that rent to own rental leaf. That's how you do it anyways. Uh, what's going on in my world? Other than that, I'm excited. Finally excited about my new hour. Finally, finally, af had some fucking jokes. I'm the fucking boss, the Bro and still, they gotta win tonight. They play in fucking Tampa Bay. Lightening Down there in Florida. Dude. I know, like fucking 12 people already fucking move down there. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       It's fucking crazy. It's like, what are you fucking 80 can't take the wind anymore. You're going to lose your edge. Dope.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Dude. I went down there. I, I visit fucking, I've visited fucking whatever. Fucking Bobby McAfee dude. He's always walking around in shorts. Fucking flip flops, sitting down by a dark, hanging out with all these fucking Weirdos. Just like, don't you know, look at you. You're all fucking tanned up. You know it's good, but do you, you got to come back to, you got to go to donkeys.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Get to lodge with extra sugar, um, broads in the middle of a three game fucking slide. We lost Edmonton and then we went over Edmonton, Alberta and then we went to Toronto, Ontario and we fucking lost there. And then we went to Ottawa, the capital, the capital, ladies and gentlemen of Canada. I was actually, that's, I was trying to remember all the provinces, the provinces and territories is 10 provinces and three territories up there. And I could never fucking remember him cause most of them begin with n whatever other than enough of them do Nova Scotia, New Brunswick. Then there's something in Labrador retriever or some shit.

Speaker 3:          00:07:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       What the fuck is it? New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. Prince Edward Island. And the rest easy. You just go on across according to fucking hockey teams, the Quebec Nordiques, well Toronto may police spent at the Ontario my beliefs and then at the man told Manitoba fucking jets the Winnipeg jets, right. Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia. Then you go up top, you've got the northwest territory, you got Yukon, and then the other one like fucking begins with an n. It sounds like an Italian word, but it isn't like, forget about it. The fuck is that thing called. This has to be in the history of podcasting. The most boring thing anybody's ever brought up. Canadian. Come on. Yukon, Wikipedia, Canadian territory door, uh, terror tour territories. The fuck is it called? It's something Italian provinces and territories of Canada. Please take out your geography books. The fuck is it called? Oh yeah. Yeah. None. None of us. Oh no, that's not, doesn't sound Italian. Hey, we'll have none of that.

Speaker 3:          00:08:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       Knock it off. No, none of that. None of that would work. Fuck off. I'm I, I got most of them. I got most of them. All right, so anyways, the Bruins are playing Tampa Bay tonight. We need a wind. You know, we just fucking beat Edmonton. We've just want one of those fucking gays. We had little breathing room, a little breathe in Roman. Now, we don't, now it's just like, you know, Joe Barton, Dick taught me, talked me off the ledge, she goes, you know, they will fucking tired. They had back to back games. Don't fucking hit the panic panic button yet. But then we lost again to fucking Ottawa. Okay. So I'm gonna listen to Joe Barton it cause he knows way more about hockey than I'll ever fucking know. But if they lose tonight.

Speaker 3:          00:09:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       So we're looking at me possibly three years in a row of being in the playoffs with two weeks to go in March and then sitting at home, you know, which uh, Barney gets told me that's the worst fucking thing to just miss the playoffs. Okay. Cause you don't get any playoff money and you don't get a good draft pick. But who knows? Maybe somebody will miss somebody good. I mean, that's how we got Tom Brady. Right? Everybody just fucking was looking at him like, you know, he's got a nice dimple in his chin. But other than that, I dunno. You can see why they passed a bike and see why they passed it by when he fucking dove after you threw that pick six, you know, and the Superbowl this year. Just look that up. Him diving to tackle and just look at how unathletic he looks, you know, anytime anybody ever says like fucking out of fucked it all these teams way to the what? What was he, the fourth round? Six round. How did they miss this guy? Just show that video and just say, imagine that running the 40 yard dash.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       You know what Tom Brady is? He's a fucking sleep. That's what he is. He showed up looking like a Volvo station wagon and they didn't realize what was under the hood. You know what it was? It was a four 54, 454 cubic kids. She's a fucking hat. I'm sorry. Alright. Plowing ahead. Um, other sports talk Formula One starts on this Sunday if you want to get into it like I did last year and last year, the Mercedes Benz team with Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg the sense retired Nico Rosberg cause he wanted to hang out with his daughter, which I didn't fuck. Or his kid, which I didn't understand until I came home after three days in San Jose. And my own daughter's looking at me like, uh, it's just a driver. Who the hell is this guy? Um, who knows? I always, I always want to blame the woman, you know, that his wife was like, it's really dangerous. I mean, you won the championship. I mean, this whole thing with Louis, it's just, it's, it's you, it's, you talk about it all the time. We can't even sit down for a meal. I get it. You think he's a cunt, but you know, I just, what about, did you just be here with me?

Speaker 3:          00:11:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:33       You know, that's the danger of being with the wrong woman. You, you end up stepping out of a formula one car and just say, hey, you know, one or maybe he's smart. Maybe he's just like that guy who plays blackjack and goes up early and just says, Hey, you know what? Fuck this. I'm going back to the room taking my money and I'm going back to the fucking room. I have no idea. I don't even understand this God damn sport to be honest with you. I still don't what happened to the steering wheel and why it looks like a fucking game boy now. And how the fuck sitting there like driving that Goddamn fast. You have time to take your hand off the wheel and fucking search for that button to pick a new, uh, a new suspension. Like you're in a Tesla with your friend driving up fucking route to, hey, you want me to put it in an insane fucking mode?

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Whatever the hell it is, except they're doing this shit at 200 miles an hour. By the way, I went by a Tesla dealership when I was up in, uh, San Jose and, um, they have, uh, they're the new one up there, you know, that it had, it had, you know, the original ones just had the motor, um, for the rear wheels. Now they got one for the front and the back. And evidently it goes, we need to get the top of the line, the best one, right. It's, it's limited with them. It's just like what, what gives it, um, makes it worth more money is the amount of fucking electrical power you have. It's all a bit, cause everything other than that, I think they're pretty much all the same. And if you get the top of the line one, um, it goes zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds. That's like a fucking, that's motorcycles level speed.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       And it's a four door. Looks like a fucking Nissan Maxima. Not even know. It doesn't look like that. It looks like maybe like a Toyota super fucked in Nissan masks at maximum. One of those late,

Speaker 2:          00:13:21       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Late eighties. Once. Um, was it the super, the Celica? I can't fucking remember. All I know is, you know what car I would love to fucking own for like a year is one of those like a 71 or 72 like Datsun five 10. Just have the whole fucking thing redone. Um, I, I gotta be honest with you. I you're, I'm hard pressed to find a fucking car that I, that I can't see that would be fun to drive. You know what I mean? So there's so many fucking great cars out there. The only ones I, I, I'm not really interested in is all the American muscle cars at this point because they're just fucking everywhere. Everybody has one. Every time you put on Mika and we've got some more power power coming up and it's the same guy comes a coup de, it comes a fucking Amie. This hemi that it comes to Shelby here comes to fucking, you know, the day I only made a couple of these Camaro's so 19 fucking 69, you know, this is a Mustang boss. It's there. They're all fighting over the same fucking three models. Meanwhile, is all these other fucking cool as cars out there. Um, I'm actually glad that the baby boomers are still infatuate that cause it keeps the prices down of the shit that I like. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       yeah, I'm a fucking Weirdo dude. I like those. Ford does Ford vans from the 60s. You know, it's just a shame that, you know, a couple of fucking serial killers that dressed up like clowns drove around in vans. They really ruined the name of them. But what did the upside of that? The upside of pedophilia is if you're into vans, you can get one for really cheap. The trade off is you can never grow a mustache for the rest of your life. That's it. Um, anyway, so for Formula One starts this Sunday in Australia and last year then Mercedes Benz teams where the a was with um, Mercedes van team, sorry, was the team to beat in this year. Evidently the Ferrari's are, uh, are looking like they're going to be really strong and a, I guess everybody's rooting for who is it? Who the fuck is the Australian driver? Therefore, the, uh, the red bull team, he's coming down there. What the fuck's his name? What's his name? Uh, Daniel. Ricardo. Hello.

Speaker 4:          00:15:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       You're getting ready to leave. Does she still remember who I am? She was looking at me like, who the hell is this guy? All right sweetie. Go ahead at that though. Huh? I ain't get a smile. Can I get a, she's staring at the microphone. I liked that. How are you going to get in Showbiz? No, no. Treat me like food. Yeah, I think she's kind of over me. Let me hang with it for like two, three hours today. Get that bond back. Get the bond back. Yeah. Can you see by data? She's just staring at it. She'd read a look at a pillow then me. Hey Buddy. You remember me? Look at me. Who Do you think paid for that? Onesy that was me. Nothing. She's looking down. She's got no interest. Unbelievable. That's the kind of charisma I have. All right. You guys go have fun.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       Okay. Bye. I'll see you. Bye everybody on the clock and ass. All right, bye. See you later. To my two ways. Um, all right. So, um, she didn't look at me once. Um, whenever I understand. Okay. It's a brand new brain still working. She's putting together her shit. The way I'm putting together my act. You got, or she already doesn't like me, but you know, I really can't blame them. Um, Daniel Ricardo is the guy, but here's the thing about him. Everybody in Australia claims the guy. All right, which is bullshit I think because he didn't move to fucking Australia till he was seven. He came from Sicily. Alright. I bet. I bet he's got some stories about everybody teasing them with this fucking accent when he first showed up to Australia, but he's got some stories. Any Sicilian, so you know, you know, he never forgets whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       Australia will like your claim them maybe you got kicked out like all those Brits incentive, that fucking land. Who knows. But, um, so everybody's going to be pulling for him. I can't fucking wait. I can't, I can't believe how excited I am for this shit that I finally stuck it through one of those whole seasons and I'm totally into it. So I'm probably borne a lot of you, but um, who knows. All right, let's get to the, let's get system all bullshit here. Um, did I already talk about everything? Oh, you know what else I did when I was up there? Um, the Improv up, they have found a, a, a drum room for me and on two days I got to play for two hours, both fucking days. I snuck four hours in. That's what I do when I'm on the road cause I can't really play drums, you know, as much as I like, which is basically an hour to two hours every fucking day.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       I can't do that anymore. Now I get out, you know, a couple a couple of days a week if I'm lucky, but I got the whole practice pad kit and all that shit here. So, um, I got to go out and do that shit. See how awful my playing is now. It was really fucking depressing, you know, but it was still a good time. Um, all right, here we go. Let's, let's read a little, Oh, you know what? I have announcements I have to do if I sound like I'm all over the place cause I got like two hours. Fucking sleep flight was at like 6:50 AM, you know, and I, I never, I usually don't do a podcast when I flew the same fucking day. So. All right. What am I supposed to do here? Oh, I have to remind the listeners about Deanna Adler's, Steven Adler's mom.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Um, I interviewed her with Steven Adler and um, Jamie Adler, um, that was posted yesterday. Please listen to it. And um, Steven's mother, mother is going to be at Barnes and noble doing a book signing a week from yesterday. So that will be the 29th, March 29th. She's going to be there. Let me make, let me double check on them. Make sure I don't fuck that up. That would be a bad thing. That would defeat the purpose of them coming on here. All right. Where am I? Where am I? Um, yeah, the 29th at 7:00 PM at the growth on Fairfax here in Los Angeles. Um, she's gonna be at the, uh, at the fucking, at the God damn mall down there where they used to have two stadiums, by the way. We used to have a football stadium down there and they used to have a baseball state and we have you ever watched those old school black and white home run derbies and you wonder where they are.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       I always thought they were liking like the Washington senators, the original, you know, Washington Senators Ballpark, but they were actually out here in la, which makes sense because it's a fucking TV show anyways, now it's a CBS slot and where all that shit stood, you know, they knocked it all down and then they did like 9 million episodes of the prices. Right. So you know what the world moves ahead. All right. In don't China, sorry. Just blew out your ear. Drums, Indochina, everybody. Chino. Talk about how um, a made to measure suit fits compared to a generic off the rack suit. And now every man looks better in a suit. Hey, why don't you fucking write something and I'll, I'll read that. I gotta sit here and riff. You know, they used to do that to comedians way back in the day. They probably still do it. We used to go on for commercial auditions and you'd show up and then you know, there's no coffee, there's no coffee. They just want to see personality. And then you'd go in there and you hold up the product and you'd sit there, riff and all this shit. And then they would just steal all your jokes. They wouldn't hire you. And then they'd write the copy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       Well I think I told this story, Patrice fucking called them out on it. That's right. I think I told this actually recently. 200 I'm standing there it goes. He just walked in with like a can of coke and just stared all three of them down. Just so what? What is this horse shit? They all imploded and told them exactly what the fuck they were doing. All right. Do I really need the riff about this? Okay. Do you know, unless you're, unless you're fucking the exact same measurements of a mannequin, you know, you're not, something's going gonna look fucked up. He just not gonna look right. Okay. If you have a suit that's fucking tailor made to your body, obviously you have a by a talk for your car. You know, if you buy the one for your model, your model car, it fits like a glove as opposed to just getting some generic one. It's a little gust of wind and it blows right off. Do you want your suit pants to come flying off and then you Dick's peeking out of your boxers at the Christmas party or do you want to fit suit? Well, thank God for Indo Chino and dope child, whatever the fuck they are, they making it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit and an incredible price.

Like it looks like a third of the net standup goalies. You know, they played goalie, they look, they look like they're in the Rockettes. Cats just fucking kick their legs out and shit. But it's, it's um, I'll you know, I'll actually, I'll maybe I'll put a link to it, um, from the podcast and podcast or at the MMP. Is that what the Twitter is? I have no fucking idea. Um, anyways, that's the, uh, that's the podcast here for this Thursday. I got something I got to go do. I apologize. I know it was a little scatterbrained here, but however you can listen to some nice music and then listen to a podcast, um, from, I don't know when, I don't know when it's going to be. It's from, from yesteryear. When I was a little bit younger, my brain wasn't as scattered. Brad, it's always been scatterbrained. Whose kid too? All right, please enjoy the next half of the podcast and I'm,

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       have a nice weekend. You'd cuts.

Speaker 5:          00:31:54       Hey, what's going on? And this is the Monday morning podcast for March 25th, 2009 a fucking podcast is to start to feel like groundhog day for me. I'm going to be a little grumpy, a little extra grumpy this week because, uh, I don't what happened. I uh, well I do know what happened. Um, I went out drinking last night and I stayed out until about two in the morning and, uh, I was driving home and I saw coyote and I slowed down and for some reason felt the need to yell at it, you know, just to see what it would do. Because according to Black Comedians, that's what white people do around wild animals. And Damn, I am the stereotype. If Dad was a black mother fucker, shit, he kept driving down the mother fucking room. Why person be pulling over? Go over there. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 5:          00:32:53       Huh? You want to bite me in the ass? That's literally what the fuck I did. I was a hacky def jam bet and those were two of the worst impressions of two races you're ever gonna hear. Um, but go fuck yourself. I'm still in my pajamas. You wear pajamas bill. Um, when it's cold in my apartment, I do still comfortable with my sexuality. Um, let me tell you something. If you wear pajamas as a man and you don't have a child, you're just, you're a fucking, I don't know what, but you're not something, I want to be around these Pajama bottoms in my way of saying that I hate myself. Oh, Bill, why would you say that? Um, anyways, yes. So I just pulled over and I started yelling at this coyote. I don't even want to sound like, hey, hey, let's see if we do something.

Speaker 5:          00:33:47       Then I started whistling at him, you know, not in like a sexual way. I'm not a creep. I was whistling of that monkey was domesticated. I just want to see if I could fuck them up, you know, just don't come. You come here, can we boy. And the thing was looking at me like, dude, are you serious? And I was like, no, not really. I just want to see what you would do. You fucking cunt. And then I drove home and I had some Salami and some horseradish cheddar cheese and uh, oh, you know what I got the other day, I got this new Sam Adams. Um, I really am a Douche bag this week I'm wearing pajamas, I'm drinking Sam Adams. Um, if I have a story that involves me having a sandwich with an olive in it, you guys should really just unsubscribed to my podcast at this point.

Speaker 5:          00:34:38       Or maybe any story when I'm standing here in a blazer with a pipe. Um, yeah, I bought this new Sam Adams Beer, like, uh, you know, they have like the seasonal ones. What is it that the blackberry something beer. I know it sounds gross, right? That's what I was thinking. I'm like, that sounds gross. I'm like, but it's Sam Adams. Somehow they make this shit tastes good. That Sherry Week Cherry wheat was something that bears, I drank and I thought it was the most delicious beer I ever had. And by the third one I felt like I had eaten a whole bag of candy and um, I was like, I need to stop. But I still get those. I like to somewhere else. I think it's fucking, you know what it was, I had just seen a Sam Adams commercial and I fucking challenge you to not want to go drink 12 beers at the scene of Sam Adams commercial.

Speaker 5:          00:35:25       You don't get to see those commercials. And the guy sticks his fucking face. And those hops grabs two big handfuls. They show how many extra hops they put in, which I don't even know what does. Evidently it makes it more tasty. And then when they put it in that fucking that beer glass shape shape, like a voluptuous woman, you know, and it just looks that perfect color. That's what was in my head. And I was at the grocery store, I was like, aw man, they got a new flavor and that guy's face in the hops that's very sexual. Like he's gotta use, buried his face in some chick's pussy. And in the end they show her all filled up and fulfilled, you know, all filled up and fulfill as a sentence for you. So anyway, black berry sweeter the best. I'm like darker the Berry. The sweeter the juice they got me. They all went sex on me and I fucking bought it. And I will tell you that was the worst goddamn tasting beer I've ever had my fucking life. Okay. You know, I'm a big fan of these smaller brewers, even though they're huge. Sam Adams is huge now, but I'll tell you, Sammy, you missed the mark on that one. Cause that tasted like a, I don't know what it tasted like. It tasted like Sam Adams armpit. Okay, that's good.

Speaker 5:          00:36:39       That didn't even make sense. Understood this. Avoid the Sam Adams blackberry. Whatever the fuck it's called. It's like, what the fuck was I thinking blackberry? What the advertisement should that for? That shit should be, it should be. It's not a wine cooler. It's not a beer. Or maybe like it's a bad cop buddy movie. You know, he's a beer, he's a wine cooler and together they tastes like ass. What is it? I'm actually in my refrigerator right now. The blackberry. Ah, Jesus. I can't pronounce it with beer wit B. I. E. R. Is it some, a fancy German way of spelling, uh, whatever fucking word that's supposed to be. And that's not a word. There's no space between it. I didn't want the fuck that is and yeah, I feel like I'm in Woodstock right now. You ever see that thing where they're like, stay away from the red tabs, man.

Speaker 5:          00:37:35       I'm telling you. Stay away from the Black Berry, Sam Adams with beer. All right? It's not a good fucking scene. It's not a good fucking scene. And yes, Jesus Christ, that's it. I'm done with that. Anytime there's any sort of fruit in a beer, you gotta be done. Although I do like, what does that beer, they put the slice of orange and the, uh, I'm just really going to just say one Douche bag thing about my personality after another on this podcast. This is what it is. You know, if for some reason, one of you finds me to be your hero and you, uh, took out the CD cover and taped it on the ceiling above your bed, you know, I just realized I don't have a poster myself. What kind of, what kind of fucking entertainer am I that I don't have that poster. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:38:31       When I'm standing under the tree, you know, both hands up on the tree branch above me with the little sea shell necklace and my shirt opened down to my name Sean Cassidy poster a, that's when you know you made it. That's when you know you made it. When you're, when you're posing for that picture and nobody around you is telling you it's a bad idea, that's when you know you made it. That's when you know, because you have making so much fucking money. People are afraid to tell you that maybe you shouldn't be sitting on a tire swing with one leg in the air, you know, for the poster of your upcoming tour. Um, okay. That was a long way to go to do a Shaun Cassidy reference. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast and uh, if you are new to my page of my website or my myspace page, um, welcome. I did one of these every single Monday. And people send me a list of questions of Co Weston's not questions, questions, because it is the internet. Um, they send me lists of questions and I, uh, try to answer them to the best of my ability.

Speaker 5:          00:39:46       I fucking pajamas are killing me. I'm fucking up with my brain. I don't know. I gotta let my brain this week, Clint, my fucking brain. What am I freaking, I'm freaking out about something right now and I can't even figure out what the fuck it is. Um, but anyways, I do this podcast every single week. Yeah. They send me questions, questions, and they, uh, send me their list of underrated, overrated things. They, uh, give me movie reviews. They asked me for advice. They tell me to go fuck myself. Every once in awhile, someone such a concert, they become douche bag of the week and a in. Lately people have been sending me stories about revenge. Um, which I find fascinating because that's one of the few evils that I've, uh, I've actually resisted. I have not partaked in, um oh before I get too deep into this podcast and we'll let you guys know that my, uh, my standup special, why do I do this evidently is on demand.

Speaker 5:          00:40:44       So, uh, if you want to have a little party, you know, get out your little fucking tea cups and a table that's way too big for you to be sitting at. Cause that's what you do at a tea party though. Yeah. Does anybody over the age of five have a fucking tea party? So they do that over in England or do they just have fucking tea and just sit there and stare out of the clouds? Um, all right, let's get on with the podcast. Okay. That was my opening. Just burst of energy trying to make this fucking thing funny because, uh, I only got five hours sleep last night. Ah, poor fucking baby. You only got five hours sleep and now what are you gonna do with the lay around the next day, the rest of the day and you fucking pajamas. You know what about me and the fucking work and man Trican boilermakers till in the morning. Now I'm operating heavy machinery.

Speaker 5:          00:41:38       Go Fuck Yourself. It's not my fault. Okay. Fuck you. You're doing heavy machinery that makes you make when like fucking 30 bucks an hour, 30 bucks an hour to take down a mountain. All right. That made no sense. What's so fucking ever, um, I just have a bunch of random notes here. Notes that I've made over the past week. Here's an idea. I had it. An airport, nothing suffers like the luggage of fat people. And I don't know how I came up with that. I know what it was. I just saw this woman dragging her wheelie sideways. Or was it a guy? I can't remember.

Speaker 5:          00:42:16       Once you get to that size, does it really matter if you think about that? It's become so big. You'd just come asexual, this is my, uh, late night DJ voice, sort of, uh, trying to convince you with some things. Um, all right. That was creepy. I'm sorry. All right, let's, do you want to talk about creepy? Let's talk about how Obama, uh, President Obama, oh, uh, Barack Obama was on the tonight show this week. Did that disturb anyone as a fucking American? Is he in dude, where's my car part too? You know, what the fuck are you doing on the tonight show? I got a big idea, my girlfriend about that, and I said, ah, it's good. It's a great way to reach people. It's like, why don't you ever fucking press conference, right? I gotta do is we'll at that podium, the whole world sits around and watches it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:07       I'm like, I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't sit there and watch it. You know what I mean? I, it's like, dude, shouldn't you be like near the red phone? What is the red phone rings? And you're on there, you know, picking your fucking march madness brackets. It's unreal how the presidency of has just gone downhill just over the last fucking 10 years. Like right around 10 years ago was when Bill Clinton got impeached because of some fucking Skank, you know, every president. Can you, can you even begin to understand not only the amount of world leaders that have been in the Oval Office, but the amount of fucking skanks that have been in there that does the original playboy mansion. All right, guys have been in there getting blown fo for centuries. Women love power guys love blow jobs. Okay? And when you marry the two, you get the fucking Oval Office that is ground zero for that shit.

Speaker 5:          00:44:12       And the guy got fucking impeached for it. It's right there. I thought that knocked down in the presidency that the president with fucking secret service at his fingertips can't get a fucking blow job. Right? He gets busted. And then you had a, what's his face, uh, uh, Georgie part to whose dad evidently didn't teach them how to give a speech. So we had to look at that fucking retard for the last eight years, given a speech where he sounds like somebody's given a book report who didn't read the book. You know what I mean? Kind of fucking looking around like he had that shit and now we got this fuck head going on the tonight show. Yeah. Like he's Ashton Kutcher. I don't know. I don't like it. This is three, three presidents in a row where I, I don't like what they're doing. He wear the blue suit. You wear the fucking tie and uh, you, you should have an air about you that you, and he just shouldn't be on the tonight show. You know what I mean? So then this night show Perez Hilton, Ashton Kutcher it, President Obama. You know what? I didn't even watch it. I'm like literally criticizing. I had something I didn't even watch. You know, I just couldn't sit there and watch that showing.

Speaker 6:          00:45:29       [inaudible] did you get through and the president [inaudible] Hani, Hani, Hani, Hani, he's doing donuts. We do it very notes.

Speaker 5:          00:45:38       Um, I don't know. All right, let's, let's get on. What the fuck? I'm really, really in an extra fucking shit mood right now. You know, it all started last night when I yelled at that coyote, you know, that's what I did. I turned my back on nature and actually kind, Kinda freaked me out cause it was just a couple of blocks down my, uh, oh my street. You know what I mean? It's like kill a sudden. It's like a fucking will Smith movie playing out at three in the morning. And uh, I was kinda wondering like where the fuck that thing came from? I know the Hollywood hills, that kind of off there in the distance, but uh, you know what a coyote eat road runners, huh? Who watches cartoons? I do, but they never catch them. What does that even fucking true?

Speaker 5:          00:46:26       You know what I mean? Roadrunners can fly, right? They just choose not to. They'd rent a room. They'd rather run, be the fucking martyr. Make all the other birds feel guilty for taking the easy way up. All right, let's get on with the questions here because this podcast is in a culdesac right now. I have driven down the street. It says not a through way and I continued down the fucking street and now I'm just driving around in a fucking circle. Okay. Uh, Bill. All right. They're listening to your podcast since I watched you perform. And because it's nice to hear someone use the word count every five minutes. You know, a lot of people have been giving me shit about that. Say I used the word count too much and that they're starting to use it in everyday life and their uh, you know, they're dropping it and weird times.

Speaker 5:          00:47:12       All right. I'm sorry. I'm going to try to take, I'm going to try not to use the word cunt so much. All right. You can't. Hey, he did a cunt joke. All right. In addition is the rest of the rest of the question about, um, how do you feel about non Irish, the way non Irish People Saint Patrick's Day? Quite frankly, it pisses me off. It's a day to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland, not to get drunk. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio and here we have a big parade downtown. It's so annoying seeing the drunks, filling the streets. People stereotype us as if we're the only culture that has a drink. Once in awhile. I'm Irish American and I'm probably the only woman of Irish descent who has never been drunk. Really.

Speaker 5:          00:48:01       My family and I usually have a traditional meal of boiled potatoes, carrots, cabbage, corn, beef and Irish soda. Bread. Now, let me tell you something. If ever there was a fucking reason to get drunk, it's the kill, the taste, boiled potatoes, carrots, cabbage, corn, beef. And you can just taste the hot water on the fucking over boiled vegetables on. Every nutrient is just taken out of them. You wonder why as Irish people have such pasty fucking skin and no pigment of the boil on the fucking nutrition out of the, out of the vegetables anyways. Personally, she says, I think traditional Irish food sucks. And it's mostly because they didn't cultivate much except for potatoes and cabbage. Well, you ever think maybe they were too fucking drunk to get a cookbook, you know, but I do like Irish soda bread. I remember you saying you don't go out drinking.

Speaker 5:          00:49:00       I don't, I don't think I ever said that. Is that a Typo? Um, but you, but do you ever do anything? And do you like Irish foods? Um, I gotta admit I really do like a corn beef sandwich and I really do like the [inaudible]. I do not like boiled potatoes. Boiled potatoes are disgusting and you need at least half a stick of butter, salt and pepper to just kill the taste of what you did to it. You know what I mean? I'm trying to think of anything that you should boil other than drinking water during a fucking catastrophe. You know, what do you boil rice? All right then what you boil. I Dunno, but let me get back to the question. How do I feel about people, uh, who celebrate same faxing. I don't go out on Saint Patrick's Day. That's a, a, it's a very bad day to go drinking.

Speaker 5:          00:49:51       You know, everybody out in their green plastic hats and they'd say, Hey, can he navigate or, and long neck goose. Yeah. It's, it's very, um, uh, it's, you know, it's like drinking on New Year's Eve, you know, and all the dumb conser out with their stupid little Corey outfits and is, if the sound of the noise makers weren't ear piercing enough, you got them shrieking over them. It's just a horrible time to go out. And, um, I still have inserted the question, how do I feel about non Irish people celebrating Saint Patrick's Day? I really could give a shit. I think it's a statement of, uh, I dunno how empty their lives are or how the herd just follows whatever the fuck they supposed to do. You know, there's always like that one traditional guy and he's got to weigh the Sculley cap in the Irish sweater, standing over in the corner, cutting into a bar of soap with a knife.

Speaker 5:          00:50:48       You know that guy. Um, yeah, I could give a, I'm a, I'm German Irish and I could give a shit about a Saint Patrick's day. I don't know the story of the patron saint and um, yeah, I don't give a fuck. I think in the, in the, when I was in my twenties, I used to go out to pubs on Saint Patrick's Day. Um, and I used to do it because I would thought I could get laid that night because I look so Irish. And then some girl did like, oh my God, this is what the day is about. Here's a Leprechaun right here. Maybe I'll blow them. That's the only reason why I went up. I was desperately trying to be interesting, but now I just, I don't go out. I don't go out on new years and I don't go out on a St Patrick's Day. I don't go out on flag day and he sorta day Earth Day I stay home.

Speaker 5:          00:51:42       But those, those are, those are just douche bag days. And what you want to do is whatever people are doing is you, you do it the next day, like Valentine's Day, everyone brings their brought out to go fucking whatever, right? You can't get a reservation anywhere. The fucking prices are jacked up through the roof. This is what you'd do. You'd go out on the 15th that's what you do. And you tell you woman that that's what you're doing because you're gonna get a fucking table anyway you want. You're not going to get raped on the charges. You probably actually to be able to go to a better restaurant than you would have on the night of the 14th and that's a great like, you know, you know a Bronx tale, the lock, the door test. That's a great way to see if you're with the cool girl and on, if she'd let you take her out on the on on the 15th because it really doesn't make a fucking difference, does it?

Speaker 5:          00:52:31       You know, you're going to get to see if she is an independent thinker or if she's fucking stuck in must see TV, you know, and it's going to drag you to the Macy Day fucking Thanksgiving parade one day. Cause that's what you do. Everybody else is doing it. We have to do it. I need, it's not that I don't love you and we're just going to get raped here on the price. You know, you're trying to find a bargain on Valentine's Day. Uh, I'm going to be rude bitch. But you're in the relationship too. You're not paying for the fucking meal. How does that work? Exactly. Exactly. You know what? Now I'm not even taking you out. We'll go ahead and cry. Go ahead and cry. It's not going to work. This is all fucking fake because you know, I just exposed you for being selfish.

Speaker 5:          00:53:22       I ain't like that. No, that was great. You liked that. You liked that little little riff I did there. I always, when the hypothetical arguments. Um, okay. Bill, how would, uh, how would I go about getting a personalized autographed DVD set from you DVD sets? I don't know where they were releasing them in a set. Do I have a trilogy of Dvds like the Godfather? Um, how would you go about that? Uh, you'd come out to one of my shows, that's what you would do and you'd buy one. And I'd stand there and I'd fucking sign it for you. And I'd smile like a jackass is, I waited the excruciating eight seconds that it takes for a digital camera to click before the three flash bulbs go. Some of those disposable cameras, as bad as they were for the environment, I imagine how great with those things, say cheese click and it was over. Now they fucking got those digital cameras. They're like, hey, lan to today and then just sit in there waiting and waiting with that fucking smile plastered on your face. You know, like that fucking newscaster who goes to throw it to the other newscaster in the field and then it doesn't go. And then you just staring at the entire state that you're broadcasting to now off to Mike, out in Chelmsford.

Speaker 5:          00:54:42       Okay. Will seem to be having some technical difficulty. That's what it's like getting your picture taken on a fucking digital camera and you want to even better is when they accidentally hit video and then you're standing there with a smile on your face. Like you start talking through your taste as a god. All the Latin Dad, you gotta hold it down. You know, many times that's happened to me after my shows and they're like, oh my God, I had it on video. And those are the times when I wish I didn't sell shit at the end of my shows. You know, I like meeting people after my shows. I definitely like doing that. But you know, sometimes you feel like a fucking idiot, you know, especially when people come up to you on like, you know, there's, there's this joke, can you just say pesto and then we'll take the picture now. Now I can. Oh my God, you so grumpy. Shut up. Take the picture. Um, all right.

Speaker 5:          00:55:38       Anyways, uh, he said I didn't want, let me go on with this guy. He says I'm happy to pay for it and I have a downloaded copies paid for to my iPhone, but I want an autograph one, so let me know what I need to do to get one where I had to pay for it. All right. I'm kind of being a Douche here, but like, um, you know, people ask me for like autographed photos and Shit. Like I'm Fonzie sometimes and they never, they like expect me to pay the postage and all that type of shit and it's just like, I'm not doing that. Okay. All right. I, I hang out at the end of my shows. I take pictures, I autographed, I do everything but kiss fucking babies. All right. I do this podcast every week. I'm not going to get myself into this situation where I got to go to the post office, you know, every fucking, you know, every other day. All right. With Manila envelopes. I'm not doing that Shit, you know, trying to think of something to write before I sign. That's the hardest thing about giving an autograph. Can you make it out to Susie? And then I always write Susie and then I signed my name and I'm like, then I tried to think what the right and I'm like, fuck uh, God bless a Susie. What's going on? [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:56:55       AH, Shit. All right. Who complains about signing autographs? You know what I do. I do. Um, okay. Uh, okay, let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm really sounding like a fucking Weirdo. I get off complaining like, Oh, acted like I would see, someone asks me for a photograph every other day. I was going to say every 20 minutes and I'm like, they'll never believe that. I'll say every other day. That's not even true. It's usually like once a month and it's usually somebody with a fatal disease and I still don't send it to him because that's the kind of guy I am. All right. Also, Bill, let me move on here. You should really promote the broadcast. Okay, Bill, you should also, you should really promote the podcast for download on iTunes. That shit is so easy that once you do it, you had the podcasts on your iPhone and you can listen to it in the car anywhere other than in front of a computer.

Speaker 5:          00:57:46       Well, there you go. Everybody, you can download it on iTunes. Thank you sir. You just hyped it for me. All right, last week I had a big question about the difference between hotels and motels and uh, well first of all, before I get into this shit, um, how about those Bruins? Huh? Beaten the New Jersey devils. I got any New Jersey Devil fans out that you like that little four to one victory. I'm just fucking with you. You guys got a great team and if you're not watching hockey right now, I really feel bad for you all you guys watching March madness and uh, you know, waiting for that, that awful song at the end of the tournament when they show the great moments, I had a dream. They usually pick up Lincoln was syrupy song as they show all the dunks in slow motion and the people being excited and then crying. What is this song that they sing tonight? I need you.

Speaker 5:          00:58:45       Oh, [inaudible] Tony Right now it playoff hockey is coming. The flyers of playing great. The range is lost yesterday, but they're coming on the capitols of fucking ridiculous. The goddamn Devil's got an insane team as always. I really hate, I really hate the devils. I just hate their, uh, I hate that the country style of hockey that they played throughout the 90s with the left wing lock in the trap defense. I swear to God, not disrespecting, you know, Marty her over there and the big records that he got, but you know, it's a little padded. It's a little fucking pattern with the fucking trap defense. I mean he spent half his career have to save. He made with skating behind his neck, stopping the puck because they just would dump it in because they clog up the neutral zone and you know what I mean? And that was also during the clutch and grab era.

Speaker 5:          00:59:45       Jesus Christ. I could've, I could've squeezed out a couple of shout outs. All right, that's bullshit. I just, I just hated that period of hockey. And when I think about that period of hockey, I think about the New Jersey devils and I don't still to this day, I don't understand why the NHL just didn't say that's an illegal defense. You know what I mean? It's like when will Chamberlain was fucking dunking on everybody. You know, they came up with rules to, to keep it competitive because it's a fucking business. You know, the three second rule, you can't have some guy just standing in the fucking paint who's nine feet tall. Goaltending they came up with that shit and they came up with the legal defenses. I still don't know why they allow that defense. It's the worst fuck they had to get rid of. The red line because of that shit.

Speaker 5:          01:00:32       I don't know, but I was watching yesterday and they don't play it anymore, so I really enjoyed it. But as usual, they just got great fucking players and they play smart fucking hockey. And uh, I dunno. I Dunno what's gonna be a tough fucking road. And uh, for those of you who are, who don't want to know, this is a question I have for you little fuck are these people who are trying to get the fighting out of hockey? I don't understand them. You know, watch a different sport. Hockey is not for you. All right?

Speaker 5:          01:01:00       And if it's somebody in hockey stopped doing it, don't get rid of fighting and hockey. All right? And think that you're going to be as popular as baseball, basketball or football. You're not all right. You're a rogue fucking sport. You don't really is hard about hockey's if you never grew, if you didn't grow up playing it or in like a hockey family or in a hockey town, it's one of the hardest fucking game to watch on TV. I was kind of noticing that yesterday. Like you literally have to be not only watching what's on the screen, but what is like literally 20 feet to the left of your screen. You know what I mean? You've got to, you've got to figure out like a guests when they're like, you can after a while you watch it long enough. You know what's going on to the left or to the right of the play. That is literally off the TV screen. You just, Oh, the change in lines like you just know shit like that.

Speaker 5:          01:01:54       I can't see the puck. Well fucking watch bowling. You blind bastard. All right. It was a question I had last week. Someone I asked, what's the difference between a hotel in a motel? You know what I mean? And I thought it was basically, you know, if your door opens up out to the parking lot, that is a fucking motel. It's a serial killer. Doesn't have to kill somebody at a front desk and get in an elevator or at least walk a hundred yards of carpet before he kills you. That is a hotel now that is a motel. I'm sorry if he has to do that shit that is a hotel and evidently I am right. Because one person said that I was, and that's the amount of research that I do with everything in my life. Bell, if you drive up to your room, uh, you are at a motel and use as you deserve to hear the people fucking next to you.

Speaker 5:          01:02:40       Oh wait, I read that wrong because I have dyslexia. Let me start over again. Take a deep breath focused. You can do this bill. If you drive up to your room, you are at a motel and you deserve to hear the fucking people next to you talk about their free fucking Hbo. Okay. That was really funny and I butchered it. Um, anyways, he goes, uh, that shit sucks also. You're killing me. You're fucking killing me. You spent $89 on a cheap motel. Are you fucking nuts? I always hear about this internet stuff and I never do it. And he writes in capital letters. Then he goes back to regular typing. Listen to me, go to Priceline. Next time you're traveling and look up a hotel and pick the highest star rating and do not bid any more than 89 bucks and you'll get the best hotel in this city for that price.

Speaker 5:          01:03:35       I would tell you to go down to 59 or 69 bucks, but just stick with 89 bucks. Please just try it once. I travel the road for 14 years and I kicked myself in the ass when I realized what I'd been missing out on. Thanks for the free podcast are the highlight of my Monday mornings. Well, thanks for the fucking Info. That's that William Shatner. Shit. I never even, I don't even pay attention to commercials. I just look at the fucking, the glitzy lights. I'm like, oh wow. Look at, well shit. William Shatner, you know, he's keeping it going. I did star trek 40 fucking years ago and he's still working, you know, um, and he has a hell of it to pay. All right, ask bill. Here we go. Here's the gas bill. A section of the podcast that I just started there. I was all right.

Speaker 5:          01:04:24       Ask Bill. Bill. I need your advice. I had something very horrible happened to me and Oh man, this is brutal. Settle into your fucking, you're a staples office chair for this one. People. This is, this is a tough situation. All right, and I don't know if I get the uh, life experience to get you out of this one. Um, as bill. Okay, Bill, I need your advice. I had something very, very horrible happen to me and it's nobody's fault but mine. Nobody's fault but mine, Ben in and Nnn, sorry, led Zepplin. All right, have this, I have this friend who don't get me wrong, is a good friend, but is that one type of friend who's really fucking annoying but wanting to hang out 24, seven. Just recently I got a new girlfriend and I've been spending all my time with her. My friend Ben became jealous, becoming more and more annoying by making me feel bad for being with my girl.

Speaker 5:          01:05:23       Anyway, long story short to vent, I wrote an email to my girl just trashing my friend up and down the fucking road for being the moron. Wait a minute. Could you use a smaller type set? You know, I suck at reading a book, Isaac trashing my friend up and down, but being the moron that I am, and here we go, people instead of just sending it, emailing it to her, I checked the send all options, sending this horrendous email to everyone on my email list. Oops. My email list doesn't really have too many people on it, but it does have the friend I was trashing. Of course, it just made, it just made me realize that you shouldn't say things behind someone's back if he can't say it to their face. So I'm nominating myself for Douche bag of the week. Lol. What would be your advice? Send an apology email or just ignore them. Uh, that's the worst.

Speaker 5:          01:06:25       That's the worst. Because you know what sucks about that is you, you're 100% in the right that this guy is a douche bag, but now you became the Douche bag because a, and you know what's funny is if he had a girlfriend, he would be doing the same thing. He just wouldn't have been a dumb enough to fucking send, hit send to everyone. Uh, I dunno. What should you do? Should you send an apology email? No. First of all, stop writing things down on paper. That's number one. Don't ever do that. And number two, learn how to spell apology. There was no e I wouldn't just ignore him. You gotta take it like a man. You just got to walk up to him and just be like, yeah, you know, I wrote it and you know what I meant that you've been a con and a and that's it.

Speaker 5:          01:07:25       So you want to punch me in the face knowing that I'm going to defend myself and punch you too. So you know, that's kind of where we're at. I know it sucks. I don't know. You know what I think, uh, I'm getting uncomfortable thinking about the situation you put yourself in. I really don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to do with that one. Uh, you got caught and you're fucking, you kind of turned yourself in. You should be on America's dumbest Shit Talkers Llc. You know, you know that show, right? America's dumbest criminals and the guy's put whipped cream on their face and they stand in line at the bank and it melts off their face by the time they get up. This is what this guy, he did the email equivalent of that. I don't know what you got to do.

Speaker 5:          01:08:07       I would just, I the laugh, I have no idea. You know what? I got no advice on this one. I got, I got, I gotta spell this to the listeners. All right. I gotta go to way, uh, what do they say that you got to, I got a phone, a friend here. If anybody has any advices what to, what the fuck this guy supposed to do? Um, I'll read it next week because I don't know what to do. You've, you've, uh, it's checkmate. Checkmate. Uh, I dunno what to do. Dump your girlfriend, change your name and moved to Alaska. Um, either that or he had just, uh, I think you just got to take it. I think you just got to take it. All right. So what did you learn? No more fucking emails. Right? And you've got to watch out too cause you'll vent to you fucking girlfriends.

Speaker 5:          01:08:51       And even, even when she's in a good mood, she's still going to tell half the fucking story to uh, to one of her close friends. You know what I mean? I Dunno why they just stay. They really, um, I don't really think women oh bad to keeping it. He didn't guys are overrated, but their ability to keep a secret. I'm going to keep it a secret because I forget shit cause I'm, I have any sort of code. I just, you know, I have really bad memory and after like three days, I can't remember. Like you could literally be like, Bill, anyone don't say anything but I fucked so and so's wife. I feel like shit, I can't believe it. I have so much guilt. I just had to tell somebody, please don't tell anybody. And I'd be like, yeah, okay. Yeah Dude, no problem. No problem. And literally, I'm not saying two, three days later, but by a year and a half, if I went out to dinner with all the people involved, maybe sometime around dessert, I would be like, oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. He fucked that guy is who I am. That's right.

Speaker 5:          01:09:56       That's right. So it's not like I can keep a secret. I just, I can't fucking remember. Yeah, though. We got it. We got it. And then we understood what the example, you don't need to go back into it. Why don't you wrap up the fucking podcast? All right. You're 40 fucking minutes in. I right. Relax. There's gonna be a long podcast, but I don't get going here. Um, all right, let's get onto revenge stories. Okay. This is a question I have, because every revenge story seems to be from guys. None of them seem to be from females. So finally, a woman chimed in with some sort of revenge, but it wasn't really revenge. Um, or maybe it was revenge and she was just doing the typical thing that women do when they tell stories as they never get to the fucking point. No kidding. Oh, Jesus.

Speaker 5:          01:10:41       I'm crabby. Tell you. All right here. Here's one from a hormone bill. I usually don't take serious revenge on someone, but I do take, I take so much pleasure in other persons fuck ups and misery. I always take comfort finding out that someone I hate has such a miserable life. Here's a story about my egg head Douche ex boyfriend. All right. I already liked the sound of this. All right. To start to start the story. I will admit that I was a con too. Rarely. Rarely gave him any sexual, anything sexual for two years. Jesus Christ. That's one of those relationship that died the final two years and no one, no one just had the nerve to be like, hey, so why don't we both just fuck off anyways. Uh, she goes at least, uh, he put up with, with that shit. Any other guy would probably want to do stuff or get sick of it and dump my ass anyway.

Speaker 5:          01:11:34       He always played a PC games such as world of Warcraft. He got so fucking gross in that game and paying money every month to renew a subscription. What a dumb ass, however, plays can talk to other players in their guilt or on their side of the, of the game. After I broke up with them, I found out that he was talking to some chick behind my back for a year. The story gets better. Um, this is, uh, this is where my revenge happens. I don't have to do shit to ruin his life. I didn't have to do shit to ruin his life. Okay. So after I dump his ass, he continues talking to the Conti meant for them from the game. He thinks he's in love with her parentheses, retard. So we goes to Canada to be with her where she lives, I guess he thought she was going to be the one and he proposed, but a month later he gets deported back to America and like a dumb ass.

Speaker 5:          01:12:30       He lets her keep the $3,000 a ringer on her finger. After a short period of time, he tried to go back, but he gets deported again. So he's a college dropout who lives at home with his mommy and he's out three grand in addition, while after he starts dating. Oh, in addition a while after he starts dating this Jewish bitch, they were dating for about a year and a half, one and a half years. Then she dumps him because she decides it doesn't, it's not going to work out cause he's Catholic. And the icing on the cake is that all I have to do to make them feel even more pathetic is let them find out. I Bang my boyfriend and everything he does usually comes back to me because he keeps in contact with one of my good friends. Anyway. Anyone who is on my bedside who has fucked with me has always had something come back to bite them in the ass. I take great pleasure in that Jesus Christ. Wow. That is a fucking, yeah, Hell hath no fury. I love how you dumped him and you think he's a loser and you're still getting enjoyment that he has this horrific life.

Speaker 5:          01:13:48       That's scary, man. You know, I usually expect that sort of evilness out of guys. You know, and it's just really frightening. Like that's, that's a mom that's going to be somebody's mom. No, our wire hangers I believe is another of story of revenge. Um, you know what it was what that story you can think of being a jerk to that person. It's that the guy really didn't do anything to you. You know, he was a lame dude. He was a loser. You dumped him and then his life continued to go down the toilet and I don't know. And you're just enjoying him getting dizzy as he goes down on, I don't fucking get it. Anyways. Um, anyways, here we go. Here we go. Vent story number two. About 20 years ago I was living in downtown Chicago by the way. This person is like, I know I read really bad out loud, but this guy is typing, eat, and even a smaller type.

Speaker 5:          01:14:43       I don't understand. Can you guys type a little bit bigger and don't be a con and just give me the biggest size. Okay. That's really a second grade joke. All right. We're trying to do something serious here. People do whatever you want. I don't give a fuck. I'll sit here and start it through the emails bill. Okay, let me get out my magnifying glass. About 20 years ago I was living in downtown Chicago and a high rise that had a multilevel parking garage. I paid a monthly fee and had a designated covered spot. Skye was doing great. It sounded like you worked like one of those, fuck oh 20 years ago. I think he was selling health insurance. Um, anyways, one night I came home to find another car parked in my assigned spot and since it was about 2:00 AM I just said fuck it, you know, and drove to the roof deck where there was always plenty of open spaces.

Speaker 5:          01:15:29       At about 10:00 AM I was looking out the window of my apartment and I saw a tow truck driving down Lasalle Street with my car attached to the back. Since I was on the 18th floor, there was no chance to catch the tow trucks. So I went down to the office and ask the manager management why my car was towed. She said that I was parked in someone else's spot. I explained that someone was parked in my spot and that there was probably 30 empty spots on the roof deck. Plus the fact that my car had a sticker on the windshield showed that I was a resident. She said that there was nothing she could do and I asked. So I asked to speak to the person who had my car towed. She called the girl who had my car towed and she came down to the office. She was a total con about the whole situation, insisted that she did the right thing. Well, since I couldn't blast this continent face, I decided to take revenge on her car since I knew exactly where she parked. Once again, revenge is coming back to fucking up somebody's car. All right, so here we go. Here is their event. I waited about two months and then I got a syringe from my mother who was a diabetic.

Speaker 5:          01:16:42       Did you make sure she had an extra one? I hope he didn't take her last one. See, see what happens when you go down the road of revenge. Next thing you know, you stealing syringes from your mom. So anyways, I still syringe from my mom who's a diabetic. Uh, then I went to a sporting good store and bought Rut, which is basically deer urine. I then proceed to load the syringe with Rut and I injected it. I injected it into all the rubber moldings around the windows of this girls' cars. It smelled awful. My parking spot was one level below her spot and I could smell it every day. I know that taking revenge on a car is a wimpy move, but it did feel good. Always remember, revenge is a dish best served cold. Jesus Christ. Wow, man. Do you went like fucking CIA on that?

Speaker 5:          01:17:41       That's like something they would miss and like the autopsy, cause it's a little fucking needle fucking holes. Um, I got to admit that that is definitely a, I mean, fucking up. Somebody's car's not to original, but at that is that dude you grew up in the backwoods. No city kid knows about Rut. You know what I mean? Yeah. You grew up in the backwoods. You did, didn't you? Your mom's a diabetic, you know, living in a trailer, ate off of George Foreman Grill. You're going to show everybody in your high school class that you will better than this. She gets some big fancy job. You live in a high rise. You had your own spot, you know, and you will looking out your window, looking out over the south street stroke and your cock, and you thought you had the whole world by the balls. And what happened?

Speaker 5:          01:18:33       They told you fucking Mazda Miata right out of your goddamn spot, right in a, brought you right back to your childhood, didn't it? And then you took revenge the same way those kids took revenge on you. And second grade, I don't want to fucking go with this shit. All right, let's, let's go to this next one. Uh, all right, Bill. Uh, it's just another story of revenge though. So I did it check for two years on and off. And this was my first real girlfriend in high school and I thought she was the perfect, most amazing girl in the world. I was an idiot. And like 17 years old. I'm still an idiot, 23 but I sure as hell won't let this crap happen again. Anyways, I let her walk all over me and I just took it like a bitch. It was the kind of thing where she could fucking cheat on me in front of me and I believe her.

Speaker 5:          01:19:16       If she told me she wasn't, I was, I was that fucking pathetic. Eventually though, after hearing that your girlfriend is cheating on you for so long, it eats away at you. [inaudible] can you hear the foreboding music in the background? Eventually she posted some bullshit poem on my space, on my space, about some dudes she was going out with at the same time she was going out with me. Wow. That's pretty bold. And anyway, she goes, the Fucker, uh, who she was cheating with even had the balls to post on there talking about how sweet she was. So finally I had my proof. She wasn't getting out of this and here comes the revenge till I actually messaged the guy and start telling him that I've been fucking her the whole time that he's been going out with her, he starts telling me that he even knows of her cheating on him and he took her back.

Speaker 5:          01:20:07       So we teamed up to destroyer. See, you see this is, this is, this is where it goes wrong. This is where it gets evil. Why do not partake? They're teaming up now to destroy another thing and this is how it plays out. All right, here we go. By this time I was out of high school and they were both, and uh, wait a minute, but this time I was out of high school and they were both at the same high school, I guess the guy in this girl basically I showed up to her school and what we did was bring up all this shit that she did up in the middle of all her little fucking friends. She cared about so much. She cares so much about and explained how much of a horseshoe was other dudes even came up and said they were going out with her at the same time I was fucking her and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:20:57       This bitch was the fucking public bicycle. Everyone was riding. Will it completely ruined the rest of high school for now, five or six years later, me and the dude are still friends. There's a wind. There's a wind for the guys who got treated like shit out there. Yeah, it is. Yeah. I guess. I don't know, Dude. That's just fucking, I don't know, man. I cut my losses. I cut my losses. That reminds me of an intervention story where there was this girl whose dad didn't stick around. So, uh, she, I don't know what, and she developed young and, uh, the guys be like, Hey, let me see a titties. And she just showed them to them, not realize she just liked the fucking male attention. So she's dancing as a cheerleader and I don't, I don't know what she did. She blew a couple of guys.

Speaker 5:          01:21:47       And so she's dancing as a cheerleader in the hope her, her entire college. I mean, high school class just started chanting whore horror, horror, horror or something like that. And then she bursted in tears and it just became a fucking alcoholic. You know what I'm saying? But you know something, you don't, you don't have the mentality to know that at that age. And that show wasn't on. So why am I playing armchair quarterback and ruin your revenge? I Dunno. Revenge. Yanno know. I don't know. Fucking creepy man. We ruined the rest of high school for and then we high fived and kicked a puppy. All right, here we go. Overrated. Underrated. This is the last thing here. Um, overrated. And this is something that I've been meaning to bring up. This is one of the I overrated that I agree with. I think the most overrated multi-blade raisers.

Speaker 5:          01:22:39       A few months ago I started using my dad's old double, a double edge razor made almost 20 years ago before I was born. Born. It's fucking great. My face feels better than ever and I can get a hundred blades for less than what it costs for an eight pack of those three or five blade cartridges. Um, if you've got to shave like a man introduced an element of danger to it. I actually have a couple of straight razors too, but it's too much work and I don't use them on a regular basis. There's not been true this fucking, one of the worst things that ever happened to be on the road was I left my toiletries behind, I think in Tampa a long time ago. Not only did I use lose my little tough crowd, uh, a shaving kit bag, I lost that fucking thing. Um, and I, I lost my twin twin blade razor and then I went onto the triple red blazer and I have a whisker underneath my nose that it just can't get, it just doesn't get it.

Speaker 5:          01:23:32       It sucks around your chin. It's, it's terrible. The two blade razor is the shit and you will never get a closer shave than that. Everything else is fucking bullshit. I was wondering though, what about the, have you seen those things on TV? We can sharpen your razor blades. Anybody? I mean, anybody buy one of those? Huh? Is this podcast going on? Well, my God, 53 minutes. I gotta get Outta here. Alright. Underrated. Uh, your podcast. It's fucking great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Here's another good one. Overrated chicks and bars and clubs, underrated chicks at the laundromat. The skill set in these two groups is so far off. It's ridiculous. Chickson bars and clubs just spackle on so much makeup that they can barely hold their heads up long enough to accept your drink before they shoot you down. But Dude, dramatic pause raising my eyebrows type shit.

Speaker 5:          01:24:19       Um, he actually typed up, um, helping me with my reading ability. I liked that. I liked direction, but dude, a chicken, the laundromat is so sexy. It's crazy. They're wearing probably the last clean shit that they own. That's just a little too tight. They don't meet, they don't put on makeup. So dude, you're really sounding like a pervert right now and how they were in that last piece of clean closet they got. Yeah, it's a little bit too tight. Damn. Put any makeup on? They're pretty at that moment and they look unbelievable and you know, they all look like definite rest of time. I'm just reading the rest of your shit like a pervert actually do. You're actually, you're right. He makes some great points there. Plus they're doing some responsible shit while they're hung over and then trying not to throw up on their newly clean clothes.

Speaker 5:          01:25:04       Sorry, I went too long. He had dude, you did. You actually make an a great point. You do. Yeah, you did. All right. That's the end of the podcast. Okay. Kind of petered out. Kind of like the Colorado River, not reaching the ocean anymore. Um, anyways, before I'm going to be in Saint Louis this week at the house of comedy, um, I have the link right there on my website. Go to [inaudible] Dot Com B U R r.com. And I want to thank everybody who came out to my Monday shows. At the punchline in San Francisco. I really wish I talked about that in the beginning. Um, the honest with you, those were two of the best shows I've ever had in my life. Um, that second show, W it was ridiculous. Um, for those of you who weren't there, I just started telling stories and uh, I probably did close to an hour and a half, 15 minutes of which was actually from my act.

Speaker 5:          01:25:59       So, uh, you know, and it was all material I'm never going to do again because it was all family stories and fucked up shit that I would never talk about on TV. So, um, I hope you guys enjoyed it. I had a great time and I'm thinking about coming up there again in a couple of months at the punch line and maybe having that be a regular thing, just coming up on Mondays and doing a couple of shows and just venting about the people in my life, you know, and I'm not having to worry about them ever hearing about it. All right. And uh, that is it. Um, thank you for listening to the podcast. Thank you guys for contributing and, uh, what else? Oh, you know what, I, people have been asking me about my myspace page. Ask them about the comments. Um, I kind of haven't been adding accepting comments since last September.

Speaker 5:          01:26:50       I just kind of forgot about it. I just was adding friends and answering emails. I get the podcast took up a lot of times. So I'm back to accepting comments. I literally had like 400 or 600 comments that didn't allow me to, uh, you know, here it is. Comment approvals, uh, click on this right now. This is, this is garbage time right now. You don't even need to listen to this shit. I have a 419 that I have to approve a. So I'm trying to, uh, trying to get back on that shit. But anyways, that's it. Thank you guys for listening to the podcast and I'm going to try to get some new photos up there on my website and on the myspace page. That's it. You guys have a great week. Okay. Bye. Bye. Okay.
