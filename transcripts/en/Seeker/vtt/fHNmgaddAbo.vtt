00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.710
Did you fall from heaven because...I have
no idea what I'm talking about or whether

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.180
you like me at all.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.510
Hey guys and gals, I’m Trace for DNews!

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.890
Let’s talk about sex, baby.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.280
Specifically, let’s talk about how we talk
about it without talking about it.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.060
When someone is interested in someone else,
usually they don’t walk right up and announce

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.060
it.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.660
Instead people rely on the ancient art of
flirtation.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.320
A smile, a joke, a double entendre if you
know what I mean.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
We do this because flirtation tends to have
a better success rate than outright declarations

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.420
of attraction, according to a University of
New Mexico evolutionary psychologist.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.129
But declarative statements, while robotic
and off putting, at least have the advantage

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.879
of being unambiguous.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.179
Flirting?

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.179
Not so much.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.260
First of all, people can have a lot of different
reasons for flirting.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
According to research out of Northern Illinois
University, there are six reasons people flirt:

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.890
casual fun, testing the waters, increasing
intimacy, boosting self-esteem, trying to

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.190
gain something from the other person, and
of course, expressing sexual interest.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.159
So the miscues happen when men and women misinterpret
signals.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.450
Women either read too much into subtle clues
or miss them entirely about evenly.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.380
Men, on the other hand, see false positives
way more often and tend to see what they want

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380
to see.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.170
In a forthcoming study in Personality and
Individual Differences, researchers from Union

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.230
College and Harvard asked nearly 500 men to
imagine a woman in a nightclub who notices

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.280
she’s being stared at and smiles back.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.149
That wouldn’t be my reaction if 500 men
were staring at me but anyway, the men were

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.880
then asked to gauge her level of interest.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.249
First, the men were rated on whether they
craved intimacy, or whether they distrusted

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:41.249
it.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.659
Those who ranked higher in distrust tended
to think women were less interested in them

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.069
and didn’t see the smile as flirtation.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.299
But the men who craved intimacy tended to
project it on the woman.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.490
In other words, they imagined a completely
hypothetical woman smiling at them and thought,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.939
“Oh yeah, she totally digs me.”

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.500
Even when non-imaginary women are involved,
men aren’t so great at reading their body

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.799
language.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.590
One study from the University of Indiana asked
280 male and female undergraduates to look

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.750
at pictures of women and determine if they
were being friendly, sexually interested,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.280
sad, or rejecting.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.220
The female participants hit the mark more
often, while the males tended to read too

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.099
much into friendly body language.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.200
It’s tempting to think this is because men
are always looking for sex, but actually men

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.740
often misread cues in the opposite direction
- they mistook sexual cues for simple friendliness.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.540
Another small study conducted at the LWL University
in Germany examined 22 men in fMRI machines

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.959
while they looked at pictures of men’s and
women’s eyes and tried to guess what emotion

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.580
they were feeling.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.910
These men took longer and were less accurate
when guessing womens’ emotions, and their

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.689
amygdalae, which help interpret emotions and
empathy, were less active than when they looked

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.830
in men’s eyes.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.349
Of course, not all men are terrible at taking
a hint.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.060
Some are quite skilled at it, while some women
struggle.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.790
But overall, according to some social science,
men are more likely to wrongly assume a woman

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.490
is interested in them, than the other way
around.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.019
So how do you tell what she’s thinking without
blowing it?

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.549
Luckily for you, Tara has a video explaining
the correct way to flirt.

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.549
Check it out here.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:34.599
Let’s do a 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.189
little science too, guys and girls.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.439
How often would you say you misread clues
and picked up on something that wasn’t there?

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.140
Or how often were you completely oblivious
to someone else’s advances?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.640
Let us know in the comments, or on facebook
or Twitter @DNews, it should make for fun

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.640
reading.
