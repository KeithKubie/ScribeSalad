if your has this unique ability to
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.600
if your has this unique ability to
really take you there and that's sort of

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
really take you there and that's sort of
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.459
really take you there and that's sort of
a something I've been trying to do in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
a something I've been trying to do in
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.129
a something I've been trying to do in
traditional still images and documentary

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
traditional still images and documentary
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680

film and and and those mediums have a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
film and and and those mediums have a
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.710
film and and and those mediums have a
great power to influence but I was

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
great power to influence but I was
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.630
great power to influence but I was
always frustrated with the inability to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
always frustrated with the inability to
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.590
always frustrated with the inability to
really take a first-person subjective

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600
really take a first-person subjective
 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.570
really take a first-person subjective
experience and let someone see it for

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
experience and let someone see it for
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970
experience and let someone see it for
themselves and VR can start to do that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
themselves and VR can start to do that
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.630
themselves and VR can start to do that
I can place people into worlds that they

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
I can place people into worlds that they
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.810
I can place people into worlds that they
may never otherwise see and experience

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
may never otherwise see and experience
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869
may never otherwise see and experience
something firsthand in a way that is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
something firsthand in a way that is
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.869
something firsthand in a way that is
very different than watching a film you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879
very different than watching a film you
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.899
very different than watching a film you
recall it as a memory instead of I saw a

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909
recall it as a memory instead of I saw a
 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.139
recall it as a memory instead of I saw a
movie I actually was there in this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
movie I actually was there in this
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.329
movie I actually was there in this
experience and so those memories

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339
experience and so those memories
 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.169
experience and so those memories
actually encode in a in a stronger way

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179
actually encode in a in a stronger way
 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.559
actually encode in a in a stronger way
and I think that allows us to reflect

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569
and I think that allows us to reflect
 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.560
and I think that allows us to reflect
and process them in a more personal way

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570
and process them in a more personal way
 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.920
and process them in a more personal way
you have an emotional connection and you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
you have an emotional connection and you
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580
you have an emotional connection and you
get as close to being in their position

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
get as close to being in their position
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230
get as close to being in their position
as possible it's not completely a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
as possible it's not completely a
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969
as possible it's not completely a
first-person perspective and there's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
first-person perspective and there's
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.249
first-person perspective and there's
there's some testing and research around

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
there's some testing and research around
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.630
there's some testing and research around
that where could we actually embody

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
that where could we actually embody
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670
that where could we actually embody
someone else that's a little bit harder

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
someone else that's a little bit harder
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.859
someone else that's a little bit harder
but right now we know we can bet least

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
but right now we know we can bet least
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200
but right now we know we can bet least
be very close and when you are very

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
be very close and when you are very
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660
be very close and when you are very
close to someone and you're seeing what

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
close to someone and you're seeing what
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.149
close to someone and you're seeing what
they're experiencing you start to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
they're experiencing you start to
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740
they're experiencing you start to
internalize that we have these mirror

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
internalize that we have these mirror
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.420
internalize that we have these mirror
neurons that we can feel what other

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
neurons that we can feel what other
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.639
neurons that we can feel what other
people are feeling and that reflection

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649
people are feeling and that reflection
 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.950
people are feeling and that reflection
that I think is invoked from these

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
that I think is invoked from these
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.609
that I think is invoked from these
powerful experiences can start to foster

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
powerful experiences can start to foster
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.450
powerful experiences can start to foster
empathy for the other and it can

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
empathy for the other and it can
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.959
empathy for the other and it can
dissolve your own ego and help you take

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969
dissolve your own ego and help you take
 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.660
dissolve your own ego and help you take
the perspective of someone else and I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
the perspective of someone else and I
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.419
the perspective of someone else and I
think this special ability of VR is

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429
think this special ability of VR is
 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.380
think this special ability of VR is
really important for the the urgent

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
really important for the the urgent
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.039
really important for the the urgent
crisis that we're facing especially

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
crisis that we're facing especially
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.370
crisis that we're facing especially
climate change which it can be hard to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380
climate change which it can be hard to
 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.499
climate change which it can be hard to
dig into to really lean into because it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
dig into to really lean into because it
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.670
dig into to really lean into because it
seems so big and abstract and but when

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
seems so big and abstract and but when
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.280
seems so big and abstract and but when
you are experiencing climate change

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
you are experiencing climate change
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920
you are experiencing climate change
right in the places that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
right in the places that
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.339
right in the places that
it's it's happening you feel like it's

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349
it's it's happening you feel like it's
 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.899
it's it's happening you feel like it's
it's here that you're getting this

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909
it's here that you're getting this
 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.199
it's here that you're getting this
glimpse into the future of a world of

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
glimpse into the future of a world of
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.979
glimpse into the future of a world of
extreme weather of dried out desert

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989
extreme weather of dried out desert
 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.910
extreme weather of dried out desert
conditions of refugees of pristine

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
conditions of refugees of pristine
 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.640
conditions of refugees of pristine
ecosystems collapsing and being

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
ecosystems collapsing and being
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.670
ecosystems collapsing and being
destroyed and so when you can actually

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
destroyed and so when you can actually
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.979
destroyed and so when you can actually
experience these events as if you were

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
experience these events as if you were
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.199
experience these events as if you were
there you internalize them and I think

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
there you internalize them and I think
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360
there you internalize them and I think
that starts to lead to this process of

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
that starts to lead to this process of
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000
that starts to lead to this process of
well am i participating in it am i

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
well am i participating in it am i
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610
well am i participating in it am i
consuming fossil fuels that I don't need

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
consuming fossil fuels that I don't need
 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.490
consuming fossil fuels that I don't need
to can i divest from some of the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
to can i divest from some of the
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.970
to can i divest from some of the
industries that are responsible for this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
industries that are responsible for this
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.569
industries that are responsible for this
crisis and so I think that reflection

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579
crisis and so I think that reflection
 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.270
crisis and so I think that reflection
was really important because it leads to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
was really important because it leads to
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.479
was really important because it leads to
or is necessary to lead to action in

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
or is necessary to lead to action in
 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.349
or is necessary to lead to action in
one's own life and there's a whole

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359
one's own life and there's a whole
 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.580
one's own life and there's a whole
threshold of different actions one can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
threshold of different actions one can
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.809
threshold of different actions one can
take to engage with this this incredible

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819
take to engage with this this incredible
 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.220
take to engage with this this incredible
environmental problem that we're facing

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
environmental problem that we're facing
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.490
environmental problem that we're facing
and so you know this chain of events I

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
and so you know this chain of events I
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.009
and so you know this chain of events I
think can be triggered through a

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019
think can be triggered through a
 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.280
think can be triggered through a
singular powerful experience and so with

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290
singular powerful experience and so with
 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.330
singular powerful experience and so with
this medium we can convey not just

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
this medium we can convey not just
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.849
this medium we can convey not just
information we can convey emotional

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859
information we can convey emotional
 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.520
information we can convey emotional
fidelity in a way that we haven't been

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
fidelity in a way that we haven't been
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.229
fidelity in a way that we haven't been
able to do with with such clarity and so

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
able to do with with such clarity and so
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.289
able to do with with such clarity and so
we can really feel what it's like to be

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299
we can really feel what it's like to be
 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.979
we can really feel what it's like to be
a mother in the deserts of Somalia

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989
a mother in the deserts of Somalia
 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.099
a mother in the deserts of Somalia
trying to find food for her children and

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109
trying to find food for her children and
 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.610
trying to find food for her children and
and having to flee to the outskirts of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
and having to flee to the outskirts of
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.319
and having to flee to the outskirts of
cities into huge camps and and seeing

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329
cities into huge camps and and seeing
 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.030
cities into huge camps and and seeing
that they're really just trying to care

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
that they're really just trying to care
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.830
that they're really just trying to care
for their families just as we would do

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
for their families just as we would do
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.229
for their families just as we would do
if we were there and so I think it has

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239
if we were there and so I think it has
 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.069
if we were there and so I think it has
this ability to help us invoke the

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079
this ability to help us invoke the
 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.440
this ability to help us invoke the
empathy that we all have and cultivate

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450
empathy that we all have and cultivate
 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.930
empathy that we all have and cultivate
the compassion and the action that is

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
the compassion and the action that is
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.460
the compassion and the action that is
needed to address so many of the world's

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
needed to address so many of the world's
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.470
needed to address so many of the world's
problems

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480
 
 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.540
 
you
