00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The angles he measured by degrees, of course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Enrico Giusti, Curator, Garden of Archimedes ] For the unit of length, he used the stadium,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but he didn't measure with a rope or something,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but he estimated the distance between Syene and Alexandria

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by the time that a camel would need to go from one city to another.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Eratosthenes measure was rather accurate for the time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Even for modern standards, it was say about 10%.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The source of error was essentially the estimation of the distance,

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because the angles he could measure with a good accuracy.
