1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,880
Happen. The Joe Rogan experience that they
have some sort of special couch. Okay,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,990
dog, my friend's girlfriend, we're all
sitting around. My friend's girlfriend,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,630
so hot, so hot is one of those. Go with
Zach. We're sitting there and she goes,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,560
and I was,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,560
I was meditating and I saw a deer and it
looked at me and the deer gave me love

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,280
and we're all like, I'm just looking
at her tits. I was a young gun, Lazy.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,240
She's so hot. She, she, she's so,
she's such an estrogen, you know.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,500
And um, my buddy, of course, you know,
you had those swords and can't let it go.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,140
Just let it go. Let her have
her thing. My buddy goes,

10
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:41,520
what gave you love?
Explain that shit to me.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,190
Explaining why I get all
biological. Well, you know what?

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,900
You're close minded and
you're not intuitive.

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,990
I'm really intuitive and it became
massive, intuitive. My favorite thing,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,311
I love that shit.

15
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,550
But those people that claim that they
have some special connection with animals,

16
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:57,890
like animals just recognize who I
am. They know my nature. You know,

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,170
kind of schooled me,
Megan Fox.

18
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,020
I was doing a movie with her and,

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,110
and I assumed she started talking about
signs and I was making fun of like

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,420
psychics and signs and all,
and Megan goes, well, um,

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,900
maybe you ever think that maybe you're
a little close minded. And I go, no,

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,120
not scientific minded and no I'm not.

23
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,970
And I think all psychics are liars
and I think astrology is bullshit.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,330
But then like Megan literally went into
her knowledge of science and geology and

25
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,430
everything else and I was like,
oh, you're a fucking, oh wait,

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,580
you're a really hot intellectual
and you know a shit load.

27
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,820
And I made a judgment on you. It was very,
it was actually embarrassing isn't it?

28
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,750
And interestingly, you would automatically
make a judgment on someone who's hot,

29
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,560
like Ah, utilize been easy as fuck.
Right. And she's not like that.

30
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,710
Like a judgment that you would
make on the son of a rich man.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,410
Like if someone correct grew up in,

32
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:57,180
is in the family business and his
father was a, a very successful man,

33
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:00,240
but he's taking over the family business,
you would assume this guy's a bitch.

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,270
Yup. Right? Yup. Most of the time. Most
of the time you're wrong. So often. Yes.

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,230
It's such a bad debt. Yeah. Cause like if
a great, if a great man has a son, yeah.

36
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,560
Most like he's going to teach that Sun's
cool shit and the sun's going to have

37
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:17,220
to like live up to a certain standard.
Right. Well that was the thing with Megan.

38
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,410
I would notice after I had
that interaction with her,

39
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:22,440
I've known her a little bit cause I know
her husband really well. And then, uh,

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,170
and then I noticed that every
time we wouldn't be shooting,

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,900
she'd be reading a book of substance.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,050
Like that's what she does when she's
not on set. So I was like, well,

43
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,140
what are you doing? You're, you're,
you're laying an iPhone next to your head.

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,830
What am I doing?

45
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,350
Their iPhone next to the other side
of your head and you have these weird

46
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,560
conversations with that.
That's my favorite thing you did.

47
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,500
I got to start doing that again.
