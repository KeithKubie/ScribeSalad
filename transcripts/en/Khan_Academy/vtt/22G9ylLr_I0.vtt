00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.168
- Used to stutter a lot.

00:00:03.168 --> 00:00:04.254
I couldn't speak to someone.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:05.400
I couldn't look at them in the eyes.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.140
Everything was just intimidating to me.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.705
I used to be a totally different person

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:11.205
before I got into the program.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:12.998
Look at me now.

00:00:12.998 --> 00:00:14.347
I'm the group commander.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.180
I'm number one.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.013
I'm in charge.

00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:16.846
To the rear.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:17.679
March!

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.541
I really wanna be a lawyer
inside the military.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.553
And I have to do a lot
of things to get there.

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:27.735
That's what I love about it
because it pushed me to study

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.818
just like ROTC pushed me.

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:32.375
I'm a very determined person.

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:34.233
I won't stop until I get what I want,

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:38.341
so practice, practice, practice
and practice for my SAT.

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.799
If I have to study more,
if I have to stay up,

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.907
I will do it to get there.

00:00:42.907 --> 00:00:44.077
I know there's a reward at the end,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.997
but I'm not working for the reward.

00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:48.233
I'm working for something bigger.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.359
I'm gonna keep going because
this is what I wanna do.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.403
This is my goal, and
I wanna accomplish it.

00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:55.736
(upbeat, driving music)
