David, do we really care whether or
not the autonomous vehicle thinks and

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.939
acts the way we do?

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; I guess, now that you mention it,

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.370
as long as the vehicle gets me to
my destination and doesn't run over

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.700
anything on the way, I really don't
care if it does think the way I do.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.100
And if you look at the way I drive, I
really hope it doesn't act the way I do.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.300
&gt;&gt; So the autonomous vehicle may really
belong to the acting rationally side

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.620
of the spectrum.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.740
At the same time,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.220
looking at the way humans write
might help us design a robot.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.340
And looking at the robot design might
help us reflect on human cognition.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.347
This is one of the patterns
of knowledge-based data.
