Ah internet trolls - whether it’s on twitter,
a forum, or even these very YouTube comments...ehem...we

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.870
can’t seem to escape them. But who are these
people - and what do they look like when we

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.100
evaluate them scientifically?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.270
While many people do enjoy chatting and debating
issues online, approximately 5.6% of individuals

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.570
self identify as trolls, or say they enjoy
trolling online. So, scientists studied a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.960
group of 1200 internet users to understand
these trolls in particular and found a myriad

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.809
of something called ‘dark traits’. Specifically,
online trolls were found to display high levels

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:45.019
of psychopathy, narcissism and most specifically
sadism; that is, people who enjoy the pain

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:45.809
of others.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.010
Now, most people tend to avoid inflicting
pain on others, and if we do, we experience

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.969
guilt or remorse. But for sadists, cruelty
can be exciting and pleasurable. These people

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.579
aren’t necessarily serial killers or bad
people, but they get an emotional reward when

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.500
causing or observing the suffering of others.
In fact, there’s even a category called

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.920
‘everyday sadism’ that highlights how
sadistic traits are present in many people

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.190
- not just sexual deviants and criminals.
For example, many of us enjoy a good fight

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.500
during a sports game or the thrill of a violent
movie, right?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.430
If you were given the choice of the following
4 jobs, which would you choose? a) Killing

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.230
bugs b) helping an experimenter kill bugs
c) cleaning dirty toilets or d) enduring pain

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.420
from ice water? Studies show that those who
choose to kill bugs have higher scores on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170
a scale measuring sadistic impulses.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.770
But internet trolls show very high levels
as sadism and have fun distressing others

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.980
by being argumentative and disruptive. Studies
have also documented a link between these

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.730
individuals and anti-social behaviour. So
are these individuals different in real life?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.350
Not likely - the studies suggest that these
traits carry over into their regular day-to-day

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.940
and reflect one’s actual personality. But
since the internet offers anonymity, antisocial

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.149
individuals can connect with similar others
while distancing themselves from their acts

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.319
in terms of personal responsibility.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.030
The unfortunate part is that trolls not only
comment more but receive more replies than

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.269
the average user, suggesting they are quite
successful at luring others in. On top of

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.040
this, negative feedback only stimulates a
harsher response from trolls, and their behaviour

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.329
becomes worse over time with more feedback.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.069
So, the next time you’re being trolled,
just remember, they WANT to disrupt you - and

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.269
they feed off of your unhappiness. Ignore
them, and you’re likely to diminish their

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:38.659
effort.
