[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.390
JAMES FALLOWS: Thank you all
for coming out this afternoon.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.160
Deb and I are really
happy to be here.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.170
We've had connections with
this city for a long time.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.840
In fact, it was 50
years ago right now

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.240
in this very city we
met on a blind date,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.860
and we've been together
ever since then.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.260
So we're glad to come back
to where it all started.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.840
We have any family
ties with this company

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
and its different
incarnations around the world.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.800
One of our sons, Tom, worked
for about four years at Google.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.690
If you've ever seen
Google Shopping Express,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.030
that was his project
when he worked there.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.910
So we're glad to be here
and excited to give you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.930
what we think is a different
message about the country

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.330
that we are all living
in now and that will

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.340
shape your collective futures.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.860
The way-- we're going
to do this alternating.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.750
I'm going to give a brief intro.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.460
Then Deb will tell
you about something

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.410
that she thinks you'll
find surprising.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.040
Then I'll tell you
some more surprises.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.790
Then Deb will have an
additional surprise.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.960
And I'll have the
payoff at the end.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.150
And then we'll have
time for questions.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.820
So we'll go back and
forth for about 25 minutes

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.660
and try to leave
you feeling, we hope

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.230
better, and at least
indifferent about the condition

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.814
of the US and the world.

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:18.980
And the way I thought I'd
introduce what we're doing

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.890
is to read a quote
from an editorial

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.160
recently in the Bakersfield,
California newspaper.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.190
Who here has been
to Bakersfield?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.290
Those of you who
have been there,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.540
will join me in saying
Bakersfield is not

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.910
the Marin County or Santa
Monica of California.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.340
I'm from inland California too.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.680
Bakersfield is sort
of a hard scrabble

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.140
place in the southern end
of the Central Valley.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.180
And the editorial in
the Bakersfield paper

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.260
last week said "there is
a quietly growing movement

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.900
brewing in the
interior of America.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.120
Pretty soon it will
boil over and it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.730
about time somebody covered it."

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.070
We all know that kind of
rhetoric over the past two

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.160
years in American discourse,
where the next paragraph has

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.710
been people are angry,
people are upset,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.070
people want to tear things down,
people are bitter and divided.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.205
In fact, this was an
editorial in Bakersfield

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:10.580
about the book
and Deb and I have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.400
done and saying that
there is, city by city

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.120
across the country, this
sense of reinvention, renewal,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.700
experimentation,
new possibility that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.960
is at such dramatic odds
with the national discourse

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.890
that we all are aware of.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.740
So that is the
experience that Deb and I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.910
have had over the last four-plus
years traveling around.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.530
And we'll try to
convince you of it

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.840
by the time we are done here.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.370
So let me tell you
just a little bit

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.450
about how we
presume to know what

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.830
we tell you we know about state
of the United States right now.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.920
I worked for "The Atlantic"
for a very long time.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.710
The magazine is
now 161 years old.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.670
Is that right?

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.360
It was founded in 1857.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.450
So that would be more or
less, I think, 161 years old.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.020
I worked for as an employee
for more than one quarter

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.730
of its total existence.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.140
And we spent a lot of
that time living overseas.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.320
We've lived China
for a long time.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.660
Deb wrote a wonderful
book about China

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.730
called "Dreaming
in Chinese," which

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.970
had not the trifecta but
the daily-double of "The New

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.530
Yorker" and "Oprah"
both lauded this book.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.500
so we were in China
for a long time.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.490
We were in Japan.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.590
We've been in Malaysia.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.670
And in all these jaunts
around the world,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.540
we have tried to do our best
to get out of the big cities,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.930
to go on trains, on
ox carts, on buses;

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.550
however we could to see
the fabric of a country.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.350
And we've been doing that
in China from 12 years ago,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.020
2006 we moved there; off and
on, we came back in 2009,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.430
went again to China
in 2011, and finally

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.100
came back from China in 2011.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.070
And the discourse of world
coverage of the US then,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.560
if you remember back, was
the US had led the world

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.630
into financial depression.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.630
And the US was finally
reaping the rewards of this.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.700
The US was really falling apart.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.830
So we thought as we
got back to the US,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.520
why not try to apply the same
reportorial approach we'd

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.770
had in China, in
Malaysia, in Japan,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770
and West Africa and
all the rest to the US?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.470
And in our little propeller
plane, who here is a pilot?

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.970
Come on.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.330
Who here is a pilot aspirant?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.750
Who here is interested
in the aerial view?

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.520
Yeah, OK.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.060
So for a long time we'd been
flying around the country

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.100
in our little Cirrus airplane.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.970
Side note, Cirruses are now the
most popular small airplanes

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.510
in the world,
single-engine planes,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.370
because they have a parachute
for the entire airplane.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.730
And in time of distress,
there's a little red

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.150
handle on the roof of the
cockpit which you pull,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.430
and the entire airplane
comes to the earth

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.324
gently with a parachute.

00:04:54.324 --> 00:04:55.490
So we've been flying around.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.040
And we knew there were
lots of parts of the US

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.860
that you could more easily
get to by small airplane

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.190
than you could any other way.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.010
And so we thought
we'd been to places

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.020
like Grand Island, Nebraska; and
Rock Springs, Wyoming; and Red

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.080
Oak, Iowa and other places of
that sort, what would be like

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.130
systematically to look
city by city to see how

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.610
the recovery was doing,
what the temper of the times

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.110
would turn out to be.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.750
So five years ago in
the spring of 2013,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.530
I put an item on my part of
"The Atlantic" site saying,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.350
tell us why we should
come to your town.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.350
We're looking for
smaller towns by which we

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.220
meant things that were usually
presented in a two dimensional

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.770
or one dimensional way
in the national media.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.730
They weren't the 3D
full human actors

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.450
that you saw from New York
or DC or LA or San Francisco,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.220
but rather people
who were covered

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.710
when there was a shooting,
or when there was a tornado,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.540
or when the Iowa
caucuses were happening,

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.370
or when there was
some concept piece.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.560
So tell us about a
smaller town that's

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.910
not usually in the media that
has had some kind of problem--

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.690
factory closing, drought;
you name the problem

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.090
and has an interesting
part of its response.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.430
And we'd like to
come here about it.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.431
We got about 1,000 essays on
one of those Google response

00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:16.930
forums.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.600
I forget what's--
what's the term for it,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.200
where I ask people some
spreadsheet that auto populate.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.840
We got more than 1,000
essays, people saying here's

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.820
why Moline is the
city of the future.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.190
Here's why Yakima, Washington
is a city you should come to.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.730
And over the last, since
from the summer of 2013

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.160
until early 2017, we spent about
half our time on the road, city

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.800
by city.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.990
You will see that we were in
the far Northeast in Eastport,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.530
Maine; the far Southwest
in Ajo, Arizona.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.550
We were in the Central
Valley of California,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.370
and places with some
really hard times.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.010
And the cumulative
message that we

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.540
ended up presenting in
hundreds of web posts

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.130
and in some articles
and in this book now

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.770
are that the narrative of
America at the cellular level,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.090
or at the organic systems level,
is really different from what

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.590
it is at the national level.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.630
And most people feel much
more hopeful, much better,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.350
and much more engaged about
the part of the United States

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.586
that they experience
in their direct lives

00:07:29.586 --> 00:07:31.960
than they do about the part
that comes through the media.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.860
And the polls reflect this
too with only about 25%

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.770
of the public thinks the
US is on the right course,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.844
but about 80% of the public
thinks their own communities

00:07:41.844 --> 00:07:43.010
are on the right course now.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.040
And that's been a stable
finding for the past few years.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.710
So this was a journey of
a lot of surprises for us.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.220
And I will tell you about a sort
of checklist of main surprises

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.830
and take-homes in just a moment.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.680
But I give you now miss
Deborah Fellows, who

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.180
is going to tell you about one
of the central surprises that

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.554
is related to a
lot of your work.

00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:03.640
DEBORAH FALLOW: Thank you.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.340
JAMES FALLOWS: Deborah?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.840
DEBORAH FALLOW: You
can call me Deb.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.390
When Jim I first
landed in a town

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.270
and we would usually stay for
a couple of weeks at a time,

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.820
we rounded up the usual
suspects and went out together

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.570
on our first day.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.120
We talked to a newspaper
editor, somebody connected

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.400
with schools, maybe the
Chamber of Commerce,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.740
the mayor or the city manager.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.030
We'd hang out in brewpubs.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.270
We'd wrangle people on
the streets and on bikes.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.490
And then we would split up after
that and follow their lead.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:40.240
Jim usually covered political
and economic development kinds

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.220
of things, what was the
business of the town.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.470
I would go to a lot of
the social institutions,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.370
like the schools, and the
public libraries, and the YMCAs;

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.720
places like that.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.520
I want to tell you
today a little bit

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.800
about my favorite
one of all, which

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.930
is this thriving
public institution

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.540
of the public
libraries in towns.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.670
And this completely
took me off base.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.670
Because the library I grew
up with is a very quiet kind

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.710
of intimidating place
where librarians

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.130
who are always kind of mean
would shush you and not

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.480
allow you to talk.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.970
I can see that a lot
of you are probably

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.940
in a next generation
of libraries.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.610
But what I learned
about the libraries

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.470
is mainly in three
different categories--

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.730
education, technology,
and civic and social life

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.260
as a community center.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.450
I'll lead with the
technology, because that's

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.830
where you all are.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.530
And as a reality
check, I'm going

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.680
to tell you a little story
of what I heard and saw

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.270
in the Columbus, Ohio
main public library.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.910
Usually when you walk in, there
are big banks of computers

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.240
everywhere, as there
were in this library.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.190
And one of the most
popular things going on

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.780
at those computers
is a job search.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.600
So there was a young man
sitting at the computer.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.380
And a librarian had come over
to help him look for a job.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.180
They scrolled all
around, found a couple

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.780
of things that seemed likely
and possible, landed on one,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.920
and she drew up the application
for this job on the computer

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.700
and said.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.659
You fill it in.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:10.700
I'll come back in 15
minutes, we'll look it over,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.710
and we'll take it from there.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.240
She went away came
back after 15 minutes.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.200
And he had indeed filled
it in, the application,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.340
but with a marking pen on
the face of the screen.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.810
So that is the degree
of low-end technology

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.020
and the challenge for public
libraries in that respect.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.980
On the high end, it's much
more what you would probably

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.880
recognize, maker spaces.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.370
In our hometown of Washington
DC at the main public library,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.080
I went on a tour of
the maker spaces.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.100
There was standing room
only, everything from artists

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.240
to people doing start-ups, to a
mom who was there with her two

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.490
home schooled kids trying
to figure out projects,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.130
and education in
everything from how

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.210
to use 3D printers, to laser
cutters, to you name it,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.080
and even stuff like you might
have seen in a family home

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.690
basement workshop.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.630
And another interesting
thing is maybe

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:13.820
some of you have started in
libraries, where entrepreneurs

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.570
who can't afford a home office
or any kind of office to rent,

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.270
will sit day after day in the
same spot at the main reading

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.810
room and get their
company going from there,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.270
take a break to take
calls in the garden

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.905
or a latte in the shop.

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:29.780
And I asked the librarians,
is this something

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.190
that you resent that all these
"young people" as we call you,

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.100
are starting companies
in your library?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.100
And they said, absolutely not.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.900
We just hope when
they're successful they

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.440
remember where they started and
can come back here and support

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.160
us.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.330
So education in libraries,
one of the first things

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.210
that directors
will always say is

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.280
you've got to see the
children's section.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.470
If there's any extra
money in libraries,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.210
it will go to the
children's section

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.690
to try to fill in the gaps
of education that are around

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.310
in towns, the preschool
and pre-reading.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.440
If I said, tell me,
what's reading readiness?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.390
And the library
director said, if you've

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.390
got a kindergartner going into
school and hand them a book

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.420
and he holds it upside down,
there is no reading readiness

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:20.960
there.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.300
So that's that kind of starting
point of where education

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.720
is in libraries is
a lot of dedication

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.550
to the preschool for kids.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.800
Preschool skills,
it goes all the way

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.700
through elementary school,
homework help, special areas

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.490
for high schoolers that are
kind of cool so kids want

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.180
to hang out there, and adult
literacy which is often

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.280
the most popular
program for volunteers,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.980
adults teaching
adults how to read.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.540
In the social and civic
sense, the civic engagement

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.010
in libraries is really basic.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.940
It's everything from ESL,
to citizenship courses,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.860
to tax preparation,
to welcoming refugees

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.710
in towns as their kind
of first landing spot.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.300
And then there's
the social stuff,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.760
which is really the fun stuff
that goes on with libraries.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.430
At my library, there's
Yoga every Tuesday.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.150
On Saturdays at 4:00 PM in the
main reading room of the DC

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.400
Public Library, I walked in.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.130
And there were 70
people doing the tango.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.220
There were the professionals
with music accompaniment.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.070
There were the regulars who were
learning how to do the tango.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.630
And it's all kinds
of lending programs.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.784
In Duluth, Minnesota, there's
a seed lending library,

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:39.450
take your seats.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.491
Plant them in the garden.

00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:41.760
Bring them back next.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.770
In Burlington, Vermont,
the kids come in

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.725
to borrow snow shovel
equipment on the weekends

00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:51.350
to make a little
money shoveling snow.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.950
Take it back.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.410
In my hometown of Vermilion,
Ohio which is on Lake Erie,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.980
you can borrow fishing
poles and go out swimming.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.700
In Denver, you can borrow the
complete backpack and hiking

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.480
equipment from libraries
to go hiking there.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:13.790
So it's the point of all this
is that in towns, in local town

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.330
America, the library is really
the institution that is filling

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.380
in the gaps that are there
in the way that they can--

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.830
in civic, social, educational,
and technological sense.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.580
And so part of what we
really feel strongly about

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.320
is to try to get
this message out.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.720
Because so many
librarians I heard

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.010
said after explaining all the
things that their libraries

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.500
did, said that one
of our problems

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.200
is that the libraries are
the best kept secret in town.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.930
And that's a place
they don't want to be.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.120
So Jim's surprise number two.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.690
JAMES FALLOWS: So
Deb was telling you

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.520
about libraries as a surprise.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.759
We had assumed.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.300
So how many of you
would have assumed

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.390
that libraries are on the way
down, of like Barnes Noble

00:14:59.390 --> 00:14:59.890
or whatever?

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.600
We've seeing them
as coming back.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.750
Here is a quick list,
just I'll list them

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.150
without elaborating very
much, of other things that

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.630
were surprising to me
personally that I wouldn't

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.287
have guessed five years ago.

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:15.620
I have an article in the
current issue of "The Atlantic"

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.310
in which I say that reporting
is the process of learning

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.920
what you didn't know
until you showed up.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.040
And these were things that why
I've loved being a reporter

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.290
is the things you experienced
by being out there.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.380
So here is a quick
list of things

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.110
that we think are lessons
of seeing the country

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.520
city by city, and not asking
people about national politics.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.080
The first of them
is particularly

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.010
relevant to a place like this.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.250
How many of you started out in--

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.590
I'm going to separate
the US into metropolis

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.630
and countryside.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.130
So metropolis is Boston, DC, LA.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.690
Countryside is every place else.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.360
How many of you started
out in metropolis?

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.790
And how many started
out countryside?

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.440
So we have a mixture here.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.350
And those of you who have
come to a place like Cambridge

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.167
and Boston, you illustrate
one of the great trends

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.000
of American history and
world history, which

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.880
is the concentration of
people in these big centers.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.210
Finance in New York, education
and medicine and tech

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.140
and Boston, entertainment in
LA; we know the whole drill.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.680
And that, of course, is a very
important ongoing pressure.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.770
We were really struck
again and again

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.870
by this sort of reverse osmotic
flow of people who thought

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.850
I have had a job in Cambridge.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.210
I do have a job offer in
Seattle or in New York City.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.300
But for me and my family,
the overall life balance

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.680
is much better in Fresno, or
in Greenville, or in Duluth,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.100
or in Erie or in a lot
of the other towns we're

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.680
talking about for a
combination of reasons that

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.130
involve real estate, arbitrage.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.930
There's a dozen cities
in the United States

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.270
where your life is
destroyed by real estate

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.920
and every place else is cheap.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.985
And so there is that
factor that makes

00:16:56.985 --> 00:16:58.610
people think they
can start their lives

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.550
and their families
better elsewhere.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.280
There is a sense of
engagement, of being

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.810
in a scale of
place where you can

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.780
make things happen, as opposed
to just sort of observing

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.940
what happens.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.470
There are local ties
of people feeling

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.140
that they're imprinted by
the feel of the Midwest,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.740
or the feel of the South, or the
feel of the Pacific Northwest.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:24.380
But again, our book is presented
as a shaggy chronicle, sort

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.379
of a whole earth catalog of
things that are happening

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.170
around the country.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.120
But you'll hear stories
of people like you all,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.050
who thought that the
better balance for them

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.810
was someplace other
than their metropolis.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:41.360
A second surprise involved the
political temper of the times.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.310
How many of you have
heard, oh, the nation is

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.870
more divided than ever before?

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.340
We've all heard that.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.250
It's true in Washington DC.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.890
It's true on cable news.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.060
It's not true of
most of the country

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.360
and most of what it does.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.850
And here is the easiest way I
know how to illustrate that.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.430
Have any of you been to
Greenville, South Carolina?

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.460
It's a really now economically
and culturally progressive

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:05.960
place.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.600
It has a BMW plant.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.671
A Michelin plant, et cetera,
and a very beautiful downtown.

00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:15.170
I assume most of you have been
to Burlington, Vermont, which

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.460
is very near here.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.770
Politically these
are opposite cities.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.020
Burlington, home
of Bernie Sanders;

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.650
Greenville, home of Trey
Gowdy and Jim DeMint

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.090
in South Carolina.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.740
If you didn't know
they were opposite,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.540
you would think they
were the same city.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.210
They work the same way, the
university, with the mayor,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.930
with the downtown organizations.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.460
And if we didn't ask people
about the divisive issues

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.250
of national politics, they
didn't usually come up.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.260
And there was sort of
the practical mindedness

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.390
that you'd like to
think Americans were

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.970
known for was also evident.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.360
Another thing that was
surprising and striking to me

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.870
is how widespread
in the country is

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:59.030
the sense of being personally,
culturally, ethnically,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.110
or regionally looked
down on and the effects

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.340
that has on how people behave.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.340
And those of us who
are not from New York

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.010
can assume that New York
looks down on everything.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.650
But almost everybody else
feels looked down on,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.730
the South by the North, interior
California by the coast,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.210
non-whites by whites, the
farmers from the countryside.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.450
You can have almost
any gradation of this

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.610
that you want.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.800
When I was in high school in
Redlands, California, Joan

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.680
Didion, a famous
writer wrote a story

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.530
about how my hometown was like
the worst place in California.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.490
So this is something that
we had a marker with me.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.600
And in many parts
of the country,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.900
this has been a
motivating force.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.500
Who here has been to
Fresno, California?

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.490
Now Fresno in the
Central Valley,

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.309
they are aware of not being the
stylish center of California.

00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:51.350
So two of their mottoes--

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.040
one is a rebranding to Fres-yes.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.510
The other is a new civic
revival program under the label

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.810
Unapologetically Fresno.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.750
And that we've seen
that in West Virginia.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.208
We've seen it in
many other places,

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:07.322
in Mississippi where
we spent a lot of time.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:09.530
We've seen-- I'll just
mention two other things which

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.170
were surprising and striking.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.200
We all know about
the dislocation

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.030
of industrial workers
over the past generation,

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.780
as the giant factories
of a bygone era

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.090
have been truly bygone.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.520
What has been
surprising to us is

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.380
how the interesting contrary
flow of high schools

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.460
and community colleges training
people whose parents worked

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.030
in those factories and
don't work there anymore

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.740
for the new tech jobs,
skilled tech jobs that

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.030
are emerging and are
high demand as welders,

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.020
as wind turbine repair
people, and a long other list.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.300
If you go to Western Kansas
now, you see the two competing

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:51.800
industries.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.020
You see the wheat fields
and inside of them,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.010
the wind turbines spreading out
over the wheat fields, which

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.870
are a major source of wealth.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.950
That was really,
really interesting.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.320
And finally in the
realm of surprises,

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.280
I think almost all of us
would think of city government

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.850
as the word call
up hidebound-ness

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.180
and out-of-date-ness, and not
being innovative in the way

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.160
that a tech company might be.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.440
I would contend that
city government right now

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.620
is one of the most innovative
and experimental parts

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.960
of American society,
where people are trying

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.710
different ways to engage
their citizens to have

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.079
tech sensors to inform
them of what they're doing.

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:31.870
And we saw countless
illustrations of that.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.570
So we saw some bad surprises.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.590
We saw opioids as a horrible
scourge to the country now.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.410
We saw the effects of
industrial dislocation.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.300
But we also saw a
lot of surprises

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.190
that we had not anticipated.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.360
So now I give you Deb.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.080
Deb is an advanced
linguistic scholar.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.868
And now she has the linguistics
part of the conversation.

00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:55.740
DEBORAH FALLOW: Yeah, OK.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.230
Advanced linguistics scholar?

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.730
JAMES FALLOWS: Well,
you have a PhD.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.530
Come on.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.530
DEBORAH FALLOW: Part of this was
really a listening tour to me.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.110
I was interested to
hear the regionalisms

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.170
versus nationalisms that we
all pick up from the media

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.440
and so forth.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.680
And it was round about
Greenville, South Carolina

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.480
into our second year, I guess,
that we heard this question

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.030
from people.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.840
If you're in a
gathering like this

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.370
and you don't know each other,
after you introduce yourself

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.910
to each other, you might
start with a second question.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.990
And I was interested in what
that second question would be.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.970
In Greenville,
South Carolina, it

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.400
was where do you go to church?

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.400
When I first heard it, I was
really kind of taken aback.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.690
Because I thought,
this is personal.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.880
This is intrusive.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.380
Why are you asking
me this question?

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.030
What if I don't go to
church, et cetera, et cetera?

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.520
And so I started asking and
listening in different places,

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.280
what's your second question?

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.840
And interestingly, I think in
Boston, it's a version of that.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.330
I heard a lot of people say,
maybe an older generation,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.590
of what's your parish?

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.540
In Chicago, it's the
what's your parish.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.820
It doesn't even matter
if you're Catholic.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.980
You know what
parish you live in.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.670
So it's the geographical marker.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.439
Is anybody here--

00:23:15.439 --> 00:23:16.730
I'm going to stick my neck out.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.240
Is anybody here from St. Louis?

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.110
OK.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.480
Can you tell me what's the
second question in St. Louis?

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.230
AUDIENCE: Where did
you go to high school?

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.230
DEBORAH FALLOW: Yes, OK.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.920
Great.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.850
It has never failed.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.740
That is absolutely the
second question in St. Louis.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.562
We were in Louisville
last week and the version

00:23:35.562 --> 00:23:38.020
of that question, it's not
where did you go to high school.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.530
It's where did you go to school?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.140
Because the assumption
is that that just

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.590
means high school and you're
not asking beyond that.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.020
So in DC, of course,
it's where do you work.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.470
Or what do you do, or
who do you work for?

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.740
Same thing kind of in New York,
unless you start asking about--

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.910
real estate goes up there.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:59.680
Where do you live?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.072
Like sizing you up in
your socioeconomics.

00:24:03.072 --> 00:24:07.580
The what-do-you-do question in
Denver and Burlington actually

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.090
means what do you do for
fun, like do you hike?

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.080
Do you ski?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.980
Do you snowboard?

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.990
What do you do?

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.390
LA, how'd you get here?

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.860
Well I took the 10 to
the 405, and on and on.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.240
In Minnesota I
learned last week,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.360
it's land of 10,000 lakes.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.210
I'm from Minnesota for 10 years.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.410
What's your lake or
what lake do you go to?

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.060
And in Wyoming, no kidding,
well maybe kidding--

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.820
did you get your elk yet?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.630
It's like everybody
gets an elk and you

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.890
get a badge for your elk.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.000
And so did you get your elk yet?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.150
Atlanta and Seattle, and
I don't know maybe Boston,

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.030
the question is,
where are you from?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:01.340
Because so many people are
there for Seattle, we know why.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.270
Atlanta same thing, and it's
just in ingrained in them.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.120
There are two places where you
dare not ask that question.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.687
One is Alaska, because so many
people relocate to Alaska,

00:25:12.687 --> 00:25:14.770
because they want to get
away from their past life

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.228
and don't want
anybody interfering.

00:25:16.228 --> 00:25:19.150
So everybody knows not to
say where are you from.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.005
Similarly in Hawaii,
on the big island,

00:25:22.005 --> 00:25:23.380
you don't say
where are you from.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.520
Because that is a big witness
protection program area.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.290
And it's much too
intrusive to ask that.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:37.000
So one more, my absolute
favorite is from New Orleans.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.080
And this a bit well,
I'll just say what it is.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.820
I heard two versions of it.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.510
One is, who's your mam.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.640
Who's your mama?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.490
Because everybody in New
Orleans kind of knows

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.220
each other and everybody
knows who your daddy is.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.060
But they can't tell from
your name who your mama is.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.120
So who's your mama?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.680
Or the more colloquial version,
how's your mama and them?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.910
Which is the kind of
nice intro to that.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.660
So I am collecting more
of these, if you have them

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.446
from your places.

00:26:09.446 --> 00:26:11.070
Everybody's got one
and they're kind of

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.170
in the currency of the town.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.960
And that's why I have a degree
in Advanced Linguistics, right?

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:23.410
JAMES FALLOWS: A virtue of
having been around Cambridge

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.320
when we were long ago is that
Deb was studying linguistics

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.955
at what was then
called Radcliffe.

00:26:27.955 --> 00:26:29.830
But there was this guy
named Noam Chomsky who

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.270
was a linguistics professor
in this part of town

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.420
you would come learn from too.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.670
So this is the
two-minute big finish,

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.890
where I'm going to tell
you what this all means.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.330
Then we'll have questions.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.590
So suppose you are
thinking right now,

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.340
these people are crazy.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.480
They've just been avoiding
the harsh realities of the US

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.360
by going to garden spots like
San Bernardino, where we spent

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.430
a lot of time, or
northern Mississippi,

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.410
or Erie, Pennsylvania,
or other places.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.420
We've been to a lot of
places that are rough,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.080
Charleston, West Virginia.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.390
So if you think this is really
an unrepresentative view

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.320
of these past four-plus
years all around the country,

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.720
the experiment I would
suggest is over the next year

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.050
or so try to go to half a
dozen places you don't know.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.260
And when you get
there, don't ask people

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.520
about national politics.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.110
If you ask them,
what about Trump,

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.152
it's like turning on CNN.

00:27:21.152 --> 00:27:22.818
You just know what
you're going to hear.

00:27:22.818 --> 00:27:24.730
But if you ask them,
how about the schools?

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.600
Who's moving here?

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.550
How are things getting
better or worse?

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.700
And not in every place in the US
will things be getting better.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.850
Because over the past
century and a half,

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.380
many, many small towns are
just too small to survive.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.640
And we can talk about
more of that later on.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.240
But in many of
the places we were

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.040
looking at, these medium sized
places of 20,000, 50,000,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.360
et cetera; things were going
in a positive direction.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.190
So see if you can test your
experiences against ours.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.490
But suppose you think
actually we might be right

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.320
and that you're willing
at least to accept

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.560
our hypothesis that there
is this historic shift

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.520
between national level
dysfunction and bitterness

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.510
and an inability to match
the resources of the country

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.100
to the needs of the country.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.460
There's a gap between
that and this local level

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.510
awareness of practicality,
and experimentation,

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.490
and willingness to
compromise, and ability

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.050
to make long-term plans.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.590
Suppose you thought that
actually might be true.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.630
What would you do then?

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.970
I can tell you what
we intend to do

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.240
for the foreseeable
future is I apply

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.550
a historical model to this.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.257
When Deb was studying her
linguistics in college,

00:28:39.257 --> 00:28:40.840
I was studying
American history, which

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.030
is the main thing I've
just tried to read about

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.980
and learned about
in the interim.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.930
And it does seem to me
there's a real lesson

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.340
to be learned from the
period from 1880 to say 1920,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.580
the original Gilded Age,
the original progressive

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.370
and populist and
reform era, in the way

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:02.380
that so many of the dislocations
we're having now, extremes

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.790
of sudden new wealth from
sudden new technologies,

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.730
people suddenly losing their
traditional livelihood,

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.550
political dysfunction,
political corruption,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.190
regional bitterness; all those
things have their precedents

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.070
150 years ago or so.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:23.200
But also you look back and
see all the different people

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.650
in all their dispersed
ways who were trying

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.530
to create a different country.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.320
You had the people in
the labor union movement,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.970
starting after the Civil War.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.410
You had the women's movement.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.480
You had the African-American
rights movement.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.220
You had immigrant
rights movements.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.200
In almost every big city you
had civic improvement movements,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.180
from Jane Addams onward.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.720
In California you had the
Good Government movement.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.680
You had the
conservation movement,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.500
starting under Teddy
Roosevelt and his peers.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.100
And the collection of those
people working together without

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.770
knowing they were pulling in the
same direction for quite a long

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.910
time over those decades,
meant that when the temper

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.740
of national politics
changed as it finally did,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.760
there was a whole array of
experiments and organizations

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.390
and solutions that
have been tried;

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.630
ones that have succeeded
and ones that hadn't.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.260
And what Louis Brandeis was
saying about the states being

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.380
the laboratories of democracy,
looking back on that time,

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.880
really is true when we
think of cities right now.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.120
So we actually think it is
like that era again now.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.470
And there is a real
battle underway

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.380
for the soul and
future of the country,

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.870
between the poison
that is dripping down

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.380
from the national level, which
is what dominates our news,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.200
and all the sources of
experimentation and hope

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.080
and new ideas that from
most of the country

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.800
in a lot of independent
places are being tried out

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.330
and succeeding, city by
city and region by region.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.070
David Brooks of
"The New York Times"

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.570
had a column about
two weeks ago,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.490
based on our book saying
the headline of which

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.560
was, "The American Renaissance
is Already Underway."

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.700
And his point was
not, the nation

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.410
doesn't have really
grave problems.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:07.920
It does.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.030
His point was that many, many
people are already finding ways

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:16.460
to try to use the technologies
of this era to connect people,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.747
the new awareness and
possibility to apply

00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:20.580
different solutions.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.660
So we think this struggle
is really underway.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.890
And we hope that when
historians 150 years from now

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.100
look back on all
of us in this era,

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.430
they'll say that you here with
your technologies and people

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.880
we've seen in Mississippi,
and Oregon, and South Dakota,

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.470
and people in state houses and
city halls around the country

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:48.450
were like their predecessors
in the earlier progressive era,

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.880
figuring out the
solutions that would

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.040
make a better country possible.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.060
So that, in brief and rushed
fashion, is our pitch.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.790
You'll find the
stories in the book.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.740
So Deb, would you
please come up here

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.367
and choose people to answer
questions or to ask questions?

00:32:04.367 --> 00:32:04.950
So, thank you.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.466
That's our pitch.

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:09.394
DEBORAH FALLOW: OK.

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:11.980
AUDIENCE: A question I have is
about something I worry a lot

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.920
about and try and spend a lot
of mental energy and time trying

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.389
to figure out, is the
separation between what's going

00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:20.680
on locally-- and I try to
get very involved in the town

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.870
of Arlington where
I live today--

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.110
again local politics
and civic engagement

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.174
there and national politics.

00:32:28.174 --> 00:32:29.840
And I've tried to mix
the two over time.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.257
And they don't blend so well.

00:32:32.257 --> 00:32:34.090
They show up to say,
an indivisible meeting,

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:34.990
a resistance meeting.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.254
You say, hey, let's talk
about bridging divides.

00:32:38.254 --> 00:32:39.670
With Republicans
and conservatives

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:40.660
it doesn't go over so well.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.370
So these things just
don't mix very well.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.872
But at the same time,
it's hard to justify

00:32:44.872 --> 00:32:46.080
focusing on one or the other.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.290
So how do you prevent--

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.590
what would you recommend
doing on the civic local level

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.420
that kind of insulates
you to some extent

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.920
from the national
politics without burying

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.836
your head in the sand?

00:32:54.836 --> 00:32:57.100
Because these
divisions trickle down,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.230
where it's like we see
divisions in town that

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:04.810
seem to me to come from a
lot of that national level

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.230
division seeping into--

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.237
these microfactures start
forming between liberals

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.820
and progressives
within our community;

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.361
not necessarily red
and blue divides,

00:33:12.361 --> 00:33:14.470
but similar sorts
of divides where

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.250
you stand on certain issues.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.820
So how do you do that locally
without being infected

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.360
by the national politics?

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.480
JAMES FALLOWS: This
is a hard question

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.680
that we've spent a lot
of time thinking about.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.000
And let me give you the current
state of my thoughts on it.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.700
I once worked in
national politics

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.460
long ago, before anybody
here was even 10 years away

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.314
from existing.

00:33:37.314 --> 00:33:39.730
When Jimmy Carter was President,
I worked on his campaign.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.630
I was a speechwriter
in the White House.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.110
And I've stayed observing
national politics since then.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.920
What I have learned
about national politics

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.910
is that it's a combination of
things which are foreseeable

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.450
and you can have vector
diagrams, and things

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.520
that are accidental.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.990
And we're still living with
the effects of Lyndon Johnson

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.760
deciding to sign
the Civil Rights Act

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.510
or pushing the Civil Rights Act,
50-plus years ago, and the ways

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.517
in which that peeled
the white South away

00:34:09.517 --> 00:34:10.600
from the Democratic Party.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.750
That is sort of the fundamental
political movement of our time,

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.929
making the Republicans
a white-based party.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.050
We're dealing with Supreme Court
rulings on political donations.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.730
We're dealing with
lots of other things.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.630
So those are the
fundamental factors.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:32.699
At the national level, there are
also things no one can foresee.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.350
I was at the Democratic
Convention in 2004

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.070
when Barack Obama made
his keynote address.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.850
People there were saying,
yeah this guy is a comer.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.070
But six months
before that, nobody

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.949
would have imagined Obama
becoming the president in 2008

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.889
and things of that sort.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:56.260
In 1988 when we were living
in Japan, through sort

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.680
of the accidents
of media intensity,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.890
Gary Hart went from being
the likely next President

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.620
to having to leave the race,
for accidental factors.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.730
The races of 2000
and 2016 turned out

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.142
the way they did for
1,000 dominoes pointing

00:35:12.142 --> 00:35:13.100
in a certain direction.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.622
So the reason I'm saying this
is similarly with Jimmy--

00:35:16.622 --> 00:35:17.830
I'll go back to Jimmy Carter.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:23.260
He was elected in the
fall of 1976 comfortably.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.792
Two years before
that, nobody would

00:35:24.792 --> 00:35:26.500
have imagined that he
would have ended up

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.560
as President, as a former
one-term governor of Georgia.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.800
And there are times in which
the mood of the country

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.790
changes in a way that makes
a certain person the voice

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.370
of that mood, as
happened to Carter,

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.940
as happened to
Obama and arguably

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.480
has happened with Trump.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.430
So to lead this to
the local, I think

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.960
the next step is
to do everything

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.730
one can locally, so as to make
the mood of the country, such

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.300
that a person whom we
can't foresee right now

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.450
ends up two years from now,
six years from now being

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.640
the voice of that sentiment.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.434
Whether it is a Democrat,
you can list a dozen of them;

00:36:07.434 --> 00:36:09.850
or whether it's a Republican,
you list one or two of them;

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.150
who would seem to be the voice
of what people will want.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:18.120
One other point, it is a pattern
in US presidential politics

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.620
and almost always
President X is succeeded

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.640
by President X plus 1 who is the
opposite on almost all fronts.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.660
You have George W. Bush
after Bill Clinton.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.600
You have Bill Clinton
after George HW Bush.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.820
You have Obama after
George W. Bush.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.270
You got Trump.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.140
So I think somebody
different from Trump

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.140
will be the next person.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.430
So mainly while we wait
to see what the linkage is

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.380
from the local to
the national, we

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.510
do everything we can
locally to prepare

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.950
the mood of the country.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.470
AUDIENCE: You talk
a lot about how

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.940
the national rhetoric
differs from what's

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.770
happening on the local scene.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.300
And a lot of that
national rhetoric

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.100
is coming from the
national media.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.860
What can the national
media do better

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:08.396
to give more of a realistic
or nuanced look at what's

00:37:08.396 --> 00:37:09.520
happening on a local level?

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.330
And then also how can we, as a
society, better support what's

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.480
going on the local
level, journalism,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.030
to kind of create more
of a nuanced dialogue

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.350
about what's going on?

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.070
JAMES FALLOWS: This is
such an important point.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.840
And if only you
all were associated

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.600
with some major technology
company that has--

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.270
JAMES FALLOWS: Yes.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:38.460
It is of first order importance.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.960
There's never been
a time in history

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.390
where we would think
of as serious news.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:46.350
That is coverage of state
houses or international affairs

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.400
or all the rest.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.170
There's never been
a time when that

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.540
has been a viable
self-sustaining business.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.940
It always has had to attach
itself to some other host body,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.930
whether it was the bundled
news packages of yesteryear.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.000
When I was a kid in
Redlands, "The LA Times"

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.430
was 800 pages a
day, because it was

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:06.180
the only newspaper you could
get, or network TV or whatever.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.100
And the history of
modern journalism

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.050
is continued death of the host
body and moving on to something

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.260
new.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.020
Google and Facebook
together have

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.270
been agents of eliminating the
host body of the last 20 years,

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.100
of destroying the
advertising model that

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.170
kept journalism going.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.360
And that is not anybody's
fault. But it's the reality.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.320
And as journalism struggles
to find its next host body,

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.030
it is of really
central importance

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.270
that the organizations
and people

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.790
who were agents of
this transition help

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.150
think about its
consequences and solutions.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:51.327
One reason I have admired
Google over the years,

00:38:51.327 --> 00:38:52.910
including when we
were living in China

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.993
and Google was standing
up in the right ways, is I

00:38:54.993 --> 00:38:57.830
think the people-- the
leadership of Google

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.480
has generally been conscious
of both the negative as well

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.010
as the positive effects of the
revolution it is engendering.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.170
So I think that
if you're working

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.720
with Google News, its
important that you

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.040
be part of the experimentation
with journalistic institutions

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.580
to see how the new
model can emerge.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:24.020
Also I think individual
rich people, from Google

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:28.790
and other tech companies, have
a civic and historic obligation

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.000
to try to shore up the public
infrastructure of this era.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.120
To wrap up this
pitch, we look back

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.470
on the people who had sudden
fortunes 150 years ago,

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.380
whether it's Carnegie, or
Mellon, or Rockefeller,

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.470
or Ford, or Heinz,
or Frick or whatever.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.340
We now think of them, not
just as financial barons,

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.330
but as something else.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.720
Because they shored up
the public infrastructure

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.510
at that time with museums,
and universities, and parks,

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.840
and all the rest.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.020
And I hope that their
counterparts now will also

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:08.510
recognize individual as well as
institutional responsibilities,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.640
to help build up the
public infrastructure.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:17.240
The cost of setting up a
Peace Corps like situation

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.066
for local reporters, it would
be trivially inexpensive,

00:40:20.066 --> 00:40:22.190
like a teach-for-America
for our local journalists.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.023
I know Google is doing
some of those things.

00:40:24.023 --> 00:40:26.540
But more and more that would
make an enormous difference

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.930
to find ways for young people
to go out there to Fresno,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.430
to Spokane, and all the rest.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.140
So that's my pitch.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.140
DEBORAH FALLOW: I agree.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.960
And you can tell
that you have hit

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.443
two of the themes that are
most important in Jim's heart.

00:40:42.443 --> 00:40:44.210
So, thank you.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:47.870
AUDIENCE: Several years ago,
the Harvard political scientist,

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:50.870
Robert Putnam, wrote a book
called "Bowling Alone."

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.480
And the main theme of
that book was the decline

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.190
of civil society in
the United States,

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.640
basically the lack
of group engagement,

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.360
basically anomie in
towns across the country,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.020
people not in fact doing
things together so much

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.960
and isolating themselves.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.570
He wrote a follow-up
book a couple of years

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.510
ago where he went back
to his own high school

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.650
in northern Ohio, his own
town, his own hometown,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.260
and found increasing
segregation,

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:26.420
increasing economic inequality
there, and again just divisions

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.850
that according to him
did not really exist

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.340
when he was a younger person.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.780
Now you're coming along.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.910
It sounds like you're
writing a story that's

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.320
really the complete opposite
of what Putnam found.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.040
And I'm just curious
about how you

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.650
see your work in the context
of what Putnam found.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.310
Basically, was Putnam wrong
or was he kind of right

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.860
and we still see some of that,
but what you're really finding

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.790
is just a breaking
out of that pattern?

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.590
JAMES FALLOWS: I think closest
to the last possibility

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.510
you were mentioning.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.230
So we know Robert Putnam, of
course respect Robert Putnam.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.510
We've debated these
issues with him.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.980
And I think it's a
combination of we're

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.150
seeing something several
years later after he wrote.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:15.200
And we're seeing it in a
different kind of reportage.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.320
So let's stipulate.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.790
And we're also seeing
about kinds of connections

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.820
that he left out of
his description, which

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.800
I'll illustrate for
second with Dodge City.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.840
So of course it is the case that
as in the original Gilded Age,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.050
there are increasing
economic extremes.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.170
And that is a genuine
problem to deal with

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.650
and that federal
policy is making

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.211
worse now, rather than better
with the new tax policy,

00:42:40.211 --> 00:42:40.710
et cetera.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:47.740
So those compared with white
society in the '50s and '60s,

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.720
it is more polarized
than it was then.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.370
The two counters
I would offer is

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.920
that while the bowling
leagues of northern Ohio,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.140
where Deb is also from,
maybe different from when

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.920
Robert Putnam was a kid, we
saw two different things that

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.790
were coming up.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.100
The maker spaces
are a different kind

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.960
of alliance from
the bowling leagues,

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:14.930
and just the craft brewery
movement, no kidding,

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.330
is becoming like bowling
leagues of these days, where

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.250
it was really spreading
all over the place.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.660
I think it's also the case
that recognizing that race

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.500
is the fundamental American
crisis and problem compared

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.070
with the America Putnam is
writing about 50 years ago,

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.570
it is less separated
than it was.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.810
And a lot of the stories
we're giving in the Midwest,

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:39.580
in Dodge City, and
Garden City, Kansas,

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.560
in Erie, Pennsylvania which is
Rust Belt rather the Midwest,

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.240
in Sioux Falls South
Dakota; are of white society

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.800
being much more connected
with Latino and black society

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.270
and refugee society than
was the case 50 years ago.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:55.700
So I think the problems
of polarization are real.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.769
But I think it's a more
complicated situation

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:01.310
than you would think, just by
the decline of bowling leagues.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.740
Bowling leagues in
Ohio may be down.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.480
Lots of other things are up.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.920
And can you tell the brief
story of the ROTC student

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.765
in Sioux Falls from Somalia?

00:44:10.765 --> 00:44:12.890
DEBORAH FALLOW: I was going
to tell the brief story

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.825
of the kids in San Bernardino.

00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.015
JAMES FALLOWS: Yeah.

00:44:16.015 --> 00:44:17.473
DEBORAH FALLOW:
Which is an example

00:44:17.473 --> 00:44:23.150
of a rising up of civic groups
with a direction and a purpose.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.250
San Bernardino is a
really troubled town.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.920
And the kids who grew up there--

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.540
let's call them 30-year-olds,
plus or minus five years--

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.250
whom we met and
spent a lot of time

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.810
with, are so tired of
people nay-saying their town

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:42.950
and feel that they have an
opportunity and an obligation

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.910
to make things
better in that town.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.110
So they got together.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:47.930
They were primarily artists.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.520
And they formed a
little group, which

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.970
Americans are great at doing.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.600
They're forming new
groups, not bowling groups,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.160
but other kinds of groups.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.540
And the purpose of what these
kids did was the end of it

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:05.090
was to bring into the
mind-share of high school kids

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.710
the importance of voting.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.590
And the way they got there
was a kind of pied piper

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.290
movement starting with
cleaning up the parks.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.870
And they eventually,
as artists, they'd

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.980
draw murals instead of
graffiti and bad graffiti.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.600
They'd draw nice graffiti.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.161
And they eventually had groups
of young kids following them

00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:24.660
around.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.330
And then they would have
fairs and festivals that

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:30.800
were based around
music, and kind

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.520
of earning the goodwill of
the young people in the town,

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.381
and then made a video
very age appropriate

00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:39.130
that they could take
into the high schools

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.965
to start to imprint on them
the importance of-- you

00:45:42.965 --> 00:45:45.260
want to get to the end of
this, you've got to vote.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.720
And you've got to understand
your civic responsibility

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.380
there.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.040
So it's like what do
you call that group?

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.880
I mean they say we are
not an organization.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.360
We are a movement.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.120
And we saw many examples of
similar kinds of things, where

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.160
people would get
together for some purpose

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.540
and banding together.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.060
So it's not a bowling league.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:10.997
But it is a group with a
purpose of doing something.

00:46:10.997 --> 00:46:13.580
JAMES FALLOWS: We could give you
a million more illustrations,

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.750
but I won't.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.524
Yeah.

00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:18.190
AUDIENCE: When I was
looking at the map,

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:19.731
I wasn't going to
bring up St. Louis.

00:46:19.731 --> 00:46:21.430
And then you did.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:25.030
But looking at that and
hearing your stories,

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.640
I'm hearing a lot of
places where there's

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.330
at least some chances
for central kind

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.670
of governmental decisions.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.890
Many of these are
small towns, where

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.590
it sounds like most of
the people live in a place

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.590
where they can contribute to
the same city government who

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.440
can make big decisions.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.540
My history growing
up in St. Louis

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.320
was of a region that had a
real trouble hanging together.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.090
Decisions basically
got arbitraged

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.980
through a state
government that was also

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.300
worried about rural issues.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.800
It was worried about
other cities in the state.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.370
And so the ability of two people
who maybe lived a mile away

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.290
from each other,
there was no one

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.420
to go to, accept a
governor who was maybe

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.880
thinking about a presidential
run at some point,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.450
to bind them together.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.150
And I was curious
if there were places

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.850
where you saw more of that
regional-- several cities

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.400
in a region that were
able to come together

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.442
without having to necessarily
depend on state government.

00:47:19.442 --> 00:47:20.900
JAMES FALLOWS: That
is interesting.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.280
We saw a number of places where
arbitrary political boundaries

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.660
were a really
significant factor.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.760
And I think Erie,
Pennsylvania is

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.240
one of the most important ones.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.270
I don't know if any
of you are from Erie.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:35.500
It looks at first glance
like sort of this nightmare

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.330
scape of industrial
decline, with all

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.130
these rotted-out
industrial buildings,

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:43.270
and then a GE plant
that is closing down.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.640
But at the same time, the
people in their 20s and 30s

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.650
have a really active
startup up culture there.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:52.820
But Erie is handicapped by the
balkanization of Pennsylvania

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.830
school district funding,
where Pennsylvania

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.770
has five times as many
administrative units

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:04.040
as the state of California
does, with many fewer people.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.970
And it means that there's a
real financing squeeze on Erie,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.500
and everybody moves
to the suburbs.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.940
And there are things like that.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.710
We were in Kansas
City 10 days ago.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.250
Kansas City, Missouri/Kansas
with all of its straddles.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:20.140
The places where we probably
saw the most effective--

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.685
I can tell you a place
that is aspiring to it,

00:48:22.685 --> 00:48:26.500
in inland Southern California
where San Bernardino, really

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.280
troubled Redlands, small and
more successful; and Riverside,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.710
large and more
successful; are trying

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.310
to find some sort of
pan-regional Inland empire

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:37.230
consciousness.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:40.000
They're divided by a county line
there, San Bernardino County

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.980
versus Riverside County.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.810
I think western Kansas
and northern Mississippi,

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:47.899
of course.

00:48:47.899 --> 00:48:49.690
DEBORAH FALLOW: Yeah,
northern Mississippi.

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:52.780
In different segments,
like in Clovis and Fresno,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.000
which are in separate
counties, they

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.240
came together on the schools
and on some school issues, which

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.135
everybody thought
couldn't happen.

00:49:00.135 --> 00:49:00.635
In--

00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:01.980
JAMES FALLOWS: In
central Oregon.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.810
DEBORAH FALLOW: That's true.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:03.800
JAMES FALLOWS: So
to interrupt there,

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.470
around Bend, which is now--

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.080
so Bend is now famous
as this resort site.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.330
20 years ago it had the
highest unemployment rate

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.410
in the country, or 25 years ago.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.860
But at some recent time,
because of the timber industry,

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.430
and in central Oregon there
was no four-year university.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.870
So a number of
towns and counties

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:22.550
there worked together on
the Central Oregon Community

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.460
College, which was--

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.370
DEBORAH FALLOW: And the Golden
Triangle of Mississippi,

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.580
which--

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.820
JAMES FALLOWS: Yeah, so we
have a long chapter there

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.820
about the cities of West
Point, Columbus and Starkville,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.310
Mississippi; which were
in three separate counties

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.450
in Mississippi.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:37.180
But they have a real
coordinated effort

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.230
where they brought in
advanced manufacturing

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:41.170
and have been in a
quite impressive ascent.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.753
DEBORAH FALLOW: And
Erie is definitely

00:49:42.753 --> 00:49:43.960
talking about that too.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.830
They are saying, we need to
look out a little bit, not just

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.570
our little town,
into regionalisms.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.070
JAMES FALLOWS: And
greater Columbus,

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.528
Ohio too; so it's an important
point that people are trying

00:49:54.528 --> 00:49:56.020
to cope with in different ways.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.228
AUDIENCE: When you first
came to a town or city, what

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.880
are some of the more
surprising indicators

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.740
of either civic
health or dysfunction

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.545
that you found to be
consistently reliable?

00:50:04.545 --> 00:50:05.920
JAMES FALLOWS:
Does somebody have

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.470
a copy of this book I
might borrow for a moment?

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.834
Most of this book is
written just as narrative.

00:50:11.834 --> 00:50:13.250
Here's what we saw
in Sioux Falls.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.280
Oh, we have an intro and outro.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.790
And there's the last
part of it is called 10

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.050
and 1/2 signs of civic success.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.260
These are the things we
learned along the way.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.190
And most of them are
high road, for example,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.200
that we would
always ask somebody,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.210
who makes things go here.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:34.150
And all that mattered is
that there was an answer.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:36.010
And the answer in
Charleston, West Virginia

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:40.071
was a country music singer named
Larry Gross who some of you

00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:40.570
may know.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.700
He has a program
called "Mountain Stage"

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.510
on Public Radio, which has
been a fundamental fact

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.890
in Charleston, West Virginia.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.760
And in Eastport, Maine it
was Captain Bob Peacock

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.990
and Linda Godfrey, and
some of the others.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.610
So is there a local patriot?

00:50:57.610 --> 00:50:59.770
Is there a local story?

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.960
Do people understand
where the city

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.320
is on the ascent of
mankind type of chart

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.400
and why the things
we're doing now

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.930
will have benefits
in the future?

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:13.810
But I say there are
10 and 1/2 signs.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:18.120
The half sign is, is
there a craft brewery?

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.770
Because a craft
brewery has become

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:21.450
a genuine source of employment.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.090
It's a sign of a certain
kind of entrepreneur,

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.190
a certain kind of
customer, and a way

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:28.020
in which the downtown
will be expanded

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.350
by bringing new areas into you.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:33.945
But the end of the book is 10
and 1/2 signs of civic success.

00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:36.240
So you can see it all there.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.160
AUDIENCE: Very excited
about the prospects

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.660
of us progressing through
this poisoned atmosphere.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.510
But I'm wondering the
flip side of the coin,

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:46.540
nothing's inevitable.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:50.100
So what would it look like
if that didn't happen?

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:53.270
Because it feels as if the whole
administration that's there

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:55.590
is getting thinner
and thinner and just

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:59.760
isn't enough to actually
support long-term poison.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.060
But I don't want to get
my hopes too high up.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.670
JAMES FALLOWS: This is a
whole separate topic, which

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:07.530
we can talk about offline.

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.210
I think you will
see "The Atlantic"

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.820
going into this with
100 articles a day

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:15.630
about the mechanics of
the current struggle.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:21.360
I think it would be better
if we had a functioning

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.410
national government.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:24.134
And I think we will ultimately.

00:52:24.134 --> 00:52:26.550
Because there's things that
only a national government can

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:31.860
do from environmental standards
to other kinds of standards

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.580
that hold the country together.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.270
I think the alternative
is having California

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.480
be more and more on its own, and
Texas more and more on its own.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.190
And that would be
OK in various ways.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.340
But I think I'd
rather than speculate

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.250
on how bad things might look
20 or 30 years from now, think

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.520
about making sure people get out
to vote in the next few months

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.970
and that they experiment
locally to provide the fodder

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.820
for the next wave of renewal.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.360
So with that, I think
we come back to center,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.370
and thank you all.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.040
Thank you all for
coming, very much.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.490
[APPLAUSE]
