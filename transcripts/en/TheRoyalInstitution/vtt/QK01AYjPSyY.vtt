[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Whoa.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.764
Did we do it?

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:30.610
 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.370
So these are what we're blowing
up at the moment.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.561
[POP]

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:39.680
But it's just a glass ball with
a couple of millilitres

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.560
of water in it and then
sealed off at one end.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.370
So when you heat them, the
water starts to boil.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270
But obviously, the water vapour
that you create can't

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.160
go anywhere.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.760
The steam builds up, and so
you pressurise the ball.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.230
[POP]

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.700
POP

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.610
And that pressure keeps on
building and building and

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.990
building and building
and building

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.990
until the ball explodes.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.966
[POP]

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:10.540
 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.260
At which point you have a load
of water in there which you've

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.860
heated way above its normal
boiling point, 100 degrees,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.320
because it's pressurised.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.970
And as soon as you release
that pressure with the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.040
explosion of the bauble, all
that heat energy that you put

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.530
into the water is released as
the water flashes into steam,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.860
and that's the energy that
drives the explosion.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.115
 

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:35.665
The glass is basically
completely pulverised.

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:39.847
Some of it seems to be embedded
in various places.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:42.620
Basically, almost embedded
themselves in the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.560
polycarbonate screen.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.886
That's quite hard to do
with polycarbonate.

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:48.300
It must have been going at
quite a rate of knots.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.260
[POP]

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.220
[POP]

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:13.100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.247
This one is definitely the best
we've done in terms of

00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:21.270
the way we've seen the glass
fail, and seen the liquid

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.375
components start to expand
and immediately boil.

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.850
And then also built up
in the component

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.122
that's already steam--

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:31.340
you can see through
it for a moment.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.760
But then it starts to condense
into the cloud of water

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.440
droplets and become-- it
starts to obscure the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.690
backlighting.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.330
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.843
So yeah, it's all over
incredibly quickly.

00:02:46.843 --> 00:03:18.506
