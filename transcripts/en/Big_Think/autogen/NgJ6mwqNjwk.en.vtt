power of mathematics a few years ago I

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
power of mathematics a few years ago I

made a film called rights of love and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370
made a film called rights of love and
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.900

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
director Ren Grove I was in Paris doing
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120
director Ren Grove I was in Paris doing
some mathematical work and suddenly I

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
some mathematical work and suddenly I
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.570
some mathematical work and suddenly I
felt inspired to make a film because I

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
felt inspired to make a film because I
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.720

don't do enough and when we do that
sometimes we don't do it in the most

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
sometimes we don't do it in the most
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209
sometimes we don't do it in the most

30 seconds into a conversation when I
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.430
30 seconds into a conversation when I
try to explain the form ode to them so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
try to explain the form ode to them so
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020
try to explain the form ode to them so
then I though I thought what it would do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
then I though I thought what it would do
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.029
then I though I thought what it would do
something radically different what if

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
something radically different what if
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010
something radically different what if
instead of trying to explain a formula

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
instead of trying to explain a formula
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.830
instead of trying to explain a formula
at a kind of a rigorous and cerebral

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
at a kind of a rigorous and cerebral
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830
at a kind of a rigorous and cerebral
level what if we try to do it at a more

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
level what if we try to do it at a more
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.220
level what if we try to do it at a more
visceral and emotional intuitive level

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230
visceral and emotional intuitive level
 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.410
visceral and emotional intuitive level
so instead of trying to explain the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
so instead of trying to explain the
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660
so instead of trying to explain the
details what if we make a tattoo of a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
details what if we make a tattoo of a
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730
details what if we make a tattoo of a
mathematical formula and let the viewer

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
mathematical formula and let the viewer
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370
mathematical formula and let the viewer
see see it in this very different

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
see see it in this very different
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.820
see see it in this very different
context in the context of a film which

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
context in the context of a film which
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.670
context in the context of a film which
is an allegory about a formula of love

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
is an allegory about a formula of love
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.320
is an allegory about a formula of love
so that's how the idea of the film

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
so that's how the idea of the film
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870
so that's how the idea of the film
rights of love and math came about the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
rights of love and math came about the
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.800
rights of love and math came about the
premise of the film is that a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
premise of the film is that a
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570
premise of the film is that a
mathematician after many years of hard

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
mathematician after many years of hard
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.170
mathematician after many years of hard
work find the formula of love and at

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
work find the formula of love and at
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880
work find the formula of love and at
first he's elated he's so happy that he

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
first he's elated he's so happy that he
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920
first he's elated he's so happy that he
found this formula which explains

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
found this formula which explains
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.120
found this formula which explains
everything and will make everyone happy

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
everything and will make everyone happy
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.240
everything and will make everyone happy
and then of course he realises the flip

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
and then of course he realises the flip
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980
and then of course he realises the flip
side of the formula it could be used for

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
side of the formula it could be used for
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.679
side of the formula it could be used for
evil as well as for good and here of

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
evil as well as for good and here of
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.899
evil as well as for good and here of
course I'm alluding to misuse of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
course I'm alluding to misuse of
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.560
course I'm alluding to misuse of
mathematical models in our world and the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
mathematical models in our world and the
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.940
mathematical models in our world and the
possibility that the mathematical

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
possibility that the mathematical
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.700
possibility that the mathematical
formula can actually do harm so he

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
formula can actually do harm so he
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.039
formula can actually do harm so he
realizes that and he is scared he's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
realizes that and he is scared he's
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.539
realizes that and he is scared he's
afraid he wants to protect the formula

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
afraid he wants to protect the formula
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.880
afraid he wants to protect the formula
and to protect the formula he decides to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
and to protect the formula he decides to
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590
and to protect the formula he decides to
tattoo it on the body of the woman he

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
tattoo it on the body of the woman he
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
tattoo it on the body of the woman he
loves so we create this mythical world

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
loves so we create this mythical world
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929
loves so we create this mythical world
and it's mythical world she his lover

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
and it's mythical world she his lover
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.660
and it's mythical world she his lover
represents mathematics itself so the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
represents mathematics itself so the
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.330
represents mathematics itself so the
film is really about his love affair

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
film is really about his love affair
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.180
film is really about his love affair
with mathematics and that's what we try

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
with mathematics and that's what we try
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.750
with mathematics and that's what we try
to convey and we try to show the formal

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
to convey and we try to show the formal
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.610
to convey and we try to show the formal
in the different light and we try to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
in the different light and we try to
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.100
in the different light and we try to
show the passion which is involved in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
show the passion which is involved in
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.509
show the passion which is involved in
doing mathematics which when he makes

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519
doing mathematics which when he makes
 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.839
doing mathematics which when he makes
the tattoo he completely shuts himself

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849
the tattoo he completely shuts himself
 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.610
the tattoo he completely shuts himself
out from the rest of the world it's just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
out from the rest of the world it's just
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.009
out from the rest of the world it's just
him and the formula and nothing else

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019
him and the formula and nothing else
 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.380
him and the formula and nothing else
that's how we do math Michael research

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
that's how we do math Michael research
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.500
that's how we do math Michael research
it's it's really a struggle of ideas

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
it's it's really a struggle of ideas
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.559
it's it's really a struggle of ideas
it's an struggle with oneself trying to

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569
it's an struggle with oneself trying to
 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.320
it's an struggle with oneself trying to
understand things at the deeper level

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
understand things at the deeper level
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.630
understand things at the deeper level
it's a very emotional and passionate

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
it's a very emotional and passionate
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000
it's a very emotional and passionate
process and we wanted to convey that in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
process and we wanted to convey that in
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.729
process and we wanted to convey that in
our film and also of course the idea

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
our film and also of course the idea
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.339
our film and also of course the idea
that when you discover that formula it

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349
that when you discover that formula it
 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.369
that when you discover that formula it
really gets under your skin like the ink

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379
really gets under your skin like the ink
 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.360
really gets under your skin like the ink
of a tattoo so when we show the film

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370
of a tattoo so when we show the film
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.479
of a tattoo so when we show the film
someone always asks but what what does

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489
someone always asks but what what does
 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.210
someone always asks but what what does
this formula mean and that's exactly

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
this formula mean and that's exactly
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.539
this formula mean and that's exactly
what we wanted we wanted to pick a

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549
what we wanted we wanted to pick a
 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.569
what we wanted we wanted to pick a
viewers curiosity to inspire them to ask

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579
viewers curiosity to inspire them to ask
 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.309
viewers curiosity to inspire them to ask
a question what is the meaning of the

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319
a question what is the meaning of the
 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.710
a question what is the meaning of the
formula in other words we wanted the

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
formula in other words we wanted the
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.330
formula in other words we wanted the
viewer to appreciate the beauty of the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340
viewer to appreciate the beauty of the
 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.599
viewer to appreciate the beauty of the
formula just in an aesthetic sense but

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609
formula just in an aesthetic sense but
 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.509
formula just in an aesthetic sense but
not stop there but use it rather as a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
not stop there but use it rather as a
 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.909
not stop there but use it rather as a
portal to the understanding of the

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:24.919
portal to the understanding of the
 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.309
portal to the understanding of the
intellectual beauty of the formula so

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319
intellectual beauty of the formula so
 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.780
intellectual beauty of the formula so
they asked put as a formal mean and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790
they asked put as a formal mean and
 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.210
they asked put as a formal mean and
actually the formula we use in the film

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220
actually the formula we use in the film
 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670
actually the formula we use in the film
is a formula for one of my papers which

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680
is a formula for one of my papers which
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.289
is a formula for one of my papers which
might was two co-authors we try to

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299
might was two co-authors we try to
 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.580
might was two co-authors we try to
understand some deep questions in

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590
understand some deep questions in
 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.129
understand some deep questions in
quantum field theory and in the course

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139
quantum field theory and in the course
 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.990
quantum field theory and in the course
of our investigation we came up with

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
of our investigation we came up with
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
of our investigation we came up with
this unexpected surprising formula

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010
this unexpected surprising formula
 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.379
this unexpected surprising formula
that's the formula which is tattooed in

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389
that's the formula which is tattooed in
 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.159
that's the formula which is tattooed in
the film and the second question that

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169
the film and the second question that
 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.379
the film and the second question that
people like to ask is is there a formula

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389
people like to ask is is there a formula
 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:53.800
people like to ask is is there a formula
of love

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810
of love
 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.870
of love
there's a formula of love really exist

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
there's a formula of love really exist
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.500
there's a formula of love really exist
and the answer I like to give is that

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510
and the answer I like to give is that
 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.479
and the answer I like to give is that
actually every formula we discover is a

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489
actually every formula we discover is a
 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.140
actually every formula we discover is a
formula of love and that's because these

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150
formula of love and that's because these
 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.140
formula of love and that's because these
formulas are presenting deep and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150
formulas are presenting deep and
 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.659
formulas are presenting deep and
fundamental about the world and perhaps

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669
fundamental about the world and perhaps
 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.000
fundamental about the world and perhaps
even more importantly every formula is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010
even more importantly every formula is
 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.740
even more importantly every formula is
objective represents objective truth

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750
objective represents objective truth
 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.810
objective represents objective truth
which means the same thing to all of us

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820
which means the same thing to all of us
 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.689
which means the same thing to all of us
and therefore the each of those formulas

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699
and therefore the each of those formulas
 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.420
and therefore the each of those formulas
is this great connector which connects

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430
is this great connector which connects
 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.060
is this great connector which connects
me to anyone else in the world and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070
me to anyone else in the world and
 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.930
me to anyone else in the world and
therefore it's something that

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
therefore it's something that
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.240
therefore it's something that
helps me to love the world and to love

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250
helps me to love the world and to love
 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.410
helps me to love the world and to love
everyone who lives in this world
