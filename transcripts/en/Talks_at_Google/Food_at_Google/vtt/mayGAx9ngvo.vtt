00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.060
SCOTT WIENER: Maybe about a
year, year and a half ago, I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.660
took what I do--

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.720
I mean, what I do for the most
part is I'm just obsessed with

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.320
pizza the way that any
normal human is.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.350
You like to eat pizza, you
see boxes of pizza, you

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.770
want to dive in.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.950
It sort of decomposes
every human.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.000
When a box of pizza comes out,
you go back to 12 years old,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.040
and that's sort of it, and it's
always going to happen

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.020
for your whole life.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.640
It's just this thing
that embodies the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.300
spirit, I think, of youth.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.970
And in a lot of ways, we're
going to talk about why that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.430
happens all day today.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.050
Today what I want to do is I
want to take you through what

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.970
we're eating, talk about where
it comes from, what it is and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.730
what it means and where it's
going, just because around New

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.070
York City, there's so many
different styles of pizza.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.280
And the first thing that ever
happens when I walk in a room

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.110
and I'm like, oh, we're going
to be talking about pizza,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.720
everybody starts asking
questions about, what's the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.880
best, what's your favorite,
that kind of thing.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.910
I just want to let you guys know
we're not talking about

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.750
that today.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.140
That's just to clear the air,
because we could spend three

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.010
hours sitting here going around
the room and everybody

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.490
being like, well, what
about this place?

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.360
Isn't it the best?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.810
As I was walking up here--

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.320
so I do walking tours
and bus tours.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.210
And the guy who runs the bus
squad out of nowhere text

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.640
messages me, hey, in your
opinion, just a question,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.870
what's the best pizza
in New York?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.020
I'm like, you couldn't get any
worse of a question than that.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.490
Just because when you guys go
out and eat pizza, I feel like

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.690
the first decision that you're
making when you're picking a

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.280
place to go is you're
choosing proximity.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.790
A lot of times it's like, what's
in this neighborhood,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.620
what's the deal with that?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.670
It's very rare that you're ever
in a situation where,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.660
like, we're going to go anywhere
within 15 miles.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.280
Let's pick one and we're
all going to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.660
rent a car or something.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.440
That's a lot more rare.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.400
But if you ever do that,
you've probably--

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.610
I mean, I've been in the
same boat many times.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.920
You're picking places sort
of based on adventure.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.810
Right now in New York, we're
in this amazing position of

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.110
having so many pizza styles
happening all at one time.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.020
Whereas in the past, when you
think of New York style pizza,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.450
there's certainly New
York style pizza

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.520
sitting on this table.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.850
New York Pizza Suprema is the
name of one of the pizzerias

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.180
that brought some pies.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270
That's a classic
New York pizza.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.720
Then we have Donatella, which
is on 8th Avenue and I think

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.270
19th Street, 18th Street,
and that's not a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.230
typical New York pizza.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.730
That's a pre-New York pizza.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.010
It's a Neapolitan pizza.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.840
Then we also have John's, which
I think is all the way

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.160
down at that end of the table.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.970
I think it's already all gone.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.360
Is there any John's left?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.180
There's two slices left?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.880
From what pie?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.860
AUDIENCE: Mushroom.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.350
SCOTT WIENER: Both mushroom?

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.000
No love for the mushroom.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.670
Although now that you announced
it, now everyone's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.590
going to be running over.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620
Well, so we've got a couple of
slices from John's, and John's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.370
is somewhere in between
those two.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.760
And I'm not talking about
quality-wise.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.200
I'm not talking about that one
is the best and the other is a

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.700
lower quality.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.550
I'm talking about historically,
just because as

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.530
you go through time, you find
developments from one style to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.155
another and the developments
all happen mainly

00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:08.990
for economic reasons.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.080
History, economics, and social
positioning really have a lot

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.490
to do with pizza styles
changing.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.380
So I'm just curious.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.140
Just right off the bat, does
anybody have a current

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.700
favorite pizzeria anywhere
at all in the world?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.310
What do you got?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.040
AUDIENCE: Bar in New Haven.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.020
SCOTT WIENER: Bar
in New Haven.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.800
Bar is an interesting place,
because Bar opened about 15

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.000
years ago, and they're
in New Haven.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.060
And if anybody's been in New
Haven, Connecticut, New Haven

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.940
is like a stronghold
for pizza.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.920
It's the kind of place where
sometimes I hear people say,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.145
oh, I heard New Haven actually
has the oldest pizzerias in

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.690
the United States, which is not
really true, but New Haven

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.070
has a lot of really old ones.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.870
They have got a place Frank
Pepe's, which opened in 1925,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.970
and then down the street there's
a place that Frank

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.280
Pepe's nephews, Tony and
Salvatore, opened a place in

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.010
1938 called Sally's.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.580
And these are these two big
places in New Haven that if

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.640
you live or if you've ever been
in New Haven or if your

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.840
family grew up there or
anything, everybody has one or

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.100
the other that they love.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.340
Then in comes Bar 15 years
ago, and they do a very

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.480
non-traditional pizza.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.420
Everybody who goes there really
loves the-- and I don't

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.370
know if you fall into
this category--

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.680
mashed potato pizza.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.110
If you are in that category,
that's cool.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.960
Totally atypical, totally a
non-classic, nontraditional

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.680
pizza, but absolutely valid in
the eyes of the great pizza

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.100
landscape, because you can
really put anything on pizza

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.550
and it still counts
as that category.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.820
So Bar is an interesting one.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.290
I'm glad that you brought that
up, because it sort of crosses

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.650
boundaries.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.480
Well, we're going to talk
about these three main

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.060
staples, these three strata,
these bits of the evolutionary

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.995
process within pizza.

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:48.700
And then there are some places
like Bar that don't

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.330
fit right into it.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.770
Any other favorites?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.560
Like, what do you got?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.176
AUDIENCE: Pizza Modo
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:55.450
SCOTT WIENER: Pizza Modo--

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.060
David with the outdoor oven
thing, and he's got a few now.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.380
And David's really interesting
because Pizza Modo is a

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.330
portable, wood-fired oven, and
he'll bring it to street fairs

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.610
and things like that, and
bakes these incredible

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.820
Neapolitan pizzas.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.750
That's more similar to
Donatella, except for the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.940
beauty of a place like Pizza
Modo is that you're outside,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.590
he's going to hand you the
pizza, it's never going to get

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.560
trapped in a box.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.410
If we could have had these
delivered here without those

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.430
boxes, that would've been
amazing, but we didn't,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.630
because Greg has two arms
and that's about it.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.680
But what else?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.480
Any other favorites?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.160
So far we've hit two totally
different strata.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.590
What do you got?

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.090
AUDIENCE: Pi Pizzeria
in Washington, DC.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.130
SCOTT WIENER: Is that the
full name of it, Pi?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.420
AUDIENCE: It's called
Pi [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.630
SCOTT WIENER: Oh, gotcha.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.000
Just so you guys know, it should
be pretty obvious,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.650
there are, like, 50 places
called Pi with the pi symbol

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.470
and they're not related.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.630
It's sort of like what Ray's
is to New York, Pi is to

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.720
everyone else around
the country.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.040
Everyone's like, oh, here's
a really cute,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.460
quirky name for a pizzeria--

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.240
pi.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.630
And I actually know somebody who
owns a place called Pi in

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.000
Rochester, Minnesota, and
it's the pi symbol.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.320
But anyway, I haven't
been to that place.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.070
What's the style?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.890
AUDIENCE: Lower Chicago style.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.195
SCOTT WIENER: Really?

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:11.260
AUDIENCE: But not
overly cheesy.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.850
SCOTT WIENER: Is it Chicago
thin crust or

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.845
Chicago deep dish?

00:06:13.845 --> 00:06:16.540
AUDIENCE: They call
it Chicago style.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.992
It's allegedly [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:25.252
It was the first pizza place
I found [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:25.736
proximity.

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:27.180
SCOTT WIENER: Proximity.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.050
So proximity is a huge
factor in the whole

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.120
discussion of pizza.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.820
The origin of pizza has nothing
to do with anything

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.660
besides proximity, because the
way we're going to track these

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.480
three different types of pizza
are basically through the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.830
ovens that they're using,
through the cheeses that

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.200
they're using, the machinery
that's available that they're

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.850
using in the kitchens, and
I think that might be it.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.140
There's no fourth one,
but we'll see.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.160
So this is actually a good
place to start, because I

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.580
brought some photos of things,
just photos that I've taken

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.440
over the years, to try to
help explain some of the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.270
progression of what we
have on the table.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.180
And the first one, the first
pizza, that we're going to

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.330
talk about is that, like,
Pizza Modo, it's this

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.180
Neapolitan pizza
from Donatella.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.160
Yeah, so do me a favor.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.390
Somebody just hold that up a
little bit, just so everyone

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.630
knows what I'm talking about.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.255
And at this point,
there's so many--

00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:17.830
oh, is that the sausage
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.130
SCOTT WIENER: Cool.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.870
At some point, just pass
that this way.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.070
AUDIENCE: You want
it right now?

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.770
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah, let's
do it right now.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.570
Oh, thank you.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.790
Wow, you're like the doctor in
the delivery room handing me

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.980
my first child.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.430
This is great.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.660
Well, so at this point in human
history, especially in

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.070
New York, so many articles
are written about

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.950
pizza all the time.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.560
And Neapolitan is sort of like
a big focus in it, but I want

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.400
to really concentrate
on what that means.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.160
Sometimes people look at a pizza
like this and they say,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.990
oh, this is a gourmet pizza,
oh, this is a highfalutin,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.130
fancy pants pizza.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.680
The interesting thing about it
is this is the oldest form of

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.720
pizza, this is the
original format.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.990
And the original format of
oven are these giant--

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.260
well, not so giant--

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.880
these big wood-burning ovens.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.830
And you've seen them
all over the place.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.150
This is not your first time
seeing a wood-burning oven.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.480
But other wood-burning
ovens around city--

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.970
Don Antonio, Keste, Motorino,
Paulie Gee's in Greenpoint,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.760
Fornino in Williamsburg.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.660
I mean, they're all
over the place.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.530
We could go on for an hour
listing them all.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.815
And this oven is really
important for what we were

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:27.760
just talking about with
proximity, because the oven is

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.300
the whole reason that
pizza exists.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.710
In the early 16th century, early
1500s, we have these

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.840
ovens, or baker's ovens,
and they're

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.539
wood-burning baker's ovens.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.880
And you can find these going
all the way back to being

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.150
baker's ovens back to 2,000
years ago in Pompeii.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.870
If you ever go to Pompeii or
Herculaneum, you can find, I

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.720
think, 30 or 40 of these ovens
sitting around preserved,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.430
these ovens.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.410
And the way that they work
is they're real simple.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.070
We're going to get to the
functionality a little bit

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.300
later, but all you need to
understand is, it's a

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.100
wood-burning oven.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.790
They use wood, they fire it up,
they get the oven chamber

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.780
really hot.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.830
And once that chamber reaches
what they call a soak point,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.800
that soak point is where the
stone within the oven, the

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.380
masonry within the oven, has
enough power, has enough

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.250
thermal energy, that it can
continuously bake product

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.490
throughout the day without
a live fire.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.770
And that's important, because
once you have a fire in there

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.200
like they do in this photo,
you can't bake anything

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.020
directly next to that fire.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.460
If you let the fire burn out,
and let the oven kind of even

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.000
out at its soak point,
then you can use any

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.410
spot within the oven.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.820
So that's what bakers did.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.920
Bakers would just use the oven
at soak point to bake anywhere

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.610
within the oven.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.950
But in the beginning of each
baking session, to test the

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.860
oven to see if it was hot
enough, they would take a

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.320
piece of dough from yesterday
and they would flatten it out

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.660
and toss it inside the oven
just to see if the

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.340
oven was real hot.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.300
And if the oven's hot enough,
then that dough is going to

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.500
blister and it's going to start
to rise and it's going

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.220
to take about two, two and a
half minutes before it's

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.110
blackened and nobody
wants to eat it.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.310
And that is the first pizza.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.430
Really, that bit.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.460
The word pizza itself is just a

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.920
mispronunciation of the word pita.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.370
And pita goes back to the
ancient Aramaic word pitta,

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.730
that just means bread.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.280
A pizza is really
just a bread.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.270
Pizza is not defined as crust,
sauce, and cheese.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.660
The tomato doesn't come
on until way later.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.450
Tomatoes, really the late 17th
century at the very earliest.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.150
Cheese is happening even later
than that, because cheese is

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.160
just too expensive until
a certain point.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.200
It really is all about having
a flattened piece of dough,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.370
that when they start throwing
ingredients on top of it, the

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.420
ingredients that they're adding
on top of that dough,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.260
it's also proximity, and
it's also economics.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.040
The butcher shop has leftover
pig fat, and that that's the

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.550
first pizza topping--

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.710
lard, just straight chunks of
lard thrown on top of a dough,

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.920
and that's it.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.020
I don't think we
got any today.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.366
Did you order any lard?

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:48.764
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.340
SCOTT WIENER: And
I'm not kidding.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.120
There are places that do it.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.530
Keste on Bleecker Street and Don
Antonio, which is owned by

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.570
the same guy, they
do that pizza.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.750
It's called the Mast'nicola,
and it's OK that

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.950
you didn't get it.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.000
It's all right.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.320
But if you ever have the
chance, try it out.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.740
Share it with people.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.360
You don't want to eat
that whole thing.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.860
And it's delicious.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.720
It's just a bunch of lard.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.790
But you end up having all these
ingredients back in the

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.540
day that are just because
of proximity.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.450
So that's why when we're talking
about something like

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:21.040
mashed potatoes at Bar in New
Haven, it's not like potatoes

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.200
are hard to come by.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.450
Throw it on a pizza.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.680
If you're in a place that people
like eating Hawaiian

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.970
pizza-- which is not
really popular in

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.590
Hawaii, by the way--

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.720
you've got pineapples handy?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.370
Why not, why the heck not?

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.330
These ovens as a bread oven,
this is your starting point

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.790
for all pizza.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.640
And throughout that,
we were starting to

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.210
change a little bit.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.920
Like, when get onto the next
step in pizza ovens, when we

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.700
get to John's, that John's pizza
is going come out of a

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.490
massive coal-burning
brick oven.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.910
And this is a shot
of Lombardi's

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.090
Pizzeria on Spring Street.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.110
Lombardi's is-- have any of you
guys been to Lombardi's?

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.880
Yeah, Lombardi's right now
is at 32 Spring Street.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.140
This is a shot of the original
location, which is 53 and 1/2

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.930
Spring Street.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.610
It's a bar called
Gatsby's now.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.360
And this oven is massive.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.990
You can see it's a wall.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.190
It's not like the little
standalone oven that we saw

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.800
before with these little guys.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.140
This is a whole wall and it
extends about 12 feet into the

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.590
backyard of this building.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.700
And again, proximity
and economics.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.980
We switched from wood to coal
just because wood is too

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.680
expensive in Manhattan
in the late 1800s.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.340
In the late 1800s,
early 1900s, coal

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.700
was just way cheaper.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.130
They were bringing in coal,
truckloads of coal, which were

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.120
used for heating all of
downtown Manhattan.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.220
Anthracite coal was just cheap,
so that's what they

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.010
used in this oven, which is why
that John's pizza that you

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.390
have is a completely
different texture,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.960
completely different flavor.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.330
You're just getting
down to the crust.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.960
And this is sort of the
early version of

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.580
New York style pizza.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.100
Even just from looking at it,
this pizza is larger than that

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.900
Donatella pizza and it has a
little bit more to do with the

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.570
ingredients that are available
here versus the ingredients

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.080
that are available back in
southern Italy, in Naples.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.780
And then of course, the
final oven is the

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.170
deck oven back here.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.910
And this is a shot of New York
Pizza Suprema, which we have

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.180
smattered along over here.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.260
There's still a couple
of slices.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.630
And I had the opportunity of
working here for a short time,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.980
and I did grow that mustache
just so I would match

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.000
everybody else who
worked there.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.770
Everybody has a mustache
there.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.720
I wanted to fit in.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.670
I was writing a series of
articles called "Undercover

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.610
Pizza Lover" for "Serious
Eats," and I did three

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.310
different jobs.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.470
I worked as a slice slinger at
Suprema, I worked at a place

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.640
called Metro Pizza in Las Vegas
where I was a pizza

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.320
maker on a busy Saturday night,
and then I did three

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.290
weeks at Domino's, where I went
totally undercover, I

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.190
went rogue.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.260
I applied for the job and I
worked there for a bit and

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.280
learned so much about why I
don't ever want to go near

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.100
there again.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.160
But anyway, I just wanted
to show you guys.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.640
Obviously, you all know this
oven probably better than

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.900
anything else, but there's a
lot of interesting things

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.150
about this type of oven.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.740
And that oven, in fact,
is part of why we

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.080
even are here today.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.850
We would not be here today if
pizza stopped with this.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.590
If they switched over to a
coal-burning oven and suddenly

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.860
everyone was like, oh, no I'm
not interested anymore--

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.610
done.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.550
You see, it's all about fuel
sources becoming cheaper.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.870
The fuel source for--

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.770
I mean, coal.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.440
In the late 1930s, coal
becomes too expensive.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.570
Natural gas starts to be the big
seller, and so natural gas

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.030
is great for an oven like this
because you can just flip a

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.990
switch and it's on, flip
a switch and it's off.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.110
Lombardi's, you can't do that.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.220
At John's, you can't do that.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.510
At Totonno's in Coney Island
or Patsy's in Harlem, you

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.430
can't do that.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.110
The switch that you have
to flick doesn't exist.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.350
Instead, to turn the oven off,
you've got to scoop out the

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.180
coal and then you've got to pull
it out of the oven, and

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.860
then you have to wait two
days or three days.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.890
Really, I'm not kidding.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.090
You have to wait two or three
days, and then if you want to

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.920
heat it back up-- let's say your
coal oven goes down to

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.480
room temp, you're talking two
and a half weeks, just because

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.550
it's all about the masonry
of the oven.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.900
So that's why sometimes
pizzerias tell you about how

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.310
hot their ovens are.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.200
The heat in the air of the oven
doesn't make as much of a

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.260
difference as the masonry.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.731
What's up?

00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:26.770
AUDIENCE: So those coal ovens,
they run continuously?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.482
Patsy's and Luzzo's?

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:31.290
SCOTT WIENER: Yes, they
run continuously.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.060
Luzzo's is an interesting
one because they

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.900
don't use solely coal.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.680
They use coal and they put
wood on top of it.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.800
So that's a coal-burning oven.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.700
It's built as a coal-burning
oven, but they also do

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.440
wood on top of it.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.690
And they're hot all the time.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.565
Places like Lombardi's
have a bigger oven.

00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:47.950
It's physically bigger, so
that's why they keep it going

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.200
all the time because it's more
efficient to let it go all

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.400
night than it would be to start
the fire in the morning

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.220
and then try to reheat
it for three hours.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.670
It's just more of a struggle,
it's harder, so it's easier

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.270
for them to maintain
it like that.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.290
And each oven has these
different nuances to it, which

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.560
are so fascinating.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.160
The way that they work
is so fascinating.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.260
The inside of a wood-burning
oven, first of all, it just

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.120
looks great.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.550
This is why people--

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.300
I don't know if you know it,
but a lot of people are

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.900
installing ovens in
their backyards.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.770
Not in Brooklyn as much.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.850
But if anybody's interested in
doing that, please talk to me.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.900
Seriously, I'm not kidding.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.900
I looked at this apartment a
couple weeks ago and they were

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.450
telling me, we're going to do
some projects in the backyard

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.110
and thinking about putting in
a wood-burning oven, and I

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.840
freaked out.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.360
And that's probably why I didn't
get the place, because

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.580
I was so excited about it.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.360
But I went over there a week
later and I was like, here's

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.750
some books.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.590
Just invite me over.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.360
But you notice it's a
dome shape in the

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.530
inside of the oven.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.750
This dome shape is really good
because it's going to help

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.060
heat transmit by all three
methods of heat

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.440
transfer in an oven.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.030
Direct conduction--

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.570
the pizza's laying directly
on the floor of the oven.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.170
There's heat conducting right
from the floor into the base

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.840
of the pizza.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.810
You're going to have a lot of
radiation, because all the

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.480
heat that's bouncing off those
bricks on the top is going to

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.460
centralize back on the
floor of the oven.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.099
And then of course, you
have convection.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.210
Since this fire-- you notice
how the fire is

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.369
sort of to the left?

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.865
I'm taking the picture through
the only opening in that oven.

00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:18.270
It's one opening, right
in the front.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.750
So air can only get in or out
through that one opening.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:26.380
I know in the picture I showed
you before, there were these

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.590
vents up on top, the flue.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.510
Each of those flues is not
connected directly to the peak

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.430
of the dome of the oven.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.180
All cool air to feed the logs
is going right in along the

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.370
bottom, hitting the fire,
heating up, swirling around,

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.660
and coming out the front
and up into the hood.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.160
So that hood is connected to
that flue in the back.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.500
That's why when you look inside
this oven, there's no

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.740
opening inside there.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.470
All that heat is coming
right out the front.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.770
But again, the problem is these
ovens don't really work

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.080
as well when you come into New
York City, just because of the

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.400
expense of the fuel, which is
why we're going to change

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.110
things up a little bit.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.850
But I just wanted to show you
another quick image about how

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.470
fresh air is going to come in
the front, warm up, move out,

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.430
and exit again out the front.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.760
But a coal-burning oven
is different.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.240
This is a more recent photo.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.490
This is a place called
Verde in Bushwick.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.790
I think it's on Irving.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.330
And this is an oven that the
guy bought the building, he

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.040
was messing around, and found
that, hey, this is not the

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.660
wall, this is an oven.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.310
And why not?

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.280
This is the way it works.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.490
You see, these ovens at a place
like Lombardi's or at

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.690
similar places-- actually, in
New Haven at Pepe's and at

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.330
Sally's, if you look at the
profile of any of these

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.950
buildings that have these old
coal-burning ovens, the

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.440
building is three or four
stories tall and then it drops

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.390
down to a one-story extension
for, 20, 30, 40 feet, and then

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.050
there's a chimney at the end.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.420
And that extension
is the oven.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.310
It's all the oven, if you
look at the profile.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.550
This one is interesting,
though.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.410
This one's not on the
ground floor.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.290
This one is in the ground.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.140
It's underneath the sidewalk.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.390
So this oven extends in the
front of the building

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.870
underneath the sidewalk,
almost definitely built

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.250
illegally about 100,
110 years ago.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.720
That's the way that
they rolled.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.390
They just built something and
they said, if I get busted,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.160
I'll get the permit later.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.460
And that's what happened.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.960
I found the permit for
Lombardi's, the Lombardi's

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.940
oven for 1898.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.430
But that oven is probably a
little bit older than that.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.540
If they got the permit in 1898,
I don't think they were

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.070
like, let's get all of our ducks
in a row and make sure

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.210
everything's right.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.450
We just moved here three years
ago, we know the rules.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.900
No, it was just they just
did it and they

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.280
figured it out later.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.060
The way this works is
totally different.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.680
Instead of having one opening in
the front, it's got three.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.030
And this is just a handle.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.030
There's a light switch
back there.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.830
That's not an opening.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.420
There's an opening right here,
and then that little doorway

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.670
to the right, and then
below that doorway.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.910
So inside that door, that little
slightly curved, little

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.500
adorable little elf door,
that's where they

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.150
shovel the coal in.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.740
Right below it is the ash drop,
which sometimes they'll

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.460
leave open so that air
can flow in, air

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.670
can feed the fire.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.190
And as that air goes up through
the fire, heats up,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.540
hits the top of the oven right
around here, it's going to

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.520
flow all the way to the back
left corner to exit out the

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.810
flue in this oven.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.350
So instead of being a circular
motion in the inside of the

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.640
oven, it's going straight
across.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.530
And that heat, as it goes
straight across, is a

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.960
completely different bake
when we go from

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.660
Donatella to John's.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.680
You notice Donatella's pizza,
it's a lot softer, it's a

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.940
little more consistent
in texture.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:44.420
John's pizza tends to be a
little tougher, a little bit

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.900
more of a bite, and that's
because the bake time is going

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900
to be longer.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.830
Donatella's pizza comes out in
60 to 90 seconds, and John's

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.800
is five minutes-- not that
five minutes is bad.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.776
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
pizza, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:01.392 --> 00:21:03.450
SCOTT WIENER: You know,
it's interesting.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.740
Anthracite is about 92%, 93%
carbon content, so there's not

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.630
a lot of moisture.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.310
Burning wood lets off a lot more
smoke than burning coal,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.370
a lot more smoke.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.795
The difference is that the ash
is easier to get rid of from a

00:21:14.795 --> 00:21:17.110
wood oven than it is from
a coal oven, so

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.840
that's the big thing.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.930
And of course, burning a fossil
fuel is not a great

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.040
deal, so I would not, by any
means, advocate coal-fired

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.310
pizzerias happening in every
city around the world.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.610
But it's not as harmful.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.940
People think it's going to be
harmful because coal has this

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.130
bad rep, as it probably
should be.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.890
But it's not.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.460
It's really any of the coal, any
of the heat, is coming on

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.580
the right side of the oven.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.800
No pizzas are baking on the
right side of the oven.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.780
They're all baking
on the left.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.000
And they can't bake on
the right, because

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.630
it's just too hot.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.590
And that coal fire is also a
different fire from wood.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.570
It's more smoldering.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.760
You don't have huge flames
leaping about.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.950
With that wood-fired oven,
you've got flames that go up

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.910
to 12 o'clock on the top of that
dome, and that flame is

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.920
going to help you get blisters
on the edge of your crust.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.190
It's not that they chose, oh,
let's make the flame big to

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.030
get blisters.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.090
It was more like, oh, we threw
the dough in when the oven is

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.980
really hot and the flame is
reaching up to the top, and we

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.230
end up getting these blisters.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.020
And then the people of Naples
figure oh, well, we can't

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.840
change anything, because
we like it.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.480
So that's why today we have
an organization called the

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.780
Associaziane Verace Pizza
Napoletana, or the pizza

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.890
police, as some people
call them.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.860
And they have a series of rules
that say the pizza must

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.160
be 35 centimeters in diameter,
the tomato that you use on top

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.040
of it must be San Marzano, and
it must be applied to the

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.370
dough in a circular motion.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.240
And I'm not kidding
about that.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.810
And it says the oil must be
extra virgin, and the cheese

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.060
must be fresh fior di latte,
which is a cow's milk

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.460
mozzarella, or buffalo
milk mozzarella.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.850
They don't give you
any leeway.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.500
It's really funny to me because
so many pizzerias, you

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.600
think that, like, oh, they've
got secret recipes.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.850
Secrets.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.600
No secrets.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.290
In fact, they publish what
you have to do to

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.440
make the right pizza.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.340
The best pizza has no secrets,
because the best pizza is

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.180
really pretty simple for me,
at least what I like.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.700
But this type of oven, again,
completely different from what

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.930
we saw before.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.660
So that's why it's so hard to
pick out what is the best,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.200
because the oven's just going
to bake things differently.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.520
It's more like you've got to
pick what you're into.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.600
You've got to pick if you're
into basketball

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.720
or football or baseball.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.230
They're all different paces of
sport, they're all different.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.710
So that's why with these ovens,
you kind of have to

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.860
know which type of oven your
pizza's coming from.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.730
And of course, there could be
wood-fired ovens that the

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.060
pizza comes out tasting
and looking like a

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.510
gas-fueled deck oven.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.880
That just means that it's not
being used the way it's

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.160
intended to, and that's all
in the hands of the user.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.790
These are just tools.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.560
Just because you have a
coal-burning oven or a

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.860
wood-burning oven in your
backyard does not mean that

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.790
you're making the right
type of pizza.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.650
So with this kind of oven, the
inside of it-- and this is

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.230
actually funny.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.590
This is a rare day when at the
very beginning of the day,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.950
when they still have wood in the
pile to help burn some of

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.980
the coals, where you
do have a flame.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.100
But that flame is not by any
means reaching as far as the

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.880
flame before.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.920
This is a picture I took of the
inside of Lombardi's oven

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.100
after they did a huge
restoration job to it to make

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.540
it look the way it used
to look, the inside.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.860
And you see the way the
inside is shaped.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.200
It's like a barrel vault.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.870
It's not a dome, so heat
is moving from

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.240
one side to the other.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.500
It is not moving in a
circular motion--

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.760
one side to the other.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.980
And you're not going to have
any pizza over there.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.700
Pizzas are going to start
right around that

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.900
point in the center.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.930
And if they have calzones,
they're going to be baked

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.670
closer to the front door,
because it's colder by the

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.150
front door.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.750
Calzones are thick.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.980
You don't want to bake
it very quickly.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.940
You want to bake it at a nice
pace, an even pace, so that

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.720
the outside can bake and
the inside can bake.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.880
But they're just fascinating.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.030
They're just a real pain.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.060
Nobody wants to use these ovens
anymore, and that's why

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.630
they fell out of vogue, also
because to maintain them--

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.840
you've got the coal on
the side of it--

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.170
every morning and every
afternoon, in the middle of

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.380
the afternoon before the dinner
rush happens, you've

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.490
got to scrape out
the excess coal.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.290
So you can see better in this
photograph, that little open

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.380
door on the bottom.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.685
That's air coming straight in to
fuel the coal, and the coal

00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:15.200
is sitting on top of
a metal grate just

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.450
so you can get airflow.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:24.030
Oh, these are my feet, sticking
out of the oven.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.600
I wanted to show you this,
because when I told you about

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.550
waiting two or three days to
repair the oven, I'm serious.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.430
This was two, two and a
half days after they

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.580
shut down the oven.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.320
And they were sending people in
to replace broken bricks.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.960
This is a picture I took right
before they did that huge

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.830
restoration for the inside, and
they let me crawl in there

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.080
for 10 seconds, and
it was amazing.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.290
And I never want to do it
again, because it was

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.050
terrifying.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.130
But the inside of the
oven, it's so hot.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.900
It was 322 degrees Fahrenheit at
that moment that the photo

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.750
was taken on the floor
of the oven.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.800
Luckily, I'm sitting on a piece
of plywood, so that's

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.110
why I'm OK.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.300
But it's extraordinarily hot.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.720
Again, that's why who in their
right mind would want to build

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.310
one of these now when
you have to do this?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.510
Have any of you guys heard about
why there aren't so many

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.420
coal ovens around anymore?

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.260
A lot of people ask me about--

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.370
they hear that it's illegal to
build a coal-burning oven, for

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.260
environmental reasons
or for whatever.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.350
It's not at all.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.400
It's 100% legal.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.970
It's just nobody would do
it, because that's how

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.160
you have to fix it.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.320
So rather than do that, it's
easier to just get one of

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.560
these ovens, to get one of these
gas-fueled deck ovens.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.510
How many of you have
been here?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.860
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.650
That's why I put this picture
in here, because I knew that

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.020
it would send a bolt
of electricity

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.220
through your hearts.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.870
And for anybody who has not been
there, this is a place

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:45.940
that you will go.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.590
It's OK.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.000
Don't go with too many people.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.880
Go at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.630
Call in sick to work.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.920
I didn't say that out loud.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.060
It's just, he's the only
guy who makes the

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.220
pizza at this place.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.840
This is Dom DeMarco.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.530
He's at a place called
the Di Fara on Avenue

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.790
J in Midwood, Brooklyn.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.870
This is actually a rare picture,
because he's using

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.460
the a peel to take the
pizza, the Sicilian

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.380
pizza, out of the oven.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.820
Usually he just grabs it, which
is also terrifying,

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.050
because it's super hot.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.610
But these are deck ovens.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.000
And a lot of times people look
at that and they're like, oh,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.030
no, I like brick oven pizza.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.840
Meanwhile, this guy makes some
of the best pizza in the city.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.380
And regardless of whatever lists
in the Zagat survey and

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.930
all that, most people--

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.230
my bus guy this morning
is telling me

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.830
about, you're crazy.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.080
You like the Sicilian here
better than Di Fara.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.640
Whatever.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.060
I wanted to show you
this, because he's

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.140
using these deck ovens.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.470
He's using an oven that is the
cheapest oven, and yet an oven

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.530
that started to proliferate
right after the Second World

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.270
War, after you've got a lot of
American soldiers coming back

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.020
from serving in Italy
during the war.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.620
And they're coming back and
saying, well, I'm not going to

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.390
build a giant oven, because of
the expense and what if I go

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.350
out of business, what if
I don't do anything?

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.420
You get one of these
ovens in 1954.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.200
One of those ovens-- and there
are three in this picture.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.630
One of those ovens was
going for $500 new,

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.100
$250 used on the Bowery.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.180
You could have bought any one of
these ovens for $250 used.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.900
So you could put that
in your place.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.530
If you go out of business, put
a For Sale sign on it, and

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.250
then you're done.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.340
If you have these coal-burning
brick ovens, and you go out of

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.350
business, you walk
away from it.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.730
A lot of times you put up
a wall in front of it.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.100
There are so many of
those coal ovens

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.340
laying around the city.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.270
So many.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.580
And you put up a wall in front
of it and walk away and

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.870
pretend it's not there.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.350
And that happened to my
friend David Sheridan.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:36.910
David is opening up a place on
Church Avenue in Ditmas Park

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.440
in, I guess, a couple
of months.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.660
He signed a lease
on this place.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.980
A week later, went
in and tried to

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.570
clean up the basement.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.335
And he finds this coal-burning
oven.

00:28:45.335 --> 00:28:46.680
He's opening a pizzeria there.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.630
He got an electric oven to use,
because he's like, well,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.530
I don't want to deal with the
hassle of anything else.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.710
And there it is.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.590
Right there, a coal-burning
oven sitting there.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.830
It's absolutely incredible.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.170
The current Lombardi's
oven is not the

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.100
original Lombardi's oven.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.990
The original Lombardi's oven
broke because the Six Train

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.560
runs directly underneath it.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.050
So when they moved to their
current location, they moved

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:08.640
there because it's an old bakery
oven that was used in a

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.220
place called the
Parisi Bakery.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.140
And when Parisi went out of
business in the late '70s,

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.450
they put up a wall in front
of it, walked away.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.320
They said, we don't need
to do demolition.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.570
Nobody will know.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.800
Lombardi's knew.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.310
And when they went out of
business, they came in and

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.130
they're said, well, we're
going to take this.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.340
It's perfect, you know?

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.800
It's like when you see, oh, this
house already has a pool

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.860
in the backyard.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.540
Let's get it.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.800
You know?

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.390
That coal-burning oven is the
pool in the backyard of the

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.540
pizzeria's house.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.450
What?

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.070
So that's why it's interesting
that we get to these ovens.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.480
And this is really what
people were using

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.790
because it made sense.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.210
Of course it works totally
differently.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.560
The bottom door on any of these
ovens, that's called the

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.490
service door.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.950
You have two pipes underneath
that have a natural gas-fueled

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.600
flame that's heating
up the stone.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.990
But on the top of the oven and
on the sides and on the back,

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.180
it's all stainless.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.440
So it's not really good at
radiating a lot of heat.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.410
It's not going to bake
a lot from the top.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.140
It's going to bake mostly
from the bottom.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.220
And that's why the pizzas from
Suprema are baked differently

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.120
from the pizzas from John's
and from Donatella.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.010
John's has more char going on.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.600
Donatella's lighter
and fluffier.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.890
Suprema is that classic New York
slice, that you can pick

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.680
it up and fold it.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.650
And the cheese only starts
to move a little bit.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.680
It starts to migrate
toward the bottom.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.200
And the oil starts to gather,
and you could drip a little

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.880
bit off the front.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.040
But don't blot it, at
least not in front

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.170
of people you respect.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.550
And then you pick it up and it
doesn't crack on the bottom.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.060
You take a bite.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.590
It's pure bliss.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.900
But that's the slice.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.020
It's so far removed from the
origin, and people get into

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.860
arguments all the time.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.910
Southern Italians especially.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.560
Oh, that's not pizza.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.060
Meanwhile, in southern Italy,
they're eating pizza with

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.230
French fries and hot dogs
on it, and they're

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.480
saying that that's OK.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.220
It's not OK.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.645
You know?

00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:57.490
And if that's OK, then
all this is OK.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.980
Which I personally believe
that it's all OK.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.450
And that's why it's so
interesting that, in an oven

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.940
like this, it's a tool.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.600
This guy makes these pizzas.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.520
And I take people from Naples
to this pizzeria sometimes.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.390
And they're into it.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.495
I'm like, just don't
worry, and they're

00:31:12.495 --> 00:31:14.890
like, oh, it's small.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.020
And then they go in and
they eat it, and

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:16.720
they understand it.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.730
And then they start
talking to him.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.130
And he's from Caserta, which
is just north of Naples.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.480
And suddenly it's like, oh.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.310
Now I get it.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.850
Because he knows
how to work it.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:27.840
Working the dough is another big
huge concept that changes

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.780
throughout time.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.720
But before we get into
that, I want to show

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.520
you guys this picture.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.070
This is a picture of a pizza
oven factory on the Bowery.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.690
This is the only pizza oven
factory in the whole city.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.730
And it still operates
every day.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.270
They build these pizza ovens.

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.630
So it's still going and
it's still totally

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.470
classic New York thing.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.760
By the way, this is
on Prince Street.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.920
If you're ever on Prince and
Bowery, there's two red doors.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.280
And you can hear them
working on stuff.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.340
Just open up the doors.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.430
They're never locked
during the week.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.870
Just open it, seriously.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:01.830
That was when I took
the picture.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:04.930
You just open it, and you look
in, and you're like, what?

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.820
It's like this secret world.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.400
It's amazing.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.215
And then he'll just flip it
up and look at you, and

00:32:09.215 --> 00:32:12.270
then you run away.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.600
So I take tours here
sometimes.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.833
And it's really funny to
look in, and people are

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:19.490
like, wait a second.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.880
You can go buy a handbag over
here, and you can go buy fancy

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.620
shoes over here, and then there
are these guys working

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.870
on pizza ovens who don't
speak much English.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.820
These guy's are from
southern Italy.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.930
It's amazing.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.670
They breathe in so many fumes.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.840
The doors are always closed.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.450
So, anyway.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.800
From here, I wanted to show you
a little bit about dough,

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.890
just because the handling of
the dough, again, is super,

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:41.890
super important.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.165
And this is a guy named
Jonathan Goldsmith.

00:32:44.165 --> 00:32:46.670
Is anybody from Chicago?

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.230
Yeah.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.047
Have you ever been
to Spacca Napoli?

00:32:49.047 --> 00:32:50.021
AUDIENCE: Actually, I have.

00:32:50.021 --> 00:32:51.969
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah.

00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:53.620
Yeah, that's his place.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.720
That's Jonathan Goldsmith
of Spacca Napoli.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.260
And he's wearing all this get-up
with the name of a

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.140
flower company.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.070
And he's a part of the
Associazione Verace Pizza

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.190
Napolitana.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.580
And he's got this
big wooden box.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.320
And right now he's kneading
dough by hand because he makes

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.870
pizza in the original Neapolitan
style, where you

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.510
don't use a machine.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.450
You have to handle the
dough very carefully.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.725
It means that the dough is going
to come out very light

00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:22.100
and supple, it's going to bake
easily and bake quickly.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.180
It's great.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.010
But again, this doesn't
make sense.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.390
After the Second World War
especially, this just doesn't

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.870
make sense as economics
change and you need

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.970
to make more dough.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.490
Which is why the Donatella
version of dough-- which they

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.790
don't do it by hand like
this, but I wanted to

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.030
show you the extreme.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.010
The Donatella version of dough
is using a machine that very

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.810
gently kneads the dough, very
gently incorporates all the

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.670
ingredients.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.160
Completely changes when you
get to the next step.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.450
This is a picture of the dough
mixer at Patsy's, which is

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.240
very similar to what they'd be
using at a place like John's.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.340
So John's is a coal oven.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.060
The era that John's opened, in
the late '20s and early '30s,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.850
Patsy's opened in 1933.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.970
And that mixer, it's got a
tumbler in the inside.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.300
So it's going to move
your dough around in

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.150
a circle like this.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.870
It's not as gentle as
using the hands.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.489
But it's not as brutal as the
next step that happens when we

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.570
get into modern pizza-making,
which is the gigantic

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.199
Kitchen-Aid on steroids.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:27.800
The Hobart H800 is this
model, which is huge.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.580
It's so sweet.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.620
No.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.630
It's this huge mixer, and the
big difference in it is that

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.870
it's a planetary mixer.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.480
So it's going to mix
from the top with a

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.270
hook that goes down.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.800
It heats up the dough a lot more
than the other mixers,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.320
which is not a great thing.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.889
Sometimes that can toughen up
the dough, which has resulted

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:47.940
in the New York slice,
which we love.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.320
It's a happy accident.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.820
This type of mixer, it's
an electric mixer.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.530
It lets you walk away
while it's mixing.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.920
You don't have to sit there
and maintain it.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.040
And also, if you notice that
this last mixer I showed you,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.240
this one from the '30s, early
'30s, it's just a mixer.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:02.710
Well, hold on.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.150
This one has a nozzle on the
front, where you can attach

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.690
either a cheese shredder, a
meat grinder, a vegetable

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.540
slicer, whatever you want.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.970
This thing does two
jobs at once.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.280
And really, that's why they
started using it, because it's

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.050
all about having this
tiny pizzeria.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.240
You know the tiny pizzerias.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.220
Joe's on Carmine street, little
places where you walk

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.220
in and it's two guys
behind a counter.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.840
And there's a counter, five or
six pizzas sitting out, a

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.610
couple of ovens, and this kind
of mixer in the back.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.970
And if they want to employ fewer
people, then you've got

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.240
to get the mixer that takes
the job of some of those

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.200
humans, which is
what this does.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.210
And that's why, as you get on,
the contemporary New York

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:48.670
slice is based on the result
of this type of oven, the

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:52.440
unplanned result of this,
rather, this type of mixer.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.980
Which is just fascinating,
because that mixer--

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.000
again, there's not a good
or a bad mixer.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.670
Now they have all these
crazy mixers.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.970
There's one mixer, I don't
have a picture.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.760
But it looks like a pair
of hands, and it

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.570
combines the dough.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.560
It's crazy.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.740
It's like, why don't you just
get your buddy to do this?

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.080
I don't know.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.750
But anyway, it's pretty
interesting how the different

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.770
handling of dough is going to
change the result of it.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:23.770
So when you go to a place,
let's say you're into

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.840
Pizzarte-- there's a place
called Pizzarte on--

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.070
oh jeez, where is it?

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:29.840
It's right in the, I think
around the theater district.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.080
If you're into that type of
pizza, and if you're into

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.310
Donatella, and if you're into
Keste, they're all made in a

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.320
similar method with similar
maneuvering, and similar

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.500
ingredients on top of
the pizza as well.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.150
Now, this as a whole
different thing.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.076
And I had to include something
about throwing dough up in the

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:50.070
air, because everybody
asks about it.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.740
We just have to get this
out the way right now.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.200
Throwing dough up in the air,
he's doing this to entertain

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.230
people and because there's a
camera sitting right there.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.090
And this is Gennaro Lombardi.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.590
This is a picture that was
taken in the '50s.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.000
He's throwing this dough up in
the air because American

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.050
wheat, American flour,
is a lot tougher

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.000
than European flour.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.410
That's why, American flour, you
can't really successfully

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.040
use your hands to mix a whole
ton of it at a time.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.240
It doesn't pull in as much
moisture as European flour.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.910
And it's tougher to move.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.950
So if you ever get a chance,
go into the kitchen at a

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.200
Neapolitan pizzeria.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.170
Just stick your hand in the
dough, and squeeze it.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.010
And then run.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.720
Pull off the fake moustache.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.690
And then go to another place
that's different, do the same

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:42.440
thing, repeat.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.550
And then see what happens.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:47.490
But you'll notice that the more
contemporary pizzerias,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.050
the dough is just physically
tougher.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.820
So to stretch it out, they
started stretching it out over

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.710
the backs of their hands.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:55.030
How many of you make
pizza at home?

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.310
Yeah.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.840
So when you make pizza
at home, you know.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.790
You start off on the table.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.100
You have to extend the dough.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.365
You're basically moving
around gas.

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:06.600
You're moving gas from the
center of the dough to the

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.000
outside, and that in turn
is what stretches it.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.350
Sometimes people get
a rolling pin.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.480
Sometimes people just grab it
and stretch it like this.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.930
And that ends up giving you weak
spots, and fixed spots,

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.070
and it's not very even.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.620
This is a way that they're able
to even out the dough.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.930
He was stretching it over the
back of his hands, and what he

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.560
just did was he, instead of
rotating it nice and evenly,

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.810
he threw it in the air.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.070
And he's going to catch
it back on the

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.040
backsides of his hands.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.290
That's why his hand is facing
down like this.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.370
But again, it's just for show.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.530
Nobody really ever does
that for fun.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.000
I mean, it is for fun.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.270
Nobody ever really does that,
because if you put 10 pizza

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.300
makers in a locked room and make
them make pizza, nobody's

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.040
going to throw it in the air.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.510
You could drop it.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.300
Who knows?

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.340
But the handling of the dough,
it just completely changes.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.550
Now, this type of crust,
this blistering, is

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.660
which one of the ovens?

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.220
We had the wood, we had
the coal, and we

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.083
had the deck oven.

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:02.030
AUDIENCE: Wood.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.570
SCOTT WIENER: Definitely.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.280
It's a wood oven, because that
fire reaches up to the top,

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.440
bounces down, and creates
all those blisters.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.220
But I really want to get into
that cheese for a second,

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.490
because you probably noticed
this, that the cheese in all

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.410
these three pizzas were totally
different cheeses.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.590
The one at Donatella was
a fresh mozzarella.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.325
And that's this stuff.

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.940
The fresh mozzarella, which
is bright white.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.020
It's really milky.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.930
Oh, I didn't put the picture
in the right place.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.770
Anyway, it's really milky.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.200
It's this bright white
milkiness.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.120
And it's bright white and not
yellowy like some of the other

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.250
cheese because there's
no extra oil added.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:41.860
You see, cheese like this
is just made from curds.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.450
You have chunks from
cow's milk, just

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.890
from curds and water.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.610
No preservatives added.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.780
But it's a problem.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.070
Another economic problem is
that this type of cheese

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.320
doesn't ship.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.310
It doesn't last long.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.000
It lasts two days at most.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.930
So as pizza expands in the
United States, we lose this

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.580
kind of cheese, and we start
getting a new low-moisture

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.890
mozzarella cheese.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.480
And low-moisture mozzarella
cheese is the

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.010
stuff that you shred.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.050
So you go from cheese
that you slice to

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.300
cheese that you shred.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.250
I have some cheese pictures
that are missing in the

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.890
universe somewhere, but you know
what cheese looks like.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.330
And cheese that's on this pizza
over here, that New York

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.490
Pizza Suprema, it's

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.750
high-quality cheese from Wisconsin.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.590
That is whole milk,
low-moisture.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.420
It's a company called
Grande, and their

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.650
mozzarella is excellent.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.630
It's just that when you bake it,
some of the fat is going

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.660
to rise up to the top, because
they're in ovens that are

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.371
lower temperatures, and
they're going to

00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:40.100
take longer to bake.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.090
It's a deck oven.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.990
And that oil's going
to rise to the top.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.090
And that's what you're seeing,
the coloration on

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.230
the very top of it.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.690
You'll also see, since it's a
shredded cheese, a lot of that

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.540
tomato is going to
bleed through it.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.610
And the tomato is a whole other
story as well, because

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.660
if you look at-- this is another
picture from Di Fara.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.280
And I took this picture of the
tomatoes he's using, because

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.810
he's using these boxes of canned
whole tomatoes, which

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.240
is the old traditional method
of doing sauces.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.880
So I don't know if you guys can
see this from back there,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.730
but there's two cans here.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.350
One of them says pizza sauce,
the one on the right.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.430
And then the one on the left
is our whole tomatoes.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.130
So there's a tomato.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.620
You can see two tomatoes
floating around in this puree.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.070
The one on the left is the old
method of doing tomato, and

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.580
the one on the right
is the new one.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.125
On the left, it's whole
tomatoes that

00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:30.580
are going to be crushed.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.520
And at Donatella, that
sauce is just

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.930
crushed tomato with salt.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.400
It's uncooked, because that's
the way it was back in Naples.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.680
Because in Naples, I think
earlier I mentioned about how

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.240
you don't really get tomato on
pizza for quite a while.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.200
You get tomato in the first
recipe in a Neapolitan

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.400
cookbook for a tomato
sauce is 1693.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.740
And then you don't really have
anything hitting dough until

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.690
long after that.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.900
So you're probably talking about
the mid-18th century

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.960
where you start to get more
tomato landing on dough.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.750
So it's kind of a new thing.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:03.230
But at that point, they're just
taking tomatoes, crushing

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.510
them up, and throwing
them on dough

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:05.940
because they're plentiful.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.610
They're around.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:09.060
AUDIENCE: Tomato was
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.370
SCOTT WIENER: Exactly.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:12.480
SCOTT WIENER: Exactly.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.160
Exactly.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.680
Exactly.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.950
And after 1492.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.760
Because that first
ride did not get

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.020
everything coming back.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.990
Took a couple of rides to
figure out the tomato.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.880
The tomato's originally
from Central America.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.740
It ends up being cultivated,
we don't even really know.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.780
Probably in Mexico, but again,
we're not really sure.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.990
But then it does end up coming
back to Europe because of the

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.240
Spanish conquistadors.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.060
Because remember, they had a
lot of people sailing under

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.640
the Spanish flag, but
they're Italians.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.850
Because at that time, southern
Italy was under Spanish rule.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:50.880
So you get all these products
coming back like the tomato,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.410
and they're all landing in
southern Italy, all because

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.330
southern Italy is a place where
there was fertile soil.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.600
So that's what you have
going on on the left.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.140
But remember, in the United
States, up until, really, the

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.370
Second World War, you have all
the tomatoes of Italy.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.760
It's really hard to get tomatoes
out of Italy between

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.840
the First and Second
World War.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.760
Mussolini kept all
the tomatoes.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.260
Very seriously, wasn't
exporting tomatoes

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.500
to the US, for sure.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.960
So we were kind of left to our
own devices, and that's bad,

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.240
because our tomatoes we're
not that hot at the time.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.390
And so instead of people
preparing sauces just with a

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.480
crushed tomato, they started
cooking down the sauce and

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.860
started adding oregano and
adding basil and adding who

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:36.500
knows what.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.190
Sugar.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.340
And that's what's
on the right.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.940
You can buy a can
of pizza sauce.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.210
Some pizzerias take a lot
of pride in that they

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.980
do their own sauce.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.860
Some of them buy the pizza sauce
and they add more spices

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.910
and things because they want
to put their mark on it.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:50.100
And then you just end
up getting this

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.990
really highly acidic--

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.490
it really gives you a little,
ooh, after you eat it, or

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:55.550
really pasty.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.230
You get a lot cleaner taste from
the stuff on the left.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.476
It's just that for a
while, we didn't

00:44:00.476 --> 00:44:01.770
really have good tomatoes.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.040
Now we do, and now
it's getting OK.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.160
But I wanted to show you this
because you can even see the

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.250
coloration.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.390
The right side is a lot darker
than the left side.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.360
So you can tell that's
been cooked.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.380
That's been cooked, which means
that the water's going

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.160
to evaporate and you're going
to have condensation of

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.930
sugars, and maybe even slight
carmelization, because of so

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.730
much sugar that's already
in the tomato.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.210
So right there, a cooked
versus, on

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.560
the left, and uncooked.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.160
On the pizzas that we've had,
Suprema, that one is an

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.800
uncooked one, the Margherita
pizza.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.820
Suprema's regular one
is cooked, and

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.350
Donatello's is uncooked.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.190
And John's is also uncooked.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.160
So we had a little
combination.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.134
AUDIENCE: Where are the best
tomatoes grown in the US?

00:44:40.134 --> 00:44:44.680
SCOTT WIENER: That's an amazing,
amazing question.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:50.360
So we actually did a taste test
of a bunch of different

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.250
commercially available
tomatoes.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.400
This was, I think, two years
ago, maybe three years ago.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.960
And I just went to different
grocery stores.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.920
I went to restaurant
supply stores.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.440
I grew some in my backyard.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.420
We did everything.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.460
And it was a double-blind
taste test.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.360
So I labeled all these cans, got
rid of the paper labels,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.240
gave them to somebody else,
who then served them up to

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.420
people in dishes labeled
G, I, F, whatever,

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.850
letters of the alphabet.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.990
And we gave everybody a sheet.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.480
And these are people-- pizzeria
owners, culinary

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.290
students, pizza writers, people
who I'm friends with

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.820
who just wanted to come over
and eat some tomatoes.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.050
And everybody ranked the
sweetness, the acidity, the

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.210
color, the texture, and
the overall flavor.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.690
And I have all that raw data.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:36.590
If anybody wants to see it,
it's all on my website.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.870
So you can see, there is not one
best tomato, because maybe

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.720
you want acidity, maybe you want
sweetness, and maybe you

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.470
want acidity and sweetness.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.800
And that's fine, because
we got all

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.300
that on the data sheets.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.830
Now, with all these tomatoes,
you see-- there's one that's

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.530
called San Marzano.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.250
San Marzano is a big
name in tomatoes.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.500
If anybody makes pizza
at home, you

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.660
probably use the San Marzano.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.570
There's a lot of pride when
you use the San Marzano

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.000
tomato, because they talk about
it on The Food Network,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.780
and you're just like, mmm,
I did it, Rachael Ray.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.370
I did it.

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.440
San Marzano tomato, San
Marzano is just

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.840
a variety of tomato.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.050
You can buy packages of San
Marzano tomato seeds and grow

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:14.010
them anywhere you want.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.900
But the traditional
San Marzano is

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.900
grown in the southern--

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.790
so the soil of the southeastern
slope of Mount

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:22.900
Vesuvius, which is why some
of these cans say

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.280
San Marzano on them.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.900
I know you can't all see
it from back there.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.330
But there is one over here that
says San Marzano on the

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.930
bottom, but it says DOP, which
means Designated Origin of

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:33.100
Protection.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:36.420
When it says DOP, it means that
it's guaranteed to be

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.550
from that region.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:39.520
When it just says San Marzano--
like this one over

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.050
here, La Bella San Marzano,
is an excellent tomato,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.210
but it's not a DOP.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.000
It's not guaranteed to
be from that region.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.130
Does it make it good?

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:49.390
Does it make it bad?

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.130
You'll find out in the results
that we have, because that's

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.760
what we were checking.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.900
I wanted to know, does DOP
make a difference?

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.080
Does the other stuff
make a difference?

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.790
This one's called Sclafani,
which is this great

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.010
Italian-sounding name.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.640
Those are grown in New Jersey.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.530
But since a lot of people like
to buy local, they have

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:09.370
another label that says "Jersey
Fresh." And so you can

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.910
buy the same tomatoes, depending
on if you wanted to

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.470
have an "i" on the end of it,
or if you wanted to say it's

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.210
from New Jersey.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:15.940
The same stuff.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.400
And we checked them, and it was
funny, because our taste

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.470
testers put them pretty
close to each other.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.020
And they didn't know.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.170
So it's this roundabout thing,
although the DOP thing is so

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:25.790
interesting.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.340
Somebody from the Italian
Consortium of San Marzano

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.980
tomatoes within the past eight
months came out with a

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.880
statement saying that 95% of San
Marzano tomatoes shipped

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.060
to America are fraud.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.230
They're fraudulent tomatoes
that are packed by Italian

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:42.650
companies using Chinese tomatoes
or somewhere else,

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:44.540
and they're sent over here
because we don't have any laws

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.300
about that.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.790
In Italy, they have law that if
it says DOP, it's got to be

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.600
from that region.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.810
That's how you get the stamp.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.450
If you get busted there,
you pay a fine.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.020
Nobody's ever gotten arrested.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.300
You just pay a little fine.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.880
It's no big deal.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.170
But if you get caught with
them here, nobody cares,

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.000
because you're just excited you
got San Marzano tomatoes.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.770
Does somebody have a question?

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.010
Yeah.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:06.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.780
So all these tomatoes that I
see right here are canned.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.435
SCOTT WIENER: Yes.

00:48:10.435 --> 00:48:14.317
AUDIENCE: I've heard thoughts,
ideas, rumors, that if you

00:48:14.317 --> 00:48:17.544
have canned tomatoes, as opposed
to boxed crushed

00:48:17.544 --> 00:48:20.538
tomatoes, you sometimes can get
a little bit of a metallic

00:48:20.538 --> 00:48:23.033
taste to them.

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.528
Is that something that
you've seen?

00:48:25.528 --> 00:48:26.530
Do you care?

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.150
Do you not care?

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.100
SCOTT WIENER: Oh, I care.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:28.700
Yeah.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.940
We tested Pomi, which is the
big boxed tomato company.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.950
They don't make a boxed
whole tomato, at least

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:36.890
as far as I've seen.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.550
We only tested whole tomatoes.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.460
But yeah, since tomatoes are
very acidic, and since

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.080
anything you can has to have a
PH that's acidic enough to

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.890
stop bacteria from growing, to
prevent them from growing,

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.900
that's why you might get
tinniness out of a tomato.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.490
But more often than not, you
can get rid of that by just

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.890
rinsing off the tomatoes
under some lukewarm

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:58.630
water, is really it.

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.870
Some of it is rumor.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.530
Some of it is true.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.800
But really, you taste it, and if
it tastes good, it's good.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.210
Remember that these tomatoes--

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.470
there was a picture I showed you
with the tomatoes floating

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:11.220
in the can, the stuff that it's
floating in is usually

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.520
chopped up junk tomatoes.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.800
So you probably don't really
want to eat those.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.620
You want to eat the whole
tomatoes coming out of it.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.720
That's why in the US now, a lot
of people like to buy a

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.950
canned sauce or a crushed
tomato, because then 100% of

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:28.170
the volume of that can will
be goods that you can use.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.070
When you buy them as whole
tomatoes, you might get rid of

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.920
some of the juice.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.330
And then you're not getting
100% of it.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.530
So that crushed tomato
that's in the box,

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:36.930
the box may be good.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.000
It may taste better.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.720
But the tomatoes themselves,
I didn't find

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.740
it tastes any better.

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.530
And I actually find the other
ones to taste better.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.340
But I would love to do
boxes, because these

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.630
take up a lot of room.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.200
Look at all the wasted
space between them.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.920
Boxes are really great
for stacking.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.510
And really, I mean, the Pomi
company was at the

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.580
International Pizza Expo in
Las Vegas this past March.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.330
And they were really excited
to show you how

00:49:58.330 --> 00:49:59.980
much space it saves.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:03.665
The same volume of tomatoes in
boxes is like this and in cans

00:50:03.665 --> 00:50:04.740
is like this.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.790
And that's what sells to people
at the International

00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.610
Pizza Expo in Las Vegas,
which is a real thing

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:12.470
and not just a fantasy.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.750
Yeah.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:16.187
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that you
don't feel there's a best

00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:18.642
pizza [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:18.642 --> 00:50:22.079
Let's say you just go to a
name-brand place, and you

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.552
don't know [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:23.552 --> 00:50:26.498
wherever you end up because
you're on that block.

00:50:26.498 --> 00:50:29.115
Are there some key signs that
you look for or key

00:50:29.115 --> 00:50:29.630
indicators?

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.308
How do I just, on a one-off stop
and evaluate if this is a

00:50:33.308 --> 00:50:34.420
place worth getting a slice?

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.200
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah, big time.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.310
Well, the first thing I should
say to that is that it only

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:40.380
costs $2.75 to find out.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.135
So really, when I find a place,
I don't really go in

00:50:43.135 --> 00:50:46.340
and snoop around and
be like, hmm.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.330
I go in and give it
a quick look.

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:51.980
And if it doesn't look bad,
then I drop the $2.50 and

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:52.840
check it out.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.790
And then I know.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:57.730
But telltale signs that you
might want to walk away-- heat

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.990
lamps, of course, having pieces
that look glazed over.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.020
If there are more than 10
pizzas sitting out, then

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.230
there'd better be 10 people
sitting in that place.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.790
Places that have fewer pizzas,
I feel like you can rely on

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.960
them more, just because the
turnover is going to be so

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.460
much faster and so
much cleaner.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.750
So at a place like Joe's on
Carmine, they only have four

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.080
pizzas ever sitting out.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.630
You're always going to
get a fresh slice.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.090
You go to places like Suprema
has, I think they have 15 or

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.690
20, but there are always 20 or
30 people sitting there.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.660
So you know that people
are eating it.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.980
When you go to some
other places--

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.770
like, there's one, I just saw
paper in the window two days

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.880
ago, and I was like, great,
because they stunk--

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.770
you see so many pizzas sitting
out and then not enough

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:36.830
movement happening.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:41.850
So yeah, you can't really judge
them by something like a

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:43.150
particular ingredient.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.820
I wouldn't tell you to go to the
garbage can and look for

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.190
some of these cans.

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.160
Which by the way, to answer
the question that came up

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.490
before, the tomatoes that did
the best in our taste test,

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:56.690
the highest overall flavor,
were both from California.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.280
They were both from central
California, which I was blown

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.620
away by because I really--

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.200
the DOPs came down very low.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.090
They were very acidic.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:05.830
The California ones
were very sweet.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.300
So it may have just been
that we liked eating

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:08.730
them out of the can.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.090
We liked eating it
fresh better.

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:11.670
Maybe cooked, it would've
been different.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.220
But it just seemed like if you
like it out of the can, you're

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.420
going to like it after it's
been on a pizza for five

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.490
minutes in an oven.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:19.940
So it was just really

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.120
interesting to see that happen.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:26.340
The number-one tomato of our
whole list was not the $6 San

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.210
Marzano or the $3.48
San Marzano.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:33.075
It was the $1.49 Trader Joe's
canned plum tomatoes.

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.870
I loved it.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.420
I thought that was really,
really great.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:45.090
But yeah, all these ingredients,
they come in all

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:48.720
because of social and economic
and historic reasons.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.560
That's kind of why we end up
eating the way we eat.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.890
It's not that somebody just
decided one day that this

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:55.320
would be a good topping
combination.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.700
In Chicago, Chicago's such a big
pork city that sausage is

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.340
the thing to do in Chicago.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.540
In New York, people are always
on the go and on the move, so

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.300
this is why we have
a slice culture.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.200
We don't have deep-dish
pizza in New York.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.080
There's no one doing
it except for two

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.660
locations of Pizzeria Uno.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.920
And that's even debatable if
they're doing anything there.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:20.620
But it's because we don't have
time to wait 45 minutes for a

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.780
pizza come out of an oven.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.760
And that's how long it takes.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.140
So much of it has to do with
the vibe of a city.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.980
And right now, you see pizza by
the slice starting to pick

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.450
up a little bit more especially
in cities where you

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:32.500
have foot traffic.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.350
It's the thing.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:37.420
In Los Angeles, where everyone's
in their car, and

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.220
that's it, when you have
pizzerias that have valet

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.730
parking, which kills me, it's
not a big slice culture.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:45.000
And when there is a place that
sells slices, everybody's

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.410
like, there's a place
that's the best now.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:49.500
It's just like New York.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.540
And it's not.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.710
Cutting it up and selling it
to me one piece at a time

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.540
doesn't make it the
same as New York.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.450
New York has all these myths and
legends about what makes

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.720
the pizza here so different.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.410
And people say it's these old
ovens, or it's the water, or

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.240
anything like that.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.770
And really what it comes down
to is that there's a long

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.420
tradition of making pizza and
that the pizza that was made

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.700
here originally is one step
removed from the original

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.890
pizza of southern Italy.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:20.280
And if the Southern Italians had
gone to Moscow instead of

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.570
coming to New York and New Haven
and all these places in

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.880
the Northeastern US, then you
would've had a higher bar for

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.990
pizza there.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:29.980
If, then, pizza got so popular
there that we got it, we would

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.680
have had third tier.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.790
In the Midwest, you have a lot
of pizzerias that opened in

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:34.970
the '40s and '50s.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.010
So when people say, oh, I got
this great place, it's been

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.500
around forever, it's been around
since 1958 or something

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.600
like that, it's not all
that long in the

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.560
American pizza landscape.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.200
So places that have been around
that long are basing

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.760
themselves off of what
came before them.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.250
And you're always going to
have this little bit of

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:51.580
degradation happening.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.020
Until recently, until right
now, where we're really

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.330
looking straight down the line
on the future of pizza, at

00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:59.960
places that are like--

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.950
earlier, before you guys came
in, we were talking about

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.360
Roberta's in Bushwick.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.130
I mentioned Paulie Gee's before,
places like this--

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.690
Speedy Romeo in Clinton Hill--

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.740
where they're doing interesting
topping

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.270
combinations and using pizza
as a genre of food

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:14.900
and not as a dish.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.570
Its pizza is sort of the
genre, and then you do

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.030
whatever you want to
do within that.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.990
And you can play, and you can
do anything, Which is why

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.970
mashed potatoes work on pizza,
and people can admit that in

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:29.700
public, which is not
always the case.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.680
Sometimes people are into
funky toppings.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.810
Have you ever had peanut
butter on pizza?

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.690
They do that in New
Haven, too.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:36.570
Weird.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.070
And yet in New Haven, they're
all about having some of the

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.230
oldest pizza in America.

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.240
They're not bound to the
tradition, which I think is

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.310
really great.

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:48.420
And that sort of seems to be
where we're going in pizza

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.650
right now, is people are
pulling it into local

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.500
traditions, doing things
that are interesting.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.470
I'm meeting with a guy
tomorrow from--

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:57.770
I don't even remember
where he's from.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:58.910
But he wants to open
up a pizzeria.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:03.850
It's going to be one of the only
pizzerias in his town.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.710
And his concept, what he sent to
me, the list of ingredients

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:09.550
that he wants to use, it's a
lot of this local stuff.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:12.250
And it's a lot of these dishes
that he's used to eating.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:16.150
And it's great to put that onto
a pizza concept and kind

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.770
of see where it goes
from there.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:22.020
But I know that the pizza
is dwindling.

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:25.840
And I don't know if you
guys have to stop

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.640
talking about pizza.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:31.280
But if anybody has any
questions, I would love to try

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.880
to answer them, if possible.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.060
Yeah.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.095
AUDIENCE: So you're not
going to say what's

00:56:35.095 --> 00:56:35.455
your favorite pizza.

00:56:35.455 --> 00:56:37.850
What's the worst pizza
you had in New York?

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:38.670
SCOTT WIENER: Oh, great.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:40.100
Now, that's a good question.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.715
The worst pizza I ever had in
New York was at a place-- and

00:56:42.715 --> 00:56:45.320
I won't mention the name,
just because--

00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.360
come up to me later, and I'll
write it on your arm with a

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.760
knife or something so
you never forget it.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.720
And it's this place
in Crown Heights.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.450
And I got an email from them
that was maybe the first

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:57.460
couple of months when I started
doing pizza tours.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.430
And my biggest fear when I
started doing pizza tours is,

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.120
like, oh no, people are going
to think that I'm calling

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.790
myself an expert, which I've
never, ever done that.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.750
Greg can call me what
he wants, but I

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.340
would never call myself--

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.610
every person who eats pizza
is a pizza expert.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.480
But this person sort
of challenged me.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.740
They said, if you really
consider yourself a pizza

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.370
person, you must have
gone to this place.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.840
They make every slice by
hand and all this.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.480
And I'm thinking, oh, they make
a slice one at a time?

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.400
Whoa.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.600
And of course, they meant
the whole pie.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.730
It was, whatever, nomenclature
difference.

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:32.920
That's OK.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.090
So I went to this place.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:35.700
I drove out there.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.750
My friend was in the
car with me.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:37.960
And I said, hang on here.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.500
I know it looks weird, but
I've just got to go

00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.290
in and eat a slice.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.010
And if it's great, I'll take
you in, and it'll be great.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.470
And I grab the slice.

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.660
It was very weird.

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.610
It felt like a school cafeteria
that had been empty

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.850
for six years, and the only
people that ever stood in

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.140
there were small children
or the two people

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.240
who served the pizza.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.560
But they definitely did not make
it, because they didn't

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.420
know, really, anything about
what was going on.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:00.910
And I ate it.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:04.820
It was the only pizza that I've
ever taken a bite and

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.160
then not swallowed it.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.840
And that was one of the worst
pizzas I've ever had.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.050
I remember chewing
it a little bit.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.880
And then I thought, is
something wrong?

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.500
What's wrong with me?

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.830
Am I having a heart
attack right now?

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:18.900
And it just turns out that
it was just real bad.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.410
So I'll tell you
the name later.

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:21.630
But I'll put it this way.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:22.860
You're never going
to go there.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.830
You're never going to even
find it by accident.

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:26.310
So it's probably best
to just don't

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:28.972
ever go to Crown Heights.

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:29.445
Yeah.

00:58:29.445 --> 00:58:30.864
AUDIENCE: See, I'm
a wine lover.

00:58:30.864 --> 00:58:32.940
So here, I open a new
bottle of wine.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:33.894
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:33.894 --> 00:58:35.930
but I look at the color
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.625
And I try to get the aromas
first before I

00:58:38.625 --> 00:58:39.850
actually taste it.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:44.015
So you being a pizza lover
[INAUDIBLE], when you hear

00:58:44.015 --> 00:58:46.383
that there's a new pie that
you've just got to try, I'm

00:58:46.383 --> 00:58:51.120
sure you don't just grab it and
take a bite right away.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.720
SCOTT WIENER: I don't know
what else to do to it.

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.660
The thing about pizza is that
it's such a simple food, which

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:00.460
is what's so great, is that
anybody can over-think it

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.250
quite easily.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.620
And that's why I try to not.

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.030
I mean, it's not like with
wine how there are things

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.660
chemically going on that you
need to prepare for yourself

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.890
to take in.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:13.940
But with a slice of pizza, I
think almost the wrong thing

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.240
to do is to look at it and
over-think it first.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.610
You could over-think it later.

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:18.570
I do that every day.

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:22.060
But I like to, first of all,
wait until the pizzeria is

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.100
open for two or three months.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.060
Let them work out the kinks,
and then go in there, sit

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.940
down, eat a slice.

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.890
I wouldn't take it in--

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.520
I don't inspect angles of the
slice first, because the most

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.650
important thing at the end of
the day is not the oven.

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:37.360
It's not the type of
tomato they use.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.990
It's how it tastes when you
eat it, because it's food.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.830
I don't care how long you age
the steak or whatever.

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:47.350
If I eat it, and it's bad,
I don't like it.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:50.010
Again, I don't care about-- so
many places say, we use this

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:51.520
type of flour, this
type of tomato.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.940
We have the buffalo sitting
right there in the corner.

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.240
I don't care.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.720
If it tastes good, it's good.

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.220
So many times, again-- this
happens on the West Coast a

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.900
lot-- they say, oh, we use
imported New York tap water.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.030
That's why our pizza's
so good.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.830
And I eat it, and I'm like,
man, you'd better start

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.790
importing some other water,
because I don't care what you

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:10.940
do, it's not good.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.700
So really, no, jump in
there, take a bite,

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.510
and then that's it.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.900
Is this a pizza that I want to
eat when I'm not hungry?

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.050
That's the big test of it.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.370
Because when you're
real hungry,

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:23.330
anything could taste great.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:24.950
You wolf down a couple slices.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.790
You always got to go in--
whenever I'm doing pizza

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:31.710
tasting, raisins and pretzels
to take off the edge

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.410
before you go in.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:37.980
Because if you drove two hours
for it, you can't go in there

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.540
without anything.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.180
Yeah, what's up?

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.998
AUDIENCE: Any advice for
someone [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:41.998 --> 01:00:43.000
SCOTT WIENER: Definitely.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.780
You make pizza at home?

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.620
What's your method?

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.780
Do you bake it on a
pan, on a stone?

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.120
You make your dough?

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.970
You buy your dough?

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:52.630
AUDIENCE: I have this
skillet [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:53.370
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah.

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.560
So this is a method that a lot
of people use that I've

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560
actually never tried.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.090
It's the skillet broiler
method, where

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.400
you heat up the skillet.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.310
So you make a really hot surface
that you then put your

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:05.050
dough into.

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.210
That surface conducts heat
directly into the dough,

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.230
starts to bake, and then you
put it under the broiler to

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.630
give yourself top heat.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:12.350
And yeah, that's
a great method.

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:15.340
I would say just overall, if you
make pizza at home, if you

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.290
make your dough, let
your dough relax.

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.710
If you start to stretch it, and
it shrinks back, cover it

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.650
and walk away from it.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:24.280
Don't force it.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.960
Always underwork your dough.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.660
I mean, really, it sounds
ridiculous.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.770
Even I hear it come out of my
mouth, it sounds ridiculous.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.670
But I've got a friend, John
Arena, who owns a bunch of

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.980
pizzerias in Las Vegas.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.880
And he's from out here, and he
always tells me the same thing

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.990
whenever I see him about.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:40.270
We always watch people
working their dough.

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:42.800
And he always says, that
dough, it's alive.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.940
And it is alive.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.690
There's yeast in it.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:45.890
It's constantly changing.

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.860
But he says it's alive in a
way that you're not even

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.500
thinking about.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:54.260
If you torture it, if you harass
it, it remembers that.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:54.960
It does.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.240
And it will toughen up if
you overwork your dough.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.660
It's why you work your dough
gently and easily and always

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.020
put it onto a hot surface,
like that skillet.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.760
Or if you have a pizza stone,
the big mistake people make is

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.570
they have the pizza stone, and
they have the stone, they put

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:10.440
their pizza together, they put
it on the stone, and they put

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.250
the whole thing into the oven.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.490
And the whole point of the stone
is to be hot so that

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.740
when you put your pizza onto
it, it immediately starts

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:19.490
baking the pizza from
the underside.

01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:21.450
So I know a lot of people who
say, oh, I tried the stone,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.030
but it just doesn't work.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.470
And there's no way that it can't
work, because that's all

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:29.350
it's supposed to do
is be a heat soak.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.860
That's it.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:33.270
It doesn't work if you don't use
it correctly, because the

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:36.240
boxes never say to heat the oven
up for an hour, so nobody

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.460
would buy them.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.430
But yeah, you've got to heat
it up a long time.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:43.830
For home pizza making, I would
say just take it easy.

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:46.890
With toppings, less is more.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:47.430
Take it easy.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.150
Don't be in a rush.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.980
Patience.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.230
That's all it is.

01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.330
And have fun.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:57.060
I mean, even if you don't think
it's the best pizza

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.660
you've ever had, it's still
you made it, and it's just

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.470
going to taste better.

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:01.200
You had a question?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.830
AUDIENCE: Maybe that'll
be the final question.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:04.690
SCOTT WIENER: Oh, OK.

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.460
AUDIENCE: So Di Fara.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:10.800
Often, if you don't get there
right at 11:30, and it's the

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.494
weekend, you wait a long
time for your pizza.

01:03:13.494 --> 01:03:16.935
I have this notion that--
it's pretty good pizza.

01:03:16.935 --> 01:03:18.250
Don't get me wrong.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.625
But I have this notion that
people love it the way that

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.540
they do because by the time
they get it, they're so

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.592
hungry, and they've waited so
long, it's kind of like a

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:25.732
pizza Stockholm Syndrome.

01:03:25.732 --> 01:03:26.644
SCOTT WIENER: Yes.

01:03:26.644 --> 01:03:27.890
AUDIENCE: Is there
anything to that?

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:28.610
SCOTT WIENER: Oh,
without a doubt.

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:31.610
Part of it is that when you go
to any place that has hype,

01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:33.750
that there's so much going on,
and you're looking around, you

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:34.440
see all these people.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.310
When you're at Di Fara, there's
this amazing communal

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:40.930
thing that happens where half
the people are there looking

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:43.770
at the other half being like,
oh, it's your first time?

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:44.640
I'll show you.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.150
That kind of thing.

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.230
And then the other half are
like, oh, what do we do?

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.720
Where do I go?

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.490
It's smoky in here, and
my eyes are crying.

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.120
What am I going to do?

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.170
And I love watching
that whole scene.

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:56.260
But the best way to approach
Di Fara is definitely not

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.620
hungry, because you'll always
be hungry by the

01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.570
time it comes out.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.540
And if you're bringing somebody
there who's never

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.110
been there, don't hype it up.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:04.870
Don't tell them anything.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:07.520
Sometimes I'll get tours of,
like, a family from Australia

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.590
or something like that,
or from Texas.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:10.660
I had a family from Texas.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.770
They never heard anything
about it.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:13.600
I told them where to meet me.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.910
I said, meet me in front
of this place.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:15.860
I didn't say a word.

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.400
And they ate it, and they were
able to kind of discover it

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.620
for themselves, which
is kind of rare.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.590
It's rare around here to
find somebody who's

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.060
never heard about it.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.610
At least there are myths going
around where people say, oh,

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.705
what about that place where
there's that guy?

01:04:28.705 --> 01:04:32.050
And he only makes 10 pizzas
a day, or whatever.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.020
When you're going to a place
like Di Fara, or anything that

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.210
has that hype, you just have to
bring those pretzels, bring

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.810
those raisins.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.440
Or water.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.020
Water is good.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.650
When you're getting hungry, just
drink some of that water.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.560
And at Di Fara--

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.490
this is probably the last thing
I should tell you guys,

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.240
because I know you guys probably
have to work today.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.350
But I'm going to stay here
and eat all this.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:56.840
But at a place like Di Fara, the
best method is you go in,

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.320
and you look down
at the counter.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.900
And sometimes, there's
a slice pie.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:00.910
And sometimes, there are slices

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.230
there that are unclaimed.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:03.760
Jump on that, and then put your

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.130
order in for the opposite.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.080
So if there's a round pie
sitting there, order a

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.900
square whole pie.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.850
If there's a square sitting
there for slices, order the

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:13.990
round whole pie, just so you
can get the best of both

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:15.670
worlds, especially if you're
taking somebody there who's

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:16.700
never been there before.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.470
You've got to jump on it.

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:18.570
You've got to walk right in.

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.930
And if you get there at 11:30,
they'll seat you.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:22.610
And they usually have
a pie ready to go.

01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:27.890
They're on top of it, although
they make it seem like they

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.540
love drawing it out.

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.642
It's just that he really just
won't move any faster.

01:05:33.642 --> 01:05:35.630
And you don't want him to,
because it already comes out

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:38.720
kind of funky and burnt, and
that's the character of it.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.640
You don't want it to be
burnt by accident.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.100
You want it to be a little
charred because of the scene

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.090
and because of what it's like.

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.030
So if you guys have any other
questions or anything, you can

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:51.690
always send me an email.

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:55.760
My email's just
scott@scottspizzatours.com And

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.680
I keep a blog on my website.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.330
The website is
scottspizzatours.com.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.070
You can easily keep in touch on
Twitter, @scottspizzatour,

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.840
or the Facebook, or
any of that stuff.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.790
Or just ask Greg.

01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:05.800
He can give you my
phone number.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.840
You can text me, hey,
what's the best

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.670
pizza in New York City?

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.200
Just a quick question.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.550
Don't think you've
ever heard this.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:16.840
What's the best pizza
in New York?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.490
Drives me crazy.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:20.250
But anyway, guys, thanks for
coming and for eating pizza.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:25.540
And thanks to Greg and Melissa
for putting this together,

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.910
because if you guys would have
seen some of the emails of

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.870
organization for pizzas,
it would've blown

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:30.660
your mind right there.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.160
AUDIENCE: What's the best
