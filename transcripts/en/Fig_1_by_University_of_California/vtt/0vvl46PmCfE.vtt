00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.069
So there are

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.720
regions of the frontal lobes that are
now being called the

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.420
empathy network and those regions of the
brain do a lot of things, but what one of

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.559
the things that they do is

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.020
they can help us detect other people's
pain

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.160
when you damaged in the empathy networks of
your brain,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.039
which some people, do they become really
impulsive and you can have

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.849
people who were really good citizens of
the world, right?

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.550
And if they have this head trauma and little chunks of the frontal lobes are gone

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.309
they'll start wearing suddenly, they'll
start yelling at their kids,

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.670
they feel disconnected. In the
neuroscience literature they call this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.010
"acquired sociopathy" - through brain
trauma you become a sociopath and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.730
our lab studies find if you give people
a little bit of power they kind of look like those

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.760
brain trauma patients, right? So we find
like,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.870
if I feel powerful, I flirt
inappropriately,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.520
I am more likely at work to swear or act in
a rude fashion,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.090
I'm more likely to gamble. It makes you
impulsive. When you feel powerful you

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.250
kind of lose touch with other people.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.659
You stop attending carefully to what
other people think.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.299
In our lab its come to be known as
the Cookie Monster study.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.049
We brought three people to the lab. We
pointed to one person and said, "you're in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.500
charge," right? And that person kind of felt
powerful

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.430
and then they had to do this really
boring task of, like, writing policy for the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.240
University.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.549
And they're getting kinda bored. We bring a plate of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.990
chocolate chip cookies. Everybody takes
one cookie. All groups always leave one

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.030
cookie on the plate because you don't want to be
that person that takes the last cookie.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.299
So there's that fourth cookie and we find high-powered people

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.549
they reach out and take it. And then my
grad student, Dan Ward at the time,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.490
he came to me and is like, "I think people are
eating differently when they have power."

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.040
and lo and behold our high-powered person is more
likely to be with their mouth open,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.420
lips-smacking,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.860
crumbs literally like falling onto their sweaters...(laughs)...

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.490
It's ridiculous!
