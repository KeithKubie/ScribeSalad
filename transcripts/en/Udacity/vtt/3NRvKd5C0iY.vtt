00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:02.752
So the two questions we’re going to talk about now

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.666
are what are my revenue streams? And next, within

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.751
the revenue streams, how do I price the product.

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.667
So let’s take a look, what exactly is a revenue

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:17.065
stream. A revenue stream is the strategy the

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:21.215
company uses to generate cash from each

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:23.808
customer segment. So if you have multiple

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.608
customer segments, you may have multiple

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:29.494
revenue streams. We’ll go into this in some

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:33.258
detail. But let’s define pricing. Pricing are

00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:37.391
the tactics you use to set the price. How

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.944
many dollars or pounds or is it free in

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:42.609
each of these customer segments.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.427
So now let’s go back and look at the revenue

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:47.460
stream in some detail. First couple of questions

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.391
you need to answer is number one what

00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:54.275
value are customers willing to pay for. How

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.939
do you know this? Well on day one you’re

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:58.872
just sitting in your building or in you

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:01.463
class room or in your lab, and you are guessing.

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:03.109
You’re going, hey these are my customers,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.642
guess. You know, these are the features they

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:08.391
care about. Guess. This the value they’re going

00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.576
to pay for. Guess. But by now you’ve been in

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:13.824
front of a ton of customers. You’ve talked

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:18.280
to them just extensively, and you understand

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.863
what it is they value. And that’s what we’re

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:22.818
going to use to figure out what the revenue

00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:25.147
streams and pricing are. The next thing that

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:27.846
you actually found out outside the building

00:01:27.846 --> 00:01:32.499
was how do customers pay for products today.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.378
Also you want to understand how much are

00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:39.330
they paying. So, how do they pay and how

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.462
much do they pay. So, well, for big picture,

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:46.533
let’s go take a look at the revenue stream

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.042
choices at the highest possible level.
