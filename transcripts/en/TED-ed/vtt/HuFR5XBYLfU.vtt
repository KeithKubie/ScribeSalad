00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.506
Have you ever wondered

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:17.298
who has the authority to make laws

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:19.258
or punish people who break them?

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:21.513
When we think of power in the United States,

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:23.229
we usually think of the President,

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.914
but he does not act alone.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:27.936
In fact, he is only one piece of the power puzzle

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:29.824
and for very good reason.

00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:32.822
When the American Revolution ended in 1783,

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:35.483
the United States government was in a state of change.

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:37.068
The founding fathers knew

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.253
that they did not want to establish another country

00:00:39.253 --> 00:00:40.786
that was ruled by a king,

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:42.671
so the discussions were centered on

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.995
having a strong and fair national government

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.999
that protected individual freedoms

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.499
and did not abuse its power.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.677
When the new constitution was adopted in 1787,

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:55.336
the structure of the infant government of the United States

00:00:55.336 --> 00:00:57.590
called for three separate branches,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.030
each with their own powers,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.507
and a system of checks and balances.

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:03.302
This would ensure that no one branch

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:04.972
would ever become too powerful

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.975
because the other branches would always be able

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.107
to check the power of the other two.

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:11.396
These branches work together to run the country

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:13.773
and set guidelines for us all to live by.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:17.653
The legislative branch is described in Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:19.821
Many people feel that the founding fathers

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.852
put this branch in the document first

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:24.156
because they thought it was the most important.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.296
The legislative branch is comprised of

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:27.996
100 U.S. Senators

00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:31.666
and 435 members in the U.S. House of Representatives.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.331
This is better known as the U.S. Congress.

00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.922
Making laws is the primary function of the legislative branch,

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:40.088
but it is also responsible for

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:42.016
approving federal judges and justices,

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:43.636
passing the national budget,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.805
and declaring war.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.557
Each state gets two Senators

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.183
and some number of Representatives,

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:52.096
depending on how many people live in that state.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:55.774
The executive branch is described in Article 2 of the Constitution.

00:01:55.774 --> 00:01:57.674
The leaders of this branch of government

00:01:57.674 --> 00:01:59.485
are the President and Vice President,

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.553
who are responsible for enforcing the laws

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:03.156
that Congress sets forth.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.296
The President works closely with a group of advisors,

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:06.706
known as the Cabinet.

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:08.546
These appointed helpers assist the President

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:11.888
in making important decisions within their area of expertise,

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:12.850
such as defense,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.934
the treasury,

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.752
and homeland security.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.976
The executive branch also appoints government officials,

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:20.548
commands the armed forces,

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:23.299
and meets with leaders of other nations.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.354
All that combined is a lot of work for a lot of people.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:28.439
In fact, the executive branch employs

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.767
over 4 million people to get everything done.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.795
The third brand of the U.S. government is the judicial branch

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:36.715
and is detailed in Article 3.

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.484
This branch is comprised of all the courts in the land,

00:02:39.484 --> 00:02:41.025
from the federal district courts

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.824
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:44.454
These courts interpret our nation's laws

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:46.241
and punish those who break them.

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:48.380
The highest court, the Supreme Court,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.277
settles disputes among states,

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.552
hears appeals from state and federal courts,

00:02:52.552 --> 00:02:55.455
and determines if federal laws are constitutional.

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:58.091
There are nine justices on the Supreme Court,

00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:00.214
and, unlike any other job in our government,

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.883
Supreme Court justices are appointed for life,

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.176
or for as long as they want to stay.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.132
Our democracy depends on an informed citizenry,

00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:10.140
so it is our duty to know how it works

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.475
and what authority each branch of government has

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:13.682
over its citizens.

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:14.811
Besides voting,

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:16.729
chances are that some time in your life

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.355
you'll be called upon to participate in your government,

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:21.151
whether it is to serve on a jury,

00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:22.361
testify in court,

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:24.193
or petition your Congress person

00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:26.711
to pass or defeat an idea for a law.

00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.855
By knowning the branches,

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:28.718
who runs them,

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:29.993
and how they work together,

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.077
you can be involved,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:31.912
informed,

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:33.580
and intelligent.
