00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:01.868
Yong: Hi, good,
hello everybody.

00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:03.534
My name is Kuan Yong.

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.934
I'm the product manager
for the YouTube APIs.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.133
So, you know, whether you've
been using the APIs

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:15.234
for some time now, or if you're
relatively new to the APIs,

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:18.701
my hope is that you guys will
come away from this presentation

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:21.968
you know, with some cool ideas
for your next mashup,

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:24.567
or at least a richer and better
understanding

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:29.634
of what you can and cannot do
with the YouTube APIs.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:33.534
Now, um...

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.868
Forgot what I
was gonna say.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.767
But, the, the APIs--
though, as Vic mentioned

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.901
in the keynote this--
this morning

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:43.167
that, the,
the Google data APIs

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:46.000
have exceeded over four billion
requests a day.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
And that's not surprising.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.100
The YouTube APIs alone
account for hundreds of millions

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.400
of those requests per day.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.934
So we have
a huge community.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.067
Now, as developers,
you know what,

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:00.434
when we're writing apps,
we tend to just go straight

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.601
for the API documentation.

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.767
You know,
meeting the terms of service

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.667
unfortunately for many of us
comes as an afterthought.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.834
But if you guys
haven't already read

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:11.934
our terms of service,

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:14.701
I think you guys are in
for a real treat.

00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.868
Now, unlike some
of the APIs

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.667
that, that you may
have used in the past,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:23.834
you know, from Google,
or from a different web company,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.634
the YouTube APIs are,
by default,

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.567
cleared for commercial use,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.133
which means, if you're
developing an app,

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.200
and if you want to sell
the app,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.467
make money
from the app,

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.634
you can do so, you know,
without coming to YouTube

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:38.667
and asking us
for permission,

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:41.267
or doing some kind
of a deal with us.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.834
And this is not true
for many of the other APIs.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.367
And we think this is
one of the reasons

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:49.434
why the--our APIs
have grown so big

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:51.200
and grown so popular.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.501
But, you know, with all,
all this power,

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:54.701
and all
this flexibility,

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:57.033
that we're giving to developers,
like yourselves,

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.501
you know there comes, you know,
certain responsibilities.

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.667
There's a bunch of things

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:06.000
that we do not want
our developers to be doing.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So, you know,
let me start my talk

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.634
by going over what some
of these main issues are.

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:17.067
So any guesses from the audience
what's gonna come up

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:19.100
on the next
couple of slides?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.400
You know, based on your own
personal experience

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.100
about developer relations
teams, um, groups.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.501
Anyone--
any guesses?

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.100
Well, let's start with
a pretty obvious one:

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.501
Just trying to access
our video streams directly.

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:36.534
Now the vast majority
of the content on YouTube

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.901
are not DRM protected.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.434
So, you know,
it's possible

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.133
and, quite frankly,
not too difficult

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.067
to rip out streams.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.901
But just because
you can do that,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.901
doesn't mean
that you should.

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:53.133
Our terms of service
clearly prohibits

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:55.934
using or performing
any of the YouTube videos

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.667
except through
an authorized player.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.601
Now, if you're just
developing a web app,

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:03.634
this usually means
using a Flash-embedded player.

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.067
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:06.767
But what if you're trying
to develop an app

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.067
for non-Flash environments.

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:10.534
You know,
if you're developing

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:11.868
a mobile app.

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:13.868
Well, the, the good news is,
you know,

00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:15.734
on some of the
newer mobile phones,

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:18.767
there's already a built-in
YouTube client player,

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:21.100
and, really, what your app
needs to do

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.634
is to figure out
how to delegate playback

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:25.667
to this
external player.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.400
And we know that this is not
always possible in all phones,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.501
but, on the iPhone,
for example,

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:34.400
it is quite possible to write
a native app in such a way

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.400
that, that the user is taken
to the YouTube player

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.601
to watch a video,

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:40.100
and once they're done
watching the video,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.334
they're automatically taken back
to the app where they left off.

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:45.267
So the whole experience
is actually quite nice,

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.267
and, um, seamless.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:49.501
But what about television set,
uh, boxes?

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.534
You know,
what are your options there?

00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:54.367
And unfortunately,
our terms of service

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.767
do not allow you
to develop an app

00:03:56.767 --> 00:03:59.300
that's intended for use
on television displays.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.901
So really
you're gonna have to look

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:03.267
for, uh, for
a different technology provider

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:07.300
if that's indeed
your use case.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.801
But, the, constraining yourself
to the Flash players

00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:13.801
necessarily mean
that you can't do anything cool.

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:16.033
Obviously, we disagree,

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.601
and recently we came across
this really cool mashup

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:20.434
that I'm quite excited
to show you guys.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.968
Unfortunately, the site
is no longer up

00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:24.467
because the campaign
is over,

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:27.334
but we have access to, like,
a password-protected version

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.767
of this site that I can use
to show you guys.

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.033
So this is--this is--
this was done

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:33.601
by a creative agency
in Japan

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.934
to promote an aquarium in,
I think it was Okinawa,

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:38.267
um, in Japan.

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:41.267
And, and what they've done
is taken the thumbnails,

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:43.601
which are available through
the YouTube APIs

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.367
and mapped them
on a vertices

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:48.067
of a--of a
3-D Whale Shark.

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:50.200
And the 3-D model itself

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.434
was created in
Google SketchUp.

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:57.067
So let's see what, the, uh,
end result looks like.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:58.934
Some of you guys
may have seen this.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:00.567
Uh, when it was up.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:03.000
I think it was Tweeted and
blogged about quite a bit

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.434
just because it's, like,
oh, so cool.

00:05:04.434 --> 00:05:06.367
And it's actually better
with the sound on,

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:08.434
but we're not gonna
use sound here.

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:15.334
So let's give this site
a couple moments to load.

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:17.901
And it should come up
any second now.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.968
There you go.

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:23.267
So this is all done
in Flash.

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:25.200
Very cool, you know,
lots of thumbnails,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.434
all from
the YouTube APIs.

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:29.968
And when you click on
any one of these thumbnails,

00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:31.634
the Chromeless player,
which is again,

00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:32.868
um, one of our
authorized players,

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:33.868
pops up,

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:36.133
and you play the video
in place.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:41.234
And, you know, this is
a really cool way to browse,

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:45.334
you know, what looks like to be
a pretty vast collection

00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:48.467
of, of videos that the aquarium
has uploaded to YouTube.

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.300
So really cool--
the site's not up.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.100
Hopefully, we can get
a screen cap of this

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.901
posted somewhere so that
you guys can take a look at it.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.200
All right, second thing
I want to talk about,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.100
just, kind how you name
your product

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.100
or feature that uses
a YouTube APIs.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.901
Unfortunately, you,
whoops--

00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:11.567
You can't say, you know,
YouTube XYZ.

00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:13.868
That's the naming convention
that we've reserved

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:15.934
for our own features.

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.000
And if you start doing that,
then users

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.634
are gonna get confused
as to who built this.

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.334
Was it YouTube?
Was it a community?

00:06:21.334 --> 00:06:22.934
So you can't do this.

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:27.033
In some cases,
you can say XYZ for YouTube,

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:29.100
but we discourage this because

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.000
you really should be thinking
about building a video app

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.801
and not like
a YouTube app,

00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:35.701
which is why
we encourage you guys

00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:38.033
to just call your product
whatever you want,

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:42.367
and use the Powered by YouTube
branding logo

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:45.133
to indicate to your users
that there is

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:49.934
a YouTube integration as part of
your cool mashup.

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:54.901
Third thing, and this happens
so often it's embarrassing,

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:57.868
you know, just resist
the temptation to monetize

00:06:57.868 --> 00:07:02.167
every spare pixel on your
web page with AdSense ads.

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.200
This is a terrible
user experience.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.100
I'm sure you guys
already know this,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.334
and not only that,
in most cases,

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:13.434
putting an ad next to a YouTube
video on the same page--

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:14.968
it's against
our terms of service.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.300
And I'll actually go into
the subtleties later on

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.467
in this presentation,

00:07:18.467 --> 00:07:21.567
but for now, you know,
this is a bad idea.

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:24.100
Also the AdSense
program policies state

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.267
that you can't use AdSense ads
in a way that violate

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:29.267
another Google products
program policies.

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:32.100
So you're actually violating
two sets of clauses here.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.334
And it just is a bad idea.

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:35.400
So don't do this.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.667
So while we're on the topic
of, uh, monetization,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.000
one of the things that
you guys may want to think about

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.200
is, you know, is there ways
for you to monetize your work

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.934
that don't involve
running ads?

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:49.701
You know,
before there was the Internet,

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.534
if you wanted to use
a piece of software,

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:53.901
you expect
to pay for it,

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:55.133
you know,
what a novel idea.

00:07:55.133 --> 00:07:57.467
And happily,
some of these business models

00:07:57.467 --> 00:07:59.834
are starting to reemerge,

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.634
you know, especially
in the mobile world.

00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:03.601
So if you're writing
an Android ad,

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.634
or you're developing
an iPhone app,

00:08:05.634 --> 00:08:08.234
if you can sell the app
and make money from day one

00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:10.467
by putting the app
on the Android Marketplace,

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:11.734
on the iTunes app store.

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:15.334
So a really clean and easy
way to make money.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:17.133
If your app is a little more
complicated than that,

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:19.234
you know, you might want to
think about segmenting your app

00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:23.767
into a free version
and a premium version.

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:26.367
The free version would be
available to everybody.

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:28.634
The premium version would have
some advanced features,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:31.567
which may include something
that's YouTube related.

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:34.734
So use YouTube as a way
to upsell your users

00:08:34.734 --> 00:08:36.701
from the free version
to the premium version.

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:39.167
And we do this ourselves
with Google Earth.

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:41.334
The free version's
available to anybody.

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:46.200
The Pro version contains
a moviemaker, um, tool,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.667
and part of that tool is
the ability to upload your video

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:50.701
directly to YouTube
once it's done.

00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:53.400
So again, the YouTube portion
is not the main reason

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.934
why users are paying
for the premium version,

00:08:55.934 --> 00:08:58.100
but it's one of
the many reasons

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.701
that you use to--
for the upsell.

00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.334
But you may, say,
you know,

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.033
I'm a Web 2.0 guy.

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.934
I'm in the business
of creating websites.

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:09.767
Can't really charge people
to come to my websites.

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.200
So, you know,
what are my options?

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.434
And if this is
the situation that you're in,

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:18.167
yeah, I would think about
the different use cases--

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:20.601
the different parts
of the user interaction--

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:22.634
and then identify
the opportunities

00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:25.300
in, uh, each portion.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.133
So there's the
video playback experience.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.133
This is...
the most obvious one.

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:30.734
You tend to overly fixate
on it,

00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:32.133
in my opinion,

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.968
but unfortunately it presents
the fewest opportunities.

00:09:34.968 --> 00:09:36.734
You might want to think about
content creation.

00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:39.734
You know, allowing users
to upload videos to YouTube

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:42.133
in interesting,
unusual ways.

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:45.567
Or, you know, content discovery
and organization.

00:09:45.567 --> 00:09:47.234
YouTube is designed
for the masses.

00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:49.734
Is there anything you can do
to better address

00:09:49.734 --> 00:09:51.133
specific niche
interests,

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:53.767
or, you know, communities.

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:57.934
So, you know, basically
your ability to monetize

00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:00.167
each part
of the user experience

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.534
is roughly proportional
to the amount of value

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:06.167
that you're adding
to the user experience.

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.734
Video playback, you know, you're
not really doing something

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:11.501
that a user can't already do
on youtube.com.

00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:13.367
So you're not
adding a whole lot of value

00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:15.567
by slapping on
an embed on your web page.

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:17.200
But if you're creating
this whole new tool

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.400
to create videos,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.033
or this whole new tool
to discover videos,

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:22.901
you're giving users
a way to do something

00:10:22.901 --> 00:10:24.200
that they can't before.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.400
You're adding
a lot of value,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.601
and therefore you have
a lot more flexibility

00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:30.634
in figuring out
how you want to advertise

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:33.467
against
that experience.

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.834
So let me call your attention
to this one specific,

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.367
and probably
quite famous, clause

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.901
in our
terms of service.

00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:43.067
It says that you can't,
you know, sell an ad on the page

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:44.601
that contains
a YouTube video

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:47.000
unless there's already
something else on the page

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.100
that warrants
that sale.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.367
And one easy way
to think about this is

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:56.667
if you take the video
out of your web page,

00:10:56.667 --> 00:11:00.434
one, are users still gonna
want to go to that web page?

00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:02.133
And, two, is there
substantial content

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:03.367
left on the page

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:06.167
that you will want to sell an ad
against that page.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:08.968
And unfortunately,
there's not a lot of cases

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.968
where the answers
are yes and yes.

00:11:11.968 --> 00:11:13.667
The classic video
watch page--

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.501
the user clicks on
the video result,

00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:18.367
watches the video--
that page clearly out of bounds.

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:20.200
But, you know,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.767
there may be cases
where there's a blog article--

00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:25.300
it's pretty long, you talk about
a whole bunch of things,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.300
part of that article,
you're referencing

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.667
a YouTube video, you have
the clip in place.

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.400
If you take that video out
of the article,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.834
yeah, maybe the article is gonna
be a little less interesting,

00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:38.033
but users may still want to come
to your page.

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:39.467
Users may still want to read
an article.

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:41.767
So, in that,
so it's justified.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.868
But again,
these cases tend to be

00:11:44.868 --> 00:11:46.767
quite, um, rare.

00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:49.667
But if you do
find yourself in a situation

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.801
where you can actually
sell an ad against

00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:53.834
a page with
substantial video content

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:55.133
from YouTube,

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:57.767
we highly encourage
using this feature

00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:59.434
in AdSense
if you're using AdSense

00:11:59.434 --> 00:12:01.767
to basically screen out
that page,

00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:03.300
that part of the page,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.100
containing YouTube
video metadata

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.601
from the AdSense crawler.

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.200
So you're not
targeting ads

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.734
to anything
that's YouTube specific.

00:12:10.734 --> 00:12:13.067
This is actually documented
in the AdSense help centers.

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:15.000
So if you guys find yourself
in this situation,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.167
you can
look this up.

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:18.601
It's just an easy pair
of HTML tags,

00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.667
and you can add
to your page.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:22.968
So let's talk
about content creation,

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:24.267
which we think
is a lot more interesting.

00:12:24.267 --> 00:12:27.434
just because in YouTube
it's all about

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:28.767
users
sharing videos

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.601
you know, every minute,
20 hours of videos

00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:33.000
are being uploaded
to YouTube.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.467
You know,
it's this amazing community.

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:39.501
And video creation tools
tend to be quite involved

00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:41.400
in the sense that
you draw the user in.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.133
It's, uh,
it's a captive audience.

00:12:43.133 --> 00:12:45.667
There is quite a bit
of engagement involved

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.000
in creating a video.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.467
So, you know,
think about how you can really

00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:52.400
monetize and capitalize
on that part

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.534
of the user experience.

00:12:53.534 --> 00:12:56.434
So one example we like
is Animoto.

00:12:56.434 --> 00:12:57.934
If you guys
don't already know,

00:12:57.934 --> 00:12:59.400
Animoto--it's a pretty cool
website.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.667
You can upload
photos,

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.968
and they use
some really fancy algorithms

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:06.501
to turn those static photos into
fully animated music videos

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:08.167
with all sorts
of special effects.

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.100
Now, the process of
turning these photos

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.033
into something
that's moving

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:13.901
and engaging
takes time.

00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:18.400
And while the user is waiting
for the video to process,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.767
they display what we think
is advertising

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.067
on the page,

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.601
where, you know, hey,
you know, you're waiting

00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:26.267
for us to process
your video,

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:28.968
why not check out this trailer
at the same time.

00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:30.501
So again, you know,
captive audience

00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:33.667
that you can monetize.

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:37.200
And then content organization
and discovery.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.501
So again,
as I said before,

00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:42.534
YouTube is built
for the masses,

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:44.834
to satisfy
as many needs as possible,

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:47.934
but you may be aware
of specific communities

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:53.968
that could benefit from perhaps
an editorial curation of videos.

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:58.200
So, oops, um, one example
is golftuts.com.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.367
What the developer has done
on this site

00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:03.267
is manually select
a bunch of videos from YouTube

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:05.601
that he thought, uh,
could be interesting

00:14:05.601 --> 00:14:07.667
to anybody
who's learning golf.

00:14:07.667 --> 00:14:11.167
And he created a really nice
website experience around it.

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:14.067
So let's take a look.

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:23.033
Let's see.
Here we go.

00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:24.267
So much
of this website

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:25.968
is actually monetized

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:28.267
but he--I mean, he's not
monetizing this site right now.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:29.767
But, for example,
this browse page

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:33.467
with all these
thumbnails and videos,

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:35.901
this page right here--
you know, you can monetize

00:14:35.901 --> 00:14:38.968
using your standard
favorite web ads.

00:14:38.968 --> 00:14:42.200
But, of course,
the video play page itself

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.901
is, um,
out of bounds to advertising.

00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:51.801
So that's, um,
creation of videos.

00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:53.167
If you don't want to be
in the business

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.300
of deciding what your user
should be watching,

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.567
you know,
you could think about a site

00:14:56.567 --> 00:15:00.167
that encourages
community-driven efforts

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:03.734
to pool together
contents of videos.

00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:07.501
So, uh, an example here
would be totll.com.

00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:09.501
I think the creator
of that site's here.

00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.067
Hello, nice to meet you
in person at last.

00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:14.100
Cool site, by the way.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.534
That's totll.com.

00:15:16.534 --> 00:15:19.133
It's a great site where
parents can submit

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:22.200
YouTube videos that they think
other parents

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.133
might enjoy watching
with their young children.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.334
And, you know,
all the content on the site

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:28.534
is community-driven,

00:15:28.534 --> 00:15:31.601
but it serves, you know,
a niche need,

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.434
and, you know,
we would like to see more

00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:35.501
of such mashups
for other communities

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.534
on the Internet.

00:15:36.534 --> 00:15:37.734
There's so many
videos on YouTube.

00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:38.834
It's hard to--

00:15:38.834 --> 00:15:40.868
It's hard to find stuff
if you have

00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:42.767
a really specific,
narrow focus.

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:45.300
So perhaps, you know,
you as the developer can come in

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.300
and do something
really interesting there.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.968
So that's a whole, you know,
discovery part.

00:15:51.968 --> 00:15:54.567
And then there's
the browsing of search results.

00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:57.200
You know, search results
don't always have to be

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.601
a thumbnail next to
some metadata.

00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.467
That's how
YouTube does it.

00:16:01.467 --> 00:16:03.801
It doesn't mean it's
how everybody should do it.

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:06.367
There's other ways
to present video results.

00:16:06.367 --> 00:16:09.501
You may have used
Claurus, I think,

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:15.067
which creates this open GL
3-D visual, uh, experience

00:16:15.067 --> 00:16:17.000
of thumbnails
in moving 3-D space.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.968
Or, um,
Dipity's Time Tube

00:16:18.968 --> 00:16:21.267
is also interesting
in that

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:25.067
it takes
a search term

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.033
and does a bunch of queries
to YouTube

00:16:28.033 --> 00:16:29.434
in the back end,

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:32.000
and presents the results on
this very beautiful timeline

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.534
that you can browse
quite easily.

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:35.367
I've searched for

00:16:35.367 --> 00:16:36.367
Obama here.

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:37.634
The search
takes a while,

00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:40.200
so I just kind of
pre-populated the search box.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.968
And you can kind of
browse videos

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:43.634
on a timeline.

00:16:43.634 --> 00:16:45.300
When you find
something interesting,

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.634
you can watch--
double click--

00:16:46.634 --> 00:16:47.701
and then there it is:

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:50.400
that standard
YouTube Flash player.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.334
It's really quite cool.

00:16:52.334 --> 00:16:54.234
And what makes this site
even more cool

00:16:54.234 --> 00:16:56.834
is that even though it looks
and feels like a Flash app,

00:16:56.834 --> 00:16:57.934
it really isn't.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.133
It's all done
in HTML and Java script.

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:02.801
So pretty awesome.

00:17:09.934 --> 00:17:12.567
All right, now that I still have
your attention,

00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.868
let me just use
the rest of the presentation

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.234
to just kind of go over
some of the issues

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:20.434
that we see developers
run into pretty often,

00:17:20.434 --> 00:17:22.133
and provide
some recommendations

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:25.801
on how to deal with
these specific issues.

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:28.267
So, getting
video metadata

00:17:28.267 --> 00:17:29.868
and how fresh that
video metadata is.

00:17:29.868 --> 00:17:31.200
I get a lot of questions
on that.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.801
And it's--

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:33.834
can be a bit confusing,

00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:35.300
because there is
more than one way

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.367
to get metadata
from YouTube.

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:41.834
There is the low latency,
high QPS way

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:45.400
for use cases
where metadata freshness

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.033
isn't your
number one priority.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.567
You just wanna show
metadata.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:51.501
So search results,
video description, title,

00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:53.300
and [indistinct] result,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.767
or you're building
this site

00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:56.868
where the user can paste in
a YouTube URL.

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:58.200
You want to go
to a server,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.934
grab the metadata
for that URL, video ID,

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:03.667
and then create an embed
with the title and so on.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.801
So for these, sort of,
very frequent operations,

00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:08.901
you can go to
the videos feed

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:11.000
to grab metadata.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.968
This feed is
very highly cached.

00:18:12.968 --> 00:18:14.334
Um, the quota's set
pretty high

00:18:14.334 --> 00:18:16.634
so, you know,
you guys can go crazy.

00:18:16.634 --> 00:18:19.334
But it's not suitable
for content management purposes.

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:22.601
If you need the absolutely
freshest possible metadata,

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.601
there is a different feed
that you have to use,

00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:26.934
and that's
the authenticated uploads feed.

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:28.501
And for that
you actually get

00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:30.467
the freshest possible
metadata you can get

00:18:30.467 --> 00:18:32.000
from the system.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.601
And what it's
really good for

00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:36.801
is updating video metadata
on YouTube.

00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:38.467
So you want to pull down
the freshest copy

00:18:38.467 --> 00:18:39.667
of the metadata,

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:42.133
update it,
and then put it back

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:44.334
on YouTube's server.

00:18:44.334 --> 00:18:46.300
It's a pretty expensive
read operation

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.667
for us to support,

00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.734
and for that reason
the quota is set pretty low.

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:52.868
But for most, you know,
ordinary use cases,

00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:56.534
you shouldn't run into
any issues.

00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:59.100
The next, kind of, tip
that I want to highlight

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.701
is just, you know,
avoid trying to construct

00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:03.601
the embed URL by hand.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.000
We know
it's really easy to do.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.567
You take the video IAD,

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:10.467
you prepare it
for youtube.com/v/.

00:19:10.467 --> 00:19:11.534
Don't do that.

00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:13.701
Instead,
use the media content URL

00:19:13.701 --> 00:19:15.801
that we provide
in the feed response.

00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:17.601
If you look at the URL
that we give you,

00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:19.467
it actually contains
a lot more information

00:19:19.467 --> 00:19:22.067
than what you
normally find.

00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:23.868
I've noticed
the client ID,

00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:27.000
a scrambled version
of your dev key,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.601
and this is useful to us
and to you, too,

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.667
because if,
for some reason,

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.367
we suspect
there's any abuse going on,

00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:36.968
if we can identify
the source of traffic,

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.334
we're much more likely
to go to you first

00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:39.501
and figure out what's--

00:19:39.501 --> 00:19:41.033
hey, you know,
what are you trying to do--

00:19:41.033 --> 00:19:42.701
instead of just
shutting you guys down.

00:19:42.701 --> 00:19:44.534
So having the ability
to know

00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:46.934
what our developers
are doing is helpful.

00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:48.701
And also we plan to make
all this information

00:19:48.701 --> 00:19:50.267
available back to you

00:19:50.267 --> 00:19:53.267
through a tool that
we are currently working on.

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:55.467
So if you use this way

00:19:55.467 --> 00:19:57.100
of creating your embeds,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.000
we can track
the number of playbacks

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.400
that are coming
out of your site,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.267
which means we can
report this information

00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:05.467
back to you
in our developer tool.

00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:06.767
We're still working
on that tool.

00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:07.968
It's not launched
right now.

00:20:07.968 --> 00:20:09.767
It should be available
in a couple of months.

00:20:09.767 --> 00:20:11.267
So the earlier
you start

00:20:11.267 --> 00:20:13.501
providing
the right embed URL,

00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:15.200
the more data
you're gonna have

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.167
when we do
launch that tool.

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.033
And just
a little tidbit:

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:22.901
instead of constructing
that whole HTML snippet by hand,

00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:25.667
you know, consider using a
SWIFT object Java script library

00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:28.868
that you can find on
code.google.com.

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:29.968
It makes it really easy

00:20:29.968 --> 00:20:31.667
to create
these HTML snippets

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:33.200
for doing embeds.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.667
If you're using
that Java script library,

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:37.167
you just need to set
the URL for that object

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:41.834
and, it will just
do the right thing for you.

00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:43.767
Next thing
is versioning,

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:45.400
so, back in
October of last year,

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.267
not sure if all you guys
are aware,

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:49.567
but we-- that was when
we launched versioning.

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.234
So there's actually
two versions

00:20:51.234 --> 00:20:53.868
of the YouTube APIs
in production today.

00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:56.501
There's, uh,
V1 and V2.

00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:59.067
V2 is the one
that we're actively supporting

00:20:59.067 --> 00:21:00.701
and adding
new features to.

00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.200
V1 is kind of frozen.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.033
It doesn't have
as many cool features.

00:21:05.033 --> 00:21:07.300
So if you want absolute
latest and greatest,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.300
you should be
using V2.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.000
If there's any problems
that we find in production,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.667
we're much likely
to fix them for V2 first

00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:17.067
than for V1.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:19.501
Note that V2, however,
is not the default

00:21:19.501 --> 00:21:21.434
in some cases.

00:21:21.434 --> 00:21:24.667
If you are using
the raw HTML request,

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:27.801
You should add
v=2 to the URL request,

00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:31.300
or add this additional
HTTP header field

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.667
to your headers.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:35.567
And if you're using
a client library as you should,

00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:37.901
in some cases
V2 is the default.

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.000
In some cases, not.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.501
The best practice
is to always specify

00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:45.300
which version
you want to use.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.133
So, you know,
last but not least,

00:21:47.133 --> 00:21:50.234
we just want to emphasize
that we at YouTube

00:21:50.234 --> 00:21:52.300
really love
our developer community.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.567
We work really hard
with our content providers

00:21:54.567 --> 00:21:56.968
to make
as much content available

00:21:56.968 --> 00:21:58.667
through the APIs
as possible.

00:21:58.667 --> 00:22:00.067
This is not always easy

00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:01.267
depending on
who we talk to

00:22:01.267 --> 00:22:03.567
but we feel that
the developer community

00:22:03.567 --> 00:22:05.267
is really
important to us.

00:22:05.267 --> 00:22:07.300
We have a groups--
we have a group set up

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.467
at Google groups

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:12.033
that's very actively
monitored.

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.300
You know,
it's a great place

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.334
for you to post
your questions.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:18.267
We try to answer as many
of the questions as possible.

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:20.234
A lot of the issues,
the problems,

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:25.367
the feature requests that
you raise in that group forum

00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:28.200
get a lot of visibility
among the product team

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.968
and the engineering team
at YouTube.

00:22:30.968 --> 00:22:34.400
So, you know, we take
your feedback very seriously.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.200
So if you aren't already
participating in our group,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.601
I highly, highly
encourage you guys to do so.

00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:43.534
All right, that's
all I have

00:22:43.534 --> 00:22:46.133
for you guys, today.

00:22:46.133 --> 00:22:50.100
Are there any questions
I can answer?

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.667
Um, please
use the mic

00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.033
if you have
any questions,

00:22:53.033 --> 00:22:56.801
just so that we're--
we can capture that on video.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.334
Anything?

00:23:03.334 --> 00:23:08.467
Um, can you
use the mic, please?

00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:09.767
man: Uh, hello.

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:11.534
Hey, um,
I was wondering if

00:23:11.534 --> 00:23:13.968
you could maybe speak to

00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:17.567
uh, why it is--could you help
explain what the--

00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:19.234
what the caution is
regarding the ads

00:23:19.234 --> 00:23:21.367
sold against videos?

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:23.601
And maybe,
I know you're not a lawyer,

00:23:23.601 --> 00:23:26.167
but you can
help us sympathize

00:23:26.167 --> 00:23:29.334
with why that's
not a good idea.

00:23:29.334 --> 00:23:31.667
Yong: Um, so
the question was

00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:34.434
can we perhaps
explain a little bit more

00:23:34.434 --> 00:23:37.200
as to why we have
a clause that says

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.033
you can't run
an ad against a video.

00:23:40.033 --> 00:23:44.400
And really
the main reason for that is

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.734
we need to be
absolutely sure

00:23:46.734 --> 00:23:50.367
that you have the rights
to monetize that video playback

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:51.868
before we can
let you do it.

00:23:51.868 --> 00:23:53.133
And in most cases,

00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:57.767
if you're just
pulling videos from YouTube,

00:23:57.767 --> 00:24:02.434
I mean, our agreement with users
who upload videos to us

00:24:02.434 --> 00:24:05.501
is that it's really meant
to be performed

00:24:05.501 --> 00:24:06.734
on YouTube,

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:10.033
and on other sites
if we do allow that.

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.767
And when that happens

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:14.267
the understanding is

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:16.234
the content provider
needs to be identified.

00:24:16.234 --> 00:24:18.501
The rightful rights owner
of that video

00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:19.968
needs to be identified,

00:24:19.968 --> 00:24:21.567
and then
the rights owners decides

00:24:21.567 --> 00:24:24.534
whether or not that video
can be monetized.

00:24:24.534 --> 00:24:25.968
And if
monetization happens,

00:24:25.968 --> 00:24:28.734
it needs to be
some kind of rev share,

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:31.167
or some kind of
a financial deal

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:33.000
with the original
content owner.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.801
So if we're just letting you
put an ad next to the video,

00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:38.200
you're really making money
from something

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.367
that doesn't
belong to you.

00:24:39.367 --> 00:24:41.534
And we don't feel
that it's right.

00:24:41.534 --> 00:24:43.701
I'm sorry,
you had a question?

00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:45.033
man: I had
a similar question,

00:24:45.033 --> 00:24:47.367
but on the other side
of the coin.

00:24:47.367 --> 00:24:48.467
We're advertisers,

00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:49.834
and we
actually wanted--

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:52.334
there's some videos
that are very useful for us,

00:24:52.334 --> 00:24:55.501
and they get a lot of
page views,

00:24:55.501 --> 00:24:56.901
video views
or whatever,

00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.200
and they rank really high
on search engines,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.501
and, on the
YouTube site.

00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:04.567
And we'd love
to use adverts to

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:05.968
advertise
on those videos.

00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:08.100
And we don't see any ads
over there.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.601
We see comments;
we see the videos,

00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:10.868
but we don't see
any ads.

00:25:10.868 --> 00:25:14.100
If you could put in ads,
that would be great for us.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.367
Yong: Oh, are you referring
to the watch page

00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:19.167
or the
search results page.

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:22.434
man: I'm referring to the
YouTube watch page, or whatever.

00:25:22.434 --> 00:25:24.601
Like, the--

00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:27.634
Um, it shows up
on search result, like,

00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:29.200
for one of the terms
that we are interested in,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.334
for instance,
the YouTube video shows up

00:25:31.334 --> 00:25:34.234
and it's really relevant
to what we sell.

00:25:34.234 --> 00:25:35.934
So if you could put
an ad there,

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.968
that would be
great for us.

00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:39.567
Yong: We do have different
ad products

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:41.701
if you want to advertise
on YouTube.

00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:45.334
I mean, there is options
for targeting ads

00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:48.701
on the watch page, as well as
on search results,

00:25:48.701 --> 00:25:49.968
using AdWords
like systems,

00:25:49.968 --> 00:25:50.968
so, I'm not sure
if you're aware

00:25:50.968 --> 00:25:52.501
man: Oh, I was not
aware of that

00:25:52.501 --> 00:25:54.000
because I don't see
any ads there,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.734
so, I didn't know that
I could actually put ads--

00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:58.901
Yong: Yes, so there is
a sponsored videos product,

00:25:58.901 --> 00:26:01.033
which allows you
to promote videos

00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:03.033
on search results pages,

00:26:03.033 --> 00:26:05.834
and then separately there's
a way to buy advertising

00:26:05.834 --> 00:26:07.300
on YouTube
watch pages.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.167
So yeah, I mean, I can follow up
with you offline

00:26:10.167 --> 00:26:11.434
if you're interested

00:26:11.434 --> 00:26:15.300
in learning more
about the opportunities.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.667
Any other questions
from you guys?

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:17.901
man: Hi.
Yong: Oh, sorry.

00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:19.634
man: Yeah, I had
a quick question about the--

00:26:19.634 --> 00:26:21.434
I've seen
some of the YouTube videos.

00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:23.067
They have
some customization--

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:25.467
they'll have, like,
a red transparent bar

00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:26.734
with some text on it.

00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:29.067
Is that the
YouTube Pro version?

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:30.534
Yong: Um,
with different versions

00:26:30.534 --> 00:26:31.701
of the embedded player,

00:26:31.701 --> 00:26:33.734
and there's
the custom embedded player

00:26:33.734 --> 00:26:35.734
where you can actually
customize the colors

00:26:35.734 --> 00:26:38.567
around the chrome
of the video.

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:40.334
But there's also
the Chromeless player,

00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:42.334
which is really
just a video canvas,

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:43.767
with no controls,
no UI,

00:26:43.767 --> 00:26:45.534
just the video window,

00:26:45.534 --> 00:26:48.701
and you can use Flash or
JavaScript or HTML, whatever,

00:26:48.701 --> 00:26:51.534
to build a UI
around the player.

00:26:51.534 --> 00:26:53.834
So some of the players
that you may have seen

00:26:53.834 --> 00:26:56.200
were actually
created from scratch

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.100
on top of
a Chromeless player,

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.968
which is why the UI
may look a little different.

00:26:59.968 --> 00:27:02.634
man: This was, actually--
the player was the same.

00:27:02.634 --> 00:27:06.501
But on top of the video
there was some, uh, text

00:27:06.501 --> 00:27:08.767
that was--that comes up
at a certain timeframe.

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:10.567
Yong: Oh, those
are annotations.

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:11.868
man: Annotations.

00:27:11.868 --> 00:27:13.200
Yong: Annotations are actually
created by the content,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.501
by the video,

00:27:14.501 --> 00:27:16.467
by the person who uploaded
the video to YouTube.

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:19.767
And they basically
follow the player,

00:27:19.767 --> 00:27:21.634
and you can actually
turn them off on the player--

00:27:21.634 --> 00:27:23.934
man: Okay, how do I
create annotations?

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:25.300
Yong: Um,
annotations are actually--

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.634
create--there's no
API for annotations today.

00:27:27.634 --> 00:27:29.667
So if you wanna create
annotations,

00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:31.467
first of all you have to be
the owner of the video.

00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:34.934
And you can do so
on the YouTube watch page

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:36.634
when you're logged in
as the owner.

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.667
And it's the
interactive graphical tool

00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:41.434
for you to, to draw, like,
little speech bubbles--

00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:43.868
man: So we don't need
YouTube Pro for that?

00:27:43.868 --> 00:27:45.234
That's just
regular YouTube?

00:27:45.234 --> 00:27:46.701
Yong: No, there's
no API at all.

00:27:46.701 --> 00:27:49.467
It's a graphical tool
on youtube.com.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.100
that you can use
to annotate videos--

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.667
man: And the name
of the graphical tool?

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:53.834
Yong: I'm sorry?

00:27:53.834 --> 00:27:55.200
man: What's the name?
Is there like--

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.267
Yong: YouTube annotations.
man: YouTube annotations.

00:27:57.267 --> 00:27:59.434
Yong: Yeah.
man: Okay, great.

00:28:01.167 --> 00:28:02.234
Yong: And it's free.

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:05.400
man: [indistinct]

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.133
Yong: Course it's free.

00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:08.901
man: Yeah, I gotta ask
a question

00:28:08.901 --> 00:28:11.200
about the
Chromeless player.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.000
We're actually
using the player.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.200
The problem is you built
the player in Flash 2, right?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.234
Yong: ActionScript 2.

00:28:20.234 --> 00:28:21.367
man: ActionScript 2.

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:24.567
But we had to use
a local connection

00:28:24.567 --> 00:28:26.968
or whatever way
to upgrade.

00:28:26.968 --> 00:28:29.567
So my question is
what is your plan

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:34.133
to update
your versions?

00:28:34.133 --> 00:28:35.434
Yong: We're aware of this.

00:28:35.434 --> 00:28:37.200
We're working on it.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.100
man: Yeah, it's kind of
frustrating because--

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.334
Yong: We understand,

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:42.501
and it's quite a
bad work around,

00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:43.968
to get your--

00:28:43.968 --> 00:28:45.567
man: So do you have
a plan at all?

00:28:45.567 --> 00:28:50.033
Do you have a plan at all
for the future--

00:28:50.033 --> 00:28:51.367
Yong: We're
working on it.

00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:54.634
So, hang in there.
[laughs]

00:28:54.634 --> 00:28:57.100
man: I have a question
that's more relate

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.234
to the little things,
but--

00:28:58.234 --> 00:29:01.367
Today in YouTube
you can see more of the--

00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:04.868
uh, copyrighted content
uploaded by somebody else.

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:07.434
Suppose if I'm writing
my own application,

00:29:07.434 --> 00:29:09.501
and if
I'm searching, and, uh,

00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:11.300
copyrighted content
if I display,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.667
and the original owner
of that video,

00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:16.934
if he flags it,
or if he sues me,

00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:18.734
like, he's gonna fight it
whether it's me

00:29:18.734 --> 00:29:20.567
or it's, uh, YouTube.

00:29:20.567 --> 00:29:21.968
Yong: I'm sorry,
could you repeat the question?

00:29:21.968 --> 00:29:22.968
So you own the video,

00:29:22.968 --> 00:29:25.734
and someone else
uploads your stuff?

00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:27.100
man: Yeah, there are,
like, three parties.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.167
One is the owner
of the video.

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.567
And somebody else, actually,
they upload it.

00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:34.000
They may capture it from
a television or somewhere.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.567
They upload it
to the YouTube,

00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:38.834
and then I search
in a YouTube--using YouTube

00:29:38.834 --> 00:29:41.100
and it gets played
in my domain.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.601
So the one
who is the owner--

00:29:42.601 --> 00:29:44.767
he sees that video displayed
in my domain,

00:29:44.767 --> 00:29:46.334
and he sues me.

00:29:46.334 --> 00:29:49.133
So he's gonna fight it
whether it's me or it's YouTube.

00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:52.033
Yong: Oh, they should
definitely come to YouTube

00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:53.901
if they have a concern
about your content

00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:56.334
because--because
we're just providing

00:29:56.334 --> 00:29:59.901
the content to you
through the APIs.

00:29:59.901 --> 00:30:01.267
Which is why it's important

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:03.000
for you to use
one of our embedded players,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.234
because we provide
a channel

00:30:05.234 --> 00:30:07.367
for delivering the video content
to the end user.

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:09.267
So if you run into
any issues like that,

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:12.100
please ask them to go to
youtube.com.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.133
We have a site.

00:30:13.133 --> 00:30:15.367
It talks about
our DMC obligations,

00:30:15.367 --> 00:30:17.901
and what the escalation
process should be.

00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:21.067
man: So that means I can do
any kind of search on there,

00:30:21.067 --> 00:30:22.634
uh, YouTube,
and I can display the--

00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:25.734
Yong: If you're, uh,
playing by the rules.

00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:28.400
If you're adhering to
our terms of service, yes.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.934
man:
Okay, thank you.

00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:34.767
man: Yeah, I come very much
from the content creation world,

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.200
filmmakers,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.133
Um, looking really at this
adding metadata,

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:43.100
and particularly
Adobe's plans with X and P,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.667
the metadata
are all there.

00:30:45.667 --> 00:30:49.234
Are there plans for that--
within the FLV file--

00:30:49.234 --> 00:30:52.367
are there plans for any of that
within YouTube?

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.701
Yong: No,
I'm actually not aware

00:30:53.701 --> 00:30:58.567
of what those specific
requirements are, so, no.

00:30:58.567 --> 00:31:00.534
So, this is
additional metadata that--

00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:02.467
man: Yeah, this is put in
at script stage

00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:05.100
and it goes through
with the time code of the video

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.267
all the way through,
so it's,

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:10.801
then associated in
Premiere Pro in Adobe,

00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:12.734
Premiere Pro
with the video.

00:31:12.734 --> 00:31:16.000
So it's alongside
the FLV file.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.501
It's gonna be a great way
to monetize the video.

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:22.133
Yong: It's not something
that I'm aware of,

00:31:22.133 --> 00:31:23.634
but we can definitely
talk more,

00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:25.234
you know,
after the presentation.

00:31:25.234 --> 00:31:28.501
man: All right,
great, good.

00:31:28.501 --> 00:31:31.601
Yong: Sure.

00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.801
man: Can't I just extract
the audio--

00:31:33.801 --> 00:31:35.334
Yong: Oh, I'm sorry, could you
move a little closer to the mic?

00:31:35.334 --> 00:31:38.200
man: Can I extract
the audio portion of a video,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.834
just insert it
in YouTube?

00:31:39.834 --> 00:31:41.567
Like, let's say
that it's a song,

00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:43.634
it's in video,
and I want to extract

00:31:43.634 --> 00:31:46.100
the MP3 portion of it,
and then, is it legal?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.267
Yong: See,
by doing that,

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:49.467
you're not using
authorized video players.

00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:52.300
So automatically
the answer is no.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.601
Because if you're using
one of our Flash players,

00:31:54.601 --> 00:31:55.901
you can't
actually do that.

00:31:55.901 --> 00:31:58.534
man: Uh, actually, like,
I saw that one of the plugins

00:31:58.534 --> 00:32:01.000
[indstinct] on the internet,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.167
they actually get the MP3 out
of--MP3 or MP4--

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:07.868
Yong: Yeah, I mean the--

00:32:07.868 --> 00:32:09.567
We're aware of sites
that try to access

00:32:09.567 --> 00:32:10.701
the video stream directly

00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:11.968
and process that stream,

00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:15.567
and we actually do block
those sites as we find them.

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:17.000
man: That's not legal,
actually.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.734
Yong: Yeah, that's against
our terms of service, yes.

00:32:19.734 --> 00:32:21.801
man: Thank you.

00:32:25.467 --> 00:32:26.734
Yong: Cool.
Anything else?

00:32:26.734 --> 00:32:28.400
If not, thank you so much
for your time.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.100
Um, I'm actually gonna be around
for office hours tomorrow,

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.000
starting at 3:00.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.267
I'm probably gonna be there
all day,

00:32:34.267 --> 00:32:37.334
so, and we have office hours
tomorrow afternoon.

00:32:37.334 --> 00:32:39.100
So I hope to see
some of you guys there.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.334
We'll also have
a YouTube talk tomorrow

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.968
where we'll be announcing
a new social feature.

00:32:43.968 --> 00:32:46.868
So, if you guys
wanna hear more

00:32:46.868 --> 00:32:48.167
about what
we're announcing,

00:32:48.167 --> 00:32:49.367
be sure to come
tomorrow.

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:51.968
And, again,
see some of you guys there.

00:32:51.968 --> 00:32:54.033
Thank you.

00:32:54.033 --> 00:32:56.234
