00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.660
We've tried a few different
varieties of melting down metal,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.480
and pouring it into clear ice.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.180
This time, we've got a bunch of lead,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.000
and we want to see if
it has a similar reaction

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to what we've seen before,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.260
or if we'll get something new.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.280
[Music]

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.109
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.210
We picked up a whole
lot of lead fishing sinkers

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.390
from a local super center.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.849
We're gonna throw them down our crucible,

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.070
and melt those suckers down.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.070
And while they're melting,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.670
we'll drill a hole about 60 percent
of the way through our block of clear ice,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.480
mix the two together,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.140
and see if we can get them to explode.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.140
[Music]

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.160
Having the lead rest on
top of the block of ice

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.170
is pretty fun.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340
The heat from the lead gets
transferred down into the ice,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.060
and it just carves a funny
texture over the whole thing.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.160
[Music]

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.480
Lead melts at a much lower temperature
than the other metals we've tried,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380
so I suspect this
will go quite a bit faster.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:31.180
[Music]

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.140
Here we go.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.220
In 3, 2, 1...

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.820
Holy cra—

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.280
I love when it explodes.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.220
Oh, that was intense.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.420
That was a big explosion.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.720
Wow!

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460
Shattered that block of ice.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.880
Just tore it apart.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.860
Popped this off so
it stops lighting on fire.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.520
Let's look at the damage from this one.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.740
Oh, our poor GoPro.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.260
Got exploded off the shelf.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.800
This is the same GoPro
that got brass on it,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.760
molten brass,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.720
from when we tested molten brass in ice.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.460
You can still see some of the
brasses still embedded in the GoPro,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.020
still stuck there,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.680
but still counting
despite a foreign body,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.240
and having just been
blown backwards off the table.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.320
I don't know what makes the difference.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.840
It seemed like when we did aluminum,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.760
and it exploded,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.720
we had more small pieces,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.820
like it shattered.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.079
Whereas the lead, definitely
tore the block of ice into pieces—

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.079
I mean, we have a good spread.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.300
We've got ice like
6-8 feet away from the table,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.959
and then just in lots of big piece,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.260
but it's in mostly big pieces.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.220
There's not tons of tiny little shards,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.540
and that could be that 
the ice was colder

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.540
when we did it with the aluminum.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.240
It was cold in the dome,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.240
and so the ice stayed really cold.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.880
Whereas today,
it's fairly warm in the dome,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.560
and so, maybe,
the ice wasn't as cold.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.099
I know what you're
thinking, ice is ice.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.000
It's freezing cold.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.099
But when we've done this before,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.930
it was actually like
10-15 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.740
here in the dome.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.360
So, it really was keeping it colder
than the freezing temperature of ice.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.840
Wow!

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.860
Where did all the metal go?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.760
Gonna have to watch that on slow mo.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.680
I think it probably
just got blown into the air,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.760
or something like that, scattered,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.800
which is why I was
60 feet away outside the Dome.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.880
It's mostly gone.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.300
Like there's little bits on the table,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.620
here and there,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.480
but that Crucible was full.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.440
Had a tiny bit left
in it when I took it out.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.780
Poured it out.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.500
We just have molten,
formally molten metal,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.529
strewn about on
the ground of the Dome in here.

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:49.209
We've had a lot of molten metal in here.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.019
We've seen this effect before.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.870
We have this sort of
cone pyramid-shaped leftover.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.419
This is where I drilled
using the spade bit

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.680
down into the ice,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.860
and it broke down away from that.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.020
But you can still see the point
right where the drill bit was.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.760
Here's what remains of our
giant block of clear ice.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.010
It's pretty well been smashed into pieces.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.440
It's weird that it completely
destroyed the bottom one.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.880
Here is all of the lead
that I was able to find,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.419
just scattered around the table,

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.840
and when I poured some out of the crucible

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.470
trying to get it out of our metal cup,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.830
I'd say we have
a fair amount of it here,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.960
but we're still probably missing it
at least 30 to 40 percent of it.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.900
So, some of that must have just
been scattered when the ice exploded.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.440
My only explanation.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.800
So, lead in a block of ice 
exploded the ice.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.860
Salt?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.400
We got to explode a block of ice.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.960
Aluminum?

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.340
We got to explode block of ice.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.360
Copper and brass both didn't explode.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.699
We had them cast somewhat 
down in the ice.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.880
We had them geyser up out of the ice, somewhat,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.300
and those were both really 
cool to watch.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.440
But they weren't the explosion
that happens from the aluminum, the lead.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.639
Now the aluminum and led both
melt at much lower temperatures

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.950
than brass and copper.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.680
So, maybe there's something there.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.240
I'm still guessing it has to do with
the specific heat of each material

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.480
that we try it with.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.080
Maybe more testing is still an order.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.400
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.620
That little box up at the top
will transport you directly to our last video.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.260
The box in the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.140
you should be watching next,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.460
and this bomb here in the middle
will subscribe to the channel,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.000
so, you never miss a video.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.259
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.100
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.900
Talk to you then.
