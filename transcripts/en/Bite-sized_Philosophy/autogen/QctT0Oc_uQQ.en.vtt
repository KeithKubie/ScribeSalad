we've done the analysis of the effects
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880
we've done the analysis of the effects
of the future authoring program it has

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
of the future authoring program it has
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889
of the future authoring program it has
had a different its differential impact

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
had a different its differential impact
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750
had a different its differential impact
on men and it had a particularly

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
on men and it had a particularly
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.510
on men and it had a particularly
differential impact on what I would call

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
differential impact on what I would call
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.209
differential impact on what I would call
excluded men and so that would be non

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
excluded men and so that would be non
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.670

majority men who are doing very well so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
majority men who are doing very well so
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840
majority men who are doing very well so
for example at Mohawk College the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
for example at Mohawk College the
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.160
for example at Mohawk College the
theater altering program had a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
theater altering program had a
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620
theater altering program had a
particularly robust effect on Mohawk

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
particularly robust effect on Mohawk
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330

College students who were men who hasn't
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950
College students who were men who hasn't
done very well in high school and who

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
done very well in high school and who
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440
done very well in high school and who
hadn't picked a major that had a

end so you can imagine those people are
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340

they have an ambiguous relationship with

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
they have an ambiguous relationship with
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.130
they have an ambiguous relationship with
the idea of education and they're not

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
the idea of education and they're not
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260
the idea of education and they're not
oriented specifically towards a goal

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
oriented specifically towards a goal
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.310
oriented specifically towards a goal
they're not very motivated now why did

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
they're not very motivated now why did
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.890
they're not very motivated now why did
it have a differential effect on man

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
it have a differential effect on man
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.170
it have a differential effect on man
that's a good question

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
that's a good question
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.130
that's a good question
well first of all the women are doing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
well first of all the women are doing
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620
well first of all the women are doing
better so it might just be a matter of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
better so it might just be a matter of
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480
better so it might just be a matter of
the fact that it does better for people

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
the fact that it does better for people
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010
the fact that it does better for people
who aren't doing as well and at the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
who aren't doing as well and at the
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380
who aren't doing as well and at the
moment most of them are men I don't

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
moment most of them are men I don't
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060
moment most of them are men I don't
believe I think that might be part of it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
believe I think that might be part of it
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340
believe I think that might be part of it
but I don't believe that's all of it I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
but I don't believe that's all of it I
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.469
but I don't believe that's all of it I
think that part of the reason that women

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
think that part of the reason that women
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.670
think that part of the reason that women
are doing better is because they're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
are doing better is because they're
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.550
are doing better is because they're
agreeable and so if a system sets out a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
agreeable and so if a system sets out a
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.709
agreeable and so if a system sets out a
structure and says here's a pathway to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
structure and says here's a pathway to
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870
structure and says here's a pathway to
attainment the women won't rebel against

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
attainment the women won't rebel against
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.310
attainment the women won't rebel against
that they'll go along with it and that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
that they'll go along with it and that's
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.600
that they'll go along with it and that's
working very well for them at the moment

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
working very well for them at the moment
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.700
working very well for them at the moment
the men especially the men on the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
the men especially the men on the
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.440
the men especially the men on the
disagreeable end of the distribution and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
disagreeable end of the distribution and
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240
disagreeable end of the distribution and
there's way more men on the district

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
there's way more men on the district
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.650
there's way more men on the district
disagreeable end of the distribution

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
disagreeable end of the distribution
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660
disagreeable end of the distribution
then there are women right that's what

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
then there are women right that's what
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.710
then there are women right that's what
you get from

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
you get from
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.090
you get from
if you look at overlapping normal

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
if you look at overlapping normal
 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.070
if you look at overlapping normal
distributions so there's the male

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080
distributions so there's the male
 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.510
distributions so there's the male
district female distribution for

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
district female distribution for
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.060
district female distribution for
agreeableness male distribution for

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
agreeableness male distribution for
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.850
agreeableness male distribution for
agreeableness tremendous overlap okay

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
agreeableness tremendous overlap okay
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.380
agreeableness tremendous overlap okay
women are higher all the really

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
women are higher all the really
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390
women are higher all the really
agreeable people are women all the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400
agreeable people are women all the
 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.070
agreeable people are women all the
really disagreeable people are men and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
really disagreeable people are men and
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.320
really disagreeable people are men and
maybe the real differences occur at the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
maybe the real differences occur at the
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.410
maybe the real differences occur at the
extremes right so so and it's a very

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
extremes right so so and it's a very
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390
extremes right so so and it's a very
interesting side effect of overlapping

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
interesting side effect of overlapping
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.250
interesting side effect of overlapping
distributions so they people can be

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
distributions so they people can be
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.590
distributions so they people can be
mostly the same but that can still

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
mostly the same but that can still
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.010
mostly the same but that can still
produce radical differences disagreeable

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
produce radical differences disagreeable
 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.510
produce radical differences disagreeable
men won't do anything they don't want to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520
men won't do anything they don't want to
 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.470
men won't do anything they don't want to
do they just say up yours I'll go home

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
do they just say up yours I'll go home
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.510
do they just say up yours I'll go home
and play video games even I'm not

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
and play video games even I'm not
 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.000
and play video games even I'm not
listening to your stupid classes and why

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
listening to your stupid classes and why
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.340
listening to your stupid classes and why
should I work for you I'll just go have

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
should I work for you I'll just go have
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.460
should I work for you I'll just go have
fun I'll do my own thing I don't think

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
fun I'll do my own thing I don't think
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.050
fun I'll do my own thing I don't think
they're motivated and so then if you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
they're motivated and so then if you
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.850
they're motivated and so then if you
take the men who are like that and you

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
take the men who are like that and you
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.610
take the men who are like that and you
say okay what do you want you can have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
say okay what do you want you can have
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.990
say okay what do you want you can have
what you want but you have to figure out

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
what you want but you have to figure out
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880
what you want but you have to figure out
what it is so then they write down what

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
what it is so then they write down what
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.530
what it is so then they write down what
they want they think oh hey well that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
they want they think oh hey well that
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.090
they want they think oh hey well that
might be worth having so maybe I'll put

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
might be worth having so maybe I'll put
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.980
might be worth having so maybe I'll put
some effort into it that's what it looks

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990
some effort into it that's what it looks
 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.990
some effort into it that's what it looks
like to me now you know that's weak

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
like to me now you know that's weak
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.020
like to me now you know that's weak
evidence and this is a weak argument but

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
evidence and this is a weak argument but
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.400
evidence and this is a weak argument but
I'm trying to stretch out my

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
I'm trying to stretch out my
 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.080
I'm trying to stretch out my
understanding to account for this but

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
understanding to account for this but
 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.070
understanding to account for this but
I'll tell you something else that's

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080
I'll tell you something else that's
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.780
I'll tell you something else that's
really weird I don't understand this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
really weird I don't understand this
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.229
really weird I don't understand this
either so more than 90% of the people

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239
either so more than 90% of the people
 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.030
either so more than 90% of the people
who watch my videos on YouTube are men

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
who watch my videos on YouTube are men
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.240
who watch my videos on YouTube are men
now that's weird because not about 80%

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
now that's weird because not about 80%
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.460
now that's weird because not about 80%
of psychology students are women so that

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
of psychology students are women so that
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.590
of psychology students are women so that
is not what you would expect right you'd

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
is not what you would expect right you'd
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600
is not what you would expect right you'd
expect that the majority of them would

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610
expect that the majority of them would
 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.009
expect that the majority of them would
be women and you might say well it's

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
be women and you might say well it's
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.330
be women and you might say well it's
because of the political stance I've

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340
because of the political stance I've
 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920
because of the political stance I've
taken and I thought well that's possible

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
taken and I thought well that's possible
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960
taken and I thought well that's possible
so I went looked at the demographic data

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
so I went looked at the demographic data
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.210
so I went looked at the demographic data
because I have that well before I did

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
because I have that well before I did
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.160
because I have that well before I did
any of the political videos eighty-five

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
any of the political videos eighty-five
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.530
any of the political videos eighty-five
percent of my viewers were men so it's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
percent of my viewers were men so it's
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.180
percent of my viewers were men so it's
actually increased a bit it's increased

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190
actually increased a bit it's increased
 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.270
actually increased a bit it's increased
by six percent and that's not trivial

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
by six percent and that's not trivial
 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.509
by six percent and that's not trivial
but it was still overwhelmingly men so

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
but it was still overwhelmingly men so
 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.009
but it was still overwhelmingly men so
that was interesting I thought what the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
that was interesting I thought what the
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.479
that was interesting I thought what the
hell why is that exactly

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489
hell why is that exactly
 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.670
hell why is that exactly
and then now I've been watching crowds

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
and then now I've been watching crowds
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.160
and then now I've been watching crowds
when I've been talking to them and the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
when I've been talking to them and the
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.630
when I've been talking to them and the
crowds that have come to see me in

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640
crowds that have come to see me in
 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.460
crowds that have come to see me in
person this happened at the University

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
person this happened at the University
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.470
person this happened at the University
of Toronto free speech debate and I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
of Toronto free speech debate and I
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.360
of Toronto free speech debate and I
actually noticed it and commented on it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370
actually noticed it and commented on it
 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.979
actually noticed it and commented on it
before the debate took place because I

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
before the debate took place because I
 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.509
before the debate took place because I
was talking about intrinsic differences

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519
was talking about intrinsic differences
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.039
was talking about intrinsic differences
between men and women and I looked

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
between men and women and I looked
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.360
between men and women and I looked
around the room and I thought hmm

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
around the room and I thought hmm
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.430
around the room and I thought hmm
hey 80% of the people in this room are

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440
hey 80% of the people in this room are
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.680
hey 80% of the people in this room are
men so I had all the men stat wintermen

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690
men so I had all the men stat wintermen
 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.379
men so I had all the men stat wintermen
women stand

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389
women stand
 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.760
women stand
and then all the men stand up they said

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
and then all the men stand up they said
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.189
and then all the men stand up they said
look like here's a natural experiment

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199
look like here's a natural experiment
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.320
look like here's a natural experiment
for some reason 80% of the people who

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330
for some reason 80% of the people who
 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.059
for some reason 80% of the people who
showed up to this or men now everybody

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069
showed up to this or men now everybody
 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.830
showed up to this or men now everybody
thought I was kind of cracked to to do

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840
thought I was kind of cracked to to do
 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.409
thought I was kind of cracked to to do
that and it was a risk you know and and

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419
that and it was a risk you know and and
 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.999
that and it was a risk you know and and
I but I thought no there's something

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009
I but I thought no there's something
 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.980
I but I thought no there's something
going on here and then what's

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
going on here and then what's
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.170
going on here and then what's
interesting now is that every public

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
interesting now is that every public
 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.269
interesting now is that every public
appearance that I've made that's related

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279
appearance that I've made that's related
 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.350
appearance that I've made that's related
to the sort of topics that we're

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360
to the sort of topics that we're
 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.080
to the sort of topics that we're
discussing is overwhelmingly men it's

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090
discussing is overwhelmingly men it's
 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.790
discussing is overwhelmingly men it's
like it's like eighty-five to ninety

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800
like it's like eighty-five to ninety
 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800
like it's like eighty-five to ninety
percent and so I thought wow that's

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810
percent and so I thought wow that's
 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.420
percent and so I thought wow that's
weird like what the hell's going on here

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430
weird like what the hell's going on here
 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.369
weird like what the hell's going on here
exactly and then the other thing I've

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379
exactly and then the other thing I've
 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.040
exactly and then the other thing I've
noticed is that I've been talking a lot

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050
noticed is that I've been talking a lot
 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.659
noticed is that I've been talking a lot
to the crowds that I've been talking to

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669
to the crowds that I've been talking to
 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.830
to the crowds that I've been talking to
not about rights but about

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840
not about rights but about
 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.019
not about rights but about
responsibility right because he can't

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029
responsibility right because he can't
 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.580
responsibility right because he can't
have the bloody converse what are you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590
have the bloody converse what are you
 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.809
have the bloody converse what are you
doing you can't have the conversation

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819
doing you can't have the conversation
 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.360
doing you can't have the conversation
about rights without the conversation

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370
about rights without the conversation
 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.550
about rights without the conversation
about responsibility because your rights

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560
about responsibility because your rights
 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.399
about responsibility because your rights
are my responsibility that's what they

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409
are my responsibility that's what they
 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.309
are my responsibility that's what they
are technically so you just can't have

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319
are technically so you just can't have
 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.350
are technically so you just can't have
only half of that discussion and we're

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360
only half of that discussion and we're
 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.909
only half of that discussion and we're
only having half that discussion the

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919
only having half that discussion the
 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.740
only having half that discussion the
question is well what the hell are you

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750
question is well what the hell are you
 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.469
question is well what the hell are you
leaving out if you only have that half

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479
leaving out if you only have that half
 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.659
leaving out if you only have that half
of the discussion and the answer is what

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669
of the discussion and the answer is what
 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.339
of the discussion and the answer is what
you're leaving out responsibility and

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349
you're leaving out responsibility and
 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.079
you're leaving out responsibility and
then the question is what are you

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089
then the question is what are you
 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.070
then the question is what are you
leaving out if you're leaving out

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
leaving out if you're leaving out
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.829
leaving out if you're leaving out
responsibility an answer might be well

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839
responsibility an answer might be well
 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.029
responsibility an answer might be well
maybe you're leaving out the meaning of

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039
