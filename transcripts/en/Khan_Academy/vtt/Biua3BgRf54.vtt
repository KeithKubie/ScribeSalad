00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.818
- [Voiceover] Let's say I'm
person A here in my ship

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:05.882
traveling through the universe
at a constant velocity,

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.091
so that is person A right over there.

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.333
Let me write it a little bit bigger.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:13.406
Person A.

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:17.478
And let's say that I
have a friend, Person B,

00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:19.183
and they are in another ship.

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:21.878
And in my frame of reference,
so this is Person B,

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:25.438
in my frame of reference,
they are traveling,

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:28.094
so their velocity vector looks like this,

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.854
they are traveling at 8/10
of the speed of light,

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:35.247
0.8 c.

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:36.456
And so once again this is all given

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:39.929
in A's frame of reference
and my frame of reference.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.013
Now the question I have for you is

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:45.606
surely there must be some third party,

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:50.575
let's call them C for convenience.

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:52.569
Surely there must be some third party

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.165
or some third party frame of reference

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:56.696
that we could imagine it
might be someone in some ship,

00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:00.214
where their velocity in
my frame of reference

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:03.696
is in between being
stationary and traveling

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.472
0.8 times the velocity of light.

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:09.613
And even more, from
their frame of reference,

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:13.289
A and B should be leaving
or going outward from them

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.097
at the same velocity.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.615
So what am I talking about?

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:19.203
So, this is...

00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:21.486
we're gonna call,

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:22.876
I'll just call this
the frame of reference.

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:25.979
So this first row is
A's frame of reference

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.758
that we just described.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:31.212
And C is going to be going
with some velocity, V,

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.761
away from A.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.739
So some velocity, V, we
haven't figured it out yet.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.111
Now let's think about
C's frame of reference.

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:44.065
So frame of reference C, so
C and C's frame of reference

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.231
is just going to be stationary,

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:50.039
and we want to figure
out a V so that A and B

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.263
are moving away from C
at the same velocity.

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:59.114
So in this frame of
reference, A will look like,

00:01:59.114 --> 00:02:02.778
A will look like it's moving to the left

00:02:02.778 --> 00:02:05.151
with a velocity of negative,

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.702
here it's magnitude is the same,

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.171
but just in the other direction.

00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:12.723
And B will also be moving
away with velocity V.

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:17.187
So B, right over here, is
going to be moving away

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.275
with velocity V.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:20.952
So this is a really interesting question.

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:23.684
Can we figure out what V is going to be?

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:25.736
If we were dealing with
the Galilean world,

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:28.134
you might say well V is
just going to be half way

00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:29.652
in between these two things.

00:02:29.652 --> 00:02:31.383
If we were just on the
highway in the Galilean

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:35.423
or Newtonian world, and B
is going 80 miles per hour,

00:02:35.423 --> 00:02:38.604
and A is stationary, well
then if C goes half way,

00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:41.802
if C is going 40 miles per hour,
then from C's point of view

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.585
it looks like A is going
backwards at 40 miles per hour,

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:47.569
and it'll look like B is going
forward at 40 miles per hour.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.981
But we know by now that we don't deal,

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.257
we aren't living in a
Newtonian or Galilean universe,

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:57.351
we're living in one defined
by special relativity.

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.568
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:02.883
and figure out what this in
between frame of reference,

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:06.278
what it's velocity needs
to be relative to A.

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:09.016
And I'll give you a hint,
it's going to involve

00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:12.338
the Einstein Velocity Addition Formula.

00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:13.769
So let's work through this together.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.082
So I'm just gonna write down

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:17.657
the Einstein Velocity Addition Formula.

00:03:17.657 --> 00:03:20.863
So it tells us that the change

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:24.465
in x prime

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:27.730
with respect to t prime is equal to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.969
u minus v

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.238
over one minus uv

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.422
over c squared.

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:37.482
Now let's think about
how we might apply it.

00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:39.606
And the trick here is
to really think about it

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:43.180
from C's frame of reference,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.461
it's to think about it from
C's frame of reference.

00:03:46.461 --> 00:03:49.521
So if you think about it
from C's frame of reference,

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:54.062
you could say, you could
say that v right over there,

00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:56.005
let me put this in a different color,

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.967
you could say that v is the velocity

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:03.022
that A is moving away from C at,

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:07.989
so velocity A

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.463
moving...

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:13.324
from C.

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:17.293
And then you could say that u

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:19.863
is the velocity that B is moving from C.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:23.343
Remember, we're dealing
in C's frame of reference.

00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:25.108
So velocity...

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:30.011
velocity that B moving...

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.594
from...

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:36.772
from C, actually let me
make everything upper case.

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:38.831
This should be upper case A,

00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:40.873
and this should be upper case C.

00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:45.536
And in that case, what is delta
x prime over delta t prime?

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:49.572
Well, that would be the
velocity that B is moving

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:52.026
away from A in A's frame of reference.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:53.300
I know that this can get
a little bit confusing,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.565
but I really want you to pause it,

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:57.854
watch it in slow mo, really
think about what we're doing.

00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:01.509
I'm kind of starting now,
I know I started this video

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.108
in A's frame of reference,
and this is really

00:05:03.108 --> 00:05:05.764
the trick of the problem
is I'm now shifting

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.477
over to C's frame of reference.

00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:11.238
I'm like, okay, V is the
velocity A is moving away from C,

00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:15.408
B is the velocity, or u is the
velocity B is moving from C,

00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:17.797
and in that case we can view delta x prime

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:21.520
over delta t prime as the
velocity that B is moving

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.956
away from A in A's frame of reference.

00:05:24.956 --> 00:05:27.422
So B moving...

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.325
moving from A

00:05:31.325 --> 00:05:32.878
in A's frame of reference.

00:05:32.878 --> 00:05:37.046
So in A's reference.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.049
And both of these are in C's reference.

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:41.601
So let me write that down.

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:45.776
In C's reference,

00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:48.489
in C's

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:52.438
in C's reference.

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:53.596
I really want you to think about this,

00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:56.145
this is a little confusing,
but hopefully this helps you

00:05:56.145 --> 00:05:59.090
appreciate how this Einstein
Addition, Velocity Addition

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.599
can be valuable.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.394
Well now, we can substitute what we know.

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:07.875
We know the velocity B
is moving away from A,

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.740
it is 0.8 c.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.091
So we can write, we can write

00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.174
0.8 c

00:06:17.174 --> 00:06:19.626
is going to be equal to,

00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:23.635
is going to be equal to u,
the velocity B is moving

00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:26.184
from C in C's frame of reference.

00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:28.110
Well we say that this
is just going to be B,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.867
that's going to be a positive v.

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:33.267
So that right over there is
going to be a positive v.

00:06:34.357 --> 00:06:36.488
Let me do that in,

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:38.001
let me do that in the same color.

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.598
It's going to be a positive v.

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:43.749
And then from that, we are
going to subtract the velocity A

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.230
is moving from C in
C's frame of reference.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.906
So A is moving from C with
the velocity negative v.

00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:53.302
I know it's kind of
confusing to replace a v

00:06:53.302 --> 00:06:55.922
with a negative v, but this
is a generalized formula,

00:06:55.922 --> 00:06:57.275
while this is the actually value

00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:59.037
that we're using in this case.

00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:02.871
So minus negative V all of that over

00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:06.791
all of that over one minus,

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:11.736
all of that over one
minus the velocity of u

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:14.018
times the velocity of v, well,

00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:17.039
or that's just going to
be, that's going to be v

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.677
times negative v or negative v squared.

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:24.007
So I'll just write that
as negative v squared

00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:26.048
over c squared.

00:07:26.048 --> 00:07:27.436
And just like that we have set it up

00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:28.913
so we can solve for v.

00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:31.662
And the key realization
is is that we said,

00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:34.285
"Okay, there must be some spaceship C

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:36.169
"that defines a frame of reference

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.432
"where A and B are moving away from it

00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:41.846
"with velocities of equal magnitude."

00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:43.359
And so we use that information

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:45.406
to go into C's frame of reference

00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:48.279
and use the Einstein
Velocity Addition Formula.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:51.385
But instead of knowing what,

00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:53.678
instead of knowing what these are,

00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:55.300
and then solving for this,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.066
we know what this is, and we're assuming

00:07:57.066 --> 00:07:58.908
that these two have the same magnitude,

00:07:58.908 --> 00:08:01.524
and we're able to solve for v.

00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:03.530
And so let's do that right now.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.166
In fact, I will do that in the next video,

00:08:05.166 --> 00:08:06.270
so that we will have enough time.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.664
And I encourage you to solve for v

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:10.586
on your own before you
watch the next video.
