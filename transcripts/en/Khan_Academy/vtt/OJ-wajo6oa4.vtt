00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.660
We've got 9,601 minus 8,023.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.420
And immediately when we try to
start subtracting in our ones

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.490
place, we have a problem.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.290
This 3 is larger than this 1.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.290
And we also have that
problem in the tens place.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.079
This 2 is larger than this 0.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.250
So we're going to have to
do some type of borrowing

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.152
or regrouping.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.860
And so the way I like
to think about it--

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.610
I like to go to the
first place value that

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.640
has something to give.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.182
Obviously, the tens
place is in no position

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:27.640
to give anything
to the ones place.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.112
It needs things itself.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.070
And so we're going to go
to the hundreds place.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.690
And the hundreds place
has an abundance of value

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
that it can regroup into
the tens and ones place.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.270
This 6 right over
here represents 600.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.940
So why don't we take
100 from that 600--

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.220
so then this will become
500-- and then give that 100

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.550
over to the tens place.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.040
Now, if we give 100 to
the tens place, how would

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.050
I represent that
in the tens place?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.480
Well, I have zero 10's.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.380
And now I'm going to give 100.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.390
100 is the same
thing as 10 10's.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
It's going to be 0 plus 100.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.980
100 in the tens
place is just 10.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.720
So let me write it this way.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.269
So this right over here is now
going to be rewritten as 10.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.060
Now, you might be
saying, wait, wait, wait.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.500
What's going on here, Sal?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.650
You took 100 from
the hundreds place.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.410
That's why it became 500.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.520
Now, why did this
become 10 and not 100?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.050
Now remember, this is 10 10's.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.740
So this is still
representing 100.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.430
You have not changed the
value of this top number.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.730
Before, the value was
9,000 plus 600 plus 1.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.210
Now it's 9,000 plus 500 plus
100-- 10 10's is 100-- plus 1.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.380
I have not changed
the value here.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.812
Now, we're still not done yet.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.770
We don't want to just
subtract because we still

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.311
have the problem
with the ones place.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.560
The ones place still
doesn't have enough value.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.120
Now, the good thing is we've
given some value to the tens

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.670
place.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.610
So why don't we take
10 from the tens place?

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.490
So if you have 10 10's,
and you take one 10 away,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.190
you're going to be left
with nine 10's, or 90.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.320
And then we can take that 10
and give it to the ones place

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.350
So let's do that.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.190
You take that 10 we
just took from there,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.640
and you give it
to the ones place.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.050
You now have 11 here.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.670
And now we are
ready to subtract.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.820
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.140
9 minus 2-- and this is
really 90 minus 20-- is 70.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.810
But in the tens place,
we represent that as a 7.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.530
500 minus zero hundred is
500, represented as a 5

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.530
in the hundreds place.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.370
9,000 minus 8,000 is 1,000.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.540
And we're done.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.100
And just to make
things really clear,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.520
I'm going to redo
this problem now

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.370
but with things expanded out.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:06.590
So this first number is 9,000
plus 600 plus zero 10's plus 1.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.220
And this number right here,
we're subtracting 8,000.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.795
We're subtracting zero 100's.

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:16.650
We're subtracting two
10's, which is 20.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.345
Subtracting 20.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.440
And subtracting three 1's.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.370
So I have just rewritten
this exact same statement.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.970
But the regrouping
and the borrowing

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.970
is going to become a
little bit clearer now.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.660
So the same exact
thing-- we said, hey,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.900
we can't subtract the 3 from
the 1 or the 20 from the 0.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.810
But we have a lot of value
right over here in the 600.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.260
So why don't we
take 100 from that?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.340
So this becomes 500.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.310
And we give that 100
to the tens place.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.830
So this becomes 100.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.015
Notice, the value
has not changed.

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:56.310
This is 9,000 plus
500 plus 100 plus 1.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.300
That's the same thing as
9,000 plus 600 plus 1.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.620
We've just put the value
in different places.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.130
And here we have
explicitly written 100.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.770
But when we represent it
in the tens place, 10 10's

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.750
is the same thing as 100.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.020
Now, we aren't done
regrouping just yet.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.440
We want to give some
value to the ones place.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.620
So we can take 10 from the tens
place-- and this becomes a 90--

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.420
and give that 10
to the ones place.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.350
10 plus 1 is 11.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.890
So notice, I did
the exact borrowing,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.000
the exact regrouping,
that I did here.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.980
I just represented it
a little bit different.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.290
This 500 was represented by
a 5 in the hundreds place.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.510
This 90 was represented
by a 9 in the tens place.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.570
But either way, we're
ready to subtract now.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.906
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:45.168
90 minus 20 is 70.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.390
Write a plus there.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.350
500 minus 0 is 500.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.210
And then 9,000 minus
8,000 is 1,000.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.550
And we got the same
result because 1,000

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.525
plus 500 plus 70
plus 8 is 1,578.
