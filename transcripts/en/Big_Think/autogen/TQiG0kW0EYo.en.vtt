the illusions that we talked about have
 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.730
the illusions that we talked about have
one main thing in common most of them

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740
one main thing in common most of them
 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.730
one main thing in common most of them
are over estimations of our cognitive

an underappreciated hiren limits on our
 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.480
an underappreciated hiren limits on our
cognitive abilities we don't appreciate

cognitive abilities we don't appreciate

cognitive abilities we don't appreciate
the limits on how much we can pay

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930
the limits on how much we can pay
 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.240
the limits on how much we can pay
attention to it once and therefore we

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250
attention to it once and therefore we
 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.650
attention to it once and therefore we
think we can multitask better than we

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660
think we can multitask better than we
 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.080

can we don't appreciate the limits what

can we don't appreciate the limits what

can we don't appreciate the limits what
we actually store in memory and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170
we actually store in memory and
 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.390
we actually store in memory and
therefore we think our memories are more

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400
therefore we think our memories are more
 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.730
therefore we think our memories are more
accurate than they are how do we solve

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740
accurate than they are how do we solve

this problem well one would be raising

this problem well one would be raising
 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.970
this problem well one would be raising
those limits or taking them away

those limits or taking them away

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.459
accurately and retrieve them more
accurately and so on that might be

limitations why do we write things down

enable us to do things like that better
so technological solutions may help us

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080
so technological solutions may help us
 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.899
so technological solutions may help us
to increase some of those limits but

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
to increase some of those limits but
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.550
to increase some of those limits but
