WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.420
It's one thing if we don't know a person or the background.

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:05.570
But when you know a person,
when there's a Laura Loomer,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.860
a Milo Yiannopoulos and it's a public case and then you,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
you get this feeling that the say no cause we decide and this is it.
Well Joe,

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.830
don't worry because no matter what Twitter does,

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.370
they're going to be defended by the New York digital,
you know,

7
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.420
journalist elites who will misrepresent what's going on in an effort to obvious

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.520
gate or sometimes outright lie about what's going on.

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
And this brings me to learn to code.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So learn to code.

10
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.840
So I asked you about this the other day that people are getting banned for learn

11
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:40.170
to code.
I'm like,
what the fuck is that?
Like what is that?

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.090
So when coal miners were getting laid off a bunch of articles and merge saying

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.270
teaching miners to code,
can we teach miners how to code?

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810
And they were showing videos about it.
I don't believe it was,

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.730
it wasn't intended to be a derogatory or insulting,

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
but to a lot of people that came off as this bourgeois,
let them eat cake.
Oh,

17
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.580
your career has been destroyed.
You're,
you're,

18
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.200
you're a 50 year old man with a family.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.080
Go to Silicon Valley into something you've never even thought about.
Right.
Let's,

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.130
so it came off as to a lot of people as just elitist,
right?

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.580
So when these journalists are getting laid off,
this meme spreads,

22
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.450
I don't know exactly where it started,
um,

23
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.680
where they'd say learn to code to the journalists.
Well,

24
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.250
this is an interesting thing happens.
John Levine,

25
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.510
I think his name from the Rep tweets,
someone from Twitter told me,
you will,

26
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.310
you can,
you can be banned for tweeting.

27
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.160
Learn to code at a laid off journalists conservative.

28
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.870
Start tweeting it far and wide.
Like,
here we go.

29
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.760
This is a reporter from the rep was confirmed this.

30
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.940
All of a sudden then other journalists can come out and say,
this is a lie.

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.680
This is not true.
This is fake news.

32
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.040
Conservatives are spreading fake news again and they say,
we have a new,

33
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.500
a new statement from Twitter that said,
we're only in banning.

34
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.290
We're only banning people who are engaging in a harassment campaign.

35
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.880
Now I've got a few problems.

36
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.410
Is tweeting a meme at somebody's critical of them a harassment campaign?

37
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.490
Is that a meme it,
yeah,
right.
It's like it condensed as an idea and,
right.

38
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.150
So here's the thing.
I got sent a bunch of screenshots,
screenshots from people.

39
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.150
Now people can fake screenshots.
I understand that some,
but,

40
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.410
but I checked some people's Twitter accounts.

41
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.750
I saw that they were tweeting this and I believe for the most part,

42
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.840
this is what happened.
Someone tweeted something to a buzzfeed journalists,

43
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.170
you know,
oh,
you guys believed x,
y,
and Z.
Yeah,
whatever.

44
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:17.700
Hashtag learned to code criticizing them suspension.
So then these,

45
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.070
these journalists come out and say,
this is not true.

46
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.230
It's just people engaging in harassment campaign.
So I said,

47
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:25.320
look at this guy's account.
He's got one tweet that says learn to code.

48
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.250
Is that him harassing somebody?
And they said,
oh,
but you're taken out of context.

49
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.320
Then John Levine from the rep says,

50
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.350
update Twitter spokesperson who was my source is now saying clarifying it is

51
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.470
about the harassment campaign.

52
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.320
And then another journalist comes out and says he his quotes fake Twitter's deny

53
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:45.030
ever saying it.
But here's the thing,
the editor in chief of the daily caller,

54
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:49.110
just a couple of I think a couple of days ago took a tweet from the daily show

55
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.440
and and it was,

56
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.940
it was a a from the state of the Union and he tweeted learn to code and quote

57
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.050
tweeted a video suspended.
So it's very clearly not about a harassment campaign,

58
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:02.170
but why then we're all of these journalists so ready to jump up and defend

59
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.950
Twitter when Twitter,
you know what I said?
Okay.

60
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.680
If Twitter is claiming they're banning people who are engaging in harassment

61
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.220
campaign you,

62
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.040
you mean they've confirmed their banning people for tweeting learn to code.

63
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.630
They just consider it harassment.

64
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.280
How is it that learned to code is harassment but Kathy Griffin sang to all of

65
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.300
our millions of fans.

66
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.780
I want these kids names several times or another verified account.

67
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:24.250
I'm not going to name cause not as famous.

68
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.640
Literally calling for the death of these kids and instructing people to kill

69
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.610
them is not a Beneful offense.
It's not harassment campaigns.
That's true.
Uh,

70
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.630
I don't want to,
I don't want to mention the guy's name,
but yes,
absolutely.

71
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.180
He said something to the effect of put them in a school,

72
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.820
lock it and burn it down.
And when you see them fire on them,

73
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.060
this guy is still active on Twitter.
They're,
you know,
you know,

74
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:47.770
right now there are anti,
so now we can,
there's,
there's so much of your dude.

75
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.640
Yeah,
we've got the proud boys.
All of them purged from Twitter.
Okay.

76
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.510
Say whatever you want about the proud boys.
If they deserve to be banned,
fine.

77
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.720
Why wasn't Antifa Bend?
A lot of people respond to me and say,

78
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:01.660
but Tim Antifa is random people who wear masks.
You don't know.
That's not true.

79
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
There are branded sells of Antifa that have their own merchandise.
Still active.

80
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.070
Some of these groups have published the private information of law enforcement

81
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.120
officers.
Still active.
No action taken against them.
So,

82
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.550
you know,
I,
I don't,
so this,
this indicates a heavy left wing bias.

83
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.380
I wouldn't necessarily say left wing,

84
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.900
I would say intersectional identity,

85
00:04:23.901 --> 00:04:27.520
Marian Ideological bias,
right?
It's,
it's,
it's,

86
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.790
it's hard to pinpoint what the tribes are in the culture war,

87
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.920
but Twitter is clearly acting in defense of intersectional activism.
Now,

88
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.700
do you think that this is a mandate?
Do you think this is written somewhere?

89
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.790
Do you think there is people who are in the company that have power,

90
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:47.560
that are acting independently?
It's,
it's uh,
grains of sand to make a heap,
right?

91
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.680
You're in,
you're in silicon valley,
you're in a very blue area.

92
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.670
The people who get hired tend to hold certain views and because they all live in

93
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.430
their own bubble,
they believe they're the majority and bus,

94
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.940
they think they're acting justly to ban those who are at odds with them.

95
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.740
And the social engineering,
and this brings back into journalism,
the big problem,

96
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.080
it's,
you know,
for decades,

97
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.130
I don't know how long journalism has been dominated by self identified liberals.

98
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.480
There's a ton of polls.

99
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:17.440
I think it was a 2015 poll showing republicans are like 7% of journalists or

100
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:20.260
some ridiculously small number.
And is it really simple reason for it?

101
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.680
News organizations are headquartered in big cities,
the big ones,
you know,

102
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.240
see and even Fox News in New York.

103
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.970
So there's a lot of people who work at Fox News.
We're actually liberal.

104
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.250
People don't seem to know that you live in New York,

105
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.930
you're probably not a staunch conservative.
So what happens then?
News breaks.

106
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.640
You've got all these journalists,
cause I've worked with them.

107
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.640
You know I worked for vice,
I worked for fusion and they sit around at tables,

108
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:43.630
they meet up after work from different offices and they talk about things and

109
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.130
they all tell each other the exact same thing.

110
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.260
And so this is why you see Covington happen.

111
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.430
These people follow each other on Twitter.
So when someone tweets this,

112
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.530
a kid got in the face of Nathan Phillips,

113
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.620
they only see each other's tweets and they just write it.

114
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.830
They don't do any journalism.
And it goes,
it,
man,
I can't believe for days.

115
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.310
And then it was even in the New York Times,
correct?
Yeah.
Yep.
No,

116
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.510
The New York Times,
uh,
Harris talked about that yet.

117
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.720
And it's mind blowing to me because the second video that came out from

118
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.530
Covington,

119
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.320
you literally watch Nathan Phillips Walk into up to the kid and get his face

120
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.140
Bill Maher.
You know,
what,
four or five days later it says,

121
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.930
the kid got in his face and I'm like,
how are you?
Yeah.
You know,

122
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.770
shame on Bill Maher for,
for,
for saying that it's not true,

123
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.910
but at the same time we have a serious journalism problem and this links back to

124
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.911
Twitter and that story in particular release almost like condensed all of the

125
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.330
problems into one yet yet.
And what's,
what's,

126
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.300
what's fascinating is following the story,
an op Ed,

127
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:42.770
I believe it was in New York Times said stop tweeting arts had never tweet Brian

128
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.603
Stelter from CNN.

129
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.050
Then got a statement that I always say I believe because I don't have the

130
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:48.740
sources pulled up,

131
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.950
but someone from Twitter said journalists are the lifeblood of our platform.

132
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.360
And so that's why I think you've got these predominantly New York based

133
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.540
progressive writers.
They're fresh out of college.
They get hired for,
you know,

134
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.250
moderate salaries to work in a newsroom,
sit around each other all day,

135
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.800
sharing the same ideas,
not exploring anything outside their bubble.

136
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.190
And Twitter supports them because they're the ones who drive traffic to Twitter.

137
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.660
They keep the conversation going.

138
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.140
And I think that's where Twitter's bias partly comes from the other,

139
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.960
is that clearly you're in San Francisco,
you're going to have,
you know,
your,

140
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:20.450
your staff,
the people who are,
who are,
you know,

141
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:24.350
running content curation and banning people.
They lean left.

142
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.560
So why,
why?
Uh,

143
