interesting research study scientists

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
interesting research study scientists
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210
interesting research study scientists
looked at the link between emotions and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
looked at the link between emotions and
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520
looked at the link between emotions and
breath they looked in particular at

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
breath they looked in particular at
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.710
breath they looked in particular at
whether emotions will change your

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
whether emotions will change your
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450
whether emotions will change your
breathing pattern so they had

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
breathing pattern so they had
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520
breathing pattern so they had
participants come in and they told them

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
participants come in and they told them
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740
participants come in and they told them
to elicit these emotions within

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
to elicit these emotions within
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330
to elicit these emotions within
themselves and the scientists then

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
themselves and the scientists then
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069
themselves and the scientists then
measured how the participants were

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
measured how the participants were
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.620
measured how the participants were
breathing how deeply how long etc and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
breathing how deeply how long etc and
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.149
breathing how deeply how long etc and
what they found was that lo and behold

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
what they found was that lo and behold
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.300
what they found was that lo and behold
each of the emotions that was elicited

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
each of the emotions that was elicited
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.510
each of the emotions that was elicited
was linked to a different unique pattern

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
was linked to a different unique pattern
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.139
was linked to a different unique pattern
of breath

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
of breath
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.550

the more interesting part of the study

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
the more interesting part of the study
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499
the more interesting part of the study
was the second part of the study other

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
was the second part of the study other
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359
was the second part of the study other
participants were brought in and were

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
participants were brought in and were
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580
participants were brought in and were
simply given the breathing the breathing

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
simply given the breathing the breathing
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770
simply given the breathing the breathing
techniques that corresponded to the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
techniques that corresponded to the
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.839
techniques that corresponded to the
emotions witnessed in the first part of

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
emotions witnessed in the first part of
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.729
emotions witnessed in the first part of
the study and what they found was that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
the study and what they found was that
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559
the study and what they found was that
when they asked those participants how

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
when they asked those participants how
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760
when they asked those participants how
they felt the participant

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
they felt the participant
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560
they felt the participant
said that they felt the emotion that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
said that they felt the emotion that
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060
said that they felt the emotion that
corresponded to the breathing pattern

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
corresponded to the breathing pattern
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.030
corresponded to the breathing pattern
what this shows is that our breath can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
what this shows is that our breath can
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100
what this shows is that our breath can
significantly change the state of our

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
significantly change the state of our
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.080
significantly change the state of our
mind so usually if we're in a very

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090
mind so usually if we're in a very
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.840
mind so usually if we're in a very
high-stress moment it's very difficult

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850
high-stress moment it's very difficult
