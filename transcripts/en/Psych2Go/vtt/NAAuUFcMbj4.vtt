00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.540
Aristotle and Plato,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.560
our main Greek boys knew what they were talking about

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.320
when they thought about love. In fact

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.460
Canadian psychologist, John Allen Lee also

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.335
found their work meaningful, that he borrowed some of their greek terms

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.560
and invented the colour wheel theory of love.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.120
Vibrant and easy to follow, we will also be using

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.600
this tool throughout this video to help

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.345
to help you explore the many different types of love.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:28.495
Although times have changed since Aristotle and Plato

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.465
were alive, the world has evolved with dating apps

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.220
flirty emojis and romantic means

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.280
one thing hasn't; We all yearn for affection.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:40.295
Whether you're just getting into your first relationship, or you

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:43.395
prioritize self-love first and foremost,

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:46.705
here are the 8 types of love you will experience in this lifetime.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.275
1) Playful love; Ludus

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.195
Are you a 'no-strings-attached' sort of partner?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.040
Do others find you flirty and fun? Then

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.475
Ludus describes you perfectly. People

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.525
who experience playful love see it as one big

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:04.035
exciting game. Instead of committing fully to

00:01:04.035 --> 00:01:05.845
one person, their main objective

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:09.015
is to make things less complicated by having multiple partners

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:11.835
or being friends with benefits. On

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:14.335
the upside, this type of love keeps things burning

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:16.975
with excitement and childlike innocence.

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.345
But on the downside, people who

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.345
prefer playful love like to feel in control, so they

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:25.265
end up manipulating their partners, whether it means lying,

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.335
deceiving or exploiting their weak spots.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.395
Unfortunately, if you're a highly sensitive person,

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:34.225
then this type of love may not be for you.

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:36.835
Daniel Kim, from We The Kims channel,

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:39.715
dives deep into what a highly sensitive person is,

00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.975
and how they function differently.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:45.435
Be sure to check out his link in the description below after this video.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:49.095
2) Obsessive love; Mania

00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:51.865
Ah yes, there's nothing like being bitten

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:54.435
by the nasty old green bug, or

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:57.395
putting on a mad hat. People who experience Mania

00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:59.745
often suffer from low self esteem,

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.495
and want to feel complete. So they

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:05.465
often latch onto their partner, which usually creates a

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:08.405
codependent relationship. The good news however

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:11.405
is that one can always grow out of Mania,

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.735
and move onto a different type of love that's free from obsession.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.685
In order to repair a codependent relationship,

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:20.315
Dr Misty Hook says that it's important to

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.625
set boundaries and find happiness as and individual.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.705
Whether that means spending more time with family and friends,

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.135
broadening your networking circle,

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.035
or picking up a new hobby, these activities can all build

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:33.375
your independence.

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:37.155
3) Erotic love; Eros

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.175
Eros was the son of Aphrodite, the goddess

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.205
of love. This is when things get real steamy

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.785
and intense, like those R rated scenes your

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:48.765
parents stop you from watching. This type of relationship

00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:51.775
involves a strong physical and emotional connection,

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.485
where both partners exercise compassion.

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.805
Romantic and idealistic,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.840
Eros leaves people feeling high on love.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.560
It is also often the initial stage of an exclusive relationship.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.220
4) Enduring love; Pragma

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.275
Do you often feel like butterflies are overrated?

00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:13.285
Or just want something that's stable and lasting.

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:16.305
People who prefer enduring love have a practical

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.385
approach towards relationships. They choose convenience

00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:22.365
over romance and are more concerned about whether

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.200
a partner can bring common sense to the table.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.515
The individual also find their partner's level of education,

00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:31.585
religious beliefs, social status and financial

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.045
standing important.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.495
5) Friendship love; Philia

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:39.755
This type of love, along with the remainder, are not

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:42.545
in Lee's colour wheel theory of love,

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:45.985
but they are still important enough to the Greeks to be explored.

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.695
In fact, they consider it far superior than Eros

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:51.565
because it's a love that's equal.

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.045
It is commonly believed that if you have one good

00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:57.105
friend in life, then you're lucky. Philia

00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:00.065
is the platonic love we have for others whom we are

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:03.005
not physically attracted to. This type of love

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:05.945
thrives on components of loyalty, openness

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.555
and a true sense of understanding one another.

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:12.675
6) Familial love; Storge

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:14.115
Storge is a Greek

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:17.135
term that means natural affection or family love.

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:20.345
This type of love is the first you experience throughout your

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:23.725
life. It forms between parents and their children.

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:26.665
Some of us are blessed with wonderful childhoods,

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:29.485
and we can rely on our parents again and again for

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:32.505
guidance. But those of us who grew up in a toxic household

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.765
may find it difficult to achieve familial love.

00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:39.595
7) Self-love; Philautia

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.360
this type of love shares the Buddhist philosophy

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.360
of self-compassion.

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:47.280
In order to reach Philautia, one must exercise self

00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:49.525
understanding, until they gain the strength

00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:51.855
to love themselves. It is only

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.155
until we accept who we are that we can love others.

00:04:55.155 --> 00:04:57.675
But, true self-love isn't just

00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:00.135
experience at certain moments. It must be

00:05:00.135 --> 00:05:03.255
unconditional love you have for yourself.

00:05:03.255 --> 00:05:06.115
If you've been in an abusive household or relationship,

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:09.075
self-love will seem like a foreign concept.

00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:12.015
Some helpful tips that are to practice include:

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:15.125
Asking yourself what you need, allowing yourself to feel

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.215
your emotions instead of tuning them out,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.220
and meditating.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.540
8) Selfless love; Agape

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.555
Lat but not least, we have Agape.

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:28.665
This is the highest form of love we will ever experience.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:31.675
Agape is what Buddhists refer to as universal

00:05:31.675 --> 00:05:34.665
kindness. When we exercise selfless love,

00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:37.645
we are capable in forgiving and seeing the good in others.

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:40.505
You can have Agape for strangers,

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:43.385
religious figures or nature. In this

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.265
type of love, you learn to be altruistic

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:49.635
and giving, helping those in great need of support.

00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:52.775

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:55.365
