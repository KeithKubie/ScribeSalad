00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.630
If a cockroach walked by you right now…
would you step on it?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:11.170
If so I get it but you should know cockroaches
are cooler than you might think.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.890
Hey guys What’s up I’m Sapna here at DNews.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.000
Today we’re answering a question that came
from our subreddit page r/dnews-- The user

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.480
“semihc” wants to know if cockroaches
have any benefit to nature?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.980
Well yes they do, Semi!

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.730
Despite their bad reputation most roaches
play an important role in the natural world….and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.050
we humans may even be able to learn a thing
or two from these resilient creepy creatures.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.050
I know it’s tough to see cockroaches as
anything BUT AWFUL and no matter what we do

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.319
to try and get rid of them, they often outsmart
us.

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:46.340
For example, cockroaches eat pretty much anything-
your leftover steak, the soap scum in your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.170
bathtub - even the glue on an envelope.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930
Which is actually pretty incredible.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.200
Roach poison takes advantage of that, and
tastes sweet to the little buggers, they eat

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
it and die.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.120
But, according to a recent study in the journal
Science, some cockroaches EVOLVED new body

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.219
chemistry so the poison no longer tastes good,
thus no snack and no death.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.869
Most people think of cockroaches as household
pests, but there are actually about 4500 different

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.890
species of cockroach around the world, and
less than 1% of them are the freaky ones that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.670
scatter when we turn on the lights.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.480
Those in our homes are often covered in bacteria
and fecal matter- it sticks to them, they

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.009
ingest it and defecate everywhere.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.960
And proteins in their feces, saliva, and eggs
are one of THE BIGGEST causes of allergies

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.420
and asthma for people living in urban environments.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
Yuck.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.270
And maybe that’s more than you wanted to
know about cockroach feces…

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.000
Beyond the cities where we live though, it
gets better!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.290
Cockroach poop is actually beneficial to the
environment!

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.970
It plays a role in the earth’s nitrogen
cycle.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.399
Forest roaches consume decaying organic matter
and release its nitrogen back into the soil

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.780
through their feces… so it can be used again
by plants.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
Most cockroaches -99.7% of them- live far
away from people….

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.749
Mostly in wooded areas .. and they actually
do some good in the world.

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:05.999
In some environments, they serve as pollinators
for flowers.

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:10.460
And by consuming the decaying vegetation-
the microbes inside their gut break down plant

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.110
materials that are often indigestible by most
mammals which is why some experts call cockroaches

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.450
nature's janitors or decomposers.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.370
Now, roaches are also an important source
of FOOD for some species- like centipedes,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.670
lizards and birds.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.500
And at least one species of wasp couldn't
live WITHOUT the cockroach.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.050
I think this is really cool!

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.460
The parasitic emerald wasp stings a cockroach
and injects venom into a specific part of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.110
its brain which blocks voluntary movement.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.190
The wasp then leads this zombie roach back
to its burrow, lays an egg on it, and when

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.270
that egg hatches- the larva eats the roach
from the inside out and emerges as a mature

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.820
wasp . I know it’s kind of disgusting but
isn’t that awesome?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.770
Cockroaches can help humans too, by the way.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.060
Because they survive in the filthiest of conditions,
their central nervous system produces natural

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.170
antibiotics.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.790
We've found that their natural defenses work
even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.310
like staph aureas, also known as MRSA.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.860
And scientists at Harvard's Biorobotics Laboratory
are studying the LEGS of cockroaches, too.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.210
Cockroach legs are not only springy and flexible-but
they also work together seamlessly so the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.510
insect can run at really fast speeds on uneven
ground.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.960
By copying these evolutionary advantages,
scientists hope to design new prosthetics

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.720
and mechanical hands!

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.970
So there you go Semihc.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.550
We love your question and yes cockroaches
really do play an important role in our ecosystem.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.250
And….get this- engineers are actually turning
roaches into robots….

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:53.160
You can see how and why in this video

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.640
So what do you think about cockroaches now?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.680
