00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We need to hide that pattern, and the way to do that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is going to require encrypting the outputs in some way.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have to encrypt them with different keys, though.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we encrypted them all with the same key, then either the evaluator would be able to

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
determine all the outputs because the evaluator knows that key

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or she couldn't determine any of them because she does not know that key.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We need to encrypt each output with different keys such that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
when someone evaluates the truth table they can only decrypt the output

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that corresponds to the row for the actual values they have.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The question is which of these values could be used for this entry in the truth table

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to ensure that a circuit evaluator who knows a1 and b0 would be able to decrypt this output

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and none of the other outputs.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Here are the choices. Be careful that more than one of these could be correct.
