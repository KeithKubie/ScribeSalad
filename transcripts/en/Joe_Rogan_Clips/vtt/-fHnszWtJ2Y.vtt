1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.110
I've been with the same guy.

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:04.290
Henry Hoof just came down at that time and roof was a striking coach.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.700
I met with him since,
you know,
it's a phenomenal coach too.
Amazing coach,

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.600
a good striking coach.
So there's those Dutch fundamentals,

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.830
meaning he has got it down.
Yeah.
And a lot of,
you know,
there's,

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.560
I've seen a lot of different coaches,
different styles.
I don't know.
You know,

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.970
I like,
I like a lot of different things.
But the thing with Henry,
he's,
he's,

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.010
he's very basic because at the end of the day when you're fucking tired and you

9
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.850
can't even hold your arms up and do certain things,

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:37.670
you're just going to do basic regular shit.
Oh,
Jab one,

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
two.
That's what you're going to do.
Now he's in and he simple,
stupid.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.680
He's very like that.
It keeps it simple.

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.210
And that was the way for me to learn it is just from the,
from the bottom up.

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.350
I just,
I learned it not,
I don't get it wrong,
Joe.
I can do some of that caution.

15
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.730
Like in practice I'll do a cartwheel kicks,
I'll do the,
all that cool shit.

16
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:57.900
I can do shit.
Yeah.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.850
That reverse Lukey front sight side taekwondo do I can,

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.440
I can try it.

19
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.120
Do you think ever about like moments in fights?

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.130
There are moments in fights were a fighter will do something.
Bet.

21
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.340
The best example is Chris Weidman versus Luke Rockhold.

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.730
Chris Weidman tries this wheel kick out of nowhere and he misses with it.

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.270
Luke gets a hold of them,

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.000
dragged him to the ground and beats the shit out of him and it was a real,

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.460
Luke has a nasty top came.
Absolutely.
His top came.
It's crushing and he just,

26
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
he just ruthless ground and pound and it changed the course of Chris's career in

27
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.500
a lot of ways.
That beating when all,

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.320
I mean he lost the title and then he lost other fights afterwards.

29
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.320
But before that he was dominating.
He'd beaten Anderson twice.

30
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:50.210
He had crushed v tour.
He was a different thing and that it just,

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.360
there's these moments,

32
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.420
these pivotal moments in fights when someone just try something,

33
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.220
I mean most of the time you just get away with it.

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.560
But sometimes like in that is my go to when I tell people don't try some shit.

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.450
That's not your thing.

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.130
This is the best example Chris Weidman throwing that we'll kick against Luke

37
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.670
Rockhold yet you gotta.
Um,

38
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.710
and that's part of everything that's grouped in with fight Iq.

39
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.450
You have to be able to assess risk reward and certain things like that.

40
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.650
And that's kind of,
at some point it was a knock on me.
It's like,
oh,

41
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.150
this guy never gets out of position.

42
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.470
He never does any other cool sharing or any of that,
you know,

43
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:32.010
it's kind of who's giving you that knock.
Fucking people come to me right now,

44
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.700
Joe.
I listened to him all the time.
Yeah.

45
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:39.120
Like I was saying a long time ago,
it was like this guy's not fucking up.
Yeah.

46
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.090
Like he keeps running through guys and he's beaten guys like a world champion

47
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.230
already.
Yeah.
A lot of people always Kinda,
you know,
like,
Oh,

48
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.410
you didn't do all this.
He's not doing all that.
But the thing with me is,

49
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.610
is being able to assess when,
when I can do that,
when I can't do that.

50
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.890
Like when I fought Rda,
I threw a freaking ax kick in the fifth round.
You know,
I,

51
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.230
and I was,
I that in practice,
I,

52
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:05.231
I catch guys with it all the time and it's just being able to assess you and you

53
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.450
already have warm.
Yeah.
I knew that there was,
you know,

54
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.380
it's just an opportunity for me to start letting go.
And so I started letting go.

55
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.880
And I don't mean RDA is a tough,
tough dude.
Very tough.

56
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.370
Tough dude.
He's a tweener rod head.
He seems like he's a tweener to me.

57
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.280
Like he's not quite a one 70 I mean,
he could beat a lot of guys.

58
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.390
I won 70 but it's almost like you should be like one 60 or one seven five but

59
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.440
one 55 is too hard of a cut for them these days.
Yeah.
But that's,
that's just,

60
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.800
that's the nature.
Yeah.
Because if we,
if we started saying,
okay,

61
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.530
well we're going to accommodate everybody.
It's never going to stop.

62
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.100
Do you think there should be more weight classes,
but you don't care?

63
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.380
I don't care.
I mean,
70 works for you.
