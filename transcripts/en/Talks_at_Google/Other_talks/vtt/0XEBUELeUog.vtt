PETER BARRON: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.890
it's a reassuringly
full house.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.720
For the latest of our Learning
From Leaders sessions, we're

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.310
delighted to welcome
Gavin Esler.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.770
BBC presenter, correspondent
of many years, former

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.850
colleague of mine at Newsnight
for several years.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.340
And we're absolutely delighted
to have you with us.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.810
Gavin is here to talk about
his latest book.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.200
He's written several books
over the years.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.570
It's a terrifyingly
large workload of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.410
novels and factual output.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.830
But he's written a handful of
novels, which are highly

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.230
recommended.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.060
They're actually really good.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.750
His latest is "Lessons From
the Top," which is stories

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.585
about leadership and how you
great leaders become great and

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.130
stay great by telling stories.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.880
And actually, it's an extremely
engaging read,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.110
'cause it's mainly gossip and
anecdotes about the many

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.040
people that he's interviewed
over the years.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.300
So Gavin's going to talk for
20 to 30 minutes, and then

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900
we'll be happy to take questions
from the floor and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.950
the various offices.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.300
Gavin?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.725
GAVIN ESLER: Thank you.

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:17.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.440
Thanks very much.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.870
It's really good to be here.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.950
It's so nice to see
so many people.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.090
And despite what you've read
in some of the newspapers,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.300
this is not a greater number
of people than the average

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.160
Newsnight audience.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.980
We're doing very well,
thank you very much.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.210
And thanks to Peter for that
kind introduction.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.280
I am always incredibly nervous
about introductions, ever

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.200
since-- and you'll see this
partly reflects in the book--

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.150
introducing Alastair Campbell
at an event a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.480
couple of years ago.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.430
And he said to me, how are you
going to introduce me?

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.910
And I said, I'm going to
introduce you as Tony Blair's

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.100
former press spokesman.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.190
He said, oh, that's all right.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.700
He then went on stage and he
said, it's a big improvement

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.620
from the introduction I got last
week in Leeds, when I was

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.070
introduced as, please welcome
Alastair Campbell, the most

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.160
evil man in Britain.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.380
So I'm very careful about the
frame in which things go.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.920
And at least because I've known
Peter for many years, he

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.990
knows who I am.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.960
I was on a plane recently,
coming back from the Far East.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.665
And one of the stewards came up
to me and said, Oh, I'm a

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:17.290
great admirer of your work.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.030
Would you like some champagne?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.320
Thank you very much.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.310
Have a drink of champagne.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.570
And during the course of the
next 20 minutes, he told me

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.950
what a great bloke I was, how
fantastic my reporting was,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.680
how he'd watched everything that
I'd done, and was really

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.010
just one of my best
fans and admirers.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460
He slightly spoiled it at the
end, when he said, I've got to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.780
attend to other passengers.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.370
But what's your next assignment,
Mr. Alagiah?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.480
Anyway, I'm here to talk about
that leaders and leadership,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.510
which is something which really
engages me, actually.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.880
What makes an effective
leader?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.870
And there are all kinds of
qualities that leaders have.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.815
They have to be persistent.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:00.080
They have to be creative.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840
They have to, quite often,
be idealistic.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.350
They can also be
quite annoying.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.740
But if you don't have any
followers, by definition,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.950
you're not a leader.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.570
And you don't get followers
if you don't

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.300
communicate with people.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.020
And I became very interested in
how leaders do communicate

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.150
with different audiences.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.800
It's obviously different
culturally, different in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.100
different countries, it's
different in business from

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.850
perhaps in the military.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.100
But there are similarities.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.070
And what really sparked off this
book was the 2010 general

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.440
election campaign here.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.310
I was doing quite a few
interviews for Newsnight.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.960
And one night when I was off, I
switched on another channel,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.210
and there was Alastair Darling,
the chancellor of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.470
exchequer, during the worst
economic crisis of my

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.120
lifetime, facing Piers Morgan.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.150
And Piers Morgan said to him,
so tell me, chancellor, are

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.345
you good in bed?

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:56.220
And I realized, at that point,
this was where my career had

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.770
gone completely wrong.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.836
Because I'd never thought
of that question.

00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.480
And I thought it was
very strange.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.100
Anyway, Alistair Darling
batted it away.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.470
But during that election
campaign-- you may remember--

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.640
or that period, Nick Clegg was
asked how many lovers he had.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.450
David Cameron was asked, have
you ever committed adultery?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.570
And how did you get your
wife pregnant?

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.649
Pretty much the way most people
get pregnant, I think

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.579
was the answer.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.000
Again, he kind of
batted it away.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.437
But I thought, would Mrs.
Thatcher have been asked any

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:30.080
of these questions?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.570
Or Churchill, or de Gaulle,
or even John F. Kennedy?

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.560
Looking backwards, would anybody
have been asked these

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.990
questions 30 years ago?

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.220
What had changed in
our media culture?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.640
What had changed in our
political culture, and in our

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.250
popular culture, that made these
questions seem, to some

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.260
people, the sort of questions
that you would ask on

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.135
television of the people trying
to run this country?

00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:56.700
And I became--

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.040
I started to go backwards and
think about all the leaders

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.940
I'd met over the past 25, 30
years, and think, what do they

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.580
have in common?

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.010
What stories did they tell, and
how useful could that be

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.790
to the rest of us, both in terms
of the stories we tell,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.580
and also seeing through some of
the constructions that they

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.030
put on their own
personal story?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.280
So just to back up a minute--
we are all--

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.620
you are all--

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.930
storytellers.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.050
You told a story to
get a job here.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.320
It might have been in your CV.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.390
It might have been in
your interview.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.840
But you did tell a story.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.640
You tell a story when you go
out on a date, frankly.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.540
You tell a story when
you ask for a loan.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.160
You go into a bank and
say, I've got this

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.650
great business idea.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.070
Oh yeah?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.970
Who are you?

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.790
Basically, that's what the bank
manager wants to know.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.600
It seems to me that there are
three basic stories that all

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.706
leaders tell.

00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:50.220
Who am I?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.950
Who are we as a group?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.450
And what is our common
purpose?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.080
Or where is my leadership
going to take you?

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.170
I'm less interested in the third
part of that, where's

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.350
our my leadership going
to take you?

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.840
Because if the leader doesn't
solidify the first two-- who

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.831
am I, and who are we?-- you're
not going to listen to where

00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.000
they want to take you anyway.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.520
So let me give you
a few examples.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.610
Mrs. Thatcher, seems to me, had
one of the best "who am

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.770
I?" stories of anybody, when
she said, I'm just the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.020
grocer's daughter
from Grantham.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.110
So those six words, which she
used repeatedly and her people

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.320
used repeatedly to try
to sum her up.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.010
Grocer's daughter, not son, so
different from the past.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.595
From Grantham, not part of
the metropolitan elite.

00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:34.380
And a grocer's daughter.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.050
Now each part of that
was true, but did it

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.130
entirely sum her up?

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.885
I mean, did anybody think she
was serving behind the counter

00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:42.730
a little, for example?

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.660
I don't think so.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.870
So she told a story in a
particular way which really

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.830
stuck and really helped her.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.820
Bill Clinton, the first
time I met him, did

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.640
something very similar.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.050
He said to me--

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.220
this was before he was running
for the presidency.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.200
He said, well, you know, I'm
just a boy from Hope.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.610
Meaning the town of Hope,
Arkansas, where he grew up.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.550
It was a few years later, after
I spent some time in

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.490
Arkansas, that I realized that
he kind of grew up there, but

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.143
he also grew up in Hot
Springs, which

00:07:10.143 --> 00:07:13.010
is a gambling town.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.350
Curiously, that was not the
story he chose to tell.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.510
I'm the boy from the
gambling town.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.360
I wonder why.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.990
I wonder why he chose Hope.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.660
And so even from the start,
you can see that

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.010
we all shape stories.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.290
You've shaped your CV.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.260
You shaped whatever it was that
you told people in the

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.690
interview for the job
that you've got now.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.130
Clinton shaped his story.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.710
It wasn't untrue, but it was
not the whole truth, of

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.320
course, about him.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.420
"Who are we" follows
on from that.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.730
Just to take care the example
of Ed Miliband and David

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.130
Cameron and the recent party
conferences, three or four

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.560
months ago.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.740
Ed Miliband told this
"who am I" story.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.620
I'm the son of Jewish
immigrants.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.860
I love this country because they
gave my parents a home

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.670
when all Europe was likely
to suffer the

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.450
tyranny of the Nazis.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.230
That's quite a compelling
"who am I" story.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.690
The "who are we" story--

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.950
well, I'm not old Labour.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.870
I'm not new Labour.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.620
I'm one nation Labour.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.530
The same--

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.500
in a different way, I suppose,
because it's a different

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.310
story-- but the same technique
is used by David Cameron.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.200
He's defined himself in various
ways personally.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.620
Talked recently about his father
and the struggles that

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.780
his father had.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.930
He talked, of course, about the
struggles he's had as a

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.870
father, and the loss of a child,
which is a terrible

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.950
part of his story.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.360
But it is something that we all
have in our minds when we

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.179
think about him.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:41.230
He also told a story about
being a compassionate

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.450
conservative.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.840
And that's one of the
interesting phrases that I

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.420
really love, in terms of
a "who are we" story.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.800
Because I first heard it in 2000
in Philadelphia at the

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.850
Republican Convention.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.940
And the person telling the
"I'm a compassionate

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.880
conservative" story was
George W. Bush.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.410
I'd never heard the
phrase before.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.050
I was standing with a long-time
friend who's a

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.150
Republican.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.340
I said, what is this
compassionate conservatism?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.370
And he looked at me and said,
it means anything we were in

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.815
the past that you don't like,
we're not that anymore.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:19.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.370
But anything in the past that
you do like, we're still that.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.580
That's also an interesting
technique that I haven't got

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.520
time to go into, but it's also
been used by Deng Xiaoping in

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.610
China, quite a similar
technique, when he said, after

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.030
Mao, and after being purged
a couple of times by the

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.920
Communist Party, when it was
likely that he was going to

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.280
assume the ultimate leadership
position, he defined himself

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.020
as practicing socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.640
Anything we were in the
past you didn't

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.080
like, we're not that.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.600
So some things do translate
from one society and one

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.080
culture to another, in terms of
the kind of techniques and

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.820
the kind of storytelling
techniques that leaders use.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.010
"Who are we" and storytelling
might not actually be words.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.580
I suspect that a hero of many
of you, as it is for me, is

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.590
Nelson Mandela, partly because
he gave up power.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.360
But his story is
extraordinary.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.130
His autobiography is
extraordinary.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.760
And there were a couple of
moments in it which show a

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.370
different way of telling
a story.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.190
When he was first arraigned
before an apartheid court, he

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.860
turned up wearing traditional
Xhosa dress.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.420
He didn't have to
say anything.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.010
I mean, you just look at him,
and the story is, here is an

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.053
African man in a white man's
court, and he's not going to

00:10:38.053 --> 00:10:38.820
get justice.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.790
That was his story.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.280
He didn't have to
open his mouth.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.085
And many years later, if any
of you are rugby fans, as I

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:47.370
am, you'll remember that in the
1990s, when South Africa

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.830
hosted the Rugby World Cup,
there was President Mandela

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.660
telling a very different story,
sitting in the stand

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.750
wearing a Springbok shirt.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.640
And again, if you're familiar
with the politics of South

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.560
Africa, the Springboks had been

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.820
associated with white supremacy.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.850
And he was saying, we're
different now.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.825
This is a different nation.

00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:06.690
Get used to it.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.925
We're the rainbow nation.

00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:10.580
So even in matters of dress--

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.400
and that's too many other
leaders, too.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.940
It was true of Jinnah, in
Pakistan, in a slightly

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.850
different way.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.150
Just the way you look can be a
way of telling a story about

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.810
who you are and who
we are as people.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.070
I've become interested in all
sorts of parts of this,

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.750
including counter-stories and
how leaders deal with

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.320
counter-stories.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.670
I mean Mrs. Thatcher, the
ultimate counter-story about

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.840
her was "Mrs. Thatcher, Milk
Snatcher." But the actual

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.740
counter-story, which worked to
her advantage, was when the

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.500
Soviet newspaper called her The
Iron Lady," thinking this

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.810
was a criticism.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.900
Can you imagine what it must
have been like in Downing

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.000
Street when they heard the
Russians had called Mrs.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.590
Thatcher the Iron Lady?

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.410
Thank you, Lord.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.220
Thank you.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.010
Thank you.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.030
And of course, she used
that to her advantage.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.650
Obama is an interesting
character in these terms,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.450
because he got his retaliation
in first.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.780
He wrote an autobiography many
years before he was running

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.610
for the presidency, in which he
revealed, for example, he'd

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.300
used drugs.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.190
So that issue, that part of
his "who am I" story, has

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.090
never come up.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.980
Nobody cares about it, because
he neutralized it before

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.590
anybody could dig it out
and reveal it to

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.480
the American people.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.720
But he has also run into
severe problems on

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.980
his "who am I" story.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.450
It's very interesting to me,
in the last election, that

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.210
while people can legitimately
criticize his health care

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.200
policies or what he's done on
the economy, a lot of the

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.790
criticism of Obama wasn't
"where's my leadership going

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.300
to take us," that third
part of the story.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.410
It was on the first part.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.010
Who are you?

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.540
You're not really an American.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.210
You're a Muslim.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.220
You're not a Christian.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.870
You weren't born in
the United States.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.490
I mean, those stories could have
been, particularly if you

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.590
were not born in the United
States, very, very

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.090
damaging for Obama.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.100
And difficult to handle,
actually.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.400
He handled it, I thought, rather
brilliantly when--

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.410
I don't know if you remember,
but he released his birth

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.670
certificate showing he'd
been born in Hawaii.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.560
So there was the facts
of the case.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.240
But he also appeared
at the White House

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.550
Correspondents' dinner.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.810
And Donald Trump, who was
possibly going to be a

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.990
Republican candidate and was one
of those in the so-called

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.190
birther movement--

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.870
who had questioned Obama's
right to the presidency

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.220
because he may not have
been born in America--

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.540
Trump was there.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.960
And Obama said, I have
released my birth

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.220
certificate this week.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.380
But tonight, I'm going to do
something that no American

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.750
president has ever
done before.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.560
I'm going to release
my birth video.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.810
Now this was a formal dinner,
and people had just eaten.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.755
You can imagine the reaction.

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:57.580
The lights went down.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.210
Up behind him on the screen
like this, there was the

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.930
opening sequence of Simba
being born in

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.110
"The Lion King." [LAUGHTER]

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.310
Now that's a kind of political
genius in storytelling, it

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.930
seems to me.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.860
Because he's saying, I don't
take this seriously.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.910
Of course he took
it seriously.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.800
But he's taking it seriously
by appearing

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.540
not to take it seriously.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.810
And we never heard of Donald
Trump again, at

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.130
least in that election.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.240
Very, very clever
moment for him.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.910
One of the things I also focus
on is what I call star

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.060
moments, something they
always remember.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.620
I've noticed that a lot of
leaders do something in a

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.400
discussion like this or when
they appear on television,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.960
when they're making a big
speech, something

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.760
that really gets you.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.510
And they do it when they
meet you, as well.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.310
I mean, I said Clinton said,
I'm just a boy from Hope.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.360
It's one of the things
he obviously

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.090
thought I should remember.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.990
The first case for me was in
Northern Ireland, when I was

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.020
scheduled to meet a paramilitary
leader that I

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.400
knew had blood on his hands.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.490
And I sat in a rather dingy
office in Belfast by myself,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.900
waiting for this fellow.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.270
And he walked in, and he
came straight up to me.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.400
He didn't say hello.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.210
He just said, I am speaking to
you as someone deeply involved

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.600
in violence.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.480
I didn't need to take
notes, actually.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.480
I got the point that
he was making.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.900
But it works in business,
as well.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.700
Bill Gates is a good example.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.460
When he was trying to raise
money for the campaign against

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.950
malaria and AIDS in Africa--
particularly

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.160
malaria, in this case--

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.560
he appeared before an audience
of potential donors with a

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.000
large jar filled with
mosquitoes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.740
And as he's talking, he starts
to unscrew the lid on the jar

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.540
of mosquitoes.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.790
And the punchline, as he gets
the top off is, so I don't see

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.490
why it should just be the poor
who have the opportunity to

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.750
get malaria.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.200
Guess what?

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.750
He got quite a lot of money from
the potential donors, and

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.010
they never forgot it, I
would suggest to you.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.760
One other technique that a lot
of leaders use in different

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.770
ways is what I call a violation
of expectations.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.400
You expect something
from somebody,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.650
and you get the opposite.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.720
Perhaps because they confront
the worst thing that you were

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.340
thinking about.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.540
It happened with Alastair
Campbell at that conference

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.810
that I was at, when the said
he'd been called the most evil

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.500
man in Britain.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.280
It's a very, very clever way
of making people laugh, and

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.450
also seeing that you understand
some of the things

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.390
that are going on in people's
minds about you.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.010
It also happened with a woman
I think is quite an

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.660
extraordinary leader, Michelle
Bachelet, who was the

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.860
president of Chile.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.140
The first woman president of
Chile, the first woman defense

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.750
minister of Chile.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.440
And when I met her a few years
ago, I asked her how difficult

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.860
it was for her to run a country
which has got a very

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.920
macho reputation, with a very
macho military, where her own

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.180
father had been murdered by
the military after the

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.380
Pinochet coup against
Allende in 1973.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.070
Her father was a socialist.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.815
He was a doctor, I think,
and a social democrat.

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.560
He was murdered.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.849
And she said, well, I thought
particularly being defense

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.500
minister would be very
difficult, because I would

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.170
have to be the boss of the
people who, if they were not

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.890
directly responsible for my
father's death, were part of

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.670
that political culture.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.670
So I said, how did
you handle it?

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.349
She said, well, I called in all
the admirals and generals

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:29.020
an senior air force officers,
sat them down, and said,

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.220
hello, I'm your new
defense minister.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.980
I'm a woman, a socialist, an
agnostic, and I'm divorced.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.920
All the sins together.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.390
But we'll work very well.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.630
I think that also is a kind
of political genius.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.670
Because she is saying to them
what was already in their

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.250
minds and confronting it, and
violating every expectation

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.390
that you wouldn't actually talk
about the nasty things

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.580
people think about you.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.880
I think that is a kind of real
leadership genius, because

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.290
you're facing the facts about
yourself, and you're

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.450
communicating that you get it.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.050
In her case, in quite
a witty way.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.490
And humor, of course,
is pretty important.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.420
I want to leave as much time
for questions as I can, but

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.860
just a couple more points.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.675
One is the words that you use,
or the words that leaders use,

00:18:16.675 --> 00:18:17.560
are quite important.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.500
I'll have to refer to a couple
of notes here, because I can

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.530
never remember this list.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.760
But years ago, when I was
based in Washington, the

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.880
Republicans and the
Democrats--

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.870
rather like now, actually, over
the budget-- they had a

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.940
terrible standoff in the 1990s,
and it led to the

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.050
shut-down of the US federal
government.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.070
Clinton was the president.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.250
Newt Gingrich was the Speaker
of the House of

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:39.970
Representatives.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.260
And they made pretty much,
actually, the same arguments

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.495
as John Boehner and Barack
Obama are making today.

00:18:46.495 --> 00:18:51.970
But Gingrich is quite an
extraordinary figure, in terms

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.960
of communication.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.310
Because a few years before
that, he circulated to

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.820
Republican candidates and
Republican activists a list of

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.110
words to use about yourself,
and a list of words to use

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.660
about your opponents.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.680
Here's the words to use about
yourself and your policies--

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.770
candid, care, challenge,
children, courage, debate,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:18.350
dream, family, hard work,
legacy, liberty.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.410
For your opponent,
he suggested--

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.060
bureaucracy, cheat, collapse,
corrupt, cynicism, decay,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.320
destroy, destructive,
failure, and so on.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.280
You can make up your own list.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.600
But this was a kind of
all-purpose toolkit.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.400
And it was used by
some candidates.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.170
And as you may well have
noticed, it is still being

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.470
used today by politicians
in this country and, in

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.010
translation, by lots of
other politicians.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.210
The thing that doesn't work,
and one of the reasons, I

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.500
think, why we're all somewhat
skeptical of

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.910
leaders in public life--

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.720
politicians in particular--

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.010
is that all-purpose toolkit
has no values.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.310
It doesn't actually tell you
what they're going to do.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.670
It just says, you're
Mr. Nasty.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.900
You're responsible for
corruption and decay.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.950
I'm Mr. Nice.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.770
I'm responsible for
dream and children

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.240
and family and liberty.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.590
And the bits in between
don't seem to matter.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.530
And I think we get--

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.770
I think the British people
certainly get-- the Newsnight

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.090
audience, believe me, really
do get-- that there's

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.770
something quite cynical
about this.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.600
And they dislike being
manipulated by a vocabulary,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.800
which is there to blow a whistle
and make you perform

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.090
certain tricks as a voter.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.150
Vote for me and not vote
for the other person.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.400
Just a final thought.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.300
I've talked quite a bit
about leaders that I

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.730
think most of us get.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.830
Most of understand why Mandela's
a great leader, or

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.490
why Mrs. Thatcher was a great
leader, even though she was

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.330
divisive here at home.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.875
Some leaders that we don't get
in this country also interest

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.830
me greatly.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.370
George W. Bush and Ronald
Reagan are two American

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.320
leaders that are have been
routinely caricatured in the

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.380
British press, in a way that I
think is unfair to British

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.800
leaders and British voters.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.700
Because roughly 50% or
more of the American

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.120
people voted for them.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.720
We have to understand that.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.880
What is their attraction?

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.110
And so simply caricaturing them
as cowboys, or in George

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.030
W. Bush's case, someone who's
misunderestimated, who can't

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.907
speak English, it's a bit of
fun, but it's rather silly.

00:21:20.907 --> 00:21:24.650
It doesn't get to the point of
America, why the most powerful

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.270
country in the world produces
leaders that we just don't

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.450
understand.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.440
And part of the reason they
connect with their own voters

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.450
is their great storytelling
skills.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.070
And when I say that sometimes
to British

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.220
audiences, they go, what?

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.370
George Bush, great storytelling
skills?

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.610
Absolutely.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.630
If you look at the way he
presented himself down on the

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.250
farm in Crawford, Texas--

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.580
dusty old jeans, open-neck
shirt, pickup truck,

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.510
raking up the brush.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.970
He says in his autobiography
about his background, he says

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.850
pretty much the same kind of
story that most American

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.020
political leaders tell.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.880
We were honest people, family
was important to us.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.720
We didn't have to lock the doors
at night, because we

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.650
were a decent neighborhood.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.100
He was the son of the President

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.780
of the United States.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.660
It was a good story.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.060
A great story, actually.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.160
And a very attractive story
to people who thought,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.950
he's just like us.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.480
OK, so he doesn't do the
fantastic grammar.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:25.760
Fine.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.130
I understand him.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.850
He's the sort of guy I'd like
to have at my barbecue.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.430
That is a story which really
connects to people.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.030
Ronald Reagan is the other
one who, I think, was

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.960
misunderestimated here, for
the power with which his

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.760
stories connected to people.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.690
And I'll tell you a couple of
Reagan stories, then leave it

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.270
and take some questions.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.850
Michael Deaver, who was--

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.007
I think he was deputy
or assistant White

00:22:53.007 --> 00:22:55.030
House Chief of Staff--

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.600
told me he was actually
responsible for

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.470
making Reagan look good.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.400
And so for example, if Reagan
was going to make an

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.640
announcement about
the environment--

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.290
let's put it this way.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.600
He wouldn't fit into
the Green Party--

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.820
Deaver would stick him in a
canyon in the western United

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.060
States with an open-neck
shirt and a horse.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.410
And whatever he said, it
would look fantastic.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.570
This is somebody who cares
about our environment.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.260
It's wonderful.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.820
Because pictures are really
important, too.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.560
Deaver told me a story about the
kind of charm that worked

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.340
with his own staff.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.810
He told me that there was one
night when there was a

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.710
terrible political crisis,
foreign policy crisis, and

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.850
questions about whether troops
should be deployed, were

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.890
Americans under attack?

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.105
What should happen?

00:23:41.105 --> 00:23:44.720
Now Reagan himself had a
fairly relaxed of work.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.320
So you didn't work through
the night personally.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.570
But his key staff did
work through the

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.450
night in the Oval Office.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.460
He breezed in the following
morning at 9 o'clock, very

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.005
cheery, good-humored as
usual, with his dog.

00:23:57.005 --> 00:24:00.530
Which ran round and round and
round his desk, really

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.190
irritating these guys who'd been
up all night, plotting

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.530
how to defend the United
States of America.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.190
And one of them finally said,
one day, Mr. President, that

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.550
dog's going to piss
on your desk.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.440
And Reagan said, well,
everyone else does.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.380
And another story which
connected to a friend of mine,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.780
who is a journalist, when he was
a very young journalist in

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.270
the Middle East, he came back
through Washington and was

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.030
going to his head office in New
York when he was called

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.510
into the White House to talk
about the situation as he saw

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.960
it, in the region
that he was in.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.790
My friend--

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.920
not much older--

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.460
has got a magnificent beard.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.910
And he had a magnificent
beard then.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.450
Reagan asked him a few questions
and then said, so,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.250
what's next for you?

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.280
And he said, well, I'm going
to New York to meet my

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.380
editor-in-chief.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.212
But before I do, I'm going to
have to shave my beard off.

00:24:50.212 --> 00:24:53.130
And Reagan said, why are you
going to shave your beard off?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.840
He said, well, the
editor-in-chief thinks beards

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.440
are scruffy and nonprofessional,
so

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.670
I'm going to do it.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.630
So that's what he did.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.790
Went to New York, and then
went back to Beirut.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.840
A couple of weeks later, his
editor-in-chief called him up.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.906
What the hell did you say
to President Reagan?

00:25:08.906 --> 00:25:10.840
He said, well, how
do you mean?

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.880
He said, well, because I had
a breakfast with him with a

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.930
number of newspaper editors
this morning, and I was

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:16.920
berating him for his

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.640
ultraconservative, illiberal policies.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.620
And he said to me, I might
be ultraconservative and

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.530
illiberal, but I'd let
a guy wear a beard.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.100
Now my friend was not a great
Reagan supporter, but he

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.760
really liked the guy.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.700
He absolutely liked
and respected him.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.900
It connected with him.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.960
That was a story.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.450
It was nothing to do with the
policies, which he, in his

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.930
journalism, found to
be the subject of

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.450
real, invalid criticism.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.930
It was to do with the person.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.140
So that's important.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.740
Storytelling's important.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.310
You can learn how to do it.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.060
You can learn how other
people do it.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.070
And you can begin to see
some of the constructs.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:01.180
Because these stories are not
fully formed, like rocks of

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.380
gold in the river.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.600
They are something that people
make in order to entertain or

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.855
attract you and make you think
they'd make a good leader.

00:26:08.855 --> 00:26:10.221
Thanks very much.

00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:15.402
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:15.402 --> 00:26:16.652
PETER BARRON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.340
Now we've got half an
hour for questions.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.624
Prepare your questions.

00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:25.874
Microphone's [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:31.248 --> 00:26:34.212
I'm deeply interested
in when [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.362
about that.

00:26:38.362 --> 00:26:40.170
Perhaps also about Dan Quayle?

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.210
GAVIN ESLER: Oh, Dan Quayle.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:47.930
Yes, well Dan Quayle was known
as being not the sharpest tool

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.750
in the toolkit when he
was Vice President

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.550
of the United States.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.750
One of the things that you must
do, it seems to me, is

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.270
recognize your own failures and
not dig yourself in deeper

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.260
into a hole.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.930
So if you're a Dan Quayle, and
you're with a 10-year-old or

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.690
12-year-old, and there's a board
behind you, and you get

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.100
him to spell potato--

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.350
P-O-T-A-T-O is what the
12-year-old put--

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.710
don't put an E at the end of it,
as Dan Quayle did, because

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.360
you dig yourself even
deeper in a hole.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.030
And it meant that stories about
him abounded, even ones

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.050
that probably weren't true.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.400
He went on a tour of
Latin America.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.070
And he was quoted in some places
as saying, aw, gee,

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.500
these are such great countries
down here.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.280
I wish I hadn't given up
studying Latin in school.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.160
I don't think he ever said that,
but it sounded as if he

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.150
could've said it.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.240
So there are real potential
for catastrophes.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.670
One which doesn't appear in the
book is one about the BBC

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.010
recently, which has not told
its story very well.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.770
And I think people have
got to own up to that.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.920
I think the people at the top of
the BBC now absolutely get

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.920
it, that there were mistakes,
there were quite serious

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.440
mistakes, and you have
got to confront them.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.610
And you've got to show people
that you confront them.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.330
And this wasn't done
with the greatest

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.530
competence, it seems to me.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.090
And that's one of the reasons
why people lose jobs.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.970
Another good example, which
is in the book,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.472
is BP and Tony Hayward.

00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:13.240
I talked to a lot of people
about the Gulf oil spill, a

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.990
lot of people in the oil
industry, and they were all of

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:22.640
the view, actually, that the
catastrophic killing of 11

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.700
people, the Gulf oil spill, the
environmental catastrophe

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.280
and so on, was terrible.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.520
But after it happened, in
technical terms, BP did what

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.230
any other oil company
would have done.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.110
They tried to get it right,
and they tried to fix it.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.770
But their storytelling--

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.490
particularly Tony Hayward's
storytelling--

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.390
was appalling, and is used by--
again, I quote in the

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.870
book, a CEO of another big
company that I didn't even

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.600
want to name--

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.620
they use it as a test case for
how not to handle a disaster.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.920
Because every company--

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.220
the BBC is one--

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.190
will have big problems.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.310
You always have big problems.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:03.100
But the way to get round those
problems, or convince people

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.220
that you can get round them,
is to be honest, to confess

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.770
the truth, to face up to
it, and to say you've

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.610
got a handle on it.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:10.940
And also, it seems to me--

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.270
it's a lesson I didn't have
time to go into, Peter--

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.900
but one of the things that's
interesting is if you say, I

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:22.910
got this wrong, I suspect that
people will respect you.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.790
Because they think if you got it
wrong and it's your fault,

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.800
you may have the capacity
to put it right.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.290
Whereas if you say,
it was his fault--

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.880
which politicians have
a tendency to do.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.850
It's all the Europeans, or the
Chinese, or it's the other

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.835
people, people who were
in office before me--

00:29:37.835 --> 00:29:39.930
which they will do.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.640
I suspect that many of us lose
respect for them, because

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.610
they're not taking control and
taking charge, in a way that

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:49.090
most well-run businesses
do take charge.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.552
AUDIENCE: Before anybody else.

00:29:55.552 --> 00:29:56.910
PETER BARRON: You may not
get away with that.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:57.440
OK.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.790
Questions or thoughts?

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.030
AUDIENCE: While they're doing
that, Gavin, if I can be rude

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.150
and ask a question--

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.390
as you enter your seventh decade
next month, can you

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.260
tell us about your daily
beauty routine?

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.270
GAVIN ESLER: Well, I was asked
what beauty products I

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.960
recommended, and I couldn't
think of any.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.930
And then I thought,
actually, water.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:18.520
I shower.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.555
GAVIN ESLER: I brush
my teeth in it.

00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:22.600
And I drink it.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.117
Can't recommend it to highly.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.080
AUDIENCE: What advice would you
give to Lance Armstrong,

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.550
who he's been telling a story
to [INAUDIBLE] next week?

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.780
GAVIN ESLER: Yeah, well, I mean,
not to start from here,

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.837
is one obvious place.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.430
Tell the truth.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.380
Just tell the truth, you know?

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.970
And if you tell the truth, you
have the opportunity to shape

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.810
the truth in the way
that you want.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.770
Because as I suggested to you
right at the start of this

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.820
conversation, in a CV,
you don't tell

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.100
everything about yourself.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.920
You may be asked what your
weaknesses are, but you're not

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.390
going to parade them.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.730
So it seems to me, if Lance
Armstrong wants people to take

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.010
him seriously, he's got to tell
us what he did, why he

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.020
did it, and explain it.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.070
And I think, actually, my
sense is that people--

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.150
not in this case,
I don't know.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.930
But people are pretty
forgiving.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.550
We forgive people for making
mistakes if they own up to it.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.400
The question of Barack Obama
using marijuana and cocaine is

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.760
a non-issue because
he admitted it.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.050
He said it was stupid.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.880
Not only that, in his
autobiography, he says, I

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.170
could have gone down
that route.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.470
That is a road that I could
have taken, but I didn't.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.575
I stopped.

00:31:31.575 --> 00:31:35.060
And I think most of us
get that, because

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:35.760
we understand it.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.090
It was true of Clinton, as well,
when he talked about the

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.870
trouble in his marriage
at various points.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.220
And when he did that right at
the start, or just before he

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.185
became president, that
helped him through

00:31:48.185 --> 00:31:49.510
the Lewinsky affair.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.310
So when you do something really
stupid, you have to

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.130
tell the truth.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.900
The fact that Clinton lied at
the start of that didn't get

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.930
him off in the end.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.700
What got him off in the end
was the American people

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.520
listened to the truth, and they
were pretty forgiving,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.300
even though they thought he
did something stupid.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.370
So in the case of Lance
Armstrong, I would suggest a

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.745
similar kind of thing.

00:32:08.745 --> 00:32:12.250
I actually have a chapter in
the book which I call the

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:19.140
Angelina Jolie Method, which
is about how she confronted

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.490
the fact that people thought
she was a bit

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.590
of a Hollywood airhead.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.170
Learned about Cambodia, learned
about landmines,

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.760
learned about what happens.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.850
Became a UN Special Ambassador
or Special Envoy, whatever it

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.880
is, and does good work by
traveling around the world to

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.400
places like the Syrian border.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.140
She's been in West Africa, she's
been in Darfur, and so

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.130
on, places that you wouldn't
go as a tourist.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.000
Now she'll still get the
nonsense in the popular press.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.480
But I think people do give her
credit for doing some good.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.870
So you can tell stories and
reinvent yourself if you

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.566
confront what people are
actually saying about you.

00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:02.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.360
GAVIN ESLER: I think I'm going
to have to write another book

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.270
about that.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.660
But to do it briefly, do would
you remember, right at the

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.520
start of this conversation,
I talked about the kind of

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.260
questions that were being asked
about Alastair Darling

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:34.790
and others?

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.350
Now I know none of them went
into politics to be asked

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.800
questions about, are
you good in bed?

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.280
None of them when into
politics for

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.370
that kind of scrutiny.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.590
I argue in the book, but it's a
quite complicated argument--

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:53.430
I argue that in the past 30
years, our media culture has

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.480
changed significantly because
of developments in--

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.330
there's a lot more of it.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.080
There's Google and
other things.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.270
So everything is available all
the time, almost everywhere.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.270
24-hour television.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.520
Confessional TV--

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.239
Oprah Winfrey and the same
kind of shows here.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.855
I actually have great respect
for Oprah Winfrey, but there's

00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:15.080
others I don't have much respect
for, including some of

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.940
the programs here, where people
are expected to parade

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.440
stories about their
private lives.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:21.850
The "Hello!

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:23.190
Magazine" factor.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.380
"Hello!

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.010
Magazine" was actually invented
in Fascist Spain at

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:32.370
the end of World War II, as
"Hola!" But the idea behind

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.460
it, which is you get to know a
little bit of the real life of

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.210
a celebrity in exchange for
they give a bit of their

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.679
privacy, has invaded all
our media, everywhere.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.750
And "Hola!" or "Hello!"
is everywhere, too.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.550
It's in more than 90
countries now.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.610
Now you take all these
things together--

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:53.330
if you're in politics, you
look at, is it easier to

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.100
appear on TV and talk about your
family, your children,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.620
your past life, who you are,
what a nice fellow you are?

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.400
The fact that--

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.310
Michelle Obama keeps talking
about how Barack Obama doesn't

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.620
pick up his own socks
in the White House.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.720
Is it easier to do that than to
tell us how you're going to

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.640
fix the economy?

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.860
I think it is.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.810
And I think anybody who looks
at the kind of scrutiny--

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.970
I don't mean, are you fiddling
your expenses?

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.490
That's all completely
legitimate.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.470
But if you look at the other
kind of scrutiny, or at least

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.380
stories that some aspects of
our media expect leaders to

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.010
tell, it's really off-putting
for talented people who are in

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.800
business, or who've got a life
doing something else.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.400
So it's a slightly
long answer.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.540
It seems to me that these are
very difficult times, and we

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.050
will dislike anybody leading
us at the moment anyway.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.480
That's part of it.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.030
But the question is whether
you respect them.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.530
Because I think in America,
even those who disliked

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.980
Reagan's leadership respected
him as a person.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.370
In this country, Margaret
Thatcher's leadership was very

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.770
divisive, but people tended to
respect her and take her at

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.910
her own value.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.700
When she said, I'm the Iron
Lady, or the Soviets called

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.790
her that, and she adopted
it, nobody really

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.390
questioned who she was.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.690
You disliked her policies,
perhaps, or you liked them.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.240
But you didn't question
who she was.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.800
Now it seems that people don't
do anything else before they

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.980
go into politics, very often.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.330
They become obsessed with the
process of politics, which

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.340
most of us are not
obsessed with.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.190
And the kinds of stories they
tell or we expect them to tell

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.830
are very odd, and
very different.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.050
David Cameron cycling to
work, for example.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.940
That's interesting, but he
obviously doesn't do that as

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.910
prime minister.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.220
And he was caught out with
his change of clothes

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:43.200
behind him in a car.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.110
Those kind of stories, we
understand that we're being

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.500
manipulated, even if we
don't really think

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.530
about it every day.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.030
Just to give you one final
example on that.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:57.250
Tony Blair, in his
autobiography, talks about his

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.930
preparation for an election.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.600
And he was hugely successful,
obviously.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.480
Three landslides.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.660
Most successful Labour
leader in history.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.615
You might have thought that
preparing for an election, he

00:37:07.615 --> 00:37:10.810
would figure out economic
policy, and what to do about

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.790
Iran, or whatever.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.460
But he's got a very eloquent
passage where he says, you

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.200
know, I was sat down by my
advisors and asked, how much

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.740
is a kilo of lamb?

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.500
How much is a tin
of baked beans?

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.170
What's a pint of beer?

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.470
If you buy bread, which bread
would you buy, and how much

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.940
would it cost?

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.770
A pint of milk?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.530
And those kind of questions.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.440
Nothing whatsoever to do with
why he was hired by the

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.230
British people to do a job.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.340
But he knew, or at least his
advisors knew, that if he

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.070
thought a tin of beans cost 20
pounds, or threepence, we

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.810
would think he was out
of touch with us.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.130
So it's partly our fault--

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.450
I mean, as voters.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.010
It's partly that the
media has changed.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.800
And it's partly that the people
who decide to go into

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.030
politics have to be slightly
different from the rest of us.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.950
Otherwise they wouldn't
put up with this.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.200
Hope that answers
your question.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:03.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, Gavin.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.766
Quick question around negative
campaigning.

00:38:06.766 --> 00:38:10.070
I watched the US election
coverage, and when Romney gave

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.060
the Obama camp that gift, they
were on TV the next day with

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.685
that, saying, he's not
the man for America.

00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:19.980
And I just wonder, why do you
think that's so pervasive in

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.460
the American elections, and
not so much over here?

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.720
And do you think that
really works?

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.420
This people trying to tell a
negative story about you?

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.150
Because I think in this room,
there's a lot of people out

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.960
there trying to say negative
stuff about Google a lot of

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.850
the time these days, and we have
to try and combat that.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.720
GAVIN ESLER: I think--

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.380
it's funny, actually.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.930
When you ask people, does
negative campaigning work?

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.000
They say, oh, no, we hate it.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.410
But it does work.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.510
That's why they do it.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:47.140
And there's much more of it in
America, because under the

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.460
First Amendment, they have the
right to freedom of speech.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.230
So you can say more.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.370
And they float on a sea
of money, as you know.

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.720
Their elections are incredibly
expensive.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.460
It doesn't work for everybody,
but it probably works for some

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.230
people, who haven't quite
made up their minds.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.750
And I think--

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.770
I think you're being
slightly too

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.270
generous to Britain, actually.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.830
I think we also have it here.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.140
I mean, some of it's
absolutely fair.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.500
It's absolutely fair for
conservative politicians to

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.270
attack Labour on their economic
record, or Labour to

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:22.420
say these welfare reforms are
going to hurt people, or

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:22.990
whatever it is.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.050
That's just the daily business
of politics.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.620
But there are some quite nasty
things that appear in

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.110
campaigns, and have appeared
in British campaigns.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.265
Perhaps slightly more subtly
than America, because we're a

00:39:34.265 --> 00:39:34.960
different audience.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.030
But it does happen here.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.370
One of the lessons that I draw--
and I use one of the

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:46.540
American parallels, which is
John Kerry being portrayed as

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.240
if he was some kind of coward
in the Vietnam War, when he

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.980
was a decorated soldier.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.740
And he was facing a candidate in
George W. Bush, who didn't

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.830
fight in Vietnam, who was in
Texas Air National Guard.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.510
Now both of those are perfectly
honorable positions.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.840
But it does seem to me to be
pretty incompetent of the

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.000
Kerry team to allow themselves
to be painted as if you war

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.020
record and your Purple Hearts
aren't worth anything.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.340
That was a huge mistake.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.400
And so one of the things I say
very strongly is if you don't

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.460
defend your reputation,
nobody else is going

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.650
to do it for you.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.690
AUDIENCE: Gavin, just
following on

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.590
from Ollie's question.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.530
And you mentioned almost a
change of perception over

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.780
generations or time.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.040
Leadership being almost an
extension of personality--

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.140
and a lot of the stories, you
said, were people effectively

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.930
projecting their personality or
challenging misperceptions

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.440
of their own, and the strength
of leadership being

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.890
a function of that.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:46.200
But we see political parties
or the political system

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.600
becoming more technocrat, and
more to your point, the story

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.200
with Tony, about being
effectively fed what was to be

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.070
his world view, in terms of
cost of a loaf of bread.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:41:00.167
And then in companies, we also
see heavily orchestrated story

00:41:00.167 --> 00:41:03.300
lines about brand
and position--

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.120
well, I guess you could say
Apple being another extreme

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.120
example where the two align.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.060
Is there a danger, or do you see
already, that leadership

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.420
decreases as those leaders are
unable to project themselves

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.110
away from what the position of
the party or company is?

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.110
GAVIN ESLER: Well,
I think that is a

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.130
really interesting question.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.500
I go into a little
bit in the book.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.480
But I mean, take Steve Jobs as
a good example that we're all

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.450
familiar with.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.570
I mean, if Steve Jobs were
here with us today and

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:32.230
presenting a new Apple
product, you

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.420
know how he'd be dressed.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.650
Just like you know what the band
KISS are going to look

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.750
like when they come on stage.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.080
You know what he
will look like.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.640
Even with Lady Gaga, you don't
know exactly what she's going

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.890
to look like, but you've
got an idea.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:49.320
And with Steve Jobs, he comes
in, open-neck shirt, none too

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.730
clean jeans, pair of trainers,
here it is.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:53.700
This is fantastic.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.410
I'm a cool kind of geek,
is the story.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.470
I'm not corporate--

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:58.470
while running one
of the biggest

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.250
corporations in the world.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:04.080
So that was obviously a great
strength for Apple.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.950
But it also a weakness, with
his passing, perhaps.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.080
Who knows?

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.670
It may take a long time.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.180
Richard Branson is another
good example.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.350
Everybody knows what Richard
Branson looks like.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.375
Everybody knows what
he looks like.

00:42:17.375 --> 00:42:20.380
Do you know what the people
running the other train

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.200
companies in this country
look like?

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.380
Don't think so.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.740
Probably middle-aged white guys
in suits, we would guess.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:32.270
So there's real advantages in
that, it seems to me, because

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:35.330
the product is himself,
and also his

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.560
company, and they're attached.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.000
And it's a very good way
of getting free media.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.660
But there are dangers
in it as well.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.290
Because if that leader either
dies or is discredited in some

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.890
way, or makes some terrible
mistake, as we've seen in

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.700
banking, where some of the bank
leaders became kind of

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:51.980
superstars--

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.710
Fred the Shred, for example--

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.885
then it's a very, very
long way to fall.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.680
GAVIN ESLER: That
surprised me?

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.740
Oh, lots and lots of surprises,
actually.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.890
Dolly Parton surprised me.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:12.930
All kinds of ways, actually.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.690
GAVIN ESLER: She's one of the
brightest women I've ever met.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.800
She'd make a fantastic
political leader.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.810
I like her music as well.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.000
She surprised me because--

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.500
I don't know if you remember,
but a few years ago, the

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.090
reason I was interviewing her
was that she released an album

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.460
which is basically covers
of 1960s protest songs.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.420
And it was during--

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.960
I think it was the end of the
Iraq War, which was very

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.540
messy, and while the Afghanistan
conflict

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.760
was still going on.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.020
And I was suggesting to her
that releasing an album of

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.530
1960s anti-war protest
songs was quite a

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.190
strong political statement.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.110
And I have to say that she
danced around that question

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.050
more brilliantly than any
politician I have ever met.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.730
Including when I said
to her, well, you

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:56.680
should go into politics.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.550
She said, honey, there have been
enough boobs in the White

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.290
House without mine.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.246
AUDIENCE: I'd--

00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:08.080
I'd love to hear your views
on the recent BBC crisis.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.290
What did the director
general get wrong?

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.190
And what should he have
done differently?

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.900
GAVIN ESLER: Well, there's
quite a lot there.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.440
GAVIN ESLER: We've only got,
thank God, 10 minutes.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.387
Look, there were clearly big
mistakes that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:24.387 --> 00:44:27.540
inquiry has gone through,
in terms of what was

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.430
commissioned, what was not
commissioned, and so on.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:33.820
One of the things, though, to go
to my theme, is how do you

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.950
tell a story?

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.690
I mean, I'm very proud
to work for the BBC.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.120
Really proud to work
for the BBC.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.430
I'm very proud of the
people I work with.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.920
And like viewers, I feel
let down if they

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.930
don't get it right.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.120
Now sometimes, we all
get things wrong.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.170
We all get some things wrong.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:53.140
And sometimes, there
are reasons for it.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.160
If you explain it, and you still
have got it wrong, but

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.185
it you explain it properly,
as I suggested, people may

00:44:58.185 --> 00:44:59.030
forgive you.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.420
So in terms of the
commissioning or

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:04.130
non-commissioning of a
program on Savile--

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:06.810
the one thing that the BBC's
never pointed out, it seems to

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:08.760
me, is kind of obvious,
really--

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.780
there wasn't actually
a program to run

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.470
in December of 2011.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.140
There was some research
and some interviews.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:15.660
There wasn't a program,
you press a

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.020
button, you've got one.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.920
When all that research was
handed to ITV, who did a very,

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.190
very good job with it--
excellent job.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.530
Really congratulate them.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:27.790
But it took them till October
2012, which is what, ten

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.800
months later?

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.600
Because these things
take time.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.400
So it wasn't as if,
here's a program.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.820
We didn't run it for
various reasons.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.110
I had nothing to do with
it, by the way.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.660
But it just seems to me, in
terms of basic communication,

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.430
you should point out to people
that there was some research,

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:45.390
which the editor at the time
didn't seem to have any faith

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.300
in, didn't think was going
anywhere, which is a

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.380
reasonable point of view.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.740
He may have been wrong, but
it's a reasonable point of

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.980
view to take.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.600
And it took ten months,
because these

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.580
things take a long time.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.520
So communicating that,
I think most people--

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.340
you may not forgive
the mistake.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.070
I don't know.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:01.780
It's up to you.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.100
You're viewers as well.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.770
But if you begin to understand
it, I think you might

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.730
understand the processes
that go on.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.700
And for example, as Peter well
knows, when you commission

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.120
anything that's investigative,
it takes a long time and is

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.900
very hungry of resources.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.890
I did a film on the INLA, which
took me and the producer

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:22.670
three months.

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:27.170
So it was three months of our
salary, where I didn't do

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.860
anything else.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:28.390
It was three months.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.660
This was years ago,
in Ireland.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.350
So it takes time.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.903
The mistakes that were made,
it seems to me, should have

00:46:36.903 --> 00:46:39.960
been confronted earlier, and
the BBC should've made its

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.840
case, which is a reasonable
case to make.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.046
It's by far, certainly
not a perfect case.

00:46:45.046 --> 00:46:46.670
But it's a reasonable
case to make.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.050
They didn't make it properly.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.280
I hope that they're
making it now.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.060
And I think there's a
degree of calm and

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.470
common sense returned.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:47:00.660
And also, for all of us, as we
found out this shocking story,

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.713
we found out that it wasn't just
the BBC that was duped.

00:47:02.713 --> 00:47:04.790
It was people in the
NHS, in was people

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.760
in the Prison Service.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.910
It was--

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.150
Mrs. Thatcher had Christmas
lunch with this guy.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.810
You know?

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:15.350
So there's quite a lot of
explaining that could have

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.200
been done that wasn't.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.450
That's the corridor.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] examples
of why "who am I" stories are

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.540
important for a leader, do you
suppose the reason that we

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.330
look down on American leaders so
much is that the "who am I"

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:34.250
story is more important to the
people directly following

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.680
you-- the voters--

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.180
than people looking from a
distance, who care much more

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.676
about, where are you taking the
country, or the world, in

00:47:40.676 --> 00:47:41.400
the case of America?

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.980
GAVIN ESLER: I think that's
absolutely right.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.230
And I think also--

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.220
I have a bit of fun in one of
the chapters, where I quote, I

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.670
think it's six American
presidents, or wannabe

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.900
presidents, quotes from
their biographies or

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.360
autobiographies, what they
say about themselves.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.395
And I don't mention who they are
until towards the end of

00:48:00.395 --> 00:48:01.110
the chapter.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.330
And you would think they're all
the same person, because

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.110
they all tell broadly
the same story.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.430
We were poor, but
we were honest.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.450
We lived in a log cabin.

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.980
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.240
Because they think, or somebody
around them thinks,

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.810
that's the story that connects
best with them.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:22.380
And it is true that people who
come from a humble background

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.830
and get on, we tend to admire,
because we like that story.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.010
And that's true everywhere.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:30.390
People who come from a really
prosperous background, like

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:33.530
George W. Bush, have got a
different storytelling trick

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:34.650
that they've got to pull.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.710
Osama bin Laden's another
one, actually.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.160
Again, a completely
different culture.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.160
And the storytelling that
he did, for most

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.250
of us, is just ludicrous.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.450
Absolutely ludicrous, .

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:52.660
But for the audience that he was
looking for, the idea that

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.650
he's fighting the crusaders,
appearance on horses, the

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.230
white robes, the Kalashnikov
in the background, the holy

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:03.545
books, tells a particular story
for his audience, which

00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:06.706
doesn't work with people outside
that target audience.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.990
AUDIENCE: How well do you
think Google is going at

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.526
telling its story?

00:49:17.526 --> 00:49:18.977
GAVIN ESLER: I'll have
to google it.

00:49:18.977 --> 00:49:20.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.200
GAVIN ESLER: Well, I mean,
you've got some great bits of

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.870
your story, it seems to me,
which is that you've got

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:27.830
worldwide recognition.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:28.690
As you--

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.580
that great cliche.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.410
When you become a verb
as opposed to a

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:34.070
noun, that's not bad.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:35.750
There are clearly problems.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.740
And it's the same problem
that Microsoft had.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.090
When you become big, somebody's
going to hate you.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.490
And it's not just your rivals.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.800
People just don't like
the big bully that's

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.340
going to bully us all.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.020
And so that seems to me to be
one of the obvious weaknesses.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.420
And what do you do about it?

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.230
Because you are big.

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.260
You're big because you're
successful.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.290
And how do you steer
around that?

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.900
How did Microsoft?

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.270
I mean, I think one way to do
it is to look at how others

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.820
have done it.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.030
How did Microsoft do it?

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:08.190
How did Steve Jobs
do it with Apple?

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:11.900
That was, to me, a really
clever model.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.530
But it worked for him because
it was authentically him.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.910
He was a showman, actually.

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.170
He liked to do that.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.440
A lot of companies don't have
people who want to put

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.330
themselves forward.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:21.860
And actually, that's not
part of the ethos.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.670
But I don't know enough
about the ethos here.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.790
But I suspect that's not quite
the way that you want to go.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.190
So you've got to find out what
is authentic about your story,

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.790
and tell that, and tell
the good bits.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.530
And know that there will always
be people who will

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.230
criticize you.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.680
I mean, the tax question
is a really big

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.460
issue in this country.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:41.860
And I hope we will continue to
get people from Google on

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.030
Newsnight to talk about it.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:47.770
Because it's something which
concerns everybody.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.728
But you've got to recognize
that, and I think you do.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.920
AUDIENCE: Current crop of shadow
cabinet and cabinet

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.510
politicians, who are the
best storytellers?

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.035
And then, who are the best
storytellers on their behalf,

00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:04.290
in terms of their teams?

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:05.950
Do you think they're
doing a good job?

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.500
GAVIN ESLER: Ah, that's
a good question.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.200
I don't know.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.880
I mean, to put it another way,
I could go through the whole

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.490
cabinet, but it probably
wouldn't be a great idea.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.380
The ones you tend to hear
of tend to be the better

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.985
storytellers, tend to be.

00:51:19.985 --> 00:51:23.210
There's some stories that are
not particularly well told, it

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.730
seems to me.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.950
I mean, I think the question
of the railways is a really

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.200
interesting story.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.670
I mean, you could tell--

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.400
I'm not going to give advice to
people in government about

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.630
how to tell that story.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.790
But there seems to me a much
better way of telling a story

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.710
than it's been told so far.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.650
And the same is true of
the shadow cabinet.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:44.640
I mean, it seems to me in terms
of in Ed Miliband's

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.770
case, he's being criticized
for the third part.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.800
What are your policies?

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.490
I actually think that's
something that really

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.510
exercises political journalists,
and doesn't,

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:56.150
until we get closer to the
election, really exercise

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.230
ordinary folk.

00:51:57.230 --> 00:52:00.610
I think what does energize
ordinary folk is,

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:01.245
who are you, exactly?

00:52:01.245 --> 00:52:05.190
You know, the confusion, David,
Ed, all that stuff.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.020
I'm sure he understands it.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.260
He's a very bright guy.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.520
But that story still
needs a bit more

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.670
telling, it seems to me.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.450
Who are you, and why should
we be interested in you?

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.560
Because I think we are like
that, as a nation.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.940
And I think that the polls,
they reflect as much, it's

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.050
hard times for everybody.

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:28.930
So some people are very hostile
to the government.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.710
Rather than a positive,
we're looking at the

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.510
other parties here.

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.020
And we won't do that until we
trust the person that we think

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.500
is going to be in
Downing Street.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.260
AUDIENCE: So you've obviously
had a lot

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.240
of people on Newsnight.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.755
But who always says no, and who

00:52:44.755 --> 00:52:47.090
would you love to interview?

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:47.780
GAVIN ESLER: That's very easy.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.370
I have got two people that I
would like to interview most,

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:53.120
in ascending order number.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.441
Number two, Bob Dylan.

00:52:55.441 --> 00:52:57.260
And number one's the Queen.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.470
I mean, seriously.

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.620
Tonight on Newsnight, Her
Majesty, the Queen.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.930
You'd watch, wouldn't you?

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.370
And you'd probably watch
the Bob Dylan one, too.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:05.363
That's very easy.

00:53:05.363 --> 00:53:06.613
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.160
Hopefully a straightforward one
to finish, Gavin, but all

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.450
the great leaders you've
interviewed, how many of them

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:28.450
are telling their
own true story?

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:31.700
Or how many of them are telling
a story that's being

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.460
spun for them by an Alastair
Campbell of this world?

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.980
GAVIN ESLER: Well, I'd say a
couple of thoughts to that.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.280
One is, you said many
great leaders.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.940
I've met a great many leaders.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.650
I never said I met many
great leaders.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.010
I've met very few
great leaders.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:45.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.100
GAVIN ESLER: Just to
be pernickety.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.840
I mean, one of the things--

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.100
I use the spin word occasionally
in this, but

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.510
actually, I don't think
it's very helpful.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.575
I think when you call something
spin, you just mean

00:53:57.575 --> 00:53:59.086
the story that you're
being told that you

00:53:59.086 --> 00:53:59.740
don't entirely believe.

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.440
I mean, were the Apostles
spin doctors for Jesus?

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.370
Or I often think, who are
the great storytellers?

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:07.260
Moses--

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.520
he didn't just say, I've had a
walk in the desert, here's 10

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.883
rules, and you're all going
to live by them.

00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:14.870
He said, I've been up on a
mountaintop, and God himself

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:16.010
has given me this stuff.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.390
It's a great story.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.410
AUDIENCE: You interviewed
him, then, did you?

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.030
GAVIN ESLER: Moses would
be number three.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:22.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:23.700
GAVIN ESLER: The Queen,
Bob Dylan, Moses.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.350
And so I think that
everybody--

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.500
including you, I would suggest,
with respect-- shape

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.410
your own story when you
talk to people.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:34.360
We all do it, and there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.860
Nor is there anything wrong with
getting help to do it.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.990
What's wrong is lying.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:42.710
And some of them lie, or come
very, very close to it.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:45.450
And all I've tried to do in the
book is give suggestions

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.660
to help everybody about
storytelling, but also to give

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.340
some suggestions for how to
see through when the story

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.400
you're being told is really
just a bit [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.920
AUDIENCE: So if I can only just
add that-- so, who's then

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.000
been the most authentic?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.440
GAVIN ESLER: Oh, I don't
know, actually.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.770
The most authentic.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:02.890
I'm not sure--

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:04.794
I'm not sure I could answer
that, actually.

00:55:04.794 --> 00:55:06.000
I'll have to ponder.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.730
AUDIENCE: Reagan.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:07.520
GAVIN ESLER: Reagan.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.740
Yeah, what you see
was what you got

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.030
with Reagan, I suspect.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.940
Yeah, that would be
one good example.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.190
Anybody who wasn't found out.

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.900
I mean, the thing about Reagan,
the thing about him,

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.240
in terms of storytelling--

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.870
and again, hugely, hugely
divisive figure.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:25.320
Peter's right.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.520
Thanks for the prompt.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.430
You know, when he got into
terrible, terrible trouble

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:34.440
about the baronial factions in
his administration, who would

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.690
reef against each other and
they would do different

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.580
things, and he was supposed to
be the CEO, as it were, of

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.870
America, but he wasn't really
paying attention to

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:42.620
everything.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.110
He was once asked about this,
and he said, well, I guess the

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.960
right hand doesn't know what the
far right hand is doing.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.550
And that's kind of
vintage him.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:54.320
It diffuses it, but there's
the premise.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.640
And what's your next question?

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.995
It's very difficult
to think of it.

00:55:56.995 --> 00:55:58.180
So maybe he's a good example.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.920
PETER BARRON: Thank
you so much.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.120
GAVIN ESLER: Thank you.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.370
Thank you.
