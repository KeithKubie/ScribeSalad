00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.060
Good afternoon, everybody,
and welcome to the African

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.220
and Middle East Division.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.430
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
Chief of the Division.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.130
And I'm delighted to
see you all here.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.990
We always start the program with
a sort of general introduction

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.590
about our division and what we do.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.950 position:56%
And why we think we should return to
our division for many more programs.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.750
So, this division is
responsible for the collections

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.420
from 78 different countries,
the entire continent of Africa,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.990
the Middle East, Central
Asia, and the Caucasus.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.360
And we are divided into three
sections, the African section,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.270
the Hebraic Section, and we collect
worldwide for the Hebraic section,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.150
and the Near East section.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.250
We serve collections in the
languages of the region.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.810
And I will explain this in a
minute, but our collections,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.310
very custodial collection,
and custodian division,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.820 position:56%
and our materials are in the scripts

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.740
and the languages of
these countries.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.870
So, were you to do
research on Ethiopia,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.460
the materials in [foreign name],
in [foreign name], would be here,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.120 position:56%
but if you were interested in
reading what people said in English,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.290
in French, in German,
in Italian, and so on,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.250
those would be spread
throughout the library,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.310
and primarily in the
General Collections.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.850
If you're interested in
law materials on Ethiopia,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.710 position:56%
you'd have to go to the Law Library.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.100 position:56%
If you're interested in films, you'd
have to go to a Motion Picture.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.030
So, what I'm saying is that,
we only have the materials

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.900
in the vernacular, but
the others for research,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.900
are spread throughout the library.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.200
And this is why it's such an
exciting thing to be here,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.850
because you can go -- you can come
to us and then we'll send you all

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.890
over the library as well.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.150
We also organize programs.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.450
We have symposia.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.750
We have workshops.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.050
We have displays.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.350
We have exhibits.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.390
And we have parties sometimes.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.700
And we always include everyone

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.020
to taste our foods
from different regions.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.030
This is a way of getting
a feel for the cultures.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.120
And through the eyes and
writings of our speakers,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.060
our programs are enriched.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.900
Our books come to life.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.950
And our 78 countries are no longer
just places on a map, but living,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.520
breathing entities that are
rich in history and culture,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.850
and that are an intrinsic part
of today's global civilization.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.900
Today we have a person who'd
going to enlighten us on --

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.090
in a field that we are not
always very familiar with.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.580
And I will leave it
hanging without saying more,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.590
but we have Gregory Copley.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.890
He's the President

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.960
of the International
Strategic Studies Association,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.400
and he will be talking
to us about a unique book

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.070
that he wrote a few years ago and
I understand is being updated.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.320 position:56%
His lecture today is entitled,
"Imperial Ethiopia's Unique Symbols,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.270
Structures, and Role
in the Modern World."

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.710
And I will -- he will
be further introduced

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.050
but before I continue any
further, I want to also

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.550
to recognize the presidents of --

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.340
Prince Ermias, the grandson of
the Emperor, Haile Selassie,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.190
and some members of his family.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.720
We're delighted to have you here.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.920
As usual, Prince Ermias also
gave us a talk a few years ago,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.180
and perhaps he'll come
back and give us another.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.780
And now, to introduce our speaker
is our own Fentahun Tiruneh,

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.410
the Specialist for Ethiopia and
Eritrea, here in the African

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.620
and Middle Eastern Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.610
Now, I want you to know,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.770
that Fentahun has just been named
Grand Officer of the Imperial Order

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.380
of the Star of Honor of Ethiopia,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.620
by his Imperial Highness,
Prince Ermias.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.500
And this great honor was bestowed
upon him for, and I'm quoting,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.820
"Great wisdom and dedication in
the preservation and promulgation

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.840
of documents and archives
of the Ethiopic languages,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.310
in the United States in the Library
of Congress of the United States.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.010
And it has reflected great
prestige and distinction

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.500
on the Ethiopian peoples
and their history."

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.800
So, I wanted everyone to recognize
also that our Fentahun Tiruneh,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.480
has been very much honored for
his work, and for making --

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.870
for developing those
collections, and those programs,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.910 position:56%
and knowledge about Ethiopia here at
the Library of Congress, and beyond.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.490
So, without further ado,
let me introduce Fenta

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.720
who will introduce
the speaker in turn.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.520
Thank you.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.100
[ Applause ]

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.000
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh:
Thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.010
Prince Ermias, distinguished
guests and ladies and gentlemen,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.640
I'm so happy to see all of you
here for this important program

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.750
in which a good friend of mine,
Gregory Copley, is going to speak

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.770
on a very important topic about
imperial symbols, structures,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.980
and the role in the modern world.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.260
A subject that has been forgotten
or ignored for a long time.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.560
But before I begin to
introduce our speaker,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.790
I would like to impart
some information to you.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.300
There will be a modest
reception in our conference room,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.600 position:56%
right behind me, in which you'll get
an opportunity to speak to the --

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.790
to our guest on a personal level.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.130
And his Royal Highness,
Prince Ermias,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:19.870
had given us a wonderful lecture in
2010, and that lecture on the Line

of Judah, was made into a booklet,
and we have about 20 for you to pick

basis, in the conference room.

And thank you for your

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.660

[ Applause ]

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.980
&gt;&gt; Gregory Copley:
Thank you, Fentahun.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.140
We're going to have
to get a shorter bio.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.540 position:56%
[Inaudible], your Imperial Highness,
Prince Ermias Sahle Selassie,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.480
President of the Crown Council of
Ethiopia, distinguished guests,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.240
my profound thanks to
[inaudible] Dr. Deeb,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.740
but also to my greatly admired
friend, Fentahun Tiruneh,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.080
for organizing this event
today, at this important center

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.340
of learning and preservation.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.450
And of course, my congratulations
to him for that recent award

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.100
of Ethiopia's great imperial
symbol, the Order of Grand Officer

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.300
of the Star of Honor, of Ethiopia.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.930
Well, it's been two decades
since I wrote the book,

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.570
"Ethiopia Reaches a Hand unto God:
Imperial Ethiopia's Unique Symbols,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.230
Structures, and Role
in the Modern World."

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.480
And that was done with
the profound assistance

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.170
of his Imperial Highness,
Prince Ermias.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.620
It's remarkable that
interest in the book has grown

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.890
with the years, rather
than diminished.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.180
And the book continues to
sell, much to my astonishment.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.260
But part of this is because we
are witnessing a strong resurgence

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.240
in the unique identity of
Ethiopia and Ethiopians.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.450
This is not just because
Ethiopia is finally recovering

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.010
from the cultural devastation
of the coup of 1974.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.360
It's also related to the fact

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.910
that the transforming global social
environment is forcing many people

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.350
around the world, to become
conscious of their core identities.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.170
We are globally entering a
period of identity politics,

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.710
a time when people yearn

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.000
to understand why they
are, who they are.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.710
Why they are special, and what
their special relationship is

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.130
with their geography.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.010
This introspection is neither
accidental nor coincidental.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.710
It's a direct response
to the threat felt by --

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.570
to their identities by
many peoples in the face

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.310
of the globalism ideology

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.980
which stressed the irrelevance
of borders, and nations.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.610 position:56%
Bear in mind, this is quite separate
from the mechanisms of globalization

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.020
of communications and trade,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.650
although these have helped
feed the globalism philosophy,

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.540
which is essentially an
urban phenomenon in a world

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.230
which is increasingly urbanizing,
and increasingly materialistic.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.390
Identity however, is both
visceral and psychological.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.920
It's the tool which
builds the frame of logic

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.570
in individuals and in societies.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.520
It gives a sense of
self-worth, purpose, legitimacy,

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.110
as well as a sense of comprehension
of as to how people fit

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.130
into their particular
geographic surroundings.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.540
And this gives them the
understandings of the seasons,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.010
and what survival demands
of them individually,

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.000
as well as in a genetic sense.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.840
It gives group cohesion and
therefore, productivity.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.220
I've described this as
a terroir relationship,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.160
to use the French expression,
the linkage between people

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.480
and their particular geography.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.940
Of course, urban societies develop
their own terroir relationship

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.130
with their concrete geography.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.310
And the urban sense of
geopolitics, has driven much

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.710
of the globalist philosophy
against the classical,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.240
or should we say Westphalianist,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.420
sense of nationhood
and national identity.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.790
Ethiopia still has one of the lower
rates of urbanization in the world.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.390
Some 17.3% of the population
was urbanized as of 2015,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.890
one of the lowest rates
in the world,

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.740
and certainly well below the
sub-Saharan African average of 37%.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.650
But urbanization is growing
dramatically in the country,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.070
possibly at an estimated
5.4% a year.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.280
For most Ethiopians, their
sense of identity was rooted

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.900
in the specialness related to the
conviction that they were chosen

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.930
by God, favored by God, that
God had a special commitment

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.580
to their welfare.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.020
This belief had more than
three millennia of evolution,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.430
based on the union between King
Solomon and Queen Makada of Saba.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.490
And the belief system
came into a civilization

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.800
which in biblical times, was
already well established among the

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.330
Cushitic people.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.820
The union of King Solomon and Queen
Makada, introduced the Second Zion

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.990
as a Jewish dominated state,
which ultimately became --

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.330
began transformation to a
Christian dominated state

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.990
from the 4th Century A.D.
Well, it's important to note

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.820
that Ethiopia also has a
special relationship with Islam.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.650
The prophet Muhammad, having sent
his family and followers to safety

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.620
in Ethiopia from Mecca, bestowed
a special significance on Ethiopia

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.730
as a place for the coexistence
of peoples of different faiths,

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.850
but sharing national identity.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.890
The transition from a
Jewish dominated society

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.510
to a Christian dominated society,
did not diminish the power

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.020
of the Solomonic imagery

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.660
to help sustain the
Ethiopian sense of uniqueness.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.050
If anything, the later introduction
of western education in Ethiopia,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.810
compounding during the 20th
Century period of Haile Selassie,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.610 position:56%
and opening still further during the
Republican years, has only served

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.390
to broaden the Ethiopian
sense of specialness.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.830
Given that it now also
embraces much greater study

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.290
of the pre-Solomonic Cushitic
periods and civilization,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.350
and also the origins of modern
mankind in the Rift Valley

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.170
with the finding of
the skeletal remains

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.330
of Australopithecus afarensis.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.520
In my brief here today,
is to discuss the issues

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.510
of symbology relating
to the Imperial Period,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.930
the Ethiopia symbols and structures
and roles in the modern world.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.260
And that essentially
focuses to a large extent

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.110
on the impact inside Ethiopia,
and on the outside world

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.900
of what became the
iconic Solomonic crown

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.500
and its rituals and hierarchies.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.680
Certainly, the post-coup period
in Ethiopia, that is since 1974,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.060
finds the country and its people

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.320
in an entirely new
global strategic context.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.230
Nothing of course, ever
returns to the way it was,

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.300
which is why the potency of the
Solomonic imagery is significant

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.490
in that it continues
to galvanize thought,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.620
even though the Ethiopian
society and the global context,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.140
have become dramatically
more complex.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.140
And he intellectual offerings have
challenged traditional religions

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.060
and beliefs, particularly
with urban centric

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.810
and more materialistic logic.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.920
But let me reiterate, that
as the world broadens,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.840
not just for Ethiopians but for
all of us, there is a tendency

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.910
to seek a reactive
search among peoples

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.650
for their identity,
their core identity.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.240
It's a search for horizons,
purpose, and uniqueness.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.630
Well, this sense of self-belief
sustained by the presence

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.310
of an iconic bloodline,
in the case of Ethiopia,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.980 position:56%
the Solomonic bloodline, in the face
of all other adversity in Ethiopia

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.600
over more than 3 millennia,
was responsible for creating

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.990
and sustaining a civilizational
model.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.250
This civilization, while not
wealthy by world standards,

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.410
provides a unique perspective
on the entire question

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.060
of the survival of
a social identity.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.420
Ethiopia's identity and
mission, was committed to writing

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.960
as the national saga of the
Ethiopic peoples in the form

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.080 position:56%
of the Kebra Nagast, the Glory of
Kings, possibly the 6th Century A.D.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.080
And this served to elevate the
specialness of the people further,

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.220
sustaining them through
great hardship.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.000
Little wonder, that the periods
when Ethiopians were separated

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.830
from their iconic sense
of specialness,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.530
perhaps during the non-Solomonic
Zagwe Dynasty between the 10th

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.740
and 13th Centuries, or
during the fractured period

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.980
of the Zemene Mesafint, the
Era of Princes and Judges,

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.770
from 1769 through 1855,
they lost some

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.000
of their sense of special purpose.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.290
And little wonder too that when
Emperor Tewodros began the modern

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.130
Solomonic Period in 1855, the
country regained some consciousness

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.880
of its historical sense of mission.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.870
Emperor Tewodros' successor,
Yohannes IV,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:47.160
in particular began building on
the iconographic foundation laid

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.730
by the mystical power
of the Kebra Nagast,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.000
and the accompanying
pervasive religious authority

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.950
of the Orthodox Church.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.630
He and particularly Emperor Menelik
II, began building structures

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.500
of authority around the
Solomonic line, using the symbols

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.290
of the Crown's authority to
build that mystical connection

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.880
between the throne and the various,

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.270
many varied people, of
the Ethiopian Empire.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.360
It's possible that this began the
most significant use of symbols

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.020 position:56%
of authority of the Crown, since the
great totemic constructions of Axum

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.380
such as the famous Stelae of Axon

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.880
in the First Millennium
of the Modern Era.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.660
The fact that Emperor Menelik

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.330
so successfully routed the Italian
invasion of Ethiopia at the Battle

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:40.840
of Adwa on March the 1st and 2nd in
1896, was itself a rallying point

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.760 position:56%
for Ethiopia and Ethiopian prestige.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.510
It was this event in which the
emperor's wife, Empress Taytu,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.290
played a role which was
reminiscent of the powerful

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.480
and unique Queen of
Sheba, Queen Makada.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.020
And this started a chain of events
which played out in bringing

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.370
to an end, the European
Colonial expansion in Africa.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.070
It was Emperor Menelik's enormous
victory, the first such victory

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.190
by an African state against
a modern European power,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.270
which gave Ethiopia the
prestige and leadership

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:17.450
to create the Pan-African concepts
to eventually be the beacon

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.240
of independence for
the African colonies.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.620 position:56%
It's absolutely clear that Emperor
Menelik's victory ultimately enabled

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.400
Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1963,
to create and host the Organization

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.610
for African Unity, and now the
African Union as the precursor

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.880
to the post-Colonial Period.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.860
Indeed no one, actually
honed this use of symbols

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.600
and intricate social hierarchy
more than Emperor Haile Selassie

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.620
when he came to full
imperial power in 1930.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.980
Such was the prestige and authority
of the emperor and Ethiopia

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.700
by late 1935, when the Italians
again invaded the country,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.580
that it was the emperor's scolding
words to the League of Nations

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:05.050 position:56%
which ended international hypocrisy
over Italy's blatant misuse of arms.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.580
You'll all recall his parting
words as he left the podium

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.880
at the League of Nations.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.180
He said, "Today it is us.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.590
Tomorrow, it will be you."

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.400
The League of Nations was in fact
finished because it was so exposed

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.610
as hollow by the emperor's globally
recognized address in June 1936.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.590
But this was to be followed
by the fact that Ethiopia

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.200
with British assistance,
achieved the first allied victory

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.220
of World War II when it
drove the occupying Italians

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.020
from the country in 1941.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.530 position:56%
Ethiopians recovered, regrouped, and
reasserted their Solomonic identity

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.180
after that five-year
interregnum in the dynasty.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:49.090 position:56%
From that point forward, the emperor
believed fervently in the philosophy

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.310
of collective security,
committing Ethiopian troops,

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.200
particularly the Imperial
Guard Regiment,

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.320
to the United Nations
force in the Korean War.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.130 position:56%
The Ethiopians' heroism and
professionalism was greatly praised,

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.220
and decorated by the United States.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.050 position:56%
Emperor Haile Selassie's enormous
international stature had a profound

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.520
and lasting impact on the world.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.610
The emerging Black Nationalists
and Pan-Africanist movements

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.250
in the Americas, led by
Jamaica's Marcus Garvey,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.400
saw in Emperor Haile Selassie,
a figurehead, an inspiration,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.240
which led to the creation
of the Rastafarian Movement.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.380
And it was the Rastafarian religion
which was to play an important role

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.880
in sustaining the unique imagery

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.600
of the Solomonic line,
after the coup of 1974.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.060
But before that, it was
the emperor's visits

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.030
to the United States, starting in
1954, which was so inspirational

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.230
to African Americans, that
they provided an impetus

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.010
for the U.S. Civil Rights Movement

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.630
which gathered pace
from that point onwards.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.700
This was addressed well in the
2011 book by Theodore Vestal,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.350 position:56%
"The Line of Judah in the New World:
Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:03.810
and the Shaping of Americans'
Attitudes Towards Africa."

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.110
Emperor Haile Selassie
consciously and fervently believed

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.480
in the mission handed down to him,
and in his responsibility to build,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.640 position:56%
first the dignity, and secondly, the
capability of the Ethiopian people.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.020
And to do this, he
stressed the mysticism

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.880
of the historical authority
of the Solomonic bloodline,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.090
which is codified in the
1955 Constitution stipulation

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.960
on succession to the throne.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.990
And in the respect that he gave
to the prestige and authority

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.050
of the regional and national
hierarchies and officers.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.840
And to the importance of Ethiopia's
unique system of ranks, titles,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.860
and honors, which set
it apart from the world.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.360
This was not merely to give
authority to the Crown itself,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.270
or to the makwanent, the upper
nobility, or the negusawi betasab,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:55.560
the Royal and Imperial
household, but to give everyone,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.440
a sense of place within the
hierarchy of the society,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.950
to give each person a sense
of purpose and dignity.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.510
It's significant that Emperor Haile
Selassie simultaneously embarked

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.170
on an ambitious and almost
helter-skelter dash towards the

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.910
western education of as
many Ethiopians as possible,

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.050
perhaps without understanding
that this introduced a competitive

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.000
and less mystical thrust
into Ethiopian society.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.800
It introduced materialism,
which challenged the stoicism

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.920
of the society, and which demanded
the satisfaction of desires,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.810
and ambitions, at a pace which no
emerging economy could satisfy.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.660
There are many reasons why
this fundamental contradiction

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.460
which Emperor Haile Selassie
introduced into Ethiopian society,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.440
led to the coup of 1974,
and to the wasteland created

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.050
by the Derg which seized power.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:56.020
Some of this is addressed in Prince
Asfa-Wossen Asserate's revealing

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.780
book, "King of Kings," in 2015,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.820
as well as in Professor Gizachew
Tiruneh's important 2015 book,

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.650
"The Rise and Fall of the
Solomonic Dynasty of Ethiopia."

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.730
But this clash of more than 3
millennia of mysticism, nurtured

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.330
and strengthened in
isolation and the materialism

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.010
of the 20th Century external
world, which because unavoidable

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.510
after World War II, also came to
a head, as the emperor was aging

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.990
and without the succession base
which he's spent his life trying

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.390
to assemble for the transition
to the next generation.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.280
It also came as the great
superpowers of the world,

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.140
the United States and the
USSR, were at a crucial time

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.550
in their own titanic confrontation.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.680
The technologies of
that confrontation

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.130
between the west the Soviet Block,
also coincided with the exhaustion

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.460
of the emperor, and the rising
demands of social expectations,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.630
which the emperor's education,
modernization, and emancipation,

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.690
had set entrain [phonetic].

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.290
The US, long a tacit
guardian of Ethiopia

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.230
in the post-World War II era,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.490 position:56%
had improved its intelligence
collection capabilities to the point

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.790
where it no longer felt

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.590
that it needed the
electronic intelligence station

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:10.260
at Kagnew Station, Asmara, as
Mara, in what is now Eritrea.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.210
So, while the US kept the
station going until 1977,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.530
three years after the
coup against the emperor,

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.120
Washington had made it clear
that it was no longer interested

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.820
in being the strategic
partner of Ethiopia.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.360
The USSR on the other
hand, had long invested

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.790
in radicalizing the newly
educated youth of Ethiopia,

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.290
the youth who the emperor
had so willingly thrust

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.980
into the urban mainstream
of international learning.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.240
The Soviet [inaudible], the
Communist International --

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.400
the Center of Soviet Psychological
Operations at that time run

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.280 position:56%
by the master psychological warrior,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.660
Boris Nikolayevich
Ponamarev [phonetic],

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.370
created in Moscow a political
propaganda publication,

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.550
to subvert Ethiopian news.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.070
The Soviets named the publication,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.290
[foreign name], "The
Rainbow from God."

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.440
This was a breathtaking
theft of a highly religious

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.370 position:56%
and particularly Ethiopian symbology
about the special relationship

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.020
which God had with
the Ethiopian people.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.140
In Soviet hands, it
became just one more tool

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.410
to take away Ethiopia's
sense of specialness.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.890
And this whole Soviet campaign
struck a chord at the same time

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.010
that Washington was
neglecting the emperor.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.370
Thus, once again with the
coup of 1974, Ethiopia seemed

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:28.240
to have been robbed of
its identity and purpose.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.650 position:56%
The coup masters destroyed or seemed
to have destroyed, in an instant,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:37.950 position:56%
the 3,500 years of Solomonic
identity, and for the next 43 years,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.170
it appeared that Ethiopia
had seen all vestiges

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.240
of its specialness erased.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.070
That it would be just
another poor African country.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.380
But it's now clear,
that this was not to be.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.600
There is now an unprecedented
level of interest

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.310
from Ethiopians inside
Ethiopia, and in the diaspora,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.370
as well as among international
scholars as to why Ethiopia was

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.510
so special and what Emperor Haile
Selassie did to raise its profile,

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.470
unity, and sense of purpose.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.680
There's now a growing
appetite among Ethiopians,

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.190
that they must either regain
that identity or revert

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.560
to very narrow ethnic
and linguistic groupings.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.630
It seems that the trend favors
the search for a path back

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.260
to that Ethiopian-ness, which
has a great sense of personal

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.100
and group identity, as well

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.400
as in rediscovering
international prestige,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.130
rather than taking the
difficult and isolating task

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:37.120
of creating new personae around
ethnic and linguistic subgroups.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.920
What's significant, is
that considerable interest

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.410
in the Ethiopian identity
is beginning

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.740
to resurge among the
Ethiopian diaspora,

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.520
which has become a distinct
grouping, virtually,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.070
entirely within the urban
areas of its host countries.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:56.020
We see the yearning for
an ancient identity coming

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.650
from the diaspora peoples who have
not been able to shake that sense

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.760
of separateness from their
new host communities.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.090
The maturing of ex-patriot
Ethiopians,

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:08.520
many of whom had become
associated with western values

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.430
and education during the
late Haile Selassie period,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.120
to the point where they begin
to search for their origins,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.890
and it's now become profound.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.080
Unsurprisingly, this example --

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.630
for example, this has led to the
fostering of important centers

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:27.230
of inquiry into Ethiopian
history in western universities,

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.350
and at such institutions
as Tsehai Publishers

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.040
at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.400
Thus, the flame of the Solomonic
line has been nurtured outside

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.550
Ethiopia during the
period of the interregnum.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.850
In much the same way, the flame

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.490
of Persia's Zoroaster has been kept
alive by ex-patriot Zoroastrian

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.310
and Parsee [assumed spelling]
communities in their diaspora,

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.070
largely in Canada, while
the sheer Muslim domination

00:30:55.070 --> 00:31:00.050
of Iran has suppressed the
traditional Persian identities.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.820
What's significant too is that much

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.910
of Ethiopia's iconic documentation
has been kept secure outside the

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.260
country, and including
particularly at such institutions

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.700
as the US Library of Congress.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.030
And for the time being,
the very Solomonic Crown

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.350
of the Ethiopian peoples itself,
resides with the Crown Council

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.540
under Prince Ermias, in
exile in the diaspora.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:27.010
Indeed, what has emerged in
the 43 years of the interregnum

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.190 position:56%
since the coup against Emperor Haile
Selassie, and it's important to note

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.970
that it was in fact a coup
by a small military group,

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.600
and not a popular revolution.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:41.160 position:56%
It's important to note that it's
the [inaudible] of Ethiopians caused

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.180
by the coup, which have
become globally visible.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.470
Conservatively, there are some 3
million Ethiopians living outside

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.770
Ethiopia at present.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.310
And I'll venture to say, it's
considerably more than that,

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.880
compared with only a handful of
such ex-patriots living abroad,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.730
less than a century earlier.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.980
And ex-patriots contribute
between 1.5 billion

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.350
and I hear 4.7 billion a year,
in foreign exchange remittances

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.410
to the Ethiopian economy.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:11.830
The Ethiopian diaspora represents
a very distinct new profile

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.850
of the nation, in the
international consciousness.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.520
But equally, this group is
now maturing and reflecting

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.640
on what it means to be
of Ethiopian origin.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.780 position:56%
It's natural that some of the ethnic
divisions in such a diverse society

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.370
as Ethiopia, are being
reflected within the diaspora.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.840
But what's been interesting
is the fact that Ethiopia's 60

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.800
or so ethnic groups, appear
to have in the diaspora,

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.190
largely identified themselves as
Ethiopian, and only secondarily

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.670
as members of the ethnic
and linguistic subgroups.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:47.190
Much of this unity in exile, is
due to the overwhelming impact

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.430
of historical symbols, including
religion, although of course,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.200 position:56%
as I said, not all Ethiopians are
united behind the Ethiopian Orthodox

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.470
Church, around symbols such as
language, and by the teachings

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.400
of the Kebra Nagast, and the
Fetha Nagast, the Law of Kings.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.310
But also including the iconography
which was so strongly promoted

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.000
by Emperor Haile Selassie.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.210
Well, the time is now right
for these vital elements

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:16.400
of Ethiopia's identity to
be regathered into Ethiopia.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.070
We've recently seen the
creation in Addis Ababa

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.300 position:56%
of the Meles Zenawi Library to honor
the recent and late prime minister.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.320
So, it's fitting that
the diaspora community

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.240
and the Crown Council are now
interested in the creation

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.160
of a prestigious new center,
the Haile Selassie I Library

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.210
and Conference Center, to be
built hopefully in Addis Ababa,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.100
in a location where the
great learning and symbols

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.350
of the Solomonic Era,
can be brought together.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.350
With the creation of
such an institution,

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.950
so much of Ethiopia's documentary

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.880
and physical heritage could
be brought home to the country

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.110
and gathered together from private
collections around the world.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.930 position:56%
The center could be a focus of
research and learning on the lessons

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:04.110
of the past, 3,500 years,
contributing to the continuation

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:09.130 position:56%
of what is essentially, an
unbroken chain of Ethiopian history,

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.380
totally compatible with its
evolution, modernization,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.500
and rising role in the new world.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.300 position:56%
Such a library would actually fit
well into the modern state structure

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.780
of Ethiopia, and has already
received private encouragement

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.500
from various government officials.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.280
There's good reason
for that support.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.640
The 3,500 year Solomonic
history is the unbroken lifeline

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.170
of the Judeo-Christian
civilizations.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.350
Even Abrahamic civilization as
a whole, and it's the heritage

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.840
of all Ethiopians,
including the government

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.770
of the Republic of Ethiopia.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.760
But it's also the historical
bloodline, the lifeline,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.170
of the modern world as a whole.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.540
And as such, the library
could attract significant

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.100
international attention.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.710
This does not in any
way preclude discussion

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.650
of pre-Solomonic Ethiopia, or
today's Republican Ethiopia.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.640
It's about recognizing a totemic
aspect of Ethiopian identity,

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.890
and its relationship
with modern civilization.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.320
What became clear as I began to
explore in that book we published

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.960
in 1998, "Ethiopia
Reaches a Hand unto God,"

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.770
is that Ethiopians have
developed a unique cultural,

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.600
and civilizational
position throughout history.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.050
It's true that this position
lost momentum briefly during the

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.830
[inaudible] interregnum, but the
sense of identity built around,

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:33.760
not only the physical iconography,
but also around the memory

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.880
of Haile Selassie and
his predecessors,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.160
is returning at a significant pace.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.520
Clearly, we are just at the
beginning of this renaissance.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.700
How the Ethiopian people and
government use this revival

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:50.660
of historical identity, could
well be strategically important.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.510
And with that, I hope to thank you

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.840
and [foreign name] turn
to you for questions.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.640
Thank you.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.540
[ Applause ]

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.840
Thank you.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.140
&gt;&gt; Questions [inaudible]?

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.440
&gt;&gt; Gregory Copley: Yes, doctor?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.730
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: First
of all, thank you very much

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.900
for this wonderful presentation,
and I very much enjoyed it.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.040
So, what are some of the
symbols that were used

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.090
in the most recent revival?

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.390
&gt;&gt; Gregory Copley: Well,

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:28.820
particularly since
Emperor Tewodros' Period,

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:34.580
we saw that what the traditional
titles and ranks and hierarchies,

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.380
which were [inaudible]
around Ethiopia,

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.420
were given greater prominence.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.100
They -- so the various
historical ranks,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.900
some of them from very
distinct regions,

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.430
were honored by the
Ethiopian Empire as a whole.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.610 position:56%
There were various other titles, the
[foreign name] and [foreign name]

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.300
and so on, which became -- which
had their own special meanings,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.630
and they gave a sense of uniqueness
to people's place in the society.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:09.020
That's the same way as the European
hierarchical structures evolved,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.220
but it was uniquely Ethiopian.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:18.980 position:56%
And in many respects, it was
compounded by the sense of isolation

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.530 position:56%
of the [foreign name], particularly.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:29.390 position:56%
And this actually was the reason why
the victory of Adwa was so was so --

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:35.560
was made possible because this
was a structure and a logic system

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.520
which applied, not only to society,
but also to military operations,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.850
which enabled Emperor
Menelik to conduct a battle

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:48.270
against the Ethiopians which the
Italians could not understand.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:53.650
They had based all of their
analysis on going into Ethiopia

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:58.730
on other African adventures by
Colonial powers, and on what seemed

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:04.850
to be the sweeping success of the
British and the General Napier

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.530
against Emperor Tewodros.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:13.460 position:56%
And as such, they actually
misunderstood how Ethiopian society,

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.270 position:56%
and the logistics [inaudible] of the
society, the way it fed its society

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.110
and fed its military
structure, was conducted.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.560 position:56%
So, that was particularly important.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.350
And this was about, if you
like non-physical iconography

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:32.170
but within -- it was definitely
an iconic sense of the country.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.880
There were others, of course.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:40.510
The belief that the Star of
David concept itself was created

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.280
in Ancient Ethiopia.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.660 position:56%
The fact that Ethiopian colors
became so significant that they came

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.400
to represent Pan-Africanism
and so on.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:57.440
But what most of the emperors,
particularly Yohannes onwards,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.700
started adapting their symbols
of recognition to accord with --

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.190
to a degree with international
standards,

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.750
and they created the great
orders like the Star of Ethiopia,

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.410
like the Order of the Holy Trinity,
the Order of Solomon and Sheba,

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:16.720
the Order of Solomon itself,
and then -- and so on.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.760
These all became items
which reinforced the sense

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.100
of hierarchy in the country.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:33.580
Of course, the sense of grandeur
was always there from the ruins

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:39.710
in Stelae of Axum, and in the
belief, that of course that the --

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:44.490
that within St. Mary's Church in
Axum, lay the Ark of the Covenant,

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.080
which gave great symbolic
importance to the church.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.520
So, the -- and the church, the
role of the church in fostering

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.680
that Ethiopian sense of
identity, can't be underestimated.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.230
Even its impact on
non-Christian elements

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.920
of Ethiopian society
has been profound

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.970
because it does give a
sense of timelessness

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.250
to the whole Ethiopian society.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.890
So, it's perhaps in a
sense, the iconography

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:18.390
of Ethiopia has been less
physical, than say the Roman

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:25.950
and Hellenic civilizations, or even
the British sense of construction

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:31.580
where great cities have tended to
be the iconography which gave power

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.520
to Rome, London, and so on.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.490
But in fact, it may be that the
Ethiopian society's all the more

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:44.460
durable for the fact that
its icons are psychological,

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.940
more than they are visual.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.450
Sir?

00:40:55.510 --> 00:41:51.260
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.010
They're common-- .

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.770
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.570
Enemy.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:44:00.110
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.410
Well, both.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.710
Thank you for that.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.560
I mean, if I forget to answer a
specific point, just remind me.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.970
But firstly, the Jewish nature

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:15.010
of Ethiopia before the 4th Century
was -- is pretty well-documented.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:20.260
Now, of course the
reporting of the Kebra Nagast

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:26.440
and other documents show the
creation of the Second Zion

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:32.300
after Menelik I, the son
of Queen Makada of Saba,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:41.520 position:56%
went back to Jerusalem and met with
Solomon and then returned with a lot

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.680
of the first born, the noble
families of Israel and Judah

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.720
at that time, and of
course, under Ethiopian myth,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.300
that's when they brought the Ark
of the Covenant back with them.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.570
That's [inaudible]
been open to debate,

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:01.470
but clearly there was a Jewish
society under Menelik I,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:08.950
lasting until the conversion of --
with the kings in the 4th Century.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.410
And then you started the
predominantly Christian era.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.670
So, yes, it was -- and then
by the way, there was --

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:18.610
it was not a unique situation
for there to be Jewish kingdoms

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.570
in the region in Arabia
and so on as well,

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:26.780
as well as up into the
areas around the Caspians.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:32.020
I mean, this was a
common phenomenon.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:38.740
You asked about the Solomonic links
with the Era of Princes and Judges,

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.050
and in fact, yes, there was
clearly a Solomonic thread running

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:47.530
through all of that as well, but
because of the dispersed leadership

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:51.200
in that period, when there was
a lot of regional infighting,

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.590
you didn't have this iconic,
central power of the --

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:00.960
of a Solomonic emperor during
that brief period until 1855

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.720
when it was re-galvanized
under Tewodros.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.610
But you're right in suggesting

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:14.430
that Emperor Haile Selassie not
only was the only viable choice

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:17.250
to lead the country
when he was chosen as --

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:21.590
first as Region and then
[foreign name] and later

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:25.010
as Emperor [foreign
name], I guess in 1930.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:30.640
He was outstandingly visionary
from a global perspective.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.820
He was, as you say, progressive
in the best sense of the word

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.430
in that he wanted excellence
and education,

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:44.370
and he did so without a
foundation of great wealth.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.460
So, he actually introduced
modern education.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.890 position:56%
He introduced modern infrastructure,
technology, and so on.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.190
He was enlightened.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.110
And it was no accident that,
and I didn't mention it in this,

00:46:55.110 --> 00:47:01.420
but no accident that he was highly
engaged in the [inaudible] Movement

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.530
because he was looking for
bridges between the world.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.830
Here was the irony.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.400
He was heavily involved in
creating the [inaudible] Movement

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.340
and sustaining that, at the same
time as he exhibited a belief

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.350
in collective security, which
is why he committed so strongly

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.710
to the United Nations,

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.660
and the United Nations
mission in Korea, for example.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:25.690
He -- in fact, the
revolution against him,

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:26.990
or the coup against him rather,

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.240
and the [inaudible] revolutionary
thought which was introduced later

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.990
by the Derg, was absolutely
regressive in, to my mind,

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:45.570 position:56%
in the sense that it was an attempt
to stop some of this broad, liberal,

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:47.470
democratic ideals,
which the emperor had.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:52.840
I mean, he was clearly a proponent
of a constitutional monarchy

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.200
and a stable democratically
elected government,

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.210
and had he been given the time,
I think we'd have seen Ethiopia,

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:08.090
not only have stable democratic
institutions to this day, but also,

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:11.790
great economic benefits
as a result of that,

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:18.790
without compromising Ethiopia's
sense of its unique identity.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:26.510
So, does that address
that, do you think?

00:48:26.510 --> 00:52:58.720
[ Inaudible audience question ]

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:06.180 position:56%
Well, I think that the abandonment,
if you like of the imperial imagery,

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:10.720
and for a brief period
during the Derg,

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.160
occurred because it was enforced.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.650
You know, the pictures of the
emperor were forcibly removed.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.390
People did hide them away.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:24.440
But ultimately, you
know, that was a mistake.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:29.640
I mean the Soviet influence
absolutely did a disservice

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.490
to itself by not trying to co-opt
[phonetic] Ethiopia's history

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:35.830
to a greater degree.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:39.030
They had succeeded as I
mentioned with the creation

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:47.670 position:56%
of that magazine called, you know,
the Rainbow of God, basically trying

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.560
to initially co-opt
an Ethiopian symbol.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.210
Then they abandoned it, and maybe
because it was [foreign name]

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.640
that he wanted to show
[inaudible] to Moscow

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.680
that he basically introduced
entirely foreign iconography,

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.990
which doesn't work.

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:07.010
And one of the things that we're
seeing around the world today,

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.500
is this cry from most societies,

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.000
"We want our country
back," whatever that means.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.060
And I don't think most people know
what it means, or they know --

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:20.340
they want to know that their whole
purpose, their ancestry and so on,

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.810
has some meaning, not to
just start fresh again.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.110
We saw with the collapse --

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:28.830
well, the collapse of the Soviet
Union 70 years after the decree

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.510
that it a new Soviet
man would be created.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.690
Seventy years later with the
collapse of the Communist Party

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.200
in the Soviet Union, we
saw an absolute revival

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.230
of things absolutely
suppressed for 70 years.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.530
The church.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:48.900
The iconic, Russian
construction styles.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:53.150
The reverence for the
monarchy of the past.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.390
Certainly, the past always
carries with it a lot of baggage,

00:54:55.390 --> 00:55:01.040
but it also, as does
our individual history,

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.700
we have the good and
the bad within us.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.350
And, but it's ours.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:08.640 position:56%
And that's the most important thing.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.900
So, I think that we -- you know,

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:15.750
we've seen a 43-year interregnum
thus far, but that doesn't mean

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:19.750
that Ethiopians have forgotten
or will forget there's a --

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:25.430
I know there's concern that
young Ethiopians in the diaspora

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.340
and in the country,
will have no experience

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.480
or understanding of their history.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:36.460
The same applied to Iran,
since the coup of '78-'79.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:41.100 position:56%
The reality there is that today, in
Iran, we see a flourishing of the --

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:47.150 position:56%
the main form of protest is the
printing of the most elaborate books

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:51.500
of poetry by [foreign
name] and the like.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.510
The most lavish -- the tributes
being paid to the Persian-ness

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.000
of the history, and the
only way they can do it is

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.190
to make books printed with
gold ink and the like.

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.280
I mean, it's anything they can
do to show this reverence though

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.870
for their past, because they
can't express it in an opposition

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.240
to the current [inaudible]
leadership there.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.910
And it gets the point of --

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:23.710 position:56%
[inaudible] made the point about the
enemy of the emperor, enemies were,

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:25.270
[foreign name] and [foreign name].

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:31.490
And to a degree, that's
true, but they -- it was --

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:38.700
it's like saying that
atheism is a disbelief in God.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.810
But it in fact, Atheism becomes its
own religion, and the opposition

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:46.280
to the emperor, became
its own religion,

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.450
almost validating the emperor
if you like, because they set --

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:55.400
their standards were set up as
to being opposed to the emperor,

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.610
which meant that the society
itself would ultimately come

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.740
to compare the two.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.650
And what we're seeing today, in
-- with the Ethiopian government,

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.170
is for the first time,
we're seeing this opening

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:14.140
up to Ethiopia's history,
and the government is seeing

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.040 position:56%
that this has some healing benefits.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:21.470
So, this is why when we raised
the issue of creating a --

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:26.520
the Haile Selassie I Library
and Conference Center,

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.520
several government officials
have commented favorably.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.330
And one said, "Oh, I think we can
find land to donate for that."

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:37.840
Well, this is a profound
transformation of attitudes

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.610
because we have to bear in mind
that the present government

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:46.680
which was opposed [inaudible] being
as an opposition force to the Derg,

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.980
was itself Marxist in origin.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.520
And so, it's been gradually coming
back to a sense of nationalism

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.030
in the best sense, in the sense
of creating an Ethiopia based

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.450
on Ethiopians rather

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:05.500
than on unnecessarily
important political models.

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.460
I think this, as with any society,
it's always got a long way to go.

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:14.550
When you look at the United
States, how difficult it was

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:20.160
to progress the idea of a
truly United States nation,

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:27.690
and it really started to occur with
the war with the British in 1812,

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:33.190
some you know, considerable
period after the 1776 Revolution.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:40.040
So, we may get impatient for
Ethiopia to rebuild its glory,

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.900
and the Ethiopians are
justifiably impatient by,

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.170
we can see it happening
and we can see

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:50.150
that the diaspora played
a critical role in that,

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.930 position:56%
the Caribbean particularly and the
creation of the [inaudible] religion

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:59.360
which I know is a source of some
bewilderment and embarrassment to,

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.630
the to the emperor whose
a devout Christian and one

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:08.950
of his great successes of course
is that Bob Marley in his love

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:12.450
for the emperor, converted to
Christianity on his death bed.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:19.480
So, and now we see the [foreign
name] religion also coming

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.830
through an accommodation
with the Orthodox Church.

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:28.400
So, it's becoming an
interesting evolution, but the --

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.230
without the [foreign name],
I think a lot of the history

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:38.790
and iconography, the actual books
and symbols of the Imperial Period,

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:41.360
might well have been lost.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.660
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh: Thank you.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.620
I know there are several questions,
but I think you can talk to Gregory

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:51.510
at the reception, and
we'll stop right here.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:58.400
[ Applause ]

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.040
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
