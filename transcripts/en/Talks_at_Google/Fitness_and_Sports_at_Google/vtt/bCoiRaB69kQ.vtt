[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.262
SPEAKER: I don't know how
much you know about these two

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:10.470
ladies, but I'll give you
a little bit of background,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.481
and then we'll jump
straight into questions.

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.775
So Pin Xiu is famous
for her backstroke,

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:22.826
and recently won more than one
gold medal at the Paralympics.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.292
And I think you've won
three in total, right?

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:26.000
YIP PIN XIU: Yep.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.583
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:30.360
And then Theresa is famous
for her breaststroke--

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.670
holds many world records.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.420
THERESA GOH: Held.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.378
SPEAKER: Two-- or held.

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:39.129
Sorry-- and won a bronze medal
at the most recent Olympics.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:39.975
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.558
YIP PIN XIU: I think she's more
in love with her cats, though.

00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.390
SPEAKER: Tell me
more about that?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.180
YIP PIN XIU: She
has too many cats.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.080
Is three too many?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.510
SPEAKER: Three is not too many.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.103
I did see your cats.

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:53.089
Yes.

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.560
I watched a couple of
videos, doing some research.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.819
They're very cute.

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.944
Do you want to tell us a
little bit about your cats

00:00:59.944 --> 00:01:01.319
before we jump
into the swimming?

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:02.376
THERESA GOH: Not really.

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:04.786
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:09.606
I have three cats, and
they are all adopted.

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:10.580
And yeah.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.795
I want some more.

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:14.838
SPEAKER: Do you
have room for more?

00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:17.168
THERESA GOH: There's
always room for more.

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:20.270
SPEAKER: OK, so as I
said, we are so honored

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.010
to have you here today.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.530
And I think maybe a
good place to start

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.230
is if you could tell us about
where your passion for swimming

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.545
came from.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:30.475
THERESA GOH: Hm.

00:01:30.475 --> 00:01:35.620
Well, I started when
I was about five.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.100
And that was just for fun in
the public pools in my family.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.970
I think it's a very common
thing for families to go

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.474
and swim every weekend
at the nearby pool.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:52.502
And that was the
same for my family.

00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:57.105
And it graduated to something
more when I was about 12.

00:01:57.105 --> 00:01:59.400
And a volunteer from the
Singapore Disability Sports

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.510
Council sponsored me
swimming with my dad in pool.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.991
I think she has potential.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.990
Why don't you bring her
to the upcoming swimming

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.315
championships that's coming
up and see how she does?

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:15.478
So he did that, and
I did pretty well.

00:02:15.478 --> 00:02:18.984
And I joined a swimming
program after that

00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:23.904
and got into the
competitive swimming at 12,

00:02:23.904 --> 00:02:28.458
and really progressed
from there.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.699
YIP PIN XIU: Are you saying
my story or our stories

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.446
are exactly the same?

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:32.442
SPEAKER: I'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:32.940
YIP PIN XIU: OK.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.138
That's right.

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:34.434
I have to repeat myself.

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:36.190
It's pretty much-- yeah.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.398
I have two elder brothers,
so I was swimming with them.

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:41.370
And then I got really
bored at the baby pool

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.328
so I asked my mom if
I could join them.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.293
And she asked the coach.

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:46.793
Yeah.

00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:49.258
So that's how I
started swimming.

00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.230
But everything else is the same.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.216
THERESA GOH: Similar.

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.188
Same thing, but different.

00:02:54.188 --> 00:02:57.240
SPEAKER: So it's the family
that inspired the first passion.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.180
And then you were spotted
and your mom inquired.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.846
YIP PIN XIU: No.

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:02.849
I was sponsored as well.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.390
SPEAKER: Oh, you
were both sponsored.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.808
OK.

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:05.644
YIP PIN XIU: That's how, yeah.

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:06.480
SPEAKER: Do you want to
talk about that journey,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.900
then, in terms of what brought
you to the Paralympics swim

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.595
team?

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:12.880
So how did you end up
representing Singapore?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.590
THERESA GOH: Sponsored from 12.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.840
And you make small goals
towards bigger goal.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.007
And for us, or for me, it
was just getting better

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.276
than the previous competition.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:31.150
So it just makes
more improvements.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.540
And I didn't really,
like, set out

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.300
to want to get to
the Paralympics.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.490
It wasn't a main goal for me.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.964
It seemed really
far at the time.

00:03:40.964 --> 00:03:45.070
But, yeah, so I just
made little goals

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.718
towards getting
faster and faster.

00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:51.276
And before I knew it,
I was at [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:53.650
YIP PIN XIU: When she was
[INAUDIBLE], I just [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.150
for me.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.330
OK, after the
competition, they asked

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.598
if I wanted to join
the elite team.

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:05.412
And so we started
with the elite team.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.370
Initially, training was
just four times a week.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.140
But I remember my
very first lesson.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.767
I was sleeping right in the
car when my dad picked me

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:14.465
up and sent me back.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:17.264
But it started off tiring.

00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:19.680
And eventually, we are going
to become 12 sessions a week,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.553
15 sessions a week before the
Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games.

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:31.345
So I think that was also
how we eventually worked

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:32.880
our way to the Paralympics.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.010
It's just through
being very consistent,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.440
consistent training,
and always wanting

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.890
to better my previous times.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.960
THERESA GOH: And it was quite
a jump, I felt like, from--

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.418
I used to train
three times a week.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:49.138
And every session would
have a different coach

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:53.034
because at the time it
was all volunteer coaches.

00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:56.510
And from jumping from that
to 12, 15 sessions a week

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.510
was not fun.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.010
It was exhausting.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.616
And there were a lot of
things that suddenly you

00:05:01.616 --> 00:05:03.884
felt like I have no time for.

00:05:03.884 --> 00:05:08.744
But you also see the need
to do that because, frankly,

00:05:08.744 --> 00:05:13.138
everyone else is doing
the same kind of sessions.

00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.573
And if you want to keep up
or you want to be better,

00:05:15.573 --> 00:05:18.330
you have to at least do
the same [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.060
Yeah.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.768
SPEAKER: So one of
the motivating factors

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.070
for both of you was
making sure that you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.530
were improving your time
over and over again, right,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.710
which led to more sessions and
further fueling your passion

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.510
to beat the previous record.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.080
YIP PIN XIU: Initially,
it started more as extreme

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.747
self-motivation.

00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:36.788
So I'd been training
because my parents had been,

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:39.230
or I'd been training because
the coach was expecting me.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.320
I'd been training
because of something.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.510
But eventually,
after many years,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.510
it started to be interesting.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.845
It was, I wanted to train
because I wanted to improve.

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:51.210
I wanted to do something better.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.665
Yeah.

00:05:51.665 --> 00:05:53.498
SPEAKER: So what are
some of the highlights,

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:57.361
then, because both of you
have been to and represented

00:05:57.361 --> 00:05:58.985
Singapore in more
than one Paralympics.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:02.654
So can you talk us through
some of the highlights?

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.100
YIP PIN XIU: I remember Beijing.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.960
Beijing was probably my most--

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.530
because before Rio, Beijing
was my most memorable games.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.530
I was pretty young then.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.338
I was 16 years old.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:15.750
And then I've been to other
international competitions,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.250
but nothing is like the Olympic
and the Paralympic Village.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.190
Maybe I can-- it's almost like--

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.155
it's the Google offices.

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:27.480
But the Olympics
is like Google--

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.880
THERESA GOH: It has everything.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.210
YIP PIN XIU: Everything.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.668
THERESA GOH: There's
a post office.

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:34.288
There's a--

00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:36.204
YIP PIN XIU: There are
food stands everywhere.

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:38.874
There's-- yoga is somewhere,
coffee everywhere.

00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:39.790
SPEAKER: You're right.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.925
That sounds like Google.

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:45.230
YIP PIN XIU: And it's
a mixture of everybody

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.300
who has worked their hardest
to get to where they are.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.460
It's very nice being in a place
with like-minded individuals.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.026
And everybody just wants to
go there to compete and also

00:06:57.026 --> 00:06:59.406
to make--

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:01.364
THERESA GOH: It's just
an experience in itself,

00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:02.600
to be honest.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.240
First of all, I don't know
another place that I can go

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.656
and I see everybody else
who has a disability.

00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:12.500
And not just a disability,
but everyone else

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.273
is an elite athlete.

00:07:14.273 --> 00:07:18.452
It's a very unique
situation that I don't find

00:07:18.452 --> 00:07:21.398
many other places you know?

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:25.970
And it's a real
privilege to be there.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.880
And you feel that
the atmosphere,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.943
it's not tense or
really competitive

00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:33.680
unless it's in a
pool or competition.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.180
But--

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.660
YIP PIN XIU: Friendly.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.410
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.506
It's friendly and
normal, basically.

00:07:39.506 --> 00:07:40.895
YIP PIN XIU: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.284
THERESA GOH: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:42.284 --> 00:07:44.412
A little bit, right?

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:45.870
SPEAKER: So the
highlight is really

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.145
just being there and
soaking up the atmosphere,

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:52.940
and, as you say, being
surrounded by other athletes.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.406
And not even just
athletes, but--

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:55.447
YIP PIN XIU: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.447 --> 00:07:56.836
SPEAKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:58.650
YIP PIN XIU: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.976
No, but other highlights
would also be-- for me,

00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:04.926
it would be knowing that I was
part of the Paralympic movement

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:08.216
in Singapore, where it
started off as being-- we

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:12.840
started off as being in the home
section of the papers, not even

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.562
in the sports section.

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:16.020
And slowly, eventually
Singaporeans

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.580
began to recognize
that what we were doing

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.330
should also be under sports.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.012
And then after Beijing,
after the wins,

00:08:24.012 --> 00:08:25.470
then we got a bit
more recognition.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.084
And then last year, with the
ASEAN Para Games and this year

00:08:28.084 --> 00:08:28.642
with Rio.

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:29.725
So we did come a long way.

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:31.410
People in the streets
now understand

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.510
what is the Paralympics.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.353
They know what para sports is.

00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:40.080
And I think we are both very
grateful to be a part of this.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.750
SPEAKER: So you've moved from
local to front-page news.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.250
THERESA GOH: We're
not-- we're not--

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.860
SPEAKER: Sponsors are
being [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.150
It really is, the fact that
everybody knows your name,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.132
right?

00:08:51.132 --> 00:08:55.356
YIP PIN XIU: Sometimes people
call me Theresa, and she gets

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:56.599
called Pin Xiu.

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:57.610
SPEAKER: Why?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.140
THERESA GOH: No, but
it's really something

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.093
to see yourself in
the sports section

00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:05.593
compared to seeing yourself in
the home section, because you

00:09:05.593 --> 00:09:06.093
feel like--

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:07.195
I mean, I felt--

00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:08.486
at the time, I was still young.

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:10.735
So I thought, oh, that's
nice I make it in the papers.

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:12.590
It doesn't matter
where they put me.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.060
But you realize that there's
a significant importance

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.826
in correctly labeling it.

00:09:16.826 --> 00:09:18.576
Because if you put us
in the home section,

00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:20.770
people don't really think
we are sports, you know.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.160
And gradually, finally
acknowledging the fact

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.344
that we are sports, we
are considered sports.

00:09:28.344 --> 00:09:29.260
YIP PIN XIU: Athletes.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.566
THERESA GOH: Athletes, yeah.

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:32.190
SPEAKER: And what
was it, do you think,

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.410
that changed so that
that relabelling,

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.426
the use of the right words,
calling you athletes?

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:42.384
THERESA GOH: It was different
people working together.

00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:49.514
I didn't feel like it was
really the reporters' fault.

00:09:49.514 --> 00:09:52.655
It was more like
maybe the editors,

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.635
knowing you shouldn't
put them there.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.593
They don't belong there
or something, you know.

00:09:56.593 --> 00:09:57.196
It's a chain.

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.875
And sometimes it just
works out that way

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.250
that some people don't believe
that you know who you are.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.930
And it took a lot of hard
work from both sides.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.659
We had to prove our results.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:12.780
And all of our teammates
and other reporters

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.280
were there also pushing
our stories out,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.160
those who believed in us, also.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.937
It was a relative
effort, I think.

00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:21.520
YIP PIN XIU: That
was a long time ago.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.711
I was in a restaurant.

00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:26.798
I was reading the papers.

00:10:26.798 --> 00:10:30.190
SPEAKER: So are there any
lessons or discoveries

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.442
that you learned about
yourself along the way?

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:36.660
YIP PIN XIU: Not many.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.535
I feel like who I am is
actually because of swimming.

00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:44.640
And swimming has given me
everything good in my life.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.380
But I've learned a lot.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.656
I've gained a big group of
my friends through sports.

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:53.820
But I think this year
itself has taught

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.890
me to really trust the process.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.499
And it's not that I
wasn't that confident,

00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:00.665
because I felt that, even
though I was really doing,

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:04.425
like, 12 sessions, I still felt
like I was not training enough.

00:11:04.425 --> 00:11:07.640
And I think it was just a
kind of psychological pressure

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.830
on myself, because
for some people

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.750
no matter how much you
do is never enough.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.905
And sometimes I felt like that.

00:11:14.905 --> 00:11:16.970
So it was important
for me along the way

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.460
to learn how to trust
myself, trust my coach,

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.450
trust what we were
doing, and just train

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.608
and don't worry
about anything else.

00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:26.441
So I think that was one
of the main points I

00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:27.930
learned this year.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.518
THERESA GOH: I learned the
same kind of thing, really--

00:11:31.518 --> 00:11:33.190
YIP PIN XIU: Copycat.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.665
THERESA GOH: --trusting
and believing,

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:39.780
I think, in myself mostly.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:45.916
Because the trust I placed in
the team was already there.

00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:50.260
I always left it to
the team to lead me.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.400
And the part that was missing
was my trust in myself,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.480
believing in myself.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.880
That was missing.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.520
So a little bit of background.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.070
I was in Athens,
Beijing, London, and Rio.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.080
And in Beijing, I
narrowly missed the bronze

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.630
by 0.7 seconds.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.901
And that was my world came
crashing down, kind of.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.026
SPEAKER: [DESCENDING SOUND]

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:16.820
THERESA GOH: It was really bad.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.700
Yeah.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.710
And that was one of
the milestones that

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.830
really shook my confidence.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.463
And I had a really hard
time recovering from that

00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:31.080
and building
confidence from that.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.580
And-- but that was
also the period

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.205
where I learned to
change my mindset,

00:12:38.205 --> 00:12:44.570
and going to what's
more happiness.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.655
So before that, I was
very focused on just going

00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:52.710
training, and going with
flow, and not really--

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.500
and just pushing
beyond, and not really

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.471
caring about whether it
made me happy or not.

00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.490
And then after Beijing, I
realized that I wasn't as happy

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.590
as I could be.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.450
And so I changed my
mindset to do things

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.816
because I wanted to do it and
more to what makes me happy.

00:13:11.816 --> 00:13:15.213
And that, while it
made me happier,

00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:17.628
it didn't allow
me to swim faster.

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:20.000
So there's always that,
striking a balance between what

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.710
makes you happy, but
what makes you better.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.060
And for me, that was what
I learned in the past eight

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.290
years, slowly building
confidence and believing

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.076
in myself again.

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:31.750
Yeah.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.611
SPEAKER: And after Beijing, you
took about a year off, right?

00:13:34.611 --> 00:13:36.415
THERESA GOH: Yeah,
about nine months.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.479
I went to power
lifting to try it out.

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:39.770
SPEAKER: To try something else?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.840
THERESA GOH: Yeah,
try a new sport.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.515
SPEAKER: And what is it, do
you think, that kind of change

00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:49.140
that said, OK, I can
go back to swimming?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.405
And I now am
confident in myself?

00:13:54.405 --> 00:13:56.446
THERESA GOH: At that time,
it wasn't really still

00:13:56.446 --> 00:13:57.029
at that point.

00:13:57.029 --> 00:14:00.830
But it was the fact that, after
nine months, I was at a point

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.610
where I needed to decide whether
to go back to swimming or not.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.710
And if I wanted to
go back to swimming,

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.600
I had to give up power lifting
because power lifting would

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.380
make me too heavy for swimming.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.550
So I had to give up
one or the other.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.972
And so I was thinking power
lifting made me quite happy,

00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:19.180
and it was a new environment.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.420
And I hadn't been
in a new environment

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.360
because I felt that swimming
was very negative atmosphere

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.280
to be in at the moment
when I first left Beijing.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.570
So after nine
months-- it took time

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:37.150
to get the positive
back in my life.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.320
And once I felt
like I was ready,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.630
I had to make the decision
whether to go back to swimming,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.090
And I felt like that I had
more to give to swimming

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:52.070
and I felt like it was time
to give it another shot.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.750
SPEAKER: So in all the
articles I read, it always

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.420
talks about your parents.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.500
And they seem to have been
very supportive in both cases.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.600
Do you want to tell
us more about how

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.570
they fuel your passion for
swimming and what you do?

00:15:10.354 --> 00:15:17.630
YIP PIN XIU: Personally, for me,
I think I work a different way.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.297
I work [INAUDIBLE] micromanage
what I do every day.

00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:23.880
So what they did to support me
was they just took a step back,

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.880
and they trusted me to do
whatever I wanted to do.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.480
So I was in secondary
school at the time.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.750
And honestly, already I
wasn't a very good student.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.811
But they didn't nag at me.

00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:37.569
They didn't force
me to have to study,

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.360
even though such a
large emphasis is placed

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.400
on education in Singapore.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.490
They gave me the freedom of
choice to choose to swim more.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.104
And they understood that
the Paralympics only

00:15:50.104 --> 00:15:52.020
comes every four years,
whereas I could study,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.660
if I felt at all levels,
which I didn't, I could always

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.500
redo it the year after.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:05.545
So for them, really, it was
just actually being there

00:16:05.545 --> 00:16:08.900
and agreeing with my decisions.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.310
THERESA GOH: For me,
we are different people

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.094
because I need the push.

00:16:14.094 --> 00:16:16.530
I'm a little bit less motivated.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.490
So my parents had
to push to training

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.220
and make sure that I get there.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.420
But for me, the easiest part
comes after I leave the house.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.545
So they have to wake
me up, and then--

00:16:25.545 --> 00:16:27.170
YIP PIN XIU: They
have to kick you out.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.630
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.171
They have to get me
out of the house.

00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:31.174
And once I'm out, I'm fine.

00:16:31.174 --> 00:16:35.040
And my dad always send me
to training in the mornings

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.980
and picks me up after that.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.243
So when I go to
trainings at 6:30,

00:16:39.243 --> 00:16:42.780
he would drop me off at the pool
and then jog around the pool.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.584
So it was a team effort.

00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:48.350
So I helped him exercise, and
he helped me get the training.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.730
And it was routine.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.270
So I work well with routine.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.808
So I just kept with that
routine for a while.

00:16:54.808 --> 00:16:57.290
And my mom was always there.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.890
And when I got home,
there was always

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.430
food on the table,
and healthy options.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:07.069
And yeah, I think just generally
also being there for me.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:11.700
And they also really
supported my decisions.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.359
I went to [INAUDIBLE]
after secondary school

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.440
for a semester.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.829
But I had made a decision
to quit school after that

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.180
to focus on full-time training.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.510
So that's also
something that I think

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.319
a lot of the
parents in Singapore

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.360
may not necessarily agree
with because of the education

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.170
system.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.930
But they trusted me and allowed
me to make my own decisions.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.910
And yeah.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:42.012
They allowed me to be as
independent as I can be.

00:17:42.012 --> 00:17:44.220
SPEAKER: Now as the audience
here is little Googlers,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.920
I wanted to switch gears a
little bit before handing it

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.690
out to the audience
to ask questions.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.500
So in terms of
technology, are there

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.765
any types of assisted
technology that you

00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:56.910
use to make your
day-to-day lives easier?

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.610
THERESA GOH: I actually
like to use Google Maps.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.967
One of the things
that, especially when

00:18:05.967 --> 00:18:09.370
you think about accessibility
in Singapore-- one of the things

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.080
that I do maybe different from
people, able-bodied people,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.310
is that when I go
to a new place,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.270
I Google Map the location.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.122
And then I go to
satellite view, and then

00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:20.820
I zoom all the way in so I
can see if it's accessible.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.260
So that helps a lot.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.680
I wish it was everywhere.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.550
Even inside buildings,
taking a 3D tour of a place,

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.770
that would help a lot
of people because it's

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.160
really hard sometimes
to define accessibility

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.380
for different people.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.010
So for me, what
might be accessible

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.010
may not be accessible
for someone else.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.330
So it's clear when you
can see it, you know.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.612
And so I like Google
Maps satellite.

00:18:48.612 --> 00:18:52.210
YIP PIN XIU: I think for
me, sometimes I don't--

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.330
because my hands
are a big klutz-- so

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.860
I don't really type properly.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.735
So what's good for me
is the voice functions.

00:18:59.735 --> 00:19:02.705
But I think sometimes it doesn't
understand a Singapore accent

00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:03.690
as well.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.487
SPEAKER: Don't worry.

00:19:04.487 --> 00:19:06.170
It doesn't understand
my accent either.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.985
YIP PIN XIU: So I
really have to text me,

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:10.625
text me, text me
during the Games.

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:11.130
Yeah.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.080
SPEAKER: I think we
definitely need to train

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.300
this on a few more accents.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.800
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.280
I think the world
has changed so much.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.440
It's made it a lot more
accessible for swimming pool.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.039
YIP PIN XIU: And
technology is really good.

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:29.330
THERESA GOH: And it was in Rio.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.430
Was it Rio?

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.855
We saw this
technology on a phone

00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:38.450
where you can use your
eyes or something.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.504
They can track your eyes.

00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:41.880
SPEAKER: Yeah-- retina.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.205
THERESA GOH: For those
who cannot use their hands

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:46.155
or-- yeah.

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.590
YIP PIN XIU: And I
really like the dinosaur

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.425
whenever there is no internet.

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.405
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.405 --> 00:19:55.890
The space bar one.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.036
SPEAKER: So what do the next 12
months have in store for you?

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:04.585
YIP PIN XIU: I took a year
off to train full time.

00:20:04.585 --> 00:20:05.960
So I'll be heading
back to school

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.634
in January for four
or five months.

00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:12.455
Then in the meantime, I
will still be training.

00:20:12.455 --> 00:20:16.130
But I probably wouldn't
be going full-time work.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.570
Then once I graduate, I will
start training full time.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.330
And we have ASEAN Para Games
and world champs next year.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.901
So it's still back to the pool.

00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:28.400
THERESA GOH: Yeah,
back to the pool.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.860
No school for me.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.840
SPEAKER: Just training,
training, training.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.325
YIP PIN XIU: You do my homework.

00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:36.310
THERESA GOH: Do
you want to fail?

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.560
I probably will go back to
swimming for a couple years.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.220
But Tokyo is still unsure yet.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:45.720
SPEAKER: OK.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.920
So I'm going to open
it up now to the floor.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.616
If anyone has any
questions, do come up.

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.800
YIP PIN XIU: You
can ask anything.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming in.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.200
I've got a two-part question.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.010
Firstly, how would you rate
Singapore as an accessible

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.980
city as a wheelchair user?

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.370
Obviously, there's newer parts,
new buildings like this one,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.134
which are designed with
accessibility in mind.

00:21:11.134 --> 00:21:13.050
But then there's parts
of town like Chinatown,

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.720
which I can imagine must
be hard to get around.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.760
And then the second
part of the question

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.270
is-- you've been
fortunate to travel around

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.320
the world to compete.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.980
How does Singapore rank
against other cities in terms

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.110
of accessibility, and
which city would you

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:29.520
say is top of the list?

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.656
YIP PIN XIU: What
would you rank it?

00:21:33.656 --> 00:21:35.820
THERESA GOH: I would say
it's actually not so bad.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.403
I don't know whether
it is because I'm

00:21:37.403 --> 00:21:42.730
familiar with the country
and how to get around.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.670
YIP PIN XIU: I give it a 7.75.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.841
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:46.715
That's very specific.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.270
I would say it's about there.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.800
Yeah.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.755
It's not so bad.

00:21:53.755 --> 00:21:58.660
I've traveled alone to
London and around UK.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.950
And we once traveled together
with some friends to Australia.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.250
And I always thought
Australia was really good,

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.240
because in some of the
national parks where

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.100
I wouldn't expect clean,
accessible toilet, they had it.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.185
And it was really clean.

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:20.060
And for me, for everybody,
being able to go to the washroom

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.460
is a basic necessity.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.860
And for me, it is
just that extra thing

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.910
about worrying
whether it's clean,

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.360
whether it's accessible,
whether there's someone inside,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:29.940
whether--

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.000
there's so many things--
and whether there's

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.120
one available at all.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.604
And sometimes you have to be
a bit creative with toilet

00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:39.930
situations.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.710
But Singapore's not bad,
especially the transport

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.500
system.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.821
MRT is really accessible.

00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:47.112
YIP PIN XIU: And we think
[INAUDIBLE] where I'm getting

00:22:47.112 --> 00:22:47.956
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:47.956 --> 00:22:50.540
On weekends.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.230
THERESA GOH: UK is really good.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.210
The tram's not very accessible.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.320
But they have options.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.650
You can call for assistance
and stuff like that.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.162
There's still no perfect
country that I've been to.

00:23:04.162 --> 00:23:06.530
Singapore, honestly,
comes pretty close.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:12.080
But it's because I am
probably used to it.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.020
YIP PIN XIU: In places
where we're used to it,

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.380
it's quite good.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.960
But 10 minus 7.75,
whatever that's missing,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.690
I think it comes form the
older places, like Chinatown,

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:30.470
[INAUDIBLE], and just some
areas where the steps are not--

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.210
from the bare eye,
you can't really tell.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.459
But if you sit on a wheelchair,
and it hits something,

00:23:34.459 --> 00:23:35.720
you might fall over.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.790
So I would say we're
actually pretty good.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.520
It's just the
smallest of things.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.790
And yeah-- the
trains are very good.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.190
All the trains have lifts.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.160
Buses have ramps.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.200
I don't like trains.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.320
That's another
thing I don't like.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:51.819
Yeah.

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:53.445
We get caught in trains as well.

00:23:53.445 --> 00:23:56.415
THERESA GOH: The [INAUDIBLE]--
what do you call it?

00:23:56.415 --> 00:23:57.900
The holes in the drainage.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.485
Yeah.

00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:00.193
So sometimes our wheels
are really small.

00:24:00.193 --> 00:24:01.066
They get stuck.

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:05.610
YIP PIN XIU: But the last
we went to Pasadena in 2014,

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.870
I thought that it
was really good.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.330
Everything had
wheelchair accessibility.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.570
But I'm not sure about it now.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.630
THERESA GOH: There's still
accessibility for us,

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.810
and still certain
types of accessibility

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.116
for maybe someone on a motorized
chair might be different.

00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:23.140
And we are lucky.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.770
We are mobile.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.760
We can get in and out of
our chairs quite easily.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.040
But from our perspective,
it's pretty OK.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.540
YIP PIN XIU: Do you
think driverless

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.880
technology will become
mainstream soon in your car?

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.090
SPEAKER: I hope so
because I don't drive.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.030
YIP PIN XIU: Neither.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.000
We need assistive
driving devices.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.500
SPEAKER: I've been
telling my family

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.418
for years I'm waiting
for driverless cars.

00:24:49.418 --> 00:24:50.912
THERESA GOH: I would use that.

00:24:50.912 --> 00:24:51.747
YIP PIN XIU: Yeah.

00:24:51.747 --> 00:24:53.830
AUDIENCE: So how much do
you think your disability

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.900
influenced the
path that you took

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.170
and your passion for swimming
and where you are now?

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.330
THERESA GOH: I think if I was
not born with a disability,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.420
I probably wouldn't have
come down this path, which

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.060
is why I also like to say that
I'm thankful for my disability

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.780
because it's opened so many
doors that may not have been

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.080
opened for me if I was not
a person in a wheelchair

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.547
or a person with a disability.

00:25:19.547 --> 00:25:21.850
YIP PIN XIU: I think about it--

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.870
if I was not disabled, would
I still be doing sports?

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.380
And I think yes, but maybe not
swimming, maybe something else.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.190
I feel I'm a very active
person and competitive person

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.480
by nature.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.430
So I do enjoy sports.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.900
But maybe I would just
be in national level,

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.109
as in not international.

00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:43.400
Like school level or something.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.540
But I probably
wouldn't get this far.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.210
AUDIENCE: I have two follow-up
questions for each one of you.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.585
First, for you,
I liked the story

00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:53.170
about the happiness and Beijing.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.420
So what did you feel when
you then eventually won

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.439
the next medal?

00:25:56.439 --> 00:25:56.980
How was that?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.896
What was that feeling?

00:25:57.896 --> 00:26:00.360
Can you describe that?

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.350
THERESA GOH: Disbelief,
but mostly relief.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:11.080
And throughout the whole
race when I was swimming it,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.800
I knew that at any
time, if I had given up,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.630
it would have been over.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.090
But it was just
that fact that there

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.680
was that importance of not--

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.960
of holding on throughout
the whole race,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.380
and not giving up at any part
that really stuck in my mind

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.260
and was so important
because I just

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.740
know how close I think
the next person was.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.617
And a slip-up for me would have
meant Beijing all over again.

00:26:39.617 --> 00:26:40.930
Yeah.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.864
But when I touched the wall,
it was disbelief and relief.

00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:46.530
AUDIENCE: Sorry for
the stupid question,

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.710
but I'm not a
competitive swimmer.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.876
So when you touch the wall,
you directly know that--

00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:50.680
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.892
It's on the wall, the time.

00:26:52.892 --> 00:26:54.266
AUDIENCE: Oh,
that's pretty cool.

00:26:54.266 --> 00:26:54.850
THERESA GOH: Oh, yeah.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.180
It is.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:55.600
Oh, yeah.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.960
I didn't know when I touched it.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.390
I just look at the clock.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.750
AUDIENCE: Oh, I though
that when you touch it,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.406
it buzzes, and that means
you won or something.

00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:05.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:05.364 --> 00:27:06.280
SPEAKER: Two requests.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.154
AUDIENCE: Look at me.

00:27:07.154 --> 00:27:09.020
I'm not competitive
or sporty so--

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.395
YIP PIN XIU: Maybe
she could tell

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:12.600
that she won based on all
of us shouting, like ahh!

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.420
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.990
I could hear everybody.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.720
AUDIENCE: And for you, you
spoke about the newspapers

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.930
and the journey from the
local pages to the front page.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.290
So how do you use that
front-page popularity

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.306
now outside of sports,
or maybe outside of--

00:27:29.306 --> 00:27:32.700
is it really just to maybe make
other people aware of things?

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.475
Do you-- I don't know.

00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:36.100
You come here,
obviously, but what else

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.149
do you do around that?

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:39.190
YIP PIN XIU: I like to
say with great power comes

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.900
great responsibility.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.525
So we're very--

00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:42.566
THERESA GOH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:42.566 --> 00:27:43.390
YIP PIN XIU: What?

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:43.610
THERESA GOH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:44.074
YIP PIN XIU: Oh, sorry.

00:27:44.074 --> 00:27:45.466
[INAUDIBLE] spoken about, yeah.

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:48.250
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.230
So we-- I can't get
my thoughts together.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.560
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.760
And now, we are--

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.830
not just myself,
but Theresa also.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:04.780
I think as athletes, one
of our most important role

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.530
is to produce results,
because only with results will

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.150
other people join our
fight, to fight with us

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.370
when it comes to things like
inequality or other things.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.460
When we get results,
then we are in the news,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.520
and people see that there
are gaps in the community

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.130
and try to bridge it.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.570
So we, on the other
hand, after the results,

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.966
we will try to join
them in this fight.

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:30.856
Not like it's a fight.

00:28:30.856 --> 00:28:35.000
But we try to join them
to promote more awareness,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.610
to go to talks, and to--

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.260
well, I wouldn't exactly
call us inspirational,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.412
but try to impact people with
our stories, and just to--

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.800
SPEAKER: All of us would
call it inspirational.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.220
THERESA GOH: Thank you.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.540
[CLAPPING]

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.510
You both talked
about how important

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:06.730
it was throughout your journey,
two such great achievements,

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.360
and to be self-motivated.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.000
And I just wondered
how different does it

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.630
feel to beat a world
record and then

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.650
to beat your own world record?

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.420
YIP PIN XIU: What if my own
record is the world record?

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.830
AUDIENCE: But how different was
that, beating your own world

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.920
record at Rio this year?

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.450
How different did
that feel to you

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.490
when you set the record
in the first place,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.990
when you beat someone
else's record?

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:39.140
YIP PIN XIU: I think getting
a better timing is always

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.490
a joy regardless
of whatever I got.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.030
So as long as the
timing that I did today

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:49.350
is better than what I did a
couple months ago, I'm happy.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.160
I'm terribly happy.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.430
THERESA GOH: It is a
different feeling when

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.170
you break a world
record and then you

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.240
break your personal best.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.880
At the time when I was
breaking world records--

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.730
not anymore, but in the past--

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.270
it was not really something
that I was focused on.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.180
So it was just like--
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.020
I broke a world record.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.530
But it was more of the
fact that I was getting

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.540
faster that I was happy about.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.420
And then the world record
just came naturally, I guess.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:28.340
Like, even in Rio, when I
saw my finals, or my heats,

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.240
it was the fastest
I've swam ever.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.520
So it was my personal best.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.980
I didn't break a world record.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.970
But I was four seconds faster
than my last personal best

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.470
time.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.840
And that was better
than any of the world

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.120
records I've ever gotten.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.024
Because it was many years
of not getting faster.

00:30:44.024 --> 00:30:46.190
And then finally getting
four seconds off like that,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.695
it's quite a great feeling.

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:51.320
AUDIENCE: First and
foremost, thank you

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.680
for what you have
done for our country.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.970
You put it on a world map.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.160
It's all their effort.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.640
But we as a nation get
to share your glory.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.930
So thank you for that.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.310
Secondly, the team is
about accessibility.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.474
But I think--

00:31:05.474 --> 00:31:06.890
I don't know about
everyone here--

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.820
but this is my first time
in a room with athletes

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.710
that are at the
top of their game,

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.680
and beating world records,
winning gold medals.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.820
So could you give us
a feel of that access

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.380
into when you were competing
for the very first time,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.130
and you entered a pool, or
you entered an arena where

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.730
you are competing with the
top, top athletes in the world?

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.650
That feeling that you had,
how did you motivate yourself?

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.380
How did you tell yourself versus
the last time when you went

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.780
over there in true confidence?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.330
What is it that for mentally
you prepare yourself

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.740
so it's not just
a physical thing

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:43.700
but more of like your
mental preparation?

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.310
YIP PIN XIU: So the
first games [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.660
So I was reminded of
this by my psychologist

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.940
like, maybe, two years ago.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.600
So I was telling her
that I'm not sure

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.450
if I can do it because so
many things have happened

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.010
since Beijing, so many ups
and downs and good things

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.140
and bad things that I didn't
know if I was able to.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.710
But then she told me to
just go into my final race

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.574
with the mentality that
I had in my first race.

00:32:13.574 --> 00:32:14.990
So for the very
first race, I just

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.775
wanted to go in and do my best.

00:32:16.775 --> 00:32:19.580
In the recent three
races, I've just

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.680
been worried about
whether I can do it,

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.150
whether I can get
a better timing.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.550
It's just a lot of worry.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.522
And so she told me to bring
it back to when I first

00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:30.980
started, because
that's when people

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.860
race the best, when they have no
worries, when they're relaxed.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.380
And I needed to adopt
that kind of mindset

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.070
into my final race
in order for it

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.010
to translate into better
physical movements as well.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.690
So the psychological
and physical part

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.300
is very linked even though
we don't really see.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.300
But I don't know how.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.320
It's like magic.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.870
But if I'm too
excited before a race,

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.000
my race really
wouldn't turn out good.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.650
So it's really to--

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.480
she said this phrase
in Chinese is like--

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.270
[CHINESE]

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.450
So now, regardless of why it is,
a mountain is still a mountain,

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.916
the water is still water.

00:33:09.916 --> 00:33:12.260
So swimming pool is
still a swimming pool.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.000
Just go in and do
your very best.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.540
And that's how I went
in on my final race.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.360
Yeah.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.420
THERESA GOH: My most latest
racing in 100 breaststroke,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.790
it felt so--

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.930
well, it was different
from any other race

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.360
I've swam in because I
felt the most relaxed ever.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.830
So before, three months before
the Rio 100 breast race,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.440
I had a lot of worries.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.911
I had a lot of trouble sleeping.

00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:40.105
And that-- yeah.

00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:42.950
Plus, we were roommates most
of the time, so she knows.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.200
YIP PIN XIU: In the middle
of the night she was like--

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.537
yeah, what happens if I--

00:33:47.537 --> 00:33:48.995
THERESA GOH: What
if I don't do it?

00:33:48.995 --> 00:33:51.505
Will everybody still love me?

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:53.380
YIP PIN XIU: Then I had
to be a psychologist.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.140
I was like, shh, shh,
stop thinking about it.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.570
THERESA GOH: So just three,
four months of that every night,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.594
it was very tiring.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.670
You know that how you want--

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:11.659
if you want to get
a perfect scenario,

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:15.219
you have to do this, and do
this, and do this, right?

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.480
So if it's like a game--
you know how those games,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.844
where you want to hit--

00:34:18.844 --> 00:34:20.719
there's a bug going up
and down, and you have

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.440
to hit it at the right time?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.330
Yeah, those games.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.949
So it always feels like that.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:25.865
It feels like a lever.

00:34:25.865 --> 00:34:30.320
And I always feel like I
have to be in the middle.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.120
And it was just very
tiring because I

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.699
felt I was over-nervous.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.580
And I was like, no.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.080
I'm fine.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.239
I don't care about it anymore.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.120
YIP PIN XIU: A few
days later, she's

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.070
like, I don't care
about anything anymore.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:39.332
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:34:39.332 --> 00:34:40.207
Why am I [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:40.207 --> 00:34:40.749
I don't care.

00:34:40.749 --> 00:34:42.706
Two days later, I'd be
like, aw, I can't sleep.

00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:44.699
It was just constantly
going back and forth,

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.570
and having to find
a middle ground,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.960
and being confident, but not
so worried about the results.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.670
And so when the final
day came, the night

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.330
before I slept at 7:00 PM,
I went to bed at 7:00 PM

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.720
just to try and fall asleep
and have enough hours of sleep

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.420
before my race, and
managed to do that

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.890
after drifting in and
out of sleep again.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.490
And then in the
morning, I woke up.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.950
I went to the call room, and
I wasn't nervous anymore.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.910
I was calm, I was
happy, I was relaxed,

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.706
and I swam my fastest race ever.

00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:16.062
Yeah.

00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:17.020
NITHA: Hi, both of you.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.840
I'm Nitha.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.552
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:35:19.552 --> 00:35:21.510
It's such a pleasure to
see you guys in person.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.860
We've been on the WhatsApp chat.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.840
What I wanted to ask is,
since you guys came in,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.230
I've seen a very infectious
energy and a camaraderie

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.770
between the two of you.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:36.240
So I wanted to ask, does
your friendship also

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.880
go a step further where you're
trying to motivate each other

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.080
or be there for each other?

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.610
Because at Google,
we all work in teams.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.330
And I think for us, that
team bonding and that team

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.200
collaboration is important.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.000
So how does it work
with the two of you?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.210
Do you guys fight
at all, or is this--

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.200
THERESA GOH: There's a
reason we're sitting so far

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.330
apart from each other.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.238
YIP PIN XIU: See the distance?

00:35:55.238 --> 00:35:57.134
So you stay there.

00:35:57.134 --> 00:35:58.800
THERESA GOH: Of course,
we have moments.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.770
It's not perfect.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.140
YIP PIN XIU: I have to tell
you my story when I first

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.667
met Theresa.

00:36:01.667 --> 00:36:02.500
THERESA GOH: OK, OK.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.590
We [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.360
I mean, it's really
hard to find someone

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.670
you can connect with so well.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.240
And it's good because
we can connect,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.120
and it's a good chemistry.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.750
We can just sit in silence--

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.190
it's fine-- or we can talk.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.670
We can do that.

00:36:25.525 --> 00:36:26.025
Yeah.

00:36:26.025 --> 00:36:27.900
But it's important to
be able to find someone

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.210
that you can click with,
for sure, much easier

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.390
than with someone you
don't like, right?

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.450
YIP PIN XIU: No, you didn't
like me at the start.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.594
THERESA GOH: She was
very annoying to me.

00:36:37.594 --> 00:36:39.510
YIP PIN XIU: So right
after I joined the team,

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.440
I was 12 years old.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:46.240
I was a very
excitable young thing.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.880
And she, on the other hand,
was already swim queen.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.450
She's a lot older than me.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.270
I'm kidding.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.530
Five years is not that much.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.030
Yeah.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.470
But when I first
went swimming, she

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.470
would be with the
older people talking.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.480
I would be at the side
talking to the younger ones.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:13.020
And we never really became
friends or spoke to each other

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.850
until we became roommates.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.860
I started swimming
competitively in 2004.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.140
But we only became
roommates in September 2005.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.015
So there was an entire year
of not talking to each other.

00:37:24.015 --> 00:37:25.790
But it was only when
I became her roommate

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.910
and started chattering
too much in the room

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.700
that I melted her
ice-cold heart.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.700
And then from then on, we've
been roommates ever since.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.380
So it's really nice to have
somebody along with you

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.310
on this journey,
because I'm not perfect.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.710
On some days when I really
cannot find the motivation

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.440
to train and I see that
she's training, I have to go.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.430
And some days I feel I
have to drag her, literally

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.190
drag her to training.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:54.769
So it's really nice just
having company along the way.

00:37:54.769 --> 00:37:57.060
And it's nice knowing that
you're not doing this alone.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.180
THERESA GOH: When you
do-- when you go--

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.830
you know you're
going to face shit.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.330
And then you know
that someone, they

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.375
are going to face the
same thing with you.

00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:06.750
YIP PIN XIU: In the morning,
when I first wake up in bed,

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.530
I hope it rains.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.280
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.486
We're texting each other.

00:38:09.486 --> 00:38:10.790
YIP PIN XIU: And we can
only tell each other.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.790
We can't tell our coach.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:12.748
I hope it rains, Coach.

00:38:12.748 --> 00:38:13.846
THERESA GOH: It will stop.

00:38:13.846 --> 00:38:15.130
You think it's going to rain?

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.150
YIP PIN XIU: Let's lie in
bed for five more minutes.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.510
OK, time to get up now.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.710
NITHA: Can I ask a
follow-up question to that?

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.170
We talk a lot about work/life
balance here at Google, right?

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.099
And both of you train
so very, very hard.

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:32.265
What do you guys do for fun?

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.200
THERESA GOH: There's a
lot of things to do--

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:38.700
go out.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.616
YIP PIN XIU: I think
it's not that hard for us

00:38:40.616 --> 00:38:43.080
because we find fun in
the work that we do.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.440
So it's good to enjoy what
you do and find people

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.020
that you can relate
and connect with.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.960
But then for us, believe
me, we have free time.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.420
It's not only just
the two of us.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.100
We normally hang out with
other people because--

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.470
I don't know-- because we
see each other too much.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.030
THERESA GOH: We
have other friends.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.700
I promise.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.440
We do hang out with a
lot of other friends.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.490
Who have mutual groups and
we hang out together, dinner,

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:10.179
or just a movie, or
just hanging out.

00:39:10.179 --> 00:39:12.720
YIP PIN XIU: And you have to
see the amount of WhatsApp group

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.020
texts.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.220
THERESA GOH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:14.880
YIP PIN XIU: You'll find it.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.585
Guess.

00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:18.690
THERESA GOH: Can anybody
guess how many WhatsApp groups

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.210
we have in common?

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.230
That's so low.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.730
OK.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.011
We have-- go higher.

00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:28.844
YIP PIN XIU: Higher?

00:39:28.844 --> 00:39:31.010
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:34.567
We have 83 groups in common.

00:39:34.567 --> 00:39:35.150
SPEAKER: What?

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.520
I wouldn't even be able to keep
up with that conversations.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.380
I wouldn't even be able
to keep up with 83 groups.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:39.950
My goodness.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.033
THERESA GOH: It's so many.

00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:43.590
YIP PIN XIU: That's too many.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.660
I think it was 50-something
the last we checked.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.410
THERESA GOH: Yeah.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.951
It's growing.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.110
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
sharing your stories.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.900
It's really, really
inspirational.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.160
My question is, is
there any technology

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.052
that has improved
your quality of life

00:39:59.052 --> 00:40:00.620
in terms of accessibility?

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:05.590
And if not, what areas would
you like to see improving on?

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.056
YIP PIN XIU:
Driverless technology.

00:40:08.056 --> 00:40:10.430
SPEAKER: I think it got stuck
there on Family and Friends

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.490
Day.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.680
I just noticed that it's one
of the YouTube Kids ones.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.490
THERESA GOH: Does the-- that's
my-- it's not her phone.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.070
I can move along
with easily and fast.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.940
But I recently
bought this thing,

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.040
the extra wheel at
the back of my chair

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.050
that can connect and disconnect.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.880
And it helps me go up ramps.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.285
And so it's like a moto--

00:40:37.285 --> 00:40:38.160
YIP PIN XIU: A wheel.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.282
THERESA GOH: Yeah, so I just
push once and it will continue.

00:40:41.282 --> 00:40:43.341
YIP PIN XIU: Is it
like a Segway-ish?

00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:44.340
THERESA GOH: Not really.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.000
Segway, you got to lean, right?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.910
No, this one doesn't lean.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.410
It helps to allow me
to move on carpets,

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.700
because it's not so easy to
push a wheelchair on carpets.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.450
Like, little things like
that that doesn't necessarily

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:01.810
make the chair heavier,
that much heavier,

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:09.940
but it adds that extra
help that I need sometimes.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.270
YIP PIN XIU: So it's a
problem finding chairs,

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.260
even the most basic of things--

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.510
maybe for us, wheelchairs that
are at the same time slick,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.040
but at the same time
still have functions

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.190
that help with our lives.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.379
So everything's really bulky.

00:41:26.379 --> 00:41:27.962
THERESA GOH: The
lighter the chair is,

00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:29.003
the easier it is to push.

00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:31.760
But the lighter it is,
the more expensive it is.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.890
And that can be problematic
for the poorer countries.

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.330
So a lot of times, you
find that the chairs that

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.990
are massive and hospital
chairs, basically.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.570
And it's not easy to push.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.270
It's basically meant
for someone to push you.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.534
And then you remove
that independent factor.

00:41:50.534 --> 00:41:52.950
And then they have to depend
on other people to push them.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.950
And then it just becomes
a downward spiral.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.620
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, Pin Xiu and Theresa.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.980
And I just saw the
news that, Pin Xiu,

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.770
you just came from SMU, right?

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.081
There's a scholarship named
after you in your honor.

00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:08.580
You were wearing the exact same
clothes, so congratulations.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580
YIP PIN XIU: Yes, I was.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.190
THERESA GOH: You
should have changed

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.836
AUDIENCE: It was one
hour ago or something.

00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:16.210
So I actually have
two questions,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.350
but I suppose there's
only time for one.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.176
One actually relates
to disabilities,

00:42:20.176 --> 00:42:22.300
and the other one is actually
Singapore in general.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:26.290
So the first one was around--

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.640
and you don't have to answer
this if it's sensitive.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.820
But during the Paralympics,
Olympics, or [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.040
rather, there was a lot of
celebrations in Singapore,

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.330
and also a lot of chatter and
talk about the monetary reward,

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.946
and the discrepancies--

00:42:41.946 --> 00:42:44.320
I'm not sure this was already
covered-- but discrepancies

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.590
between both, and just wanted
to get some of your thoughts

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.694
on how you feel about that.

00:42:49.694 --> 00:42:51.610
I think you were quoted
in the papers as well.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.110
But it would be great to hear
some of your personal thoughts

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.290
and reflections on
the discrepancies

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.520
and how that affects--

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.100
or whether you
think that's fair,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.520
what you would like to
see changing going forward

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.510
in Singapore, and the
perception of Olympians

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.240
versus Paralympians.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.440
And then the second thing was--

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.100
it's very stark or
very interesting

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.060
that swimming seems to be
the sport in Singapore that

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.530
earns us medals, both
for able-bodied athletes

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:21.490
and Paralympians.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.980
And just wanted to
get your view on how

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.770
we can replicate the success
for other sports in Singapore

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.150
as well.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.880
THERESA GOH: I'm going to
touch the first question first.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.620
The easiest way to say is
if you were a Paralympian,

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:41.360
and you had gotten a gold
medal, and your friend is

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.150
an Olympian got a gold
medal, and both of you

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.070
have gone through the
same kind of trainings,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.695
and basically got
into the same things,

00:43:47.695 --> 00:43:51.190
how will you feel if you've
got different amounts?

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:57.410
So that's the way that it allows
you to feel, how we would feel.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.720
But at the same time,
it's also not something

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.290
that we worry about because it's
not something we can control.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.680
And I think in
life, my whole life,

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.720
it's always not worrying about
something you cannot control.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.890
So you control what
you can control.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.340
And if you control something,
you cannot control it,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.260
it just makes you
more frustrated.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.650
So I think it's also a lot--

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.340
we like to compare it to--

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.650
because Paralympic sports
is not so competitive--

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:32.150
so I think one of the
[INAUDIBLE] something.

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:33.800
And that's not really
a fair comparison

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.133
because there are different
sports with different levels

00:44:36.133 --> 00:44:38.120
of competitive level--
not competitive level,

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.200
different levels of
numbers of competition.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.970
And swimming has a lot of
competitors, a lot of swimmers.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.690
But then if you compare another
sport, maybe it has two-thirds.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.890
Are you giving that sport
lesser even though it's

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.970
an able-bodied sport?

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:51.900
All right.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.280
So I think that's not really
a fair comparison to make.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.170
The main point is
that they probably

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:03.560
don't value personal
disability s highly

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.300
as an able-bodied person.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.070
That's how I feel like.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.980
I feel that's the main
base, the foundation of it.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.720
That is why they feel that
we don't deserve as much,

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.760
even though they don't--

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.312
they may not realize that
they're feeling that way.

00:45:17.312 --> 00:45:18.770
YIP PIN XIU: And
they don't realize

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.890
that not many people get their
knowledge or their information

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.840
from papers or from things.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.290
So if the people at the top--

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:32.720
not exactly the top-- but if
people don't see us as equals,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.389
then people read
the news, and they

00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:36.180
see that they're not
equal, they would also

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.513
start to have this mindset
that-- oh, maybe they are not

00:45:38.513 --> 00:45:42.470
equal, which is a bit painful.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.055
But I think we
don't take the money

00:45:45.055 --> 00:45:46.930
thing too hard because
we're really not doing

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:48.600
this for the money.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.124
Yeah.

00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:51.540
So maybe you don't have to
increase our amount but maybe--

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.750
THERESA GOH: Bring
down the Olympians'.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.090
YIP PIN XIU: I didn't say that.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:58.090
Yeah.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.886
And what was the other one?

00:46:00.886 --> 00:46:04.102
AUDIENCE: How to replicate
the success of swimming.

00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:05.185
THERESA GOH: I don't know.

00:46:05.185 --> 00:46:06.727
YIP PIN XIU: I feel
I want to try it.

00:46:06.727 --> 00:46:08.226
THERESA GOH: Yeah,
swimming, I think

00:46:08.226 --> 00:46:10.650
we can achieve a lot more
because we have a lot of events

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:11.900
to win medals in.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:16.346
So if I have eight events
that I can get medals in,

00:46:16.346 --> 00:46:20.940
and bowling has only one,
it's not comparative, not

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.739
very competitive-- comparative.

00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:24.030
YIP PIN XIU: But it's not true.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.830
Actually, it's just
that for Olympic sports,

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.829
we are good at swimming.

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:29.250
But bowling doesn't
have the Olympics.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.936
But we are very good bowlers.

00:46:30.936 --> 00:46:32.310
THERESA GOH:
World-level bowlers.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.500
YIP PIN XIU: Our bowlers
win world championships.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.420
THERESA GOH: But they just
don't have an audience.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.450
YIP PIN XIU: Yeah, they
just don't have an audience.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.470
And I think in order
to be a good athlete,

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:43.230
it comes from the culture
of the sports itself.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.330
So some people--
say for swimmers, we

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.300
have a lot of swimmers
to look up to.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.950
We know what they do.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.410
We know the science
behind it and everything.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.954
But maybe for some other sports,
some of the athletes are just--

00:46:54.954 --> 00:46:56.370
they think that
what they're doing

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.250
is the way the
athlete should do,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.910
but it actually isn't the way.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.570
So I think it's really
the culture of the sport

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.060
and how the athlete
grows up in the sport.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.630
I wouldn't say we
are super athletes,

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.920
but at least we wake up
at 5:00, we sleep on time,

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:12.890
we sleep at 10:00.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.100
But there are some
athletes who go for supper,

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.550
and sleep at 2:00
in certain spots.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.701
And maybe that's
why they're not--

00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:22.450
THERESA GOH: I think
it's very individual.

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.130
YIP PIN XIU: Yeah,
it's very individual.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:28.610
So I can't tell if it's from an
individual, or from a country,

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.521
or from a sport.

00:47:29.521 --> 00:47:30.937
THERESA GOH: But
I think that it's

00:47:30.937 --> 00:47:35.710
also because swimming is
so marketable and so high

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.120
profile for weather--

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.680
SPEAKER: We're outdoors
here all the time.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.550
That helps, right?

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:42.466
THERESA GOH: Oh, yeah.

00:47:42.466 --> 00:47:45.310
And there's a lot of
pools in Singapore.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:51.526
It helps when a country invests
more in a certain sport.

00:47:51.526 --> 00:47:55.384
Triathlon is getting hot.

00:47:55.384 --> 00:47:59.040
And a lot more people are
competing in triathlon.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.490
And it really depends on
what people know is out there

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.026
and what you're exposed to.

00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:07.740
SPEAKER: So I just wanted to say
a huge thank you to both of you

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.490
for coming in.

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:11.540
[APPLAUSE]
