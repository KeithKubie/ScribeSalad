ability to interpret this data is very valuable.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.390
&gt;&gt; Now, coupled with family history, this

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.620
information has the power to reveal your potential

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.040
future, but also the future of any

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.980
children you might have with a particular mate.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.890
