00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.330
Previously you've seen
the view did load gets called,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.710
when the view controller
class is loaded into memory.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.930
This diagram illustrates the view and
view controller life cycle.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.130
When the view in view controller
are changing states, these functions,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.800
if you have implemented them,
will get called.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.972
In iOS, the will functions always
get called before the did functions.

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:22.940
If YouWill appear,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.500
gets called before the view
controller in its view are onscreen.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.621
If YouDid appear,
gets called right after the view and

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.430
view controller are on screen.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.510
This is really useful if you want
something to happen right before or

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.970
right after a view
controller's view appears.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.430
If you override these functions in your
view controller, they will get called.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.680
Otherwise, their default
in empty implementations

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.570
in the UI view controller class,
will get called instead.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.780
The last point bears repeating, as it
is a common error I've seen many times.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.210
If you mistyped the function
name it's not the same function.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.400
For example,
view will appear as you see here.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.160
Has an extra P,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.710
into IOS it is a completely different
function than the one it's looking for.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.900
So I would never call this function,
even though, our code would compile.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.050
Remember, programming is an exercise
in trying to be as precise as possible.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't worry too much though,
Xcode autocomplete will help you

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.960
in filling out the names
of these functions.
