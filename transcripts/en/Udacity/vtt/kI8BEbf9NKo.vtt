00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.810
What sequence did you come up with,
David?

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; So from this state, there's seven
possible moves we can make initially.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.990
Some of them are going to move
us away from our goal state.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.560
So putting D on A or D on B are going
to move us away from our goal state.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.120
To means and to analysis, the rest of
the moves are relatively the same.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.720
Putting A on B doesn't get us closer,
putting B on C doesn't get us closer,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.810
and putting B on D
doesn't get us closer.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.620
However, we can see that we really
need to get B out of the way of C

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.260
to move it up here.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.160
Like Ashad mentioned, later on we'll
talk about how an agent would decide

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.320
that it needs to get B
out of the way of C.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.380
But for right now, let's just go ahead
and choose B on Table as the next move.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.490
Given that, we now see that
of the next possible states,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.710
only one reduces our difference,
and that's to put C up on D.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.880
&gt;&gt; That was the right answer, David.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.010
Thank you.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
You will note that we're leaving
several questions unanswered for now,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.810
and that is fine.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.670
But you will also note
that this round reduction

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.750
helps us make progress
towards solving the problem.
