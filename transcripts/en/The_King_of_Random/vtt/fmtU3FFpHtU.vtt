00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.520
Hey guys, I'm Nate. 
Welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.540
Today we've got an experiment 
to see if we can make "magic sand."

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.860
That's sand that you can pour into water 
and it doesn't get wet.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.520
There are commercially available versions
of this same idea but we want to know

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920
if we can make it ourselves.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.460
To experiment with this 
we have a large bag of quartz sand

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.680
and three different 
versions of waterproofing

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.180
that we're going to try applying to 
the surface of the grains of sand.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.740
We have a silicone-based spray, 
this fabric Scotchgard,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.980
and the two-part NeverWet spray.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160
All three of these products are 
supposed to do a very good job of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.760
waterproofing different materials.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.160
So let's apply some to 
three different batches of sand

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.240
and see which one gives us 
the most magic.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100
You can see I don't have a very thick 
layer of sand in each of these.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.420
That's because I want to get really good
coverage with our waterproofing spray.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.720
If the sand is too deep in the trays

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.160
it will have a really hard time getting
through and sticking to all of it.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.480
Now it's time to apply each of our 
water-coating sprays

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.940
to the three batches of sand.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.840
First let's label each pan with its
corresponding type of waterproofing

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.360
so that we can keep track of 
which one's going on which.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.260
This is silicone, 
so we'll put SIL for silicone.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.080
SG for Scotchgard

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.700
NW for never wet.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.940
All three of thesewaterproofing systems 
have warnings on the cans

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.660
that you should be careful not to breathe 
too much of the fumes,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.160
so let's take these outside and spray them down.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.500
First up is the silicone spray.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.480
You can see a slight change in color 
as the spray coats the sand.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.700
It's veery mild, though.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.480
Next up, the Scotchgard.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.100
And finally, the NeverWet. 
Now this does come in a two-

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
part system so we'll have to 
apply Step 1, let that dry

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.780
for the appropriate amount of time, 
and then apply Step 2.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.710
Now we've sprayed each of these batches 
of sand with waterproof coating

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.980
so we need to let them dry out a little bit.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.300
I kind of wanted to try using a heat gun 
or putting them in the oven

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.980
at low temperature to speed up the drying,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.780
but all of them contain warnings 
about not letting them

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
get near any sources of heat and sparks,
anything like that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.380
and so I think we just have to do it the 
old-fashion way and let them dry out.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.119
Since we're not actively spraying into 
the oven it would probably be fine but,

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.940
just in case, I don't want to risk it.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940
I don't think Grant wants me to 
blow up his oven.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.700
There we go. We've got 
one side of our sand sprayed

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.420
with each of our different 
types of waterproofing

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.500
and it's mostly dry at this point. 
So what I want to do is stir it up

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.240
and then flatten it out again 
and spray on a new coat

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.040
to try and make sure that we have all of the
different edges of our sand nicely coated.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.860
That's something. 
Our first layer of NeverWet

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.580
kind of makes the sand bond together into sheets.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.640
We're just going to break that up.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.200
Turn it back into particles of sand.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.240
There we go. Now let's add 
new coatings to each of these.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.980
And I think what I'm going to do is spray
on a coat and then just sort of stir it up,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.840
spray on some more, stir it up and do a
few layers all at once to really try and get

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.420
all of the coating spread 
very evenly around the sand.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.840
There we go. We've got 
all three of our sands coated in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.067
our different waterproofing materials. 
Now let's let them dry out completely

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:52.120
and see which one has the most magic.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.222
The NeverWet, of course, 
because it is a two-stage process,

00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:57.935
will need the second layer 
applied in a little while.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.460
Let's let this dry for 30 to 40 minutes, 
then let's do the same thing

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.320
with the Step 2 of our NeverWet.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.640
At this point, all three batches of sand 
with all three types of coatings have had

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.980
the opportunity to dry overnight, so now 
I think it's time to see what happens

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.460
if we pour them into water.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.740
It is interesting to see that 
the different coatings have left

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.860
slightly different textures on our sand.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.280
To test this sand out I've got a whole
bunch of water in our glass jar

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.960
and we're just going to try adding
spoonfuls of each different type of sand

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.100
in here at a time and see what happens.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.980
To start out I think we'll test the sand 
coated in the NeverWet

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.900
because I suspect that's going to give us 
the best hydrophobic results.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.100
So that mostly just looks like 
a spoonful of sand,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.700
but the sand isn't really getting permeated by the water.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.460
It's just sort of there.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.580
Now let's see what happens when I take
 the spoon back out of the water.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.700
Instantly goes dry again. 
Let's do that again.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.020
Underwater

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.840
Back to dry powder.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.020
Underwater; dry powder.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.000
Every time it does that 
a little bit of sand falls off the spoon

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.040
into the surface of the water, 
just kind of floating there.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.180
What if I can gather back up?

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.340
Nope, I just made more fall off.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.340
The pressure of the water is kind of 
holding the sand on the spoon;

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.620
it doesn't really fall off.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.160
All right, I'm gonna lift the spoon 
out of the water at this same angle.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.640
I think once it's out of the water 
all the dry sand will just fall right off.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.600
It fell off and then it's floating. 
It repels the water so much

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.120
that none of the water can get in 
or above it to make it sink.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.260
I'm just going to push it under and see what happens.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.840
There it goes. Just clumps together as 
one piece down at the bottom of the water.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.760
Pull that out.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.800
Ohâ€”back to powder immediately.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.100
This stuff really likes to float well because 
it doesn't like to go under the water.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
Let's try more.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.700
It's under the water, 
but the part that's still on the surface

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.320
is still repelling the water and holding air
 in it so much that it's making it float.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.320
Let's try and just get it to sink. 
There it goes.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.060
Just this solid block of sand 
holding itself together underwater.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.440
It just doesn't want to mix 
with the water at all.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.900
And it's very buoyant because it has 
so much air trapped inside it.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.240
That is some very neat 
underwater sculpture-like things.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.800
In addition to the NeverWet 
we did try using some Scotchgard

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.440
and some silicone waterproofing spray and we got mixed results with both of them.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.900
Both of them made the sand 
somewhat hydrophobic

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.340
and we were able to pour the sand 
down into the bowl

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.519
and it would clump up 
the way you would expect it to.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.080
But after a little bit of time 
it did seem like the water

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.280
was starting to soak in and get the sand wet.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.160
In the end of the silicone spray and the Scotchgard were somewhat effective,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.160
but the NeverWet worked much better.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.512
Now there is one more test that I wanted 
to do to make our sand even more magical.

00:07:17.512 --> 00:07:20.598
This sand is sort of a white color 
and it's kind of boring.

00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.963
We want to try and find something 
to make it really pop

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:24.700
when you're playing with it in the water.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.260
This is a new batch of sand 
that's not yet waterproof.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.110
I have this turquoise, alcohol-
based ink and my airbrush

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.040
and I'm going to try and see if I can 
color the sand before I waterproof it.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.220
All right. I had to turn the psi way down

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.980
because the air was just 
blowing the sand all over the place,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.200
but by holding it a fair way away I am able 
to get some of that ink out onto the sand.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.800
It's still blowing the sand around 
a little bit, but not too badly.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.720
That's one layer of sort of coating on there.
Let's mix it up and add some more.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.080
We're definitely getting some good color added.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.880
Just takes a while.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.460
Well, we haven't coated every side of 
every grain of sand on here

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.680
but I think we do have a nice 
turquoise color going.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.520
Let's try waterproofing this and then see
how it looks in the water.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.640
There we go. Our colored sand is now coated. 
Let's let it dry out

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.180
and then put it into some water.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.580
Let's see if now we have some 
brightly colored hydrophobic sand.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.740
That looks pretty cool.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.060
There we have it: An experiment 
using three different

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.500
types of sprays and some sands 
to see which works best

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.260
to make our magic water-resistant sand.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.980
I think we got the best results 
using our NeverWet although,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.540
like I explained before, 
I don't like how it clumps up

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.640
after the first stage. You really have to 
go in and break it back up

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.640
into the individual grains of sand 
before you apply the second coat

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.860
Using a little bit of alcohol ink 
and an airbrush did a

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.700
great job of dyeing our sand 
a beautiful turquoise color.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.054
I did use the silicone spray on the 
turquoise sand which worked fairly well.

00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:31.781
At this point I do kind of wish 
I'd used the NeverWet

00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:33.890
as that is a little bit more hydrophobic.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.760
It repels the water a little bit better.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.920
If you want to make your 
own version of this magic sand,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.580
I would recommend going with the NeverWet 
and just give it a little bit of time

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.980
really breaking it up into fine particles

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.020
before you start adding on 
the second coat.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.800
This stuff is pretty fun to play with. It
makes really cool formations under water.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.140
It's really fun to pull it up out of the water
 and watch the water just break off of it

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.180
and leave the dry sand underneath.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.080
If your sand does get a little bit wet, 
pull it out of the water, squeeze it off,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.500
let it dry off in a paper towel or on a tray.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.100
Once it's dry it will be returned to 
its water-repellent state

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.520
and you can pour it back in again

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.140
and watch it form those cool twisty, 
swirly shapes under water.
