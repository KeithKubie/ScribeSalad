the icebergs even my way yeah no these
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 align:start position:0%
the icebergs even my way yeah no these
are<00:01:24.630><c> icebergs</c><00:01:25.020><c> whoo</c><00:01:25.170><c> breaking</c><00:01:25.500><c> down</c><00:01:25.680><c> like</c>

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
are icebergs whoo breaking down like
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.990 align:start position:0%
are icebergs whoo breaking down like
totally<00:01:26.580><c> normal</c>

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
totally normal
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 align:start position:0%
totally normal
they're<00:01:27.750><c> starting</c><00:01:28.170><c> to</c><00:01:28.200><c> dilute</c><00:01:28.590><c> then</c><00:01:28.799><c> into</c><00:01:29.100><c> the</c>

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
they're starting to dilute then into the
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
they're starting to dilute then into the
North<00:01:29.400><c> Sea</c><00:01:29.490><c> and</c><00:01:29.820><c> when</c><00:01:30.030><c> they</c><00:01:30.150><c> are</c><00:01:30.240><c> deluded</c><00:01:30.479><c> you</c>

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
North Sea and when they are deluded you
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 align:start position:0%
North Sea and when they are deluded you
cannot<00:01:30.930><c> use</c><00:01:31.170><c> that</c><00:01:31.380><c> water</c><00:01:31.560><c> anymore</c><00:01:31.829><c> then</c><00:01:32.159><c> it's</c>

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
cannot use that water anymore then it's
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 align:start position:0%
cannot use that water anymore then it's
like<00:01:32.400><c> heavily</c><00:01:32.670><c> salted</c><00:01:32.970><c> yeah</c><00:01:33.450><c> so</c><00:01:33.780><c> they're</c>

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
like heavily salted yeah so they're
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 align:start position:0%
like heavily salted yeah so they're
picking<00:01:34.320><c> up</c><00:01:34.439><c> this</c><00:01:34.590><c> huge</c><00:01:34.799><c> icebergs</c><00:01:35.340><c> and</c><00:01:35.549><c> you</c>

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
picking up this huge icebergs and you
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
picking up this huge icebergs and you
can<00:01:36.210><c> see</c><00:01:36.420><c> like</c><00:01:36.600><c> they</c><00:01:36.720><c> are</c><00:01:36.810><c> tons</c><00:01:37.170><c> they're</c><00:01:37.530><c> super</c>

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 align:start position:0%
can see like they are tons they're super
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start position:0%
can see like they are tons they're super
heavy<00:01:38.250><c> they</c><00:01:38.490><c> have</c><00:01:38.579><c> our</c><00:01:38.700><c> own</c><00:01:38.909><c> vessel</c><00:01:39.210><c> they're</c>

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 align:start position:0%
heavy they have our own vessel they're
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.390 align:start position:0%
heavy they have our own vessel they're
picking<00:01:39.750><c> up</c><00:01:39.810><c> these</c><00:01:39.960><c> icebergs</c><00:01:40.170><c> and</c><00:01:40.619><c> then</c>

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
picking up these icebergs and then
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.010 align:start position:0%
picking up these icebergs and then
melting<00:01:41.759><c> them</c><00:01:41.909><c> down</c><00:01:41.939><c> into</c><00:01:42.329><c> this</c><00:01:42.540><c> bottle</c><00:01:42.869><c> so</c>

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
melting them down into this bottle so
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230 align:start position:0%
melting them down into this bottle so
that's<00:01:43.590><c> something</c><00:01:43.799><c> very</c><00:01:43.950><c> cost</c><00:01:44.520><c> intensive</c><00:01:44.820><c> and</c>

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's something very cost intensive and
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's something very cost intensive and
they're<00:01:45.360><c> cost</c><00:01:45.570><c> intensive</c><00:01:45.869><c> and</c><00:01:46.350><c> also</c><00:01:46.740><c> it's</c><00:01:47.640><c> not</c>

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 align:start position:0%
they're cost intensive and also it's not
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 align:start position:0%
they're cost intensive and also it's not
gonna<00:01:48.000><c> be</c><00:01:48.210><c> that</c><00:01:48.630><c> they're</c><00:01:49.110><c> not</c><00:01:49.140><c> gonna</c><00:01:49.350><c> make</c>

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 align:start position:0%
gonna be that they're not gonna make
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 align:start position:0%
gonna be that they're not gonna make
million<00:01:50.310><c> now</c><00:01:50.490><c> and</c><00:01:50.970><c> I</c><00:01:51.090><c> think</c><00:01:51.600><c> they</c><00:01:51.689><c> did</c><00:01:51.750><c> 10,000</c>

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
million now and I think they did 10,000
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
million now and I think they did 10,000
bottles<00:01:52.500><c> faster</c><00:01:52.890><c> so</c><00:01:52.979><c> that's</c><00:01:53.040><c> why</c><00:01:53.220><c> the</c><00:01:53.280><c> price</c>

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 align:start position:0%
bottles faster so that's why the price
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 align:start position:0%
bottles faster so that's why the price
point<00:01:53.790><c> is</c><00:01:53.909><c> gonna</c><00:01:54.090><c> be</c><00:01:54.240><c> elevated</c><00:01:54.630><c> it's</c>

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
point is gonna be elevated it's
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
point is gonna be elevated it's
something<00:01:55.229><c> very</c><00:01:55.259><c> very</c><00:01:55.950><c> unique</c><00:01:56.780><c> that's</c><00:01:57.780><c> a</c>

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 align:start position:0%

I<00:02:16.410><c> had</c><00:02:16.650><c> three</c><00:02:16.950><c> bottles</c><00:02:17.340><c> already</c><00:02:17.580><c> in</c><00:02:17.700><c> tasting</c>

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 align:start position:0%
I had three bottles already in tasting
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.490 align:start position:0%
I had three bottles already in tasting
in<00:02:18.180><c> all</c><00:02:18.360><c> three</c><00:02:18.600><c> bottles</c><00:02:18.870><c> tasted</c><00:02:19.200><c> slightly</c>

in all three bottles tasted slightly
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
in all three bottles tasted slightly
different<00:02:19.830><c> and</c><00:02:20.010><c> that</c><00:02:20.640><c> makes</c><00:02:20.850><c> sense</c><00:02:21.120><c> because</c>

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 align:start position:0%
different and that makes sense because
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.970 align:start position:0%
different and that makes sense because
it's<00:02:21.630><c> a</c><00:02:21.780><c> mother</c><00:02:21.960><c> it's</c><00:02:22.320><c> a</c><00:02:22.470><c> product</c><00:02:22.770><c> of</c><00:02:22.830><c> nature</c>

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's a mother it's a product of nature
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820 align:start position:0%
it's a mother it's a product of nature

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
