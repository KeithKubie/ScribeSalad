WESLEY CHUN: Hey everyone,
this is Wesley Chun,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.270
an engineer and developer
advocate here at Google.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.240
If you've been wanting to
integrate Google technologies

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.698
into the apps that
you create, this

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:09.220
is the right place
to get started.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.540
In this episode, we'll
cover the setup process

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.430
when you want to build an
app that uses Google APIs.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.180
First of all, why Google
Developer Tools at all?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.680
Well, in the last
episode-- click

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.370
the link if you missed
it-- we mentioned

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.620
that people are familiar
with tools like Google Search

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.254
and YouTube.

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.420
But can you imagine having
to create your own Google

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.800
Maps or Google Drive?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.026
Well, we can't either.

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.900
There's no need to
reinvent these wheels when

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.860
you can use our APIs and open
source developer tools to tap

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.730
into these technologies.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.380
Today, we'll show you how
easy it is to get started.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.720
You'll learn how to create
a project in the Developer

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.250
Console-- or
DevConsole-- and how

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.320
to enable the APIs
you wish to use.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.960
Finally, you'll learn how to get
the credentials your app needs

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.050
to access Google
APIs, whether you're

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.530
accessing authorized data
or using simple API keys

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.600
to access public data.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.180
In upcoming episodes,
we'll create

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.240
scripts using these credentials
to access Google APIs.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.260
This common code will be
the same regardless of app,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.750
how may APIs it uses,
or what language.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.090
By the way, if you're not
accessing authorized data,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.400
the required code
is even shorter.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.410
Your code will be able to access
Google services from anywhere,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.870
whether it's a client-side
web app, a mobile app,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.430
or a back-end service
running in the cloud.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.900
Because the approach to
all are very similar.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.450
All you need to do to get set
up is done in the browser.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.160
So let's go to the computer now.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.180
All right, here we go.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020
Any time you're running an app
using Google APIs or the Google

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.900
Cloud Platform, you need to
go to the Developer's Console,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.950
or DevConsole.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.580
So pop open a browser to
console.developers.google.com

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.510
and log in with your credentials
if you haven't already.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.200
If you don't have a
Google account yet,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.750
then click on the
Create Account link

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.704
that you see just
below to get started.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.370
Once you're logged
in, you'll be brought

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.990
to the DevConsole's
home page, which

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.849
is an overview of
all of your projects.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.640
Don't worry if you
haven't created one yet.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.690
It'll just be blank instead
of having a list of them.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.970
Here, we're going to
be doing three things.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.820
One is to create a new project.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.230
Two is to turn on
the APIs you're

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.480
going to use for that project.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.396
And three, you're going
to create and download

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.039
the appropriate credentials.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.050
To begin, let's create a project
by clicking on the blue Create

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.220
Project button.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.180
You need to provide two things.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.030
One is the project
name, which is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.040
used only here in
the DevConsole--

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.470
so you can change it later
if you don't like it.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.400
The second thing you need
to provide is a project ID.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.940
This uniquely
identifies your project

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.760
over all the others
in the system.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.400
And because of that, you can't
change it later, so make it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.420
a good one.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.010
For your convenience, Google
creates a random one for you,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.275
like the one you see here.

00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:40.650
If you don't like it, pick
your own, if it hasn't already

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430
been chosen, or click on the
little refresh wheel over here,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.540
and Google will make
another random one for you.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.076
Once you've decided,
click on Create.

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:52.450
A bunch of gears will start
spinning around inside Google

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.160
data centers to
create your project.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.660
It usually takes
about half a minute

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.141
to get the project set up.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.390
Once it's ready, you'll be
taken to your new project's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.280
dashboard, which is
where we'll pick up.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.970
So go ahead and
pause the video to do

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.520
that, then resume once you've
landed on your new project's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.960
homepage.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.290
Great, our project was
created successfully.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.000
So here we are on our
project's Overview page.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.920
To keep things
simple, our project

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.980
will just be a
command line script.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.220
It could be also a mobile client
or a server-side app running

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.060
in the cloud.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.070
We'll show you where those
other options come in later.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.590
For now, the next step
is to enable APIs.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.180
And yes, there is
an app for that,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.109
which is this Enable
an API button.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.900
You'll be taken to the
services page, where

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.777
you can turn on APIs
you wish to use.

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:38.110
You'll see that some Google
Cloud Platform services have

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.600
already been enabled by default.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.350
So if you're not
interested in using them,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.410
feel free to toggle them
off using the switches

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.630
that you see here on
the right-hand side.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.750
Now it's time to find the
APIs that you want to enable.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.040
For example, if you're
interested in using the Google

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.960
Drive API, just scroll
down and flip it on.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.610
There it is.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.650
Next, let's say you wanted
the YouTube data API.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.660
Well, you'd scroll down
to find that and turn it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.230
on in the same way that you
would turn on any other API.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.800
Once you're done selecting
the APIs that you wish to use,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.150
scroll back up to the top
to ensure that they've

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.070
been turned on,
like we see here.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.930
Now let's set up our credentials
by selecting that link

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.970
on the left.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.340
On this page, we see two
sections-- authorized

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.050
and public API access.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.280
We're going to create
credentials for both.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.110
For Google Drive,
you should recognize

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.380
that files and
folders are user data,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.980
meaning that your app needs to
be authorized in order to get

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.850
access to that type of data.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.190
So let's do that by clicking
on the Create New Client ID

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.290
button.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.640
Here, we see a dialogue to
enter our application type.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.530
Since it's a simple
command line script,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.480
it's neither a web app nor an
app running on a Google server

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.050
acting on behalf
of a user, which

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.880
is what a service
account is for.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.070
Instead, we're creating an
installed app, so select that.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.160
Now, it's neither a web
nor a mobile installed app,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.790
but a command line
script instead.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.520
So that means Other.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.430
Now click Create Client
ID to generate your OAuth

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.120
credentials.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.830
The last step in this section
is to click on the Download JSON

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.100
button.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.770
This will save the credentials
file that your script will

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.660
use in order to
communicate with Google

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.520
Service for authorization.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.770
Naturally, we'll recommend
you drop that file

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.910
into the same folder as to where
you're going to build your app,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.600
like we did here.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.020
So now that's done.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.550
Going back and
taking a look here

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.040
at the second half of
the Credentials page,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.550
we see this is for simple or
public API access, meaning

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.470
you'll be creating an API key.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.860
It's primarily used for
APIs where you're just

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.190
accessing the service, like
searching for YouTube videos.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.200
In such cases, just
having an API key

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.600
is good enough, as there's no
need for authorization here.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.700
Click on the Create
New Key button.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.650
Again, we have just a
command line script,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.940
which is neither a
web nor a browser app.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.210
So it's technically a
server app, so select that.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.900
You can also choose to whitelist
IP addresses if you wish.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.470
Otherwise, click Create.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.270
In a few seconds, you'll
have an API key-- ta-da!

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.680
This is a string that you
can copy and paste directly

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.010
into your code, which is
fine for experimenting with.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.210
But obviously, this
isn't secure in practice.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.500
So if you're doing
this for production,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.730
make sure you put it
into a secure database

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.660
or someplace other than plain
text and code, all right?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.810
Anyway, now you've got
authorized and public API

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.740
access.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.590
So our mission in the
DevConsole is complete.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.211
The rest is up you.

00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.210
All right, now that you've
got a project set up,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.565
you're ready to start coding.

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.190
In the next episode, we'll walk
you through the common security

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.600
code necessary to
use Google APIs.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600
Well, that's it for now.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.580
Be sure to bring your
code editors next time.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.330
This is Wesley Chun
from Google, and we'll

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.100
see you again soon
on the Launchpad.
