first question to Professor Winkleman

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:27.140
first question to Professor Winkleman
 

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.460
first question to Professor Winkleman
because first when we have a problem we

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:30.470
because first when we have a problem we
 

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.170
because first when we have a problem we
start by figuring out what tools we have

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:32.180
start by figuring out what tools we have
 

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.140
start by figuring out what tools we have
a new work at a rather unique

a new work at a rather unique
institution it is a climate Research

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:36.980
institution it is a climate Research
 

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.100
institution it is a climate Research
Institute that it's not just

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.110
Institute that it's not just
 

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:39.670
Institute that it's not just
interdisciplinary but I think you say

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680
interdisciplinary but I think you say
 

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.190
interdisciplinary but I think you say
trance disciplinary as well so my first

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200
trance disciplinary as well so my first
 

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.320
trance disciplinary as well so my first
question to you is really do we have

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:44.330
question to you is really do we have
 

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.620
question to you is really do we have
knowledge wise the tools that we need to

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:47.630
knowledge wise the tools that we need to
 

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.740
knowledge wise the tools that we need to
solve the problem yeah to me there are

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:50.750
solve the problem yeah to me there are
 

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.530
solve the problem yeah to me there are
really two parts to this question part

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:53.540
really two parts to this question part
 

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.570
really two parts to this question part
number one is the question do we have

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:55.580
number one is the question do we have
 

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.240
number one is the question do we have
enough knowledge to understand that we

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:58.250
enough knowledge to understand that we
 

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.680
enough knowledge to understand that we
need to act now and we need to act fast

00:53:59.680 --> 00:53:59.690
need to act now and we need to act fast
 

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:03.520
need to act now and we need to act fast
and the answer is yes absolutely we just

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:03.530
and the answer is yes absolutely we just
 

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.550
and the answer is yes absolutely we just
saw earlier an impressive account of all

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:06.560
saw earlier an impressive account of all
 

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.410
saw earlier an impressive account of all
the different impacts that are already

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:08.420
the different impacts that are already
 

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.500
the different impacts that are already
observed that are already experienced by

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:11.510
observed that are already experienced by
 

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.740
observed that are already experienced by
people around the world the second part

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:14.750
people around the world the second part
 

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.170
people around the world the second part
of the question however however is and I

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:17.180
of the question however however is and I
 

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.330
of the question however however is and I
would argue that we need science and

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:19.340
would argue that we need science and
 

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.120
would argue that we need science and
knowledge now more than ever we urgently

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:22.130
knowledge now more than ever we urgently
 

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.580
knowledge now more than ever we urgently
need more knowledge and understanding

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:24.590
need more knowledge and understanding
 

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.190
need more knowledge and understanding
how we can mitigate how we can adapt and

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200
how we can mitigate how we can adapt and
 

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.830
how we can mitigate how we can adapt and
the simple and plain reason for this is

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:29.840
the simple and plain reason for this is
 

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.340
the simple and plain reason for this is
we are in uncharted territory never have

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:33.350
we are in uncharted territory never have
 

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.250
we are in uncharted territory never have
temperatures risen this fast in the

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:36.260
temperatures risen this fast in the
 

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.060
temperatures risen this fast in the
history of humankind and we just saw in

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:40.070
history of humankind and we just saw in
 

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:43.180
history of humankind and we just saw in
this movie that the difference between

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:43.190
this movie that the difference between
 

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:46.270
this movie that the difference between
an ice age and today is warmer

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280
an ice age and today is warmer
 

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.910
an ice age and today is warmer
interglacial that's just three to five

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920
interglacial that's just three to five
 

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.980
interglacial that's just three to five
degrees three to five degrees

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:50.990
degrees three to five degrees
 

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.880
degrees three to five degrees
distinguishing an ice age and today it's

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:54.890
distinguishing an ice age and today it's
 

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.670
distinguishing an ice age and today it's
a very vast difference and right now

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680
a very vast difference and right now
 

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.160
a very vast difference and right now
we're facing the same kind of warming in

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.170
we're facing the same kind of warming in
 

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.890
we're facing the same kind of warming in
the other direction but

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:01.900
the other direction but
 

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:05.789
the other direction but
much much faster rate now why is it so

00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799
much much faster rate now why is it so
 

00:55:05.799 --> 00:55:08.099
much much faster rate now why is it so
crucial that we understand these

00:55:08.099 --> 00:55:08.109
crucial that we understand these
 

00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:10.260
crucial that we understand these
temperature differences and the impacts

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:10.270
temperature differences and the impacts
 

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.599
temperature differences and the impacts
that come along with 1.5 verse two

00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:12.609
that come along with 1.5 verse two
 

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.370
that come along with 1.5 verse two
degrees versus two point five degrees

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:14.380
degrees versus two point five degrees
 

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.140
degrees versus two point five degrees
why does it even matter

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.150
why does it even matter
 

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:17.789
why does it even matter
well the reason for this is that the

00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799
well the reason for this is that the
 

00:55:17.799 --> 00:55:20.339
well the reason for this is that the
climate system is full of nonlinearities

00:55:20.339 --> 00:55:20.349
climate system is full of nonlinearities
 

00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:23.670
climate system is full of nonlinearities
and Al Gore actually mentioned a few of

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680
and Al Gore actually mentioned a few of
 

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.319
and Al Gore actually mentioned a few of
them earlier I'm just gonna give you one

00:55:28.769 --> 00:55:28.779
example the Antarctic Ice Sheet so an
 

00:55:28.779 --> 00:55:31.230
example the Antarctic Ice Sheet so an
article is covered by this massive ice

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240
article is covered by this massive ice
 

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:34.170
article is covered by this massive ice
sheet that's worth fifty eight meters of

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:34.180
sheet that's worth fifty eight meters of
 

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.569
sheet that's worth fifty eight meters of
global sea level rise so really a vast

00:55:36.569 --> 00:55:36.579
global sea level rise so really a vast
 

00:55:36.579 --> 00:55:39.210
global sea level rise so really a vast
ice cover but even though it's so

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:39.220
ice cover but even though it's so
 

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:42.120
ice cover but even though it's so
massive it's also very fragile and we

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.130
massive it's also very fragile and we
 

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.400
massive it's also very fragile and we
understand icy dynamics better and

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:44.410
understand icy dynamics better and
 

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.920
understand icy dynamics better and
better and we also understand that there

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:46.930
better and we also understand that there
 

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:48.930
better and we also understand that there
are these so-called tipping points these

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:48.940
are these so-called tipping points these
 

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.059
are these so-called tipping points these
critical thresholds that can determine

00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:51.069
critical thresholds that can determine
 

00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:55.470
critical thresholds that can determine
in just a few tens of degrees whether or

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480
in just a few tens of degrees whether or
 

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:58.170
in just a few tens of degrees whether or
not an ice base and my drain into the

00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:58.180
not an ice base and my drain into the
 

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.839
not an ice base and my drain into the
ocean and lead to global sea level rise

00:55:59.839 --> 00:55:59.849
ocean and lead to global sea level rise
 

00:55:59.849 --> 00:56:02.130
ocean and lead to global sea level rise
so it's these kinds of critical

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:02.140
so it's these kinds of critical
 

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.529
so it's these kinds of critical
thresholds that we find everywhere in

00:56:04.529 --> 00:56:04.539
thresholds that we find everywhere in
 

00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:06.690
thresholds that we find everywhere in
the climate system so the Antarctic Ice

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:06.700
the climate system so the Antarctic Ice
 

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.609
the climate system so the Antarctic Ice
Sheet is only one of the examples for

00:56:08.609 --> 00:56:08.619
Sheet is only one of the examples for
 

00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:10.079
Sheet is only one of the examples for
tipping elements in the climate system

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:10.089
tipping elements in the climate system
 

00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:12.779
tipping elements in the climate system
and really we found that there are

00:56:12.779 --> 00:56:12.789
and really we found that there are
 

00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:14.700
and really we found that there are
actually a few tipping elements that are

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:14.710
actually a few tipping elements that are
 

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.559
actually a few tipping elements that are
already at risk of transgressing that

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:16.569
already at risk of transgressing that
 

00:56:16.569 --> 00:56:18.599
already at risk of transgressing that
critique threshold within this Paris

00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:18.609
critique threshold within this Paris
 

00:56:18.609 --> 00:56:22.700
critique threshold within this Paris
range of 1.5 to 2 degrees of warming

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:22.710
range of 1.5 to 2 degrees of warming
 

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.589
range of 1.5 to 2 degrees of warming
that makes it very relevant to pose a

00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599
that makes it very relevant to pose a
 

00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:27.510
that makes it very relevant to pose a
question that was posed to the Forum on

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520
question that was posed to the Forum on
 

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.799
question that was posed to the Forum on
social media because we all all got a

social media because we all all got a
 

00:56:28.809 --> 00:56:30.539
social media because we all all got a
lot of questions in advance so thanks to

00:56:30.539 --> 00:56:30.549
lot of questions in advance so thanks to
 

00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:33.859

viewer said if we all decided to take
 

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:39.180

care of the environment with the damage

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:39.190
care of the environment with the damage
 

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.789
care of the environment with the damage
be reversible or we already doomed or

00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799
be reversible or we already doomed or
 

00:56:41.799 --> 00:56:44.099
be reversible or we already doomed or
kind we at least salvage some mother

00:56:44.099 --> 00:56:44.109
kind we at least salvage some mother
 

00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:47.190
kind we at least salvage some mother
earth yeah that's a really good very

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200
earth yeah that's a really good very
 

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.010
earth yeah that's a really good very
important question so of course as my

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:50.020
important question so of course as my
 

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.410
important question so of course as my
role my role as a scientist is to lay

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:52.420
role my role as a scientist is to lay
 

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.410

the cards on the table and yes there are

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:55.420
the cards on the table and yes there are
 

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.039
the cards on the table and yes there are
some climate impacts that might not be

00:56:59.039 --> 00:56:59.049
some climate impacts that might not be
 

00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:00.900
some climate impacts that might not be
reversible because we have these

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:00.910
reversible because we have these
 

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:02.519
reversible because we have these
particular thresholds in the climate

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:02.529
particular thresholds in the climate
 

00:57:02.529 --> 00:57:05.910
particular thresholds in the climate
system but at the same time and I cannot

system but at the same time and I cannot
 

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.289
system but at the same time and I cannot
stress this enough we live in the

00:57:07.289 --> 00:57:07.299
stress this enough we live in the
 

00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:09.420
stress this enough we live in the
Anthropocene so we're in an age now

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:09.430
Anthropocene so we're in an age now
 

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:13.410
Anthropocene so we're in an age now
where humans actually have the power to

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:13.420
where humans actually have the power to
 

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.569
where humans actually have the power to
change the climate system

00:57:15.569 --> 00:57:15.579
change the climate system
 

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:17.759
change the climate system
but that also means that we should feel

00:57:17.759 --> 00:57:17.769
but that also means that we should feel
 

00:57:17.769 --> 00:57:21.390
but that also means that we should feel
empowered to also reverse some of what

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400
empowered to also reverse some of what
 

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.690
empowered to also reverse some of what
is happening right now and the very good

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:24.700
is happening right now and the very good
 

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:28.380
is happening right now and the very good
news is that we actually know how to do

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:28.390
news is that we actually know how to do
 

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.680
news is that we actually know how to do
it we know which knob we need to turn we

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:31.690
it we know which knob we need to turn we
 

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:34.620
it we know which knob we need to turn we
know what what what we can do in order

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:34.630
know what what what we can do in order
 

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:38.160
know what what what we can do in order
to mitigate some of these changes thank

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:38.170
to mitigate some of these changes thank
 

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:41.239
to mitigate some of these changes thank
you they'll turn out to professor hey-ho

00:57:41.239 --> 00:57:41.249
you they'll turn out to professor hey-ho

the climate issue cannot be solved by

00:57:45.509 --> 00:57:45.519
the climate issue cannot be solved by
 

00:57:45.519 --> 00:57:47.519
the climate issue cannot be solved by
someone on behalf of someone else it

00:57:47.519 --> 00:57:47.529
someone on behalf of someone else it
 

00:57:47.529 --> 00:57:49.529
someone on behalf of someone else it
concerns us all as a global issue

00:57:49.529 --> 00:57:49.539
concerns us all as a global issue
 

00:57:49.539 --> 00:57:51.479
concerns us all as a global issue
now beyond being a very distinguished

00:57:51.479 --> 00:57:51.489
now beyond being a very distinguished
 

00:57:51.489 --> 00:57:53.999
now beyond being a very distinguished
scientist you are also a very active

00:57:53.999 --> 00:57:54.009
scientist you are also a very active
 

00:57:54.009 --> 00:57:55.609
scientist you are also a very active
communicator and I know that you have

00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619
communicator and I know that you have
 

00:57:55.619 --> 00:57:58.019
communicator and I know that you have
worked to involve groups who have

00:57:58.019 --> 00:57:58.029
worked to involve groups who have
 

00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:59.910
worked to involve groups who have
traditionally maybe not been so involved

00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920
traditionally maybe not been so involved
 

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.549
traditionally maybe not been so involved
in climate change or maybe even been

00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559
in climate change or maybe even been
 

00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:03.900
in climate change or maybe even been
actively opposed to it so my first

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:03.910
actively opposed to it so my first
 

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.910
actively opposed to it so my first
question to you is really how do we work

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920
question to you is really how do we work
 

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.400
question to you is really how do we work
to get everyone on board with trying to

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:08.410
to get everyone on board with trying to
 

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:11.579
to get everyone on board with trying to
solve this issue mm-hmm that really is

00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:11.589
solve this issue mm-hmm that really is
 

00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:14.459
solve this issue mm-hmm that really is
the question so I'm a climate scientist

00:58:14.459 --> 00:58:14.469
the question so I'm a climate scientist
 

00:58:14.469 --> 00:58:18.599
the question so I'm a climate scientist
also I live in Texas I am active on

00:58:18.599 --> 00:58:18.609
also I live in Texas I am active on
 

00:58:18.609 --> 00:58:21.779
also I live in Texas I am active on
social media and so almost every day

00:58:21.779 --> 00:58:21.789
social media and so almost every day
 

00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:24.930
social media and so almost every day
sometimes many times a day I have people

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:24.940
sometimes many times a day I have people
 

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.420
sometimes many times a day I have people
telling me that climate isn't changing

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:27.430
telling me that climate isn't changing
 

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.599
telling me that climate isn't changing
that it's cold outside so the planet

00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:30.609
that it's cold outside so the planet
 

00:58:30.609 --> 00:58:32.880
that it's cold outside so the planet
can't be warming that it's just a

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:32.890
can't be warming that it's just a
 

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.769
can't be warming that it's just a
natural cycle haven't I heard of the ice

00:58:34.769 --> 00:58:34.779
natural cycle haven't I heard of the ice
 

00:58:34.779 --> 00:58:37.829
natural cycle haven't I heard of the ice
ages or my favorite that we scientists

00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839
ages or my favorite that we scientists
 

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:40.999
ages or my favorite that we scientists
are just doing this for the money

00:58:40.999 --> 00:58:41.009
are just doing this for the money
 

00:58:41.009 --> 00:58:44.130
are just doing this for the money
you might think that these comments come

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:44.140
you might think that these comments come
 

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:45.599
you might think that these comments come
from people only in the United States

00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:45.609
from people only in the United States
 

00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:49.890
from people only in the United States
but they don't many of them many of them

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:49.900
but they don't many of them many of them
 

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.739
but they don't many of them many of them
come from my home country of Canada more

00:58:52.739 --> 00:58:52.749
come from my home country of Canada more
 

00:58:52.749 --> 00:58:55.739
come from my home country of Canada more
from Australia the UK even here in

00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:55.749
from Australia the UK even here in
 

00:58:55.749 --> 00:58:57.509
from Australia the UK even here in
Norway there are people who say this and

00:58:57.509 --> 00:58:57.519
Norway there are people who say this and
 

00:58:57.519 --> 00:59:00.779
Norway there are people who say this and
think this so often we as scientists

00:59:00.779 --> 00:59:00.789
think this so often we as scientists
 

00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:04.829
think this so often we as scientists
think they don't understand we need more

00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839
think they don't understand we need more
 

00:59:04.839 --> 00:59:05.699
think they don't understand we need more
information

00:59:05.699 --> 00:59:05.709
information
 

00:59:05.709 --> 00:59:07.140
information
as we discussed the other day we need

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:07.150
as we discussed the other day we need
 

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.689
as we discussed the other day we need
animated graphics in our reports maybe

00:59:09.689 --> 00:59:09.699
animated graphics in our reports maybe
 

00:59:09.699 --> 00:59:13.410
animated graphics in our reports maybe
that will help but when you look at

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:13.420
that will help but when you look at
 

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.420
that will help but when you look at
public opinion polling even in the

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:15.430
public opinion polling even in the
 

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.339
public opinion polling even in the
United States

00:59:16.339 --> 00:59:16.349
United States
 

00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:18.569
United States
the majority of people agree that

00:59:18.569 --> 00:59:18.579
the majority of people agree that
 

00:59:18.579 --> 00:59:21.749
the majority of people agree that
climate is changing that it will affect

00:59:21.749 --> 00:59:21.759
climate is changing that it will affect
 

00:59:21.759 --> 00:59:24.449
climate is changing that it will affect
the natural environment people who live

00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:24.459
the natural environment people who live
 

00:59:24.459 --> 00:59:26.219

when the big government's all producing
 

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:21.250
when the big government's all producing
governments are stepping on the brakes

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:21.260
governments are stepping on the brakes
 

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.140
governments are stepping on the brakes
we see the absolute in the opposite

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:24.150
we see the absolute in the opposite
 

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.300
we see the absolute in the opposite
happening in the financial sector

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:26.310
happening in the financial sector
 

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.360
happening in the financial sector
they're pushing up the climate changes

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:29.370
they're pushing up the climate changes
 

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:32.480
they're pushing up the climate changes
on the agenda and action now we see that

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:32.490
on the agenda and action now we see that
 

01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:35.810
on the agenda and action now we see that
insurers we see that wealth managers are

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820
insurers we see that wealth managers are
 

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.690
insurers we see that wealth managers are
actually going together and with the

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:38.700
actually going together and with the
 

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.330
actually going together and with the
biggest cooperation we have seen so far

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340
biggest cooperation we have seen so far
 

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.130
biggest cooperation we have seen so far
you're actually trying to push

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:43.140
you're actually trying to push
 

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.930
you're actually trying to push
governments to reduce your the use of

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940
governments to reduce your the use of
 

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:51.560
governments to reduce your the use of
coal and also to move hosta to a greener

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:51.570
coal and also to move hosta to a greener
 

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.980
coal and also to move hosta to a greener
energy and greener economy so it's very

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:54.990
energy and greener economy so it's very
 

01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:57.530
energy and greener economy so it's very
interesting to see that's working

01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540
interesting to see that's working
 

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.110
interesting to see that's working
together even though you are competitors

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120
together even though you are competitors
 

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.150
together even though you are competitors
from the start that you could actually

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:02.160
from the start that you could actually
 

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.940
from the start that you could actually
get something going but it is important

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:04.950
get something going but it is important
 

01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:06.740
get something going but it is important
to look at a role from the financials

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:06.750
to look at a role from the financials
 

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.480
to look at a role from the financials
for the financial sector what are we

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:08.490
for the financial sector what are we
 

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:11.210
for the financial sector what are we
doing what are we supposed to do and I

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:11.220
doing what are we supposed to do and I
 

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.190
doing what are we supposed to do and I
think the most important role for the

01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:13.200
think the most important role for the
 

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.620
think the most important role for the
financial sector is to put the right

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:15.630
financial sector is to put the right
 

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:19.310
financial sector is to put the right
price on on the risk and I think it's a

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320
price on on the risk and I think it's a
 

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.040
price on on the risk and I think it's a
growing awareness as well that risk

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:22.050
growing awareness as well that risk
 

01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:25.070
growing awareness as well that risk
connected to climate changes are growing

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080
connected to climate changes are growing
 

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.100
connected to climate changes are growing
it's posing posing a threat to the

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:28.110
it's posing posing a threat to the
 

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:30.230
it's posing posing a threat to the
financial sector as such and in the

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:30.240
financial sector as such and in the
 

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.510
financial sector as such and in the
worst place we can end up with a new

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520
worst place we can end up with a new
 

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.390
worst place we can end up with a new
crisis a new financial crisis that we

01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400
crisis a new financial crisis that we
 

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.290
crisis a new financial crisis that we
had in 2008 so how do we actually do

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300
had in 2008 so how do we actually do
 

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:39.500
had in 2008 so how do we actually do
that

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:39.510
that
 

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:42.590
that
how do we put a price on the risk which

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600
how do we put a price on the risk which
 

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.010
how do we put a price on the risk which
is connected to climate changes first of

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020
is connected to climate changes first of
 

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.690
is connected to climate changes first of
all I think we we should notice that

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:47.700
all I think we we should notice that
 

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.310
all I think we we should notice that
climate change this is not only the

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320
climate change this is not only the
 

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.200
climate change this is not only the
physical climate changes we're talking

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:51.210
physical climate changes we're talking
 

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:54.530
physical climate changes we're talking
about it's also risk connected words for

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540
about it's also risk connected words for
 

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.570
about it's also risk connected words for
example changes in policy that could

01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580
example changes in policy that could
 

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.000
example changes in policy that could
come quite fast it could be changes in

01:14:59.000 --> 01:14:59.010
come quite fast it could be changes in
 

01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:00.690
come quite fast it could be changes in
regulations

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:00.700
regulations
 

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.420
regulations
and also very important as well changes

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:03.430
and also very important as well changes
 

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:06.300
and also very important as well changes
in consumer preferences this could come

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:06.310
in consumer preferences this could come
 

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:08.550
in consumer preferences this could come
overnight and change the way the capital

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560
overnight and change the way the capital
 

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.280
overnight and change the way the capital
is flowing very fast so this kind of

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:11.290
is flowing very fast so this kind of
 

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.740
is flowing very fast so this kind of
risks we have to incorporate in our

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:13.750
risks we have to incorporate in our
 

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:17.190
risks we have to incorporate in our
models so what's the problem actually by

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:17.200
models so what's the problem actually by
 

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.280
models so what's the problem actually by
doing this at the moment I think the

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:20.290
doing this at the moment I think the
 

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.950
doing this at the moment I think the
short-term way the financial market is

01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960
short-term way the financial market is
 

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.470
short-term way the financial market is
working we're thinking about Walkley

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480
working we're thinking about Walkley
 

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.540
working we're thinking about Walkley
results we're thinking about half a

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:27.550
results we're thinking about half a
 

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:30.510
results we're thinking about half a
year's results annual results but they

01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520
year's results annual results but they
 

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.910
year's results annual results but they
don't necessarily pick up the changes we

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:32.920
don't necessarily pick up the changes we
 

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.640
don't necessarily pick up the changes we
see in the climate in the society as

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:35.650
see in the climate in the society as
 

01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:38.100
see in the climate in the society as
such so we need to have a longer horizon

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:38.110
such so we need to have a longer horizon
 

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.940
such so we need to have a longer horizon
when we measure risk and how should we

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:41.950
when we measure risk and how should we
 

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.610
when we measure risk and how should we
do that then I think it's important to

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:44.620
do that then I think it's important to
 

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.900
do that then I think it's important to
look first of all you have to look at

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:45.910
look first of all you have to look at
 

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.630
look first of all you have to look at
the taxonomy the way we are referring to

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640
the taxonomy the way we are referring to
 

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.150
the taxonomy the way we are referring to
things when you talk about green when

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:51.160
things when you talk about green when
 

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.400
things when you talk about green when
you talk about sustainability when I

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:53.410
you talk about sustainability when I
 

01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:54.930
you talk about sustainability when I
talk about green and we're going to talk

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:54.940
talk about green and we're going to talk
 

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.030
talk about green and we're going to talk
about sustainability it has to be the

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040
about sustainability it has to be the
 

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:57.720
about sustainability it has to be the
same thing

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:57.730
same thing
 

01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.870
same thing
otherwise it's confusing it can be green

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880
otherwise it's confusing it can be green
 

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.720
otherwise it's confusing it can be green
washing so we need to have a common of

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:03.730
washing so we need to have a common of
 

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.850
washing so we need to have a common of
reference of what green and sustainable

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:05.860
reference of what green and sustainable
 

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.390
reference of what green and sustainable
is but then we have to have goals old

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400
is but then we have to have goals old
 

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.000
is but then we have to have goals old
goals because we need to see the capital

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.010
goals because we need to see the capital
 

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:15.630
goals because we need to see the capital
moving faster so far it's a lot of talk

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:15.640
moving faster so far it's a lot of talk
 

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.430
moving faster so far it's a lot of talk
but we haven't really seen the big

01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440
but we haven't really seen the big
 

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.710
but we haven't really seen the big
changes coming so we need to have goals

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:19.720
changes coming so we need to have goals
 

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.440
changes coming so we need to have goals
we need to have a taxonomy and we also

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:22.450
we need to have a taxonomy and we also
 

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:26.700
we need to have a taxonomy and we also
have to measure the risk and to be able

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:26.710
have to measure the risk and to be able
 

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.520
have to measure the risk and to be able
to do so I also think that we have to

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:29.530
to do so I also think that we have to
 

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:33.450
to do so I also think that we have to
have a more open and clear reporting so

01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:33.460
have a more open and clear reporting so
 

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.550
have a more open and clear reporting so
so that actually you can follow up of

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560
so that actually you can follow up of
 

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.130
so that actually you can follow up of
what we are doing and we also have to be

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:38.140
what we are doing and we also have to be
 

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.160
what we are doing and we also have to be
more transparent because if you're going

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:41.170
more transparent because if you're going
 

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:43.650
more transparent because if you're going
to see where actually we are investing

01:16:43.650 --> 01:16:43.660
to see where actually we are investing
 

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.860
to see where actually we are investing
money how we are managing your money it

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:46.870
money how we are managing your money it
 

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.020
money how we are managing your money it
could be your pension money it could be

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:49.030
could be your pension money it could be
 

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:51.030
could be your pension money it could be
your saving money or it could be the

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040
your saving money or it could be the
 

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.010
your saving money or it could be the
money for big corporations in there and

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:53.020
money for big corporations in there and
 

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.230
money for big corporations in there and
investors you need to know what we're

01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:55.240
investors you need to know what we're
 

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.230
investors you need to know what we're
doing so we need we need much more

01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:58.240
doing so we need we need much more
 

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.660
doing so we need we need much more
transparency to see how the capital is

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:00.670
transparency to see how the capital is
 

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.090
transparency to see how the capital is
moving and in that kind of sense I think

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:03.100
moving and in that kind of sense I think
 

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.770
moving and in that kind of sense I think
it's also important to look at how we

01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:04.780
it's also important to look at how we
 

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.620
it's also important to look at how we
could use technology imagine how good it

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:07.630
could use technology imagine how good it
 

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.240
could use technology imagine how good it
would be if you have your mobile phone

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:09.250
would be if you have your mobile phone
 

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.240
would be if you have your mobile phone
with an app and if you push that app you

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:12.250
with an app and if you push that app you
 

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:14.550
with an app and if you push that app you
actually see what would be the climate

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560
actually see what would be the climate

and of course when you have two big

01:18:45.810 --> 01:18:45.820
and of course when you have two big
 

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.600
and of course when you have two big

course there is another risk because

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:54.730
course there is another risk because
 

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.400
course there is another risk because
he's saying that actually the cost of

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:56.410
he's saying that actually the cost of
 

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:58.920
he's saying that actually the cost of
producing solar power wind power is

01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:58.930
producing solar power wind power is
 

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.590
producing solar power wind power is
decreasing very sharply and very fast

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600
decreasing very sharply and very fast
 

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.840
decreasing very sharply and very fast
soon these energy sources will be

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:03.850
soon these energy sources will be
 

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:06.840
soon these energy sources will be
competitive without any subsidies so of

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:06.850
competitive without any subsidies so of
 

01:19:06.850 --> 01:19:08.880
competitive without any subsidies so of
course staying in the fossil fuel for

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:08.890
course staying in the fossil fuel for
 

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:10.500
course staying in the fossil fuel for
too long actually could make your

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:10.510
too long actually could make your
 

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:13.200
too long actually could make your
investments not profitable you can

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:13.210
investments not profitable you can
 

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:14.700
investments not profitable you can
actually lose your money so it's

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:14.710
actually lose your money so it's
 

01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:16.770
actually lose your money so it's
important to get this shift in time

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:16.780
important to get this shift in time
 

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:20.390
important to get this shift in time
actually to be profitable in longer term

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400
actually to be profitable in longer term
 

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.380
actually to be profitable in longer term
but also a global climate changes

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:25.390
but also a global climate changes
 

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:28.530
but also a global climate changes
of course they are global that they are

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:28.540
of course they are global that they are
 

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.210
of course they are global that they are
infecting us and of course government

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:30.220
infecting us and of course government
 

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.790
infecting us and of course government
had to have a per share but we could

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800
had to have a per share but we could
 

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.180
had to have a per share but we could
also do something ourself I mean we as

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:36.190
also do something ourself I mean we as

scale for the local communities to
 

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.870
scale for the local communities to
welcome because the solutions are often

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880
welcome because the solutions are often
 

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.530
welcome because the solutions are often
local so how could we actually support

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:49.540
local so how could we actually support
 

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.500
local so how could we actually support
for example solar power in the local

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:52.510
for example solar power in the local
 

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:55.620
for example solar power in the local
environment women for example that would

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:55.630
environment women for example that would
 

01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:57.930
environment women for example that would
help women because it will make their

01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:57.940
help women because it will make their
 

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:01.590

the energy were using today as well are

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:03.970
the energy were using today as well are
 

01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:06.030
the energy were using today as well are
quite polluting so we see we can see

01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040
quite polluting so we see we can see
 

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.040
quite polluting so we see we can see
that we could increase the living

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.050
that we could increase the living
 

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:10.740
that we could increase the living

groups in that way we could try together
 

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.500
groups in that way we could try together
also reducing the risk working together

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:25.510
also reducing the risk working together

it's also a lot of the technology risk

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:34.330
it's also a lot of the technology risk
 

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:37.220
it's also a lot of the technology risk
but if you could share the risk with a

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:37.230
but if you could share the risk with a
 

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:41.850
but if you could share the risk with a
public company or a public fund we could

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:41.860
public company or a public fund we could
 

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.470
public company or a public fund we could
take some of the risk the public side

01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480
take some of the risk the public side
 

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.450
take some of the risk the public side
could take some of the risk we could

01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:45.460
could take some of the risk we could
 

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.120
could take some of the risk we could
actually generate more money into to

proposed is it the lack of knowledge

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:11.710
proposed is it the lack of knowledge
 

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:14.040
proposed is it the lack of knowledge
about the consequences is it the initial

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:14.050
about the consequences is it the initial
 

01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.650
about the consequences is it the initial
cost of switching to renewable energy is

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:16.660
cost of switching to renewable energy is
 

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:19.290
cost of switching to renewable energy is
it ineffective leadership is it lobbying

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:19.300
it ineffective leadership is it lobbying
 

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:21.900
it ineffective leadership is it lobbying
from large corporations or is it other

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:21.910
from large corporations or is it other
 

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:25.440
from large corporations or is it other
some other issue looking at the results

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:25.450
some other issue looking at the results
 

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.540
some other issue looking at the results
here I think we have a clear opinion

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:27.550
here I think we have a clear opinion
 

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:30.740
here I think we have a clear opinion
from the viewers in the audience that

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:30.750
from the viewers in the audience that
 

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:33.210
from the viewers in the audience that
ineffective leadership is something we

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:33.220
ineffective leadership is something we
 

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.460
ineffective leadership is something we
have to tackle

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:34.470
have to tackle
 

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:36.170
have to tackle
part of our leadership is in the

01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:36.180
part of our leadership is in the
 

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.340
part of our leadership is in the
audience so do you look to the poll but

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:40.350
audience so do you look to the poll but
 

01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:43.040
audience so do you look to the poll but
I will post this question now to our

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:43.050
I will post this question now to our
 

01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:44.600
I will post this question now to our
audience I will propose you two

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:44.610
audience I will propose you two
 

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.930
audience I will propose you two
questions at the same time first what do

01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:47.940
questions at the same time first what do
 

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.220
questions at the same time first what do
you think is the greatest barrier to

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:49.230
you think is the greatest barrier to
 

01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:51.790
you think is the greatest barrier to
climate action at the moment and

01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800
climate action at the moment and
 

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.510
climate action at the moment and
personally how worried are you about the

01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520
personally how worried are you about the
 

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.070
personally how worried are you about the
future for the earth and for our climate

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080
future for the earth and for our climate
 

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.200
future for the earth and for our climate
so let's go back to Professor Winkleman

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:00.210
so let's go back to Professor Winkleman
 

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.330
so let's go back to Professor Winkleman
first maybe starting with your last

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340
first maybe starting with your last
 

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:05.300
first maybe starting with your last
question first I am a stubborn optimist

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:05.310
question first I am a stubborn optimist
 

01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:08.120
question first I am a stubborn optimist
but I'm a stubborn optimist for a reason

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:08.130
but I'm a stubborn optimist for a reason
 

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.550
but I'm a stubborn optimist for a reason
so I always listen to the voice of

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560
so I always listen to the voice of
 

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.560
so I always listen to the voice of
science the voice of physics and the

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:12.570
science the voice of physics and the
 

01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:15.380
science the voice of physics and the
voice of reason and within myself and so

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:15.390
voice of reason and within myself and so
 

01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:17.990
voice of reason and within myself and so
I have good reason to be optimistic and

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000
I have good reason to be optimistic and
 

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.790
I have good reason to be optimistic and
some of those reasons were actually

01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800
some of those reasons were actually
 

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.790
some of those reasons were actually
pointed out by the panel just now we

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800
pointed out by the panel just now we
 

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.680
pointed out by the panel just now we
actually know what the solutions are and

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:24.690
actually know what the solutions are and
 

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.020
actually know what the solutions are and
I'm quite surprised I mean 10 years ago

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:27.030
I'm quite surprised I mean 10 years ago
 

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:29.480
I'm quite surprised I mean 10 years ago
who would have thought that for instance

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:29.490
who would have thought that for instance
 

01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:31.280
who would have thought that for instance
solar and wind energy would be scalable

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:31.290
solar and wind energy would be scalable
 

01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.470
solar and wind energy would be scalable
as we see it now who would have thought

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480
as we see it now who would have thought
 

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.550
as we see it now who would have thought
that electric vehicles which sort of

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560
that electric vehicles which sort of
 

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.130
that electric vehicles which sort of
flood flood the world in the way that

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:40.140
flood flood the world in the way that
 

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:43.220
flood flood the world in the way that
they are doing and so all of those

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:43.230
they are doing and so all of those
 

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.350
they are doing and so all of those
reasons are good reasons to be

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360
reasons are good reasons to be
 

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.680
reasons are good reasons to be
optimistic and so while I think the

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:48.690
optimistic and so while I think the
 

01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:51.230
optimistic and so while I think the
climate problem is very severe and calls

01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:51.240
climate problem is very severe and calls
 

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.930
climate problem is very severe and calls
for collective action and something that

01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940
for collective action and something that
 

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.450
for collective action and something that
we all need to work on I think it's

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460
we all need to work on I think it's
 

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.370
we all need to work on I think it's
important to also point out that we have

01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380
important to also point out that we have
 

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.020
important to also point out that we have
good reason to believe in these

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.030
good reason to believe in these
 

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:03.790
good reason to believe in these
solutions and to be optimistic thank you

01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800
solutions and to be optimistic thank you
 

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.340
solutions and to be optimistic thank you
well first of all if if you look at

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:07.350
well first of all if if you look at
 

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:09.860
well first of all if if you look at
government's I think or leadership I

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:09.870
government's I think or leadership I
 

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:13.070
government's I think or leadership I
think it's also a bit of short-termism

01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080
think it's also a bit of short-termism
 

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.470
think it's also a bit of short-termism
within leadership and governments

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480
within leadership and governments
 

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.480
within leadership and governments
because often politicians they're

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:17.490
because often politicians they're
 

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:19.720
because often politicians they're
elected for a certain period of time and

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.730
elected for a certain period of time and
 

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:23.450
elected for a certain period of time and
the same with boards boards are also

01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.460
the same with boards boards are also
 

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:26.420
the same with boards boards are also
elected often for a certain period of

01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:26.430
elected often for a certain period of
 

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:29.510
elected often for a certain period of
time and you don't be want sometimes to

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520
time and you don't be want sometimes to
 

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.730
time and you don't be want sometimes to
be too radical because if you're too

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:31.740
be too radical because if you're too
 

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.150
be too radical because if you're too
radical you make two large changes maybe

01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:35.160
radical you make two large changes maybe
 

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.060
radical you make two large changes maybe
not elected to the next time so in that

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:38.070
not elected to the next time so in that
 

01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:39.830
not elected to the next time so in that
kind of way I think this short-term

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840
kind of way I think this short-term
 

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.750
kind of way I think this short-term
thinking is not only in the financial

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760
thinking is not only in the financial
 

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.790
thinking is not only in the financial
industry but it could also be a

01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800
industry but it could also be a
 

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.670
industry but it could also be a
bottleneck within the politics in and

01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:46.680
bottleneck within the politics in and
 

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.050
bottleneck within the politics in and
also in the

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060
also in the
 

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.330
also in the
wardroom and that's why we have to end

01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340
wardroom and that's why we have to end
 

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.670
wardroom and that's why we have to end
that we had to rethink the way we're

01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:52.680
that we had to rethink the way we're
 

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.680
that we had to rethink the way we're
actually thinking about climate and risk

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:56.690
actually thinking about climate and risk
 

01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:59.390
actually thinking about climate and risk
but moving on to the second question I

01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400
but moving on to the second question I
 

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.820
but moving on to the second question I
so much happening in the financial

01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:01.830
so much happening in the financial
 

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.100
so much happening in the financial
sector now it really gives me hope and

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:04.110
sector now it really gives me hope and
 

01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:06.710
sector now it really gives me hope and
it's also fun to work with because it's

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:06.720
it's also fun to work with because it's
 

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.480
it's also fun to work with because it's
an important sector to actually get a

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:08.490
an important sector to actually get a
 

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:11.150
an important sector to actually get a
shift going and it's fun to do this

01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:11.160
shift going and it's fun to do this
 

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.890
shift going and it's fun to do this
because we have to set a new direction

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900
because we have to set a new direction
 

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.340
because we have to set a new direction
we have to close the gap and how to

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:16.350
we have to close the gap and how to
 

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:20.210
we have to close the gap and how to
align our financial business models with

01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:20.220
align our financial business models with
 

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.190
align our financial business models with
the Paris agreement and with the United

Nations recurrent requirements so I

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280
Nations recurrent requirements so I
 

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.400
Nations recurrent requirements so I
think you know I'm optimistic that this

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:28.410
think you know I'm optimistic that this
 

01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.230
think you know I'm optimistic that this
is changing and actually see you know

01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:30.240
is changing and actually see you know
 

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.510
is changing and actually see you know
the push coming now from the financial

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520
the push coming now from the financial
 

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.520
the push coming now from the financial
sector and in that way I hope thank you

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:36.530
sector and in that way I hope thank you
 

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:40.310
sector and in that way I hope thank you

they're what we're facing now is the
lacking of funds financial constraint if

lacking of funds financial constraint if
 

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.410
lacking of funds financial constraint if
you take for example step again on mr.
