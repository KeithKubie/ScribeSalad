MALE SPEAKER: We essentially
tried to reimagine classic

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.820
advertising as if it
was done today.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.300
We're looking at the brands most
iconic [? working, ?] and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.690
we couldn't screw that up.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.260
Everyone could relate
to Ralph sitting on

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.510
the side of his bed.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.170
So, what are the tools that
are available to us that

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.340
really allow us to showcase
relevancy?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.360
We identified a list of about 20
things that we thought sort

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.930
of from a creative and
technology standpoint would be

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.690
really amazing.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.620
A lot of the stuff that we did
in desktop can't be done in

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.780
mobile in the same way.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.240
And so thinking about both of
those platforms at the same

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.505
time so we only solve
the problem once.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.910
There was a constant push-pull,
and I think a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.338
healthy one.

00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:56.690
The ads didn't actually
run in media.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.360
They ran for Google.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.660
The metric, though, is whether
we could get people to engage

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.440
and do so in a way that
reimagined that

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.725
ad and did it justice.

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:09.280
If you look at this as a resize
of a website, if you

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.340
look at it as a resize of a
print ad, then you're not

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.240
doing with the media what it's
capable of doing, and you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.320
won't see any of the types of
things that you really expect

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.040
to get out of it.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.780
But if know what those things
are, if you know that this is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.750
a channel that does things that
no other channel does,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.695
you can create creative for
that, and see it perform

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:30.945
remarkably well.
