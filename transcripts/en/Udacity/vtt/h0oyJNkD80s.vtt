00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, if your data falls onto, say, a curve like this,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and this here is your mean, then you can think of the spread--this one over here--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as your standard deviation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The formula that gives you this as the mean is the now-familiar formula of the sum

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of the data points divided by the size of the data set.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The variance--often written σ² is the sum of our data points normalized by the mean to the square.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then from that it follows that the standard deviation is just the square root of σ².

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
These are the formulas that you just applied, and I hope you recognize them.
