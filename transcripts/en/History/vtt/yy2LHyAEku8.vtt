00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.530
NARRATOR: A mid-season melt

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.630
for a hunt.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.230
But today, Jake Herrick
isn't chasing lions.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.400
He's tracking his next meal.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.370
JAKE HERRICK: I got
an empty freezer,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.830
and I definitely need to get
some really good, clean meat.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.570
NARRATOR: Mule deer are known
to graze at high altitudes

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230
where the terrain is steepest.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.430
I'm trying to find my
way through the rocks here.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.330
It looks like I found a spot I
can finally crawl through here.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.700
NARRATOR: Jake's betting that
the receding snow has reopened

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.230
their feeding ground 6,000
feet up the mountain,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.630
but not for long.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.270
Once the deep freeze returns,
the herd will be out of reach.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.300
Trying to find a spot
I can poke through.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.230
This country is rugged as heck.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.100
You don't want to make
a slip and a fall.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.400
Oh, [bleep]!

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.470
[sighs]

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.870
Close call there.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.870
Lost my footing a little bit.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.670
All right.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.870
I'm at the top of the hill.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
I just need to make my way
down to this rock point,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.470
do some glass, and hopefully
I can get them spotted.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.570
Oh, shoot, right there
sneaking out of the brush

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.530
there, chasing that doe.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.700
Let's see if I can't
sneak down somewhere

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.600
and get a shot at them.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
That doe is just streaking
across the hillside

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.970
with the buck hot on her tail.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.630
I'm thinking they're going to
end up out on this point here.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.430
I'm going to work my way
down to this little rock knob

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.570
and get set up to shoot, see
if we can't get that buck.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.070
NARRATOR: In the
steep and jagged peaks

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.730
of the Tobacco Route
Mountains, Jake's

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.200
moving in to get a clean shot.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.200
They're feeding across
that hillside over there.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.830
NARRATOR: He's been chasing
the mule deer for three hours.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.770
And now, still 100
yards out of range,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.530
he can't risk letting
the opportunity pass.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.770
All right.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.370
They're working their way
up towards that ridge there.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.970
The buck is following the doe.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.700
[gunshot]

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.570
Well, it looks like a good hit.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.600
Doesn't look like she's
quite tipping over yet.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.500
NARRATOR: Big game like
this 200-pound buck

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.130
get a surge of
adrenaline when wounded,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.530
enough to run for several
minutes after a hit.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.500
Damn it.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.100
He's heading up over the hill.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.700
NARRATOR: At this
distance, there's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.030
no way to confirm a kill.
- All right.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.670
I better get over that ridge
and get up buck tracked down.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.970
Just hoping we can turn up
some blood here somewhere

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.800
and track him down.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.270
This area right
here is about where

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.300
I thought he was standing.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.570
He could be anywhere out here.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.330
They usually tend to go
downhill when they're shot.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.630
They'll try to find a hole
or something to lay in.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.670
There he is.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.670
Woo!

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.630
All right.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.270
We got us a nice, mature buck.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.130
He's got a nice body on
him, lots of good meat.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.230
NARRATOR: The
full-size buck will

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.170
provide nearly 70
pounds of meat to last

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.700
through the end of winter.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.100
But breaking down such a large
kill takes a skilled hand.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.870
We don't want to be out here
after dark with fresh meat

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.930
on our back.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.600
There's bears and
mountain lions out here,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.000
and it's a wild place
with wild animals.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.700
This was their home, and
meat is what they eat.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.330
When I butcher my deer,
the processing of it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.900
is just something I love to do.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.100
This, to me, is
what keeps me going.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.130
There's nothing like outsmarting
the smartest animals out there,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.030
and doing it yourself.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.100
All right.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.400
Over the mountain I go.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.230
This nice buck here
is going to provide me

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.730
with a lot of good meat through
the wintertime to keep me out

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.630
and about running lions and
keep me chasing them hound dogs.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.730
Got a lot of work ahead of me.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.030
The work has just begun.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.000
And we'll be back at
it again tomorrow.
