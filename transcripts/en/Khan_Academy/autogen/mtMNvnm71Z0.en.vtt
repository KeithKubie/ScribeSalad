00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.920
 In this video I would like to exercise 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.140
 finding the face of the surface of a body 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.060
 by decomposing its main parts into so-called unwrapping. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.860
 One way to achieve this is 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 imagine that the given body 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 is made of cardboard. 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.740
 Imagine we're cutting 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.740
 right where I paint, 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740
 and also here, 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.740
 and here; also here. 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.320
 and back where it is not visible at the moment. 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 The body will unfold in shape, 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.960
 similar to what I paint. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.080
 When we unfold this body, 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.100
 we see it much easier 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.720
 to understand how his face is. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
 The face of the given body 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 is the sum of the persons 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 of its constituent elements. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360
 Well, let's decide where to start. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.960
 How much is the surface of this body that I mark? 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.620
 If we look at the run, 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 this body responds to that person. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740
 We see that this is a triangle 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.020
 with base 12 and height 8. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.020
 So the face will be equal 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.380
 1/2 of the base, which is 12, 8, that is, the height. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.640
 This is the same as 6, multiplied by 8, 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.740
 which is equal to 48 square units, 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.400
 depending on what square units are used. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.400
 The same is the face of the second triangle of the stroke. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.500
 We can not see the second triangle of the picture, 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.960
 which I drew, 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.700
 but if it was transparent, 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.680
 this would be this triangle, 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.040
 also equal to 48 square units. 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 Now we can find the face of - 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's call them the side panels. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.500
 This is a side panel 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.900
 with a height of 14 and a width of 10, 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.380
 and here is the second side panel. 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.600
 We see that this height is the same 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 like the panel on the right - 14. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.660
 This panel is the same as this one, 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.380
 and the other is from the country we do not see. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.980
 The face of each of these panels 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.600
 will be 14 by 10 = 140 square units. 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.420
 And finally we have to find the face of the base. 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.040
 This is the area here that I color. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.140
 Here's that face. 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.800
 The face will be the height multiplied by the width, 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.380
 or 12, multiplied by 14. 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 If we multiply this in mind, it will be equal to 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.180
 12 by 12 = 144, plus 12 by 4 = 24, 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080
 there is a total of 168. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.300
 Therefore, the total area 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.400
 will be equal to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 48 + 48, 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 which is 96, 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 plus two side panels, 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
 the sum of the persons of which is 280. 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 We write the number below 96 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400
 and we remain the foundation, 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 which is 168. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.220
 I want to write it in the same color. 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.120
 168. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.940
 And by gathering these three numbers, 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.360
 we get the face on the surface of the whole body. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.260
 I think it's very useful to unroll the body 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 and to form this crawl, 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 to have a visual idea of 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300
 all components. 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.900
 6 + 0 + 8 = 14 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.780
 We carry one in mind, 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.200
 we get 1 + 9 equals 10, 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 plus 8 is 18, plus 6 is 24; we record 4, 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.800
 transfer 4 and collect 2 + 1, 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.420
 we get 5. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.200
 So the face of the surface of the whole body is 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.560
 544 square units.
