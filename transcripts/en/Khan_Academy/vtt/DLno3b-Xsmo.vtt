00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.580
How many hours are
in 549 minutes?

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.120
And we can write it as
a decimal or a fraction.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.860
So essentially, we're
going to take 549 minutes

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.210
and divide them
into groups of 60.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.370
Why 60?

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.030
Because we know that one
hour is equal to 60 minutes.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.020
So it's essentially saying, how
many groups of 60 minutes can

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.220
we divide 549 into.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.780
Or another way of
thinking about that

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.590
is, well, what is 549
divided into groups of 60.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.090
This is how many hours
we're going to have.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.300
So let's do that.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.290
Let's take 549 and
divide it by 60.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.670
So let's see, 6 goes
into 54 9 times.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.359
So 60 is going to
go into 540 9 times.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.150
We're going to have a
little bit left over.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.080
So we have 9 times 60 is 540.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.270
We subtract.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.695
We have 9 left over.

00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:07.120
And now let's see, we
have a little left over,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.453
so we're going to get a decimal.

00:01:08.453 --> 00:01:11.060
So let's put a decimal
place right over here

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.580
and let's throw
some 0's over there.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.220
Let's bring down a 0.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.400
So we bring down a 0.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
60 goes into 90 1 time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.390
1 times 60 is 60.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.250
And we subtract.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.510
We get 30.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.130
Let's bring down another 0.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.822
And so we get to 300.

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:30.690
60 goes into 300 5 times.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.660
5 times 60, 6 times 6 is
30, so 5 times 60 is 300.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.390
Subtract and we are done.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.110
So you divide 549
into groups of 60.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.960
You can divide it into
9.15 groups of 60 minutes.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.720
A group of 60
minutes is an hour.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.650
So this 549 minutes
is 9.15 hours.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.340
I want to make sure that we
can visualize that properly.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.490
So let's actually construct
what 9.15 hours looks like.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.240
So let me draw a little
line here, and on the top

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.660
I'll label Hours, and on the
bottom I'll label Minutes.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.820
So this is 0 hours, 0 minutes.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.520
And now we have 1 hour,
which is 60 minutes.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.860
Now we have 2 hours,
which is 120 minutes.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.880
Then you have 3 hours,
which is 180 minutes.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.170
Then you have 4 hours,
which is 240 minutes.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.810
5 hours is 300 minutes.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.770
6 hours is 360 minutes.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.111
7 hours, I might be running out
of space, is for 420 minutes.

00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:44.860
Let me copy and paste
this someplace where

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.900
I have more real estate.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.580
So let me clear that.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.090
And then let me
paste that someplace

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.400
where I don't run into
my other math that I did.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.530
All right.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.980
So then you have 8
hours is 480 minutes.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.070
And then you have 9 hours.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.570
Notice, I'm just adding
60 minutes every time.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.099
9 hours is 540 minutes.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.140
Or another way you could
think about it is, well,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.700
if each hour is 60,
9 times 60 is 540.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.710
And we don't want
to go to just 540.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.260
We have another 9 left.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.320
So then we have to go another
9 minutes to go to 549.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.120
So you have 9 minutes left over.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.550
So another way of thinking about
this, is that 549 is 9 hours.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.450
And then you have 9
minutes left over.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.160
And 9 minutes is what
fraction of an hour?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, 60 minutes
is a whole hour.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.289
So 9 minutes is 9/60 of an hour.

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:50.580
So you could write it this way.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.150
It's 9 and 9/60 hours.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.720
Or we could write this as
an equivalent fraction.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.200
9/60 is the same
thing if we divide

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.070
the numerator and
the denominator by 3,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.060
is the same thing as 3/20.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.230
So we could write
this as 9 and 3/20.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.510
And 3/20, well we could figure
out what that is going to be.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.292
Let's see, 20 divided by 3.

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:16.750
It's definitely
going to be smaller

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.390
than 1, because 3
is smaller than 20.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.450
So let's throw some 0's on here.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.300
20 doesn't go into 3, but
it does go into 30 1 time.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.200
1 times 20 is 20.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.620
Subtract, we get a 10.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.650
Bring down a 0.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.270
20 goes into 100 5 times.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.650
5 times 20 is 100.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.730
And we are done.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.780
So notice, 3 over 20 is
the exact same thing.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.840
So 9 and 3/20 is the exact
same thing as 9 and 15/100.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.605
These are all
equivalent answers.
