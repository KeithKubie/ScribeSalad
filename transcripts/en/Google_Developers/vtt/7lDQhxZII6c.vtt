00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.400
PAUL: Hi guys.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.630
I'm Paul Kinlan and I'd
like to introduce Alex

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.252
[? Krymovsky, ?]

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.056
who is a product-- you're a
product manager, right?

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:18.410
ALEX: Yes, product manager
on the web platform.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.090
PAUL: Cool, on the
web platform.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.990
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630
And I'm working, well, actually,
we are both working

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.170
on the Web Intents project.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.250
Today this is the first of our,
hopefully, biweekly, or

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.830
fortnightly, as we say in the
UK at least, series of Web

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.000
Intents Wednesdays.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.520
It's not every single
Wednesday.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.290
We want to try and kick start
the community, and kick start,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.300
basically the hype.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.930
What kind of what's
happening inside

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.860
the developer community.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.910
What's happening
with the apps.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.510
What's happening with
Web Intents.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.000
And just find a generally
friendly way to actually get

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.890
in contact with you, the
developers, building

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.710
applications on the web today.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.850
Who are interested
in Web Intents.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.980
Who want to know what
it's all about.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.625
And, yeah, let's go from here.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.300
So, we have a little bit of a
technical snag at the moment.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.120
We wanted to give you a nice
demonstration of what Web

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.110
Intents are.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.550
And, show you some
applications.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.160
But, unfortunately, the software
that I'm using,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.250
decided to start working about
three or four minutes before

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.930
the presentation.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.960
So, my apologies.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.470
The next time we do this, we'll
give you a better set of

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.190
demonstrations, and, hopefully,
show some

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.100
applications that all
the developers have

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.090
built in the ecosystem.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.400
But in the meantime, we must as
well just get started, and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.740
talk about what Web
Intents are.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.800
Hopefully, Alex will be able
to grill me with all of the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.715
questions that US developers
also my interested with.

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.350
ALEX: Yep, so I'll be playing
the role of you, basically, in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.500
this interview, asking him all
the hard questions as far as

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.210
to channel what you'd be
asking, hopefully.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.430
PAUL: Cool.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.490
So we also do have
a moderator page.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.272
It's on our Google developer's
live moderator.

00:01:50.272 --> 00:01:52.720
So, if you just go to our
YouTube channel and see this

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.570
event, you'll be able to
go and ask questions.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.540
We do have a really set of
questions that we're going to

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.710
try and ask, answer or ask
answer a little bit later.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.280
But, anyway, we'll start
with an introduction.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.190
So, like many people, you might
have heard a little bit

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.050
about Web Intents, but are
not actually quite

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.250
sure what it is.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.920
So, Web Intends is basically
a standard, or

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.840
not standard, sorry.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.650
Not standard yet.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910
It's a specification that's
built into Chrome that we are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.880
working on with the W3C at the
moment, to actually help

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.780
application developers be
able to integrate their

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.750
applications a lot
more easily.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.830
Right now application
developers, if they want to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.380
build an application, I don't
know, that talks to Twitter,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.290
or some other remote kind of
sharing service, you have to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.760
normally do a deep
integration.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.510
You know, the user not only
has to install a piece of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.800
software, whether it's a
bookmarklet, or some other

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.695
kind of widget to actually
have the share happen.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:45.040
And Web Intents is designed to
kind of say, well you could

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.210
use to develop but you can't
actually build all these deep

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.410
integrations into your
application.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.460
You can't support every single
social network that lives on

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.900
the open web today.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.770
But you want to give your users
control, give your users

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.610
some flexibility to be able to
choose the services that they

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.170
want to use for these actions
across the web.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.950
Now, the interesting thing is
at the Web Intents API is

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.360
designed to kind of slightly
dis-intermediate some of the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.280
APR integrations.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.940
You don't have to have a deep
integration to be able talk to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340
the remote services.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.430
And just before we continue, I'm
just going to move this,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.190
because, it turns out, I
composition cameras very well

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.560
for our presentations.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.870
And now, Alex is out
of the shot.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.850
So here we go.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.430
That's a little bit better.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.520
At least it should look like
I'm looking at you, rather

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.670
than at some person
behind the screen.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.870
So I apologize.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410
So, Web Intents is just a simple
APR that allows us to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.480
build applications that talk to
each other way more easily

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.470
than it is right now.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.340
We would normally show
a demonstration, but

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.125
unfortunately, because the
screen sharing doesn't work.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.200
And It is my machine, and
it's all my fault.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.320
It's not a problem with
the actual software.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.420
We can't shoot a nice little
demonstration.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.400
So, I tell you what.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.730
Should we talk about some
of the news, things--

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.964
ALEX: Yeah, let's talk about
what's happened in the last

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:56.300
couple of weeks.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.820
PAUL: Yeah, OK.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.310
Cool.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.615
So in the past couple of weeks
what's kind of happened with

00:03:59.615 --> 00:03:59.980
Web Intents.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.270
Well, I think the first and the
biggest thing, for me at

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.450
least, was we did a presentation
at Google I/O. It

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.200
Is on our YouTube channel at the
moment if you want to go

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.070
and check it out.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.150
And actually, there you will
see demonstrations that are

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.890
live, that we did on stage,
using the Web Intents API.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.560
So, we do have a presentation.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.540
We also had a really kind of
interesting meeting with W3C,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.839
where I wasn't actually present,
I was on the phone

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.380
call at the time, where we were
kind to talking about how

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.150
we can basically integrate
further

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.890
API's into Web Intents.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.392
I'm going to share the links,
the notes, because the notes

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:34.170
are publicly available, but
not many people read them.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.661
So, just after this presentation
I'm going to

00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:36.630
share the notes.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.570
The interesting thing is that
it's interesting to see the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.455
types of APIs that want to
integrate with Web Intents, so

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:45.630
if people want be able to pick
media, or picks contact from

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.120
your particular device, so let's
say, it's your phone.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.970
You want to be able to pick
a contact from your phone.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.690
And the best way to do it, well
maybe, not the best of it

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.990
right now, but the best way
we're thinking about doing it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.800
is by the Web Intents API.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.470
So you can basically say, you
know, i need to pick a contact

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.220
from my address book.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.420
Your address book on your phone
could actually live as

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.370
the physical address book, but
it could also be Google

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.410
contacts, it could be whatever,
it can have services

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.852
support on the web,
that support to be

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:12.020
able to pick contacts.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.610
So that's one of the areas
that we talked about.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.530
And also picking
media as well.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.900
So, the idea is your phone
might have a gallery, you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.340
might have a gallery
of your favorite

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.280
photos on the web somewhere.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.540
You know, you should be able
to pick that photo, or any

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.366
kind of media from those devices
and actually be able

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:27.060
to manipulate in such
application.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.370
ALEX: I think, the point here
is that Web Intents is not

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.310
just one singular API, it's
actually enabler with lots of

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.740
other stuff.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.130
PAUL: Yeah.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.700
ALEX: So, people are really
starting to discuss,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.170
especially right now in W3C and
other standards bodies and

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.820
groups, how they could use this
plumbing of Web Intents

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.620
to connect up applications with
other things, like media

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.988
galleries and that
kind of stuff.

00:05:44.988 --> 00:05:46.620
PAUL: Yeah, that's the kind
of interesting thing.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.360
We all talk about
sharing data.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.480
You know, to be able to share a
link to a social network is

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.610
one of the key APIs.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.350
But that's actually one of
really small facet of what Web

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.650
Intents is trying to do.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.990
You know, we want to connect
applications based on an

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.930
action, so the user wants
to perform some

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.280
action on the web.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.610
They want to edit
an image, right.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.970
Well, they want to kind of
pick a document from some

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.780
cloud file storage solution.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.560
They should be generalized
actions by an API, which

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.190
hopefully is Web Intents, to be
able to just let you say,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.810
well, my application I need to
pick an image from somewhere

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.670
on the web.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.356
It could be on your hard drive,
it could be on your

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:20.970
cloud file storage solution.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.226
We've got some Chrome
extensions, which I'll want to

00:06:23.226 --> 00:06:25.610
share out a little bit later,
which let you pick an image

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.580
from an individual tab, that's
running inside your browser.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.370
Which is kind of cool, right?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.100
I mean picking an image from
another web page that's

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.560
actually inside your browser,
is actually a

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.000
pretty complex task.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.090
You find the image, you right
click it, download it

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.310
somewhere, and upload it into
another application.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.540
ALEX: I do it all the time.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.460
PAUL: Yeah, I mean, everyone's
got this download's directory

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.890
that's just full of--

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.190
whoa, I was going to say
a rude word-- rubbish.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.840
it's just full of things,
you know, it's just like

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.440
[INAUDIBLE] basically.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.180
You just download it, you never
delete it, you never get

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.640
around to, because your
applications aren't

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.840
integrated.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.706
So, yeah it's not just share,
it's pick, it's edit, it's the

00:06:57.706 --> 00:07:00.037
ability to say, I need to
edit this image just to

00:07:00.037 --> 00:07:01.570
remove some red eye.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.690
You have to find an application
that supports

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.970
image editing, and you'll be
able to send the data there

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.690
and pull it back.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.950
So next week I'll show you--
well, not next week, the next

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.110
time we do this in two weeks
time, I'll show you a proper

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.030
demonstration about how
old all this hooks up.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.650
And I'll actually show you the
code as well, because it's

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.570
actually really simple.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.460
ALEX: It's surprisingly simple
to get this to work.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.830
PAUL: Yeah, so the demo that
we have is on [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.730
It's like twenty lines of code
with four different actions.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.982
ALEX: So you can wait for two
weeks to see the demo, or you

00:07:31.982 --> 00:07:35.795
can just check out the I/O
video, which shows off the

00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:37.990
demo, more complicated demo
has all [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.370
PAUL: And it also shows a really
cool presentation of--

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.060
I say presentation, a picture
of when I prove I invented

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.270
Google glass.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.890
Two or three years ago, right.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.790
You have to go check it out.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.000
Just check it out to see what
it's like, because, I think,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.120
it's pretty cool, but
no one believes me.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.420
Cool, so--

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.320
ALEX: Shall we do questions?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.310
ALEX: Yeah.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.540
We might as well jump
to the questions.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.350
We have about 10 questions
so far.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.370
ALEX: And just so
you know, again.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.420
The link to submit questions in
the Google Moderator page

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.700
is on the plus page.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.820
So, follow that link, submit
some questions and we'll walk

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.000
through these.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.570
PAUL: Yeah.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.710
I mean this week is very much
an experimentation week.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.010
We want to hear feedback from
you guys about what you want

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.190
to hear, what you want to see,
and just kind of the types of

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.510
information that you'd like
to get info, a kind of

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.180
bi-weekly round up.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.880
So, feel free to email me.
paulkinlan@googl.com.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.275
I'm very open to share
my email address, so

00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:33.559
it's not too bad.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.830
But, yeah, let's jump into
these questions.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.549
So the first question from x is
have you considered cross

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.650
Android Web Intents.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.030
Could you enable some interest
in these cases like being able

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.370
to directly launch into related
parts of a web app

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.680
from a related Android
app and vice versa.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.310
ALEX: I think, and we were just
talking about how there's

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.320
interest in W3C in using Web
Intents for all other things

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.960
to connect MediaStreams and
that kind of thing.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.770
And I think this is exactly
the same vein, right?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.590
Web Intents is very directly
inspired by Android intents.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.010
They work together relatively
nicely because they are

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.840
directly inspired, and you could
imagine all kinds of

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.930
really interesting use cases
they are connected to.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.820
So, I think, this is absolutely
a great idea.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.950
It's something really cool
that we'd love to do.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.100
But, right now, we
don't have it.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.675
PAUL: I mean, I right now,
we don't have it.

00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:27.120
It's something we or I'm
quite passionate about.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.940
However, we have a really big
problem on the web in the

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.780
sense that we can't connect
apps easily, right?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.320
We want to make sure the web
developers and apps on the web

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.985
at that moment get great
experience like an

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:39.660
interconnected experience.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.820
ALEX: So we're focusing
on making it

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.970
work in Chrome today.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.450
Implementing that spec that's
being discussed in W3C before

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.960
we move on to even bigger
and cooler things.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.854
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:50.854 --> 00:09:51.750
Android Intents.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.660
PAUL: I mean people on the W3C
at the moment have been

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.020
talking about trying to
integrate with TVs, right.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.870
So, you say I need to play a
video, I need to share a video

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.000
with something that
can play a video.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.290
You find Intent, you know the
browser, might be able to

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.820
discover a list of devices that
are connected to your

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.370
home network by UPnP
discovery.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.440
And send the video straight
out to that remote device,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.970
straight from you web app.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.670
ALEX: The possibilities
are really cool.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.940
There are a lot of really neat
use cases that are made.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.750
Very easy with Web Intents.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.926
A lot of people are looking
and are excited to

00:10:19.926 --> 00:10:20.490
build on top of.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.080
PAUL: Yeah, but we just
start now, right?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.130
ALEX: Just start now.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.550
PAUL: Is it right?

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.780
We've only been I
think publicly--

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.320
we announced it a year ago?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.770
ALEX: I think so.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:28.260
PAUL: I think about
a year ago.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.410
We've been working on new
implementations like Chrome,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.750
working with standards groups
as well to actually get this

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.990
off to a good level before we
can actually start thinking

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.930
about integrating externally.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.830
Ah, cool, so I hope that
answered the question.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.100
We also have another
question--

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.605
what browsers support
Web Intents?

00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:45.940
Ah Chrome.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.040
Chrome definitely supports Web
Intents from stable right

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.940
through its Canary.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.980
Obviously, Canary he's got some
of the latest things that

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.250
are happening inside the API.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.870
But it is actually on a stable
channel of Chrome.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.210
ALEX: I think one of the
important things to emphasize

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.330
here is that this standard Web
Intents, we're hoping one day

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.930
will become formal standard.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.330
But we're discussing it's an
active, it's a working draft

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.380
right now spec in the W3C.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.680
So although Chrome is the only
one that currently implements

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.580
it, we've been laying the
groundwork having discussions

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.180
with all the browser vendors
in the standards bodies to

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.780
make this something that other
browsers can one day

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.460
implement as well.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.710
PAUL: Yeah, I mean there's a
good implantation generally

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.030
inside WebKit as well now so,
the theory is that anyone who

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.600
implements WebKit could also an
implementation themselves

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.010
of Web Intents quite easily.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.100
ALEX: So, although, this is
currently only implemented in

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.460
Chrome, [INAUDIBLE], there's
hope other browsers

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.990
will pick this up.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.910
I should also too really quickly
that the implantation

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.750
we have in Chrome right
now is experimental.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.040
We know this API as developing
it is going through the

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.830
specification process as we're
talking to other browser

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.890
vendors, some things
might change.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.290
And right now, it's definitely,
we want to get it

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.350
out there, so that developers
can start using it, can start

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.230
showing off all the cool things
they can do with it.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.310
And help us develop and
evolve the spec.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.620
So--

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.960
PAUL: And we have
a shim as well.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.976
Which the shim works in
Internet Explorer 8?

00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:03.730
ALEX: Yeah.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.640
PAUL: 8 and above.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.950
Opera, I can't remember
which version.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.670
I know it works in the latest
version of Opera.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.180
It did work in Firefox, I need
to fix a book, because I

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.390
introduced Content Security
Policy, which I won't say is a

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.830
complete nightmare, but it's
harder to implement than other

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.950
kind of APIs at the moment.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.950
ALEX: So, basically, the shim
allows you, although Chrome

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.060
implements it currently directly
into the browser, the

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.130
shim basically allows you to
instead use the JavaScript, a

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.815
little bit of JavaScript
include, that would then sort

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:31.380
of pop separate iFrame to allow
the user to pick which

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.300
action they wanted and then
connect to the service.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.560
PAUL: Yeah, the theory is it'll
be binary compatible

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.410
with the API.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.370
Obviously, as the API changes,
we might get to the points,

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.260
where your JavaScript won't be
able to do exactly what we

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.080
want to do, but by then,
hopefully, other browser

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.410
vendors will kind of all
use the same API.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.437
OK, so the next question- how do
you-- oh, actually there's

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:54.090
another trick question
jumped up in front.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.960
How do you include the support
for suggestions [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.480
in Web Intents in Chrome?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.340
If not, when will we
see the support?

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.180
So, just a bit of background
behind this.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.090
Because we couldn't
show the demo.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.590
Web Intents has got quite a few
little features already

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.810
built in, when the Web Intents
implementation inside Chrome

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.720
has got discovery
features built

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.400
straight into the interface.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.470
And One of those features
is the ability to find

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.430
applications that will, say,
have the support to,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.700
say, edit an image.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.560
So, the user says, I
need an application

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.190
to edit this image.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.960
We can pop up a list, that
basically says this is the

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.062
application that the user
has installed right now.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.740
Being that there are other
applications on the Chrome Web

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.890
Store which also supports same
types of functionality,

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.010
editing images, picking data
from other services.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.380
So one of the things that people
have asked for is the

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.370
ability to, basically, manually
control that list of

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.460
suggested services, not
necessary have them come from

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.820
the Chrome Web Store.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.500
The reason being, you might
know, for instance, that you

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.130
support Twitter, right, and you
want to have that ability

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.020
for the user, if they haven't
got it installed, to be able

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.530
to install that application,
which might not necessarily

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.390
directly come from the
Chrome Web Store.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.560
So the suggestions is
basically a list of

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.790
developer-provided suggested
services, that they know

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.430
complete the action
and complement

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.610
their site very well.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.922
ALEX: So, if you're firing and
intent, and saying that you

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:18.850
are starting an intent, and you
know if your apps already,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.910
that are pretty good matches for
it, you can provide those,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.080
so they could be shown to
the user as suggestions.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.040
PAUL: Yeah, It basically,
it's to solve

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.050
the bootstrap problem.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.420
We think we've done a really
good job in Chrome in sense of

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.920
providing this set of
applications from

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.930
the Chrome Web Store.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.420
But quite often developers
would want to

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.825
provide their own list.

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:36.480
So, it's actually onto
the question.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.900
It's not implemented just yet.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.120
I believe, we're still working
on it at the moment.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.760
The reason why it's kind of a
little bit up in the air is

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.230
because when we've been talking
to the guys at W3C, we

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.620
have to iron out a
couple of things.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.960
But it's something that we want
to support, and we got a

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.600
lot of developer feedback.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.430
It's just a matter
of kind of when.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.950
So, if you have any suggestions,
I would suggest

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.800
that you kind of just pop some
feedback on the Web Public

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.290
Intents group on the W3C,
and again, I'll share

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.630
the actual list out.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.570
But there is some active
conversations going on about

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.750
the types of features that are
needed by developers to have

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.270
this API, to make sure it's of
use to them essentially.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.450
So we'd like to say, we don't
have support for suggestions

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.660
just yet, but it should be--

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.300
hopefully soon, it all depends
on the W3C instead of

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:22.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.300
ALEX: Just to emphasize, this is
definitely an evolving API.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.790
We're learning as
people use it.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.960
What things are useful,
what things they need.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.920
And so we're listening very
carefully to what you guys,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.226
what your feedback is on this
API, to help put feedback into

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:38.152
this specification process in
implementation in Chrome.

00:15:38.152 --> 00:15:40.400
PAUL: Yeah, So, that was
Glen Jones in Brighton.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.770
So, I've noticed we've got a
whole load more of questions

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.090
in, today as well.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.175
So, hopefully we'll be
able to answer them.

00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:46.800
So, let's have a look.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.320
Have you been doing any work
with NFC being enable to

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.600
receive Web Intents from tags?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.870
Android Beam et cetera, seems
like a logical fit.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.380
I think the quite frank
answer is not directly

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.330
anything with NFC.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
I think there's a couple of
interesting possibilities,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.155
which, I believe, have been
discussed briefly on the

00:16:06.155 --> 00:16:08.160
Public Intents group.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.310
Basically being able to kind of
look out for the URLs, the

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.255
user might might go to that
applications now can handle.

00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:18.140
But, this is just too early on
the the whole specification

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.480
the moment.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.090
We want to make sure that we
have a good solid ground to be

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.830
able to find applications that
perform definite tasks before

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.250
we think too much about trying
to integrate with NFC.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.050
ALEX: There's possibilities,
really cool ideas.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.150
Like NSC is a great idea here.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.100
But we just have a lot of stuff
that we're trying to do.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.510
And so we want to get
to that point.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.500
But right now, we're focusing
on really making sure that's

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.535
the core foundation is really
solid, and something people

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:43.750
could build on top of.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.010
PAUL: Cool.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.640
So, yes, I hope, that answered
the question.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.610
You know, it's one of
those things, right.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.480
And then we're tracking this
now, so we should be able to

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.920
give you some information
as things change.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.280
So, if we talk about it on the
Intents Group, the W3C, then

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.170
we should be able to find a nice
way to actually give you

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.780
this information back.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.330
And, so the next question.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.380
In the recent Google I/O 2012
talk you mentioned that the

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.690
interface for Web Intents in
Chrome is currently being

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.810
redesigned.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.089
When will we get to see it, and
can you talk about it now?

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.490
ALEX: Also, one of the coolest
things that I think is really

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.624
cool about Chrome is that we do
the vast, vast majority of

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:21.710
the development in the open.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.150
So, if you're using Canary,
you're seeing the very cutting

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.020
edge of what's in Chrome.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.980
So already some of this
work has started.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.190
And actually, if we were able to
show the demos, then you'd

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.390
see that the UI shifted already
a little bit, and so

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.140
we're already starting to make
progress on updating this UI

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.950
and making it really,
really smooth.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.050
PAUL: Yeah, I mean, some of the
feedback that we've had,

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.010
is that, actually, the user
interface didn't response,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.290
especially for inline intent.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.360
And for those of you who don't
know what inline kind of

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.220
intent is, it's the ability
to have like a pop-up that

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.270
appears, just over the context
that the user currently has

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.450
inside the browser.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.430
So if they say, I'm going to
share a link from a blog, for

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.050
instance, you don't want to
necessarily be completely

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.760
redirected to another
application like Twitter or

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.520
Google+, or these
types of things.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.720
You just want to appear it, like
how it appeared just over

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.770
the thing that you want
to share, right?

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.570
So the inline intent,
is that same thing.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.700
And this is one of the areas
that we got a lot of feedback

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.990
from developers, at
the moment, is

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.930
that it looked rough.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.600
Early, early I think is
the way of saying it.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.470
ALEX: And we're definitely
working on

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.040
iterating on that design.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.895
And we knew it was rough.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.830
But we wanted to get in it in
the hands of developers, so

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.770
that they could start
using it.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.550
PAUL: So, if you go to the
Chrome Canary channel now.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.530
And fire the intent,
that is the share.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:38.510
demos.webintents.org is a
good place to start--

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.640
you'll basically see,
the inline of

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.240
user and spaces changed.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.630
So it's got this idea of, again,
constrained dialogue.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.110
The idea being that the intent
picker itself can actually

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.010
adapt more freely to the user
interface, to the actual page

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.960
that's being displayed.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.020
So the page that you've embeded
is 800 pixels wide,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.450
the actual user interface, the
actual intent display, will

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.360
adapt to that 800 pixels.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.360
So, it is being worked on,
and expect more changes.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.560
ALEX: Expect a fair number
of more changes.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.410
We're really working hard to
make this a really tight UI

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:14.990
that's a pleasure
to work with.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.960
PAUL: Yeah, I mean the success
of Web Intents is kind of

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.070
generally tied to
user experience.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.740
So just the users need to be
comfortable with what they do

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.950
inside the browser.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.990
And we are acutely aware of
this, and we are making

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.010
changes the accommodate
for that as well.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.780
So, hopefully, that again, was
Glenn Johns, and he said--

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:32.710
Jen Johnes?

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.630
Don't worry about that, I've got
spoonerisms on my brain.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.830
So the next question.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.650
As a user, how can I find
possible varieties for any

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.720
given intent?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.280
Is that something third parties
can do to catalog

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.950
providing of different
intents?

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.440
ALEX: Before you answer that
question, I just want to point

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.830
out too, just so just for
people who aren't aware.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.240
When you fire a Web Intent as a
developer, Chrome Web Store,

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.040
what we do write down today,
is if the user doesn't have

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.160
any Web apps installed that can
handle that intent, then

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.430
we show actually a list of
apps that can handle that

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.800
intent from the Web Store.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.006
So this is a natural way that
even if you fire an intent,

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:10.720
even if the users don't have
anything installed, they are

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.830
going to still find applications
really easily

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.770
that can handle that intent.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.370
PAUL: So, yeah that, actually,
pretty much answers part of

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.300
the question.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.740
It's completely possible, for,
if the user agent wants to

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.960
implement intents, that they
might have their own directory

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.210
of intents themselves.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.680
This, actually, brings up an
interesting question about why

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.990
we went to the Intents
side, right?

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.830
So, for me, right now,
we have to use that

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.940
manifest inside Chrome.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.360
So you have a Chrome
applicational extension, which

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.590
has, basically, a small piece of
what essentially amounts to

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.940
JavaScript inside the manifest
that describes exactly what

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.880
your application does.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.950
It says my application can share
links or edit images.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.645
So the interesting thing, just
generally, is that the Chrome

00:20:57.645 --> 00:21:00.640
actual manifest itself is
very specific to Chrome.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.120
And when we've been talking
about Web Intents publicly,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.350
generally is, you know, we're
really kind of keen on this

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.680
idea of an intent tag.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.800
You know, a very small piece of
HTML that can live inside

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.990
applications, web applications,
on the web, that

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.410
actually describe the
capabilities of the URL.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.020
What it enables you to do is
things like search engines,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.250
for instance, who come along
and start to understand the

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.340
capabilities of the apps,
so that they could offer

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.430
suggestions for the user.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.030
If they, for instance, maybe
search on the open web

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.690
image-editing applications,
right?

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.590
So, it's kind of cool.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.590
And at the same time, it's
because it's a tag

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.750
indiscriminable on the open web,
any third party system

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.690
could come along, scrape
the contents and

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.700
provide that directory.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.490
So I'm not going to say open
intents.org are going to do

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.840
this, because we haven't spoken
of this just yet.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.120
But you know, they could go
along and start cataloging the

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.130
intents that have been
discovered on the open web,

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.990
which can provide extra
directory services,

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.100
so you can go in--

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.020
ALEX: Yeah, the community here
is really going to be really

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.040
key in helping evolve how to
use Web Intents, and how to

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.690
catalog which events
are available.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.690
And the internet tag
is really key.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.300
So today we're using the Chrome
Web Store as an natural

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.170
directory of stores
of applications

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.710
that can handle intents.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.270
But that's the temporary
solution.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.280
We were working in this with
W3C in this standardization

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.780
process to find a way for just
normal web pages to be able to

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.930
say, hey, I can handle
that intent.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.090
PAUL: Yes, and the application
capabilities should just be

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.920
available on the web
just generally.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.980
ALEX: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.200
There's one other thing I wanted
to say, which is, an

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.150
important part about Web
Intents, I think, is Web

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.960
Intents is basically the
plumbing that allows you to

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.620
connect up to not to know
whether or not they're

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.210
connecting up to, and for Chrome
or the browser to help

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.610
initiate that connection.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.150
Once you have that, how you talk
over that connection, is

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.410
to some extent, up to the

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.580
conventions that you're following.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.180
It's just going to be really,
really important for the

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.740
community to be actively
involved in helping us define,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.470
as a community, what the right
conventions are to be speaking

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.150
over this channel, that Web
Intents allows you to create.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:22:59.620
PAUL: Yeah.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.650
So, yeah.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.906
There goes the point we've got,
I think we've defined

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:06.540
five, six, different actions--
the ability to share data,

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.900
edit data, pick data from a
service, save out to a remote

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.580
service, and view as well.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.620
So they'll be able to say, look,
my application can just

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.680
view images, or view videos.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.170
This is just a very small set
of common actions that we

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.850
believe are on the open
web right now that

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.230
people are kind of using.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.640
But there might be use cases,
for instance, payments, i

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.850
think is one, for instance.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.340
And authentication ware.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.290
You know, we haven't
said that we don't

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.840
find our intents directly.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.130
We haven't said we don't
find them in like the

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.980
webintents.org area, because
this is open and discoverable,

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.930
people should just be able to
go and say, well I want to

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.540
start experimenting with
the ability to manage

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.300
payments on the web.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.250
Fire Intents.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.360
And then applications get
built from there.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.550
But it all depends on great

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.790
documentation in the community.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.860
I mean this is what
we found out.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.310
When I first started with this
kind of whole idea is we

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.370
wanted the URL for the action
because we can describe

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.600
documentation for some of
the best practices.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.750
And, actually, when you speak to
developers, they want even

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.720
more documentation, even more
guidance about exactly how

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.780
these actions should
be implemented.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.720
And this is one of those things
that we're going to see

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.530
on the open web, as well, is
when people start building

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.670
their own intents, they'll
want great

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.180
documentation as well.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:19.310
ALEX: Absolutely.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.850
And we definitely want to help
the community be a part of

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.150
this, and help them find
how to use Web Intents.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.660
The question was a
really great one.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.510
There's so many use cases
for Web Intents.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.750
I'm so excited to see what the
community is using this for

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.140
what, and what kinds of use
cases it wants to enable.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.436
It's really exciting, I think.

00:24:38.436 --> 00:24:40.830
PAUL: Yeah, thanks.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.340
I went a little bit far against
that question, so

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.910
we'll move to the next
question at least.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.870
How will Web Intents handle
verbs like edit, where the

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.590
application design would be
dependent on the context, as

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.170
on the file type, e.g. edit an
audio files, it's a song, I

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.540
want it to open Garage
Band versus the

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.140
general sound in Audacity?

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.260
ALEX: It's actually is
a great question.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.970
PAUL: Yeah.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.800
ALEX: So the insight is that
just because you have a

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.390
certain file type, you might
still want to open different

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.440
types of those files in
different applications, in

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:11.640
different contexts.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.175
So, the example here is I've
got a sound file, it's

00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:17.900
technically am MP3, but I want
to open it in Garage Band if

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.390
it's a song, versus I want to
open it in Audacity if it's--

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.660
PAUL: So, what is Audacity?

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.180
ALEX: Audacity, I believe,
is a cool sound editing

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:26.690
application.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.570
PAUL: OK.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.336
ALEX: I've never
used it myself.

00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:29.930
I'm not [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.880
PAUL: So, we differentiate
between intents on the verb

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.100
and the data type
at the moment.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.670
So, right now--

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.050
ALEX: I don't know how--

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.600
this is the kind of thing that
will be interesting to see how

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.450
the community addresses
this use case.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.080
PAUL: I mean it'd be perfectly
possible for someone to do a

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.050
new edit intent.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.070
I mean, we don't particularly
want to encourage that,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.940
because, we think,
we've got a very

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.810
good generalized solution.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.880
But this, I'll be honest, I
don't know how to quite answer

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.650
this right now.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.660
But this is what we're trying
to discuss on the Public

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.162
Intents groups on the
webintentsdiscus

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.412
s@googlegroups.com.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.510
These are the things that we
want to try to find out,

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.850
because if it turns out there's
a compelling need for

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.510
editing different types of image
files or different types

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:21.520
of audio files in the context
of an application, then we

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.310
might need to provide some
better solution.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.800
I mean, suggestions is one area,
but the developer might

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.780
say, look, we want to guide the
user down using Audacity

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.370
or Garage Band for one
type of application.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.470
Suggestions looks like it might
handle some of that that

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.880
use case, but it's not going
to help filter what

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.600
applications you would have
got to install that handle

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.870
those types of data types--

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.450
ALEX: So, again, Web Intents
is pretty malleable.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.130
So you could use its potential
in the future if the community

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:54.980
as a whole decides, hey the edit
intent isn't expressive

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.860
enough, I have a different
kind of edit.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.840
Then, maybe it makes sense to
creative different intent.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.690
We want, definitely, encourage
the community always to keep

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:02.730
the number of intents small.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.650
As the smaller of intents we
have, the more sharing there

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.620
can be, the more interaction
the can be among apps.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.750
But every so often there will be
a compelling use case, that

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.445
means a new intent.

00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:14.785
And as a community, we'll need
to experiment with that and

00:27:14.785 --> 00:27:16.040
figure out what's the
right answer.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.160
In this case, one thing to keep
in mind, is that when a

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.150
user hits the edit button,
they probably know what

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.810
their action is.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.790
Like they know, oh, I want to
edit this song right now.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:31.110
To some extent, if they see both
Audacity and Garage Band

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.350
in their picker, than they
probably know, oh I'm editing

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.620
music file, the task I'm
doing right now.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.260
So they might not actually
even need--

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.083
ALEX: Yeah, they've
got the choice

00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:41.700
themselves to do this, right?

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.180
So, they can chose that.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:43.870
ALEX: That's a great question.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.660
It was from Jay in Boston.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.730
PAUL: So, Glenn Johns from
Brighton, hello again.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.010
What are your first thoughts on
Ian Hickson's proposal for

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.540
merging Web Intents with
register to handle APIs with

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.335
Mozilla web activities?

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:04.820
ALEX: So, Ian Hickson is the
editor of the HTML5 spec on

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.560
[INAUDIBLE], and he recently
posted a proposal that sort of

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.810
takes the Web Intents idea and
merges it in with similar

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.530
proposal from Mozilla
and other ideas.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.930
So, one of the things to keep
mind about these kinds of

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.620
discussions and standards, and
we're trying to collectively

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.490
define a new standard, there is
lots of discussion, there's

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.900
lots of changing how you
think about things.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.280
And we really are hoping that
something we think [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.990
Web Intents it is really
important.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.020
But it is, of course,
experimental at this point.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.240
And so if, ultimately, as a
community, in the standards

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.524
body, if we need to go in
different directions, we are,

00:28:39.524 --> 00:28:40.670
of course, open to that.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.130
And so we're looking forward
to working with Ian and

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.485
Mozilla and others to really
define this spec

00:28:45.485 --> 00:28:46.620
the best it can be.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.010
This very basic functionality.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:54.490
So that's a very general answer,
but where I'm really

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.835
excited to see so much
interaction from other browser

00:28:57.835 --> 00:28:59.000
vendors as well, in
this process.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.450
And it really shows that this
is an important problem that

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.710
we all want to solve.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.190
It's awesome.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.860
PAUL: The solution is generally
the same as well.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.880
So, the next question, which
is by x, but I think I know

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.200
who asked this one.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.650
Mike [? Marnov, ?]

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.200
I think.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.060
So, for the sharing intent,
which is webintents.org/share

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.480
at the moment, is it enough to
add Web Intents support via

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.300
Adthis integration?

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.690
So, Adthis is a service that
aggregates the ability to

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.030
share your pieces of data
across, I think up to 300

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.150
different types of networks.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.350
ALEX: It's a lot.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.080
PAUL: And they've done a lot
hard work to actually

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.230
integrate these networks
into a very

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.320
common generalized solution.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.690
And the really cool thing is
that they've actually taken

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:44.390
Web Intents on quite early, and
provided an integration in

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.200
their that little widget that
you put on the page.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.860
Which will fire an intent.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:54.210
So there's an issue, which is
the Web Intents logo, which I

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:54.840
gave to them.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.340
Which doesn't well describe
exactly what Web Intents is.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.340
So that's hopefully going
to change soon.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.530
But generally, to this question,
if you've already

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.000
gotten Adthis widget on your
page, it makes perfect sense

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.652
just to keep it on, because they
aggregate across a whole

00:30:09.652 --> 00:30:11.430
lot of different networks.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.860
One of the things that we've
seen with some people that

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.480
we've worked with recently is
that when they integrate share

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.730
intent they might have a
direct integration with

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.170
already, let's say Facebook,
and Twitter.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.770
And what you aren't going to
find is that they have all the

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:25.550
rest of the services.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.880
And all the rest of the services
is generally provided

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.210
by Web Intents.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.040
So, that's what we're seeing
at the moment.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.110
I wouldn't get rid of your
Adthis integration at all,

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.800
they provide a very valuable
service as well as it's not

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.013
just the ability to share with
the different networks.

00:30:38.013 --> 00:30:41.720
It's the ability to get metrics,
on like page views,

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.380
and also kind of the types of
networks that your data and

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.500
your users and viewers
are sharing data to.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.070
ALEX: And ultimately, Adthis
was created to come up to

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.290
solve a problem.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.686
A very real problem, that
also Web Intents is

00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:54.310
trying to solve as well.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.060
And I think, Adthis adds a lot
of cool functionality, as

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.350
well, but Web Intents does
address some of these issues.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.870
So, if you already have
Adthis it's great.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.995
It's really simple to switch
to their Web Intents

00:31:04.995 --> 00:31:05.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.020
PAUL: And they already provide
support for Web Intents as

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.830
well, so it's--

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.580
ALEX: But Yeah it's
really cool again.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.700
A lot of people trying to solve
the same basic problems

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.020
is showing there's
a real need here.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.730
PAUL: I think the interesting
thing, because Web Intents is

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.230
quite generalized, they ability
to share something

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.735
normally is links.

00:31:21.735 --> 00:31:23.630
But If you look at some
different services, like

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.350
Tumbler, for instance,
they share quotes.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.430
You can select a piece
of text, and

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.820
share that single quote.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.610
And how that actually works with
the generalized solutions

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.670
that isn't Web Intents,
is pretty hard, right.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.120
So, when you look at different
services, and different things

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.080
that are going to come
in the future.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.370
You might want to share an
image, you might want to share

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.810
a video, like a physical
video file.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:46.110
You might want to share a
document type, which is very

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.920
uncommon, but very specific
to the kind of

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.950
workflows that you use.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.050
Whether it's a Word document,
a Google Doc, all these

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:52.910
different types of things.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.700
Actually, providing the widget
based system is pretty hard.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.010
So, we believe, Web Intents
in this case would be--

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.050
that's where it comes
into its element.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.660
You can share URL types of
data, with services that

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.540
support the same
type of thing.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.465
ALEX: Yeah, so it's not going to
that it is more useful for

00:32:08.465 --> 00:32:11.230
other types of use cases that
aren't directly addressed by

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.590
Adthis as well.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.091
PAUL: This is a question
from Lynn in Shanghai.

00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:19.070
If a website uses JavaScript
shim to register the handler

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:23.350
by intent tags, can Chrome
invoke the handler natively

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.730
without the JavaScript shim?

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:28.020
OK so, a little bit of
information about the

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.870
JavaScript shim.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.830
So the JavaScript shim is
designed to replicate the

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.400
functionality of Web Intents
in browsers that don't

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.140
actually support Web
Intents natively.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.730
So right now, that is native
spot inside Chrome.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.690
Chrome has the code available
to actually register the

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.930
intent tag natively,
however the

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.390
functionality is turned off.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.036
So what it actually means is if
a page detects the intent

00:32:53.036 --> 00:32:55.380
tag, it won't do anything.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.406
If the browser detects the
intent tag it won't do

00:32:57.406 --> 00:32:58.780
anything at the moment.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.600
This also means the same for
the JavaScript shim because

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.470
the JavaScript shim just
delegates functionality

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.910
straight to the browser if it
detects a native functionality

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.240
is already in place.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.701
So right now, if the browser
detects the shim, in Chrome at

00:33:11.701 --> 00:33:12.790
least, it won't do anything.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.500
If it has JavaScript shim,
that's already been detected

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.550
and it's inside browser like
Firefox, or Opera, or Internet

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.450
Explorer, then they are just
going to be be registered in

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.763
the kind of the shims
datastore at

00:33:22.763 --> 00:33:23.900
least at the moment.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.550
So, we don't have that bridge,
we don't have that way of

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.840
converting users directly from--
you know, if you've

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.340
used the shim in Chrome before,
[INAUDIBLE] natively,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:36.850
to when we get that tech
support down the line.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.220
So we don't have a great answer
of you on that one,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.910
unfortunately.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.985
But that's the state of what
it is at the moment.

00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:46.715
I don't know if there is
anything else to add.

00:33:46.715 --> 00:33:47.990
I believe, so--

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.890
ALEX: Next three.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:49.330
PAUL: Yeah.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.150
Did we miss any from before?

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.950
Sorry about this, I'm not in
presentation mode for the

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:56.800
moderator questions.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.010
So, here we go.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.030
Page load.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.990
ALEX: Did you click on it?

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.460
ALEX: I might have
clicked on it.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.430
I didn't click on it.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.030
OK.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.490
So to what extent can OS
native non-browser

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.476
applications hook into
Web Intents?

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.000
It's a very good question.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.370
Right now, none.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:17.250
But that doesn't mean that
we can't do this.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.510
If the browser can provide a
hook into its registration

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.190
system, then that's something
that could be

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.480
supported in future.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.489
It just requires vendor
support and external

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.310
application support.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.750
ALEX: This is another
great example.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.989
There's tons of possibilities
for Web Intents in the future.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.570
Right now, we're focusing on
web app to web app, but

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.420
there's obviously tons of
opportunity for doing things.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.020
From web app to browser,
browser to web app.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.159
Web app to native app.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.020
Within Android--

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.280
PAUL: What about external
devices?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.345
ALEX: There's all kinds of
different connections that Web

00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:48.199
Intents could help be
the broker between.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.270
So this is another great example
of something that we

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.889
love to do.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:52.480
And it is a cool idea.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.120
And we aren't looking at it
actively right now, but that

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.300
just because we're focusing on
really nailing that basic

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.730
functionality of web
app to web app.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.250
PAUL: I believe this is
the last question.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.760
And it's actually for me to
repeat the different types of

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.850
intents that we have.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:10.250
So Wes Short from Shasta
Lake, in California.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.780
Hello, thank you for
your question.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.650
It's one of the six
data intents

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.710
you've identified again?

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.480
So, basically we've identified
six types of intents, six

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.700
actions that users will perform
commonly across the

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:29.080
web that we believe should be
built-in support to the API.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.985
ALEX: I should point out,
built-in does not mean it's

00:35:30.985 --> 00:35:32.600
actually specified in
a specification.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.440
It just means that these are
the default actions that we

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.850
think user of this API and most
likely want us to build

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.630
consensus around.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.600
PAUL: So, the first is share.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.250
The interesting thing about
share is that it's not just

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.870
about sharing links, it's about
share any type of data.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.240
So the ability to send some data
from one application to

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.990
another to--

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.030
like send and image.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.110
So we actually used this at
Google I/O. Our example was

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.110
it's really hard to actually
share an image on the web

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.030
today to a remote application,
well, like a remote web

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.010
application, like Gmail
for instance.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.410
We have mailto.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.240
Mailto Is a protocol
on the web.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.390
So basically, when we need to
send an email, and what

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.060
happens, when you click on the
web today is you click mailto,

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.595
it'll open up your preferred
application, I believe we've

00:36:17.595 --> 00:36:19.090
got it in Gmail support.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.440
And you have encode the data
in a very specific way.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.460
The title to, person to,
the title of the

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.150
email, and the body.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.490
But what it neglects to do is
actually, well, most people

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.030
want to share not just this
very basic kind of email--

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.750
ALEX: Text.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.540
PAUL: Yeah, text.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.400
They want to share images.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.010
They want to share videos
and all the stuff.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.280
They want to share
links as well.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.008
Links that they find
on the web.

00:36:40.008 --> 00:36:43.310
And the idea behind the share
intent, is that you can say in

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.430
your application, and our
image maker application

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.730
example, which we could have
shown today, if it wasn't for

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:52.420
me, has the ability to share
this image out to different

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.100
types of networks and support
sharing images very

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.260
specifically.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.210
And what this enables you to
do in the future would be,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.550
say, well, I'm want to share out
to Twitter by, say, Imgur,

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:05.160
which is the integration I've
put in as an example.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.720
Images supported challenges to
deliver the data of that image

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.910
to that application.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:10.920
So we have share.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.220
It's not just about
sharing text.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.260
It's about the ability to share
images, the ability to

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.195
share videos, any type of
data that you want.

00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:21.220
You can be be very specific
about and pass it out.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.350
The next is edit.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.750
The reason why this, I think,
edit is kind of important, and

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.290
we need to talk about it a
little bit more, is because

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.160
you have data in one
application.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.680
And you want to get in to say
your image manipulation

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.690
application.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.360
You may want to put a funny
text or a funny

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.660
caption on the image.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.300
Today right now, unless you've
got a very deep integration

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.180
with a third party system, the
user has to right click on the

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.310
image in the browser, download
it to the desktop, upload to

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:52.510
the image editing application,
change the image inside the

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.600
image editing application, then
right click on it to save

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.210
it, download it back to the
desktop, and then try to

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.570
upload it back into the app.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.330
ALEX: You know, it's funny, Is
when I do that in practice, it

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:02.975
is just what you do.

00:38:02.975 --> 00:38:04.780
But when you describe it that
way, that's insane.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.510
PAUL: Yes, yes.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.970
That's crazy.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.620
So, the idea behind edit is you
just say, I need to edit

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.430
this image.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.280
And edit, you find the
applications that supports

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.845
image editing, sends the data to
it, and then, once the user

00:38:15.845 --> 00:38:18.420
has finished editing the data
inside the application, they

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.560
can just return that data
back to the corner.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.885
So the data just lives inside
the browser, is transferred

00:38:22.885 --> 00:38:23.910
from browser.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.680
Browser [INAUDIBLE] to
browser [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.562
Never really has to switch
the internet if it

00:38:27.562 --> 00:38:28.490
doesn't have to.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.670
And then you can edit, and
bring the data back in.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.396
And that's completely different
what we see on the

00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:33.540
web today at the moment.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.360
So, edit for me is
really important.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.530
The next, I'm going to skip
one.And that's on

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.320
webintents.org documentation
for now, is pick.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.300
The reason why pick is kind of
cool is because we've got

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.900
things like Google Drive,
Box, box.net.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.970
Dropbox and box.net,
for instance, these

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.220
are all your clouds.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.990
All your files and stuff
are starting to live

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.340
in the cloud, right.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.000
You don't want to have one
application, have one direct

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.790
integration to the service that
you don't use, right?

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.820
So the idea behind the Web
Intents is that you could say,

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.750
I want to pick my file, my
image, my document from any of

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:10.390
my cloud file storage solutions
and then bring it

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.550
back into my application.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.155
And that's what the
pick intent does.

00:39:13.155 --> 00:39:16.900
You pick a file, or pick some
data from some service.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.650
The next is save.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.650
So the complementary service
to pick is save.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.050
So, you want to save an image,
something that you've edited

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.030
on the web, or inside
a web application.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.280
Right now, if you're trying to
do a save, you only have to

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.520
save to the file system.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.085
You either right click to save
direct, or maybe do some hack

00:39:32.085 --> 00:39:36.259
in Chrome to only anchor, to do
a download, and put in the

00:39:36.259 --> 00:39:37.240
downloads directory.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.410
It's pretty crazy, right?

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:42.450
And save is designed to say,
well I picked from Google

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.690
Drive, for instance, I don't
want to save it to Dropbox.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.570
So the idea is that you can
have these three service

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.420
integrated, not necessarily with
each other directly, but

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.100
you can pull from one service,
edit the data in another app,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.730
and send it back out.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.640
So pick is to pull data in, and
save is to push data out

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.070
that you've just edited,
for instance.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.310
We have also view.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.530
So view is kind of interesting,
right?

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.610
Most people don't think of this
on the web, probably,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.890
you're watching a YouTube
video and

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:09.805
watching inside YouTube.

00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:12.440
Or you're watching video, or you
might watch inside Vimeo.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.420
But what do is you actually
have a video file that's

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.880
either been sent you via email
or it's on your desktop and

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.910
you want to view it inside, like
a special kind of video

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:23.110
viewing piece of software.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.370
You're not necessarily going to
upload it to one of these

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.030
kind of video services just
to go and view the video.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.380
You might just want to view
inside your web app.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.710
And we don't see many web
applications today which are

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.840
just dedicated to viewing
file types.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.270
We just don't see them at
all, I don't think.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.570
And the view intent is
designed to save up.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.810
You know if Chrome detects that
you, for instance, that

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.030
you've downloaded a video.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.850
I mean, this functionality
is not there, just yet.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.530
But if Chrome has detected that
you've just downloaded a

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.960
video, why not try to view
the video inside the web

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.900
application that is
on the web today.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.820
So view, is, I think, is
a pretty important one.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.420
I think it's quite important
for things like Chrome

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.200
[INAUDIBLE] as well where
literally all your

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.860
applications just
live on the web.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.870
ALEX: But this is a great meta
point too that there are

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.790
things that you do today that
are sort of annoying to do,

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.620
there are other things
you don't do

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.920
today, because you can't.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.090
PAUL: Yes.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:12.940
ALEX: So Web Intents enables
new types of integrations

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.990
between apps that couldn't
exist before.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.810
So, that's one of the reasons
that I guarantee that this

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.150
list that we've got here is
going to have things added to

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.220
it, as people actually use Web
Intents and realize what the

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.480
full potential of this kind
of technology is.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.202
PAUL: Yeah, people have been
talking about things like a

00:41:29.202 --> 00:41:30.600
pay intent, for instance, if you
want to buy some goods on

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.710
the web, using a preferred
merchant.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.230
Like merchant record.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.500
So, yeah, these things that we
are not even thinking about

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.120
properly just yet, which people
can start and develop.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.000
So, I think, view is kind
important as well, I say kind

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.850
of, it's very important.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.180
We do actually have view
slightly integrated into

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.200
Chrome at the moment.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.250
So if you download an RSS feed
or and Atom feed, you'll be

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.610
presented with a list
of services

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.640
that can support that.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.632
I think it's only in Canary and
dev, I don't think it's in

00:41:56.632 --> 00:41:58.210
stable just yet.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.980
So this is one of those things
once the user interface on the

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.050
flow gets a little bit better,
we're going to start seeing

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.400
these things roll out
a little bit more.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.850
But, yeah, you can view RSS
feeds and Atom feeds in your

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.100
preferred application.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.590
And one of those applications
can actually just be the

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.250
browser with their XML view.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.200
And the last one we've
got documents is and

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.980
intent called subscribe.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.200
The idea behind this is if
you're on a page, you want to

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.400
subscribe to say an RSS feed,
or changes to the state of

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.110
that page inside your preferred
application.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.000
So you might not only view an
RSS feed in a specialized

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.450
reader or a special view, but
you might have it subscribed

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.880
in a different type
of application.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.530
And one of the guys who've
have implemented this is

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:39.900
Message Boy.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.440
I checked it out on the Web
Store at the moment, because

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.020
they have the subscribe intent
already built in, which just

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.910
basically allows you to say,
look, I'm going to subscribe

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:47.600
to changes in this RSS feed.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.590
And to add this application is
going to do something that is

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.522
not normally just like a view.

00:42:51.522 --> 00:42:54.020
It's going to aggregate the data
and do things behind the

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.770
scenes that normal view
intents wouldn't do.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:58.400
So, subscribe is actually
kind of interesting.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.050
It's pretty cool.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.210
Yeah, that's it.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.100
They're the six core ones that
we've defined so far.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.410
ALEX: And again, these are
not built into the spec.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.330
It's up to the communities
to find and standardize

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:14.420
themselves around which of
these intents are useful,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.580
which of the action types and
to find new ones, and find

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.778
exactly precisely what
they mean and when

00:43:18.778 --> 00:43:19.510
they should be used.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.920
ALEX: Yeah and to check these
out today the simplest thing

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.350
to do is go to webintents.org
forward slash verb thing.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:32.930
So it's webintents.org/share
or /edit, /pick.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.130
What happened there is because
we're trying to document best

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.260
practices quite concisely is
that we are going put all the

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.120
best practices guidance,
example code, of how to

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.210
integrate maybe the share
action, or the pick action

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.820
into your applications, both
from a client, and a service

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.610
point of view.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.340
So if you're a service that
wants to provide data to

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.630
clients, you can say, well, I
need to implement the pick, I

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.220
need to implement the pick
for my type of data.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.640
How do I go about doing it.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.523
You go to webintents.org/pick
and then we'll try to provide

00:44:01.523 --> 00:44:03.580
you with the best guidance
possible--

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.980
ALEX: And we're really working
to improve that as well to

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.700
make sure that it's useful, has
all the best practices.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.690
It's a place that the community
can work together to

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:15.020
figure out, to define what
the best practices are.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:15.940
PAUL: Yeap, Cool.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.940
So, I think that's all the
questions that we've had.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.210
We do have a weird question at
the end that just looks like

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.150
some random text--

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.710
ALEX: Yeah, so won't
answer that one.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.560
PAUL: Well, I can speak
random if you want.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.080
Yeah, so this was our first Web

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.440
Intents livestream Hangout.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.500
I'd be really interested to get
the feelers out there to

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.860
see what kind of stuff
that you want to

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.900
hear us talk about.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.690
ALEX: Absolutely.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.830
PAUL: I don't want to do it
weekly, because we're quite

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.620
early on in this
whole process.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.290
I want to aggregate the best
things that happen around the

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.610
web, so we can present
them to you.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.160
But also, at the same time, If
you have any kind of things

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.600
that you want me to talk about,
get some engineers.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.130
I haven't asked the
engineers yet.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.200
So we've got a couple of
engineers over in America who

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.100
are actually working on this
project at the moment.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.850
We can get these in as well,
and talk to them, get some

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.620
feedback from you guys.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.260
Hopefully, we'll have a better
Hangout as well, so they can

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.550
invite their parties
into it as well.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:17.460
ALEX: So, everything in Web
Intents is really up to the

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.820
community to help figure
out how should we

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.260
be doing these Hangouts.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.900
How webintents.org
should work.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.700
How to use this API.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.046
And sort of feeding back in to
make sure we're designing it

00:45:29.046 --> 00:45:32.020
in the best possible way.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.860
PAUL: Yeah, so cool.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.940
I think, we're done.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.390
So what I'm going to do as well,
and I encourage everyone

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.440
to, well, not everyone to do,
I'm going to share a whole lot

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.850
of links, you can share
links if you want.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.886
I'm going to share a whole lot
of links on our Web Intents

00:45:43.886 --> 00:45:45.530
Google+ page.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.220
I encourage everyone to try
and follow that, because

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.600
that's where our centralized
communication channel, of

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.490
pushing out updates
and everything is.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.840
ALEX: Following all this
stuff is hard.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.950
If you try to follow the spec
discussions on W3C, there are

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.780
a lot of very smart, very
technical people having very

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.440
interesting and complicated
discussions.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.600
And as a web developer, I just
want to summarize it for you.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.800
So Web Intents Google + pages
are a great place to follow in

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.930
a more summarized way, easier
to consume way.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.360
To know what's going on.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.410
PAUL: Cool.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.700
So thank you very much
for your questions.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.700
I'll be here again in
two weeks time.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.650
So, thank you very
much and goodbye.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.900
ALEX: Bye.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:33.860
I'm not sure how we turn off.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.960
So stop streaming.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.510
ALEX: Good bye for real.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.760
PAUL: Good bye.
