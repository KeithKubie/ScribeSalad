00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.750
&gt;&gt; Peter Nelson: My name's
Peter Nelson, I'm the Director

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.190
of Research and Innovation
for ServeMinnesota.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.190
And we're very thankful and
happy today to be here today

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.030
to talk a little bit
about Reading Corps.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.240
So, at its heart, Reading Corps
is a tutoring program designed

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.610
to increase the number
of students

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.110
who are reading proficiently
by third grade.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.990
And I think as everyone
here knows,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.890
that outcome is particularly
important not just

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.520
for what it is, but for
what it represents in terms

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.480
of students' academic trajectory
and their career trajectory.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.980
But also, knowing that the
benefits to individuals

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.030
who are reading early and
developing those skills early,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.380
extend to society as well.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.790
So, as the name suggests,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.890
Reading Corps is
fueled by AmeriCorps.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.100
And I want to put my
researcher cap on for a second

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.440
to highlight how
exciting that is.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.790
Because essentially,
there is all this research

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.090
that's happening.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.070
Academic institutions
that might be compiled

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.290
in best practice
guides, and be published

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.620
in peer review journals.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.920
And by in large, all this
information is not translating

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.360
very well, the practice
taking a very long time.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.480
And then, you have all these
folks who are highly passionate

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.820
about reading that are
compassionate about service.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.800
And you know, wouldn't it be
great if we could marry the two?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.320
And this is the opportunity
that AmeriCorps affords us,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.660
and at ServeMinnesota
it's something

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.050
that we really take to heart.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.520
We think about AmeriCorps
as an opportunity

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.500
to reach our communities,
but do it in a way

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.510
that helps bridge the gap
between research and practice.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.920
So, in -- well, I'll just say,
in the context of reading,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.160
what this looks like is that
our tutors, what they're doing

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.560
in the schools is all directly
connected to empirical research.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.040
They're using data every
day to make decisions,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.890
and there are structures
in place to ensure

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.130
that what's happening
in practice aligns

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.800
with how we talk
about the program.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.700
So, the program spans
from Pre-K to third grade,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.840
and the only difference
between the two --

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.020
so, in K-3 they're full time
AmeriCorps members working

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.320
in the school.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.620
And they're doing
pull-out intervention,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.740
so each kid gets 20
minutes a day, every day,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.050
targeted reading intervention.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.300
In Pre-K, that's happening,
but the member's also pushing

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.120
into the core instruction
environment.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.890
So, they're partnering
with the preschool teacher

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.880
to deliver whole class
literacy intervention.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.930
As well as just, engaging in a
number of different activities

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.740
to increase the quality of
the instructional environment.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.060
So, I mentioned implementation
integrity.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.240
Another thing that's
a little unique

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.560
about Reading Corps is that, we
have an Internal Coach first.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.300
And that person is there to
really help the member feel

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.960
like they're a part of
the school community.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.060
Because we know that members
who feel like they are a part

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.440
of the school community
are going

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.290
to have a more meaningful
experience

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.590
in their service here.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.890
That they're going
to be happier,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.500
and that they're going
to be more impactful.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.030
This is something that
we've seen sort of,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.890
born out through data as well.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.080
And then, we also have
Master Coaches who serve

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.220
as content experts, so
they serve as consultants

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.600
to Internal Coaches, and as
-- also to the tutors as well.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.340
So, does this program work?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.840
In a word, yes, it does.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.530
So, these are just some data
from a recent evaluation done

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.430
by NORC at the University
of Chicago.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.600
And this is Pre-K, and the
gold bars, you're looking

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.290
at performance of kids who
receive reading course support.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.750
And the grey bars, those
are the comparison students,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.910
so equivalent type students.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.820
You can see, you know,
across these Pre-K outcomes,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.990
students who receive Reading
Corps tend to do better

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.290
than students who didn't.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.520
And what's exciting, for us,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.700
is that we see these outcomes
every year in our sort of,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.600
annual evaluation data, and
we see them across grades.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.450
We also see it across
gender, ethnicity,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.230
English Learner status,
we see these effects

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.060
across these categories.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.640
And we can look at
geographic regions as well,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.000
so within the state
of Minnesota.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.700
We look at rural areas,
they're sort of larger areas

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.050
like St. Cloud or Rochester,
but also the urban areas

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.080
of Minneapolis and St. Paul,
where a large percentage

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.700
of the students who
are meeting proficiency

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.050
by third grade were
served by Reading Corps.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.150
And we look at states
where we're expanding in to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.450
where a larger percentage

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.410
of the students are
exceeding benchmark growth.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.750
Which is important,
because you know,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.140
these students are
starting here, you can kind

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.830
of visually see they need to
exceed expected rates of growth

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.010
in order to catch
up to their peers.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.960
And also, just noting that these
outcomes, I mentioned earlier,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.570
they matter for the individuals,
but they matter for schools.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.680
they matter for states, and they
matter for the nation in terms

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.520
of -- and they have
real fiscal value.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.410
and reading has a
monetary benefit.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.110
So, the last thing I want to
talk about is related to our,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.410
again, I'm in research.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.710
So, we have a Research

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.040
and Development crew
that's really tasked

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.100
with something I think,
I'm willing to bet

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.510
of us grapple with, which
is, you design a program,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.310
you find out it's
effective, and then,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.820
you know, you say, now what?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.760
Well, under what conditions is
it most effective and where?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.020
And also, thinking about,
well, how can we get better?

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.320
How can we continue to innovate?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.990
Because you can't just continue
to exist the way you are.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.870
You're always thinking
about getting better.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.830
So, we look at adding
programs related to vocabulary.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.420
We look at areas that are in
areas of concentrated poverty,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.260
and say, well, can we
do something different

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.570
in these schools?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.720
And again, all of this really
toward the end of trying

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.470
to just figure a little bit more
about the program, and figuring

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.770
out ways to improve
both the efficiency

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.520
and the effectiveness.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.090
So, that's it, I had a really
great time so far hearing

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.390
about all the programs.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.930
I'm excited to hear about some
of our colleagues in tutoring,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.330
and thank you very much.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.020

of the Library of Congress.
