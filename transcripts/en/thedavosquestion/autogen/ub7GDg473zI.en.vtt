integral part the teaching and learning
 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.120
integral part the teaching and learning
process and not necessarily a measure of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130
process and not necessarily a measure of
 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.210
process and not necessarily a measure of
performance but it can be used also and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220
performance but it can be used also and
 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.780
performance but it can be used also and
this is a debate human cultures
