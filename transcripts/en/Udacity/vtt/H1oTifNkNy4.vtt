In order to find out where this curve hits the x-axis, we need to set y equal to

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.289
0. Then we can say that this will be satisfied if one of two conditions is true.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.455
We could either have the first factor equaling 0, which gives us the equation x

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:17.025
plus 3 minus the root of 6 equals 0. Or we could have the second factor equals

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.542
0, x plus 3 plus root of 6 equals 0. Now we just solve for x. This gives us x

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:26.204
equals negative 3 plus the root of 6, and x equals negative 3 minus the root of

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.890
6. So if x equals either of these numbers, this expression will equal 0. These

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.776
are just the x-coordinates of our two x-intercepts, and of course the

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:38.801
y-coordinate of each is 0. So this is actually really incredible what we've

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:43.028
done. We figure out how to factor over not just the integers but over the real

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:46.939
numbers. In other words, we can use completing the square and understanding

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.899
difference of squares to find the x-intercepts of a ton of different equations

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.040
for parabolas, not just ones that we can factor in the traditional way. Oh, and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.641
I almost forgot. The rounded version of these two answers are negative .55, 0

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:05.759
and negative 5.44, 0. We're going to keep working with the idea of finding

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.372
x-intercepts of any given parabola in the next lesson. Awesome job on a lot of

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.678
pretty complicated material.
