00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.380
RICK: What do we got here?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.460
I have brought you in
something that you may want

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.380
to take home and use tonight.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.040
A bar of soap from 1896.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.880
RICK: Yellow Kid Soap.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.210
That is funny.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.540
And, uh, yeah, it
definitely looks aged.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.210
It's seen its better days.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.210
[laughs]

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.540
MAN: I came in the
pound shop today

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.210
to sell my Yellow Kid soap.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.420
It was an early comic
strip character.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.250
He wore a yellow nightgown
with different saying on it.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.880
And it was real politically
geared at the time.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.540
If I sold the bar
of soap today, I'd

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.710
probably make sure my daughter
has a very nice birthday.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.830
It's really, really
neat and different.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.750
It was, like, the first
comic strip to really use,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.710
like, the bubbles that come up.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.330
But everything he said
was written on his shirt.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.580
It was really weird.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.250
The reason they
called him Yellow Kid,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.710
he was always wearing
a yellow nightshirt.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.420
His actual name
was Mickey Dugan.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.880
He was a little boy that lived
in the slums of New York.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.750
And it was pretty
common for kids

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080
to be bald back
then in the slums,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.580
because that's how
you took care of lice.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.250
The neatest thing
about the comic strip

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.460
is, that's where the term
"yellow journalism" came from.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.710
MAN: I did not know that.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.040
I forget the name
of the newspapers,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.620
but it was Pulitzer's
paper and William

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.120
Randolph Hearst's newspaper.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.620
And they were massively
competing against each other

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.250
for viewership.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880
Originally, the Yellow Kid
appears in Pulitzer's paper.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.420
But since it was so popular,
Hearst poached the comic's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.790
creator for his own paper.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.750
So Pulitzer got
a new illustrator

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.790
and he started
publishing Yellow Kid.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.880
Next thing you know, you had
two competing Yellow Kids.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.080
So the public started
calling the papers

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.960
Yellow Kid newspapers.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.620
Those two main
competing newspapers--

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.380
I mean, they would straight
up lie about stuff just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.920
to get the viewership.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.120
So eventually, sensationalized
news stories became

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.210
known as yellow journalism.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.540
MAN: Interesting.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.120
RICK: So you wanted to sell it.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.830
I'm here to sell it today.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.420
How much did you want for it?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170
I'm asking $750 for it.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.750
RICK: [sighs] How did you
come up with the price 750?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420
I saw it, like, in a
price guide, I think,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.120
that was about 10 years old.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.460
RICK: [sighs] I mean,
my big problem is,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.620
no one knows about this, OK?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.830
I'll tell you what.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.460
I'll give you $150 for it.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.790
You might see a book that
gives you a price in it.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.080
That means nothing if you can't
find anybody to pay that price.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.500
We need to come
up a little bit.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.670
$200, it's yours.
RICK: No.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.670
I'll give you 175.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.750
No one else is going to buy it.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.960
No one else knows what it is.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.830
I'm being a nice guy.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.250
You could wait another
five or six years,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.460
find someone else
that knows what it is.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.670
175.
MAN: All right.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.040
Sweet.
We got a deal.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710
Um, come up front and
we'll do some paperwork.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.210
OK.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.380
It's not as much as what
I was hoping to get today.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.380
But I'm going to take this $175
and be bathing in $1 bills.
