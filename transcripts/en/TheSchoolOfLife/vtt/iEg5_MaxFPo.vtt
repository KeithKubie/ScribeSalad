"Old Boy... is it a guy trapped in a room?"

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.080
"Yeah, yeah, yeah... basically. It has a twist-- just wait for the end of it."

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.440
It can be painfully rare to end up in a satisfying conversation. A lot of the time, we talk and we listen,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.420
but sincere, deep connection eludes us.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:25.200
"Oil, the yeast and pan... it reacts differently and some more healthy or less. I-- like, grapeseed oil is actually

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.600
really... I like that. I mean it's very..."

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.660
We shouldn't blame ourselves for the difficulties we face in conversations. After all, no one ever particularly

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.520
taught us how to have a conversation, though it might have have helped.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.220
"This is the, um, well it's not the orbital, is it? It's the other one. [incoherent]

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.080
Well, there's people trying to get to work, people trying to get to school, I mean, so-- it's just so stupid."

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.100
Too often, when we meet and talk, we stay on the surface of events. We say what happened, where we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.260
went, who we saw; not how we felt, or what it meant to us. We talk about facts, not feelings, which are the only

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.560
conduits to real connection.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.500
"... thing-- that's the issue. It's like when you're on that platform you see there's Royston, Natural Garden City,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.300
and Welling Garden City. And that's the thing-- a lot of people are there on that platform and they don't know

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.700
that they could change your Alexandra Palace..."

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.580
Or else, we insist rather than explain feelings, thereby failing to get them into other people's minds.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.680
"... like so amazing. I still got like-- even thinking of it now, it's just like... UHHH! Uh... you know the...

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.720
yeah, you know when you're kind of... oh, God it was great. Oh, so good."

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.960
Typically, we skirt the raw and intense emotions and  head for safe, but bland, adminstrative chat.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.620
"I used to eat meat... and then, obviously when me and James broke up and I became vegetarian. I've found...

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.400
just absolutely the most amazing recipe book. It's literally-- I don't know if you've seen it and it's got like--

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.500
you can replace... sort of the dish that you would have with meat in it..."

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.680
Or else, we simply can't keep a conversation on track. We repeatedly, as it were, open new windows,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.320
digressing until the thread is lost.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.240
"So I was thinking-- I was actually thinking of playing poker this weekend with uh... you know, my mates,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.280
but I don't play anymore because I lost a bit of money last year, and I know. There's just so much to read now...

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.600
you know what I mean? I'm more interested in reading, if anything... I am going skiing next week, so...

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.800
I don't know, it's not the kind of place you might read but..."

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.980
The good news is that we can learn to shape others' conversations rather than just receive them passively.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.620
In a dialogue, there are always what one might term, "conversational crossroads," with paths that lead either

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.240
to greater intimacy, or else towards ongoing superficiality. Here is one conversational crossroads:

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.220
"I'm inviting some friends over next week who I haven't seen since uni."

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.460
At this point, you could go in one of two ways. A surface way:

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.360
"Oh cool, what university did you go to?"
"Manchester."

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.320
"Oh, yeah, it's really fun. Manchester, yeah. My sister went there. What did you study?"

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.720
"Business."
"What-- what did you do in the second half for?"

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.900
"Well, I ended up in Events Management, but yeah."
"I did French."

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.080
Or, you could steer things down a more emotional path:

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.660
"I'm inviting some friends over next week who I haven't seen since uni."

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.460
"Oh my God, it's like what? 10, 12 years?"
"Yeah, that's when I fini-- got my degree, yeah.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.160
"So, I mean, you've all completely changed... I mean, you've changed."

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.440
"Yeah, I guess I have, yeah. I suppose so. Haven't really thought about it that much."

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.460
"What would you think or say-- I mean, if you could see you then now?"

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.660
Good listeners are like good editors: trimming away what's superfluous, trying gently to get the speaker to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.120
focus on what's really at stake.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.520
"And after my mum died, as you can probably guess, there was quite a bit of stress... um. Well uh, not helped

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.220
by the fact that my favorite football team at the time,  Manchester United, was going through a losing streak--"

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.480
"So, but you were saying that, um, that your parents got divorced and then literally three months later your mum

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.880
passed away?"
"Yes. It was all quick... quick quick."

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.840
"Yeah."
"Um, but yeah. I've got a friend-- uh, Dave, um, or David,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.360
as he's called at work, because obviously that's a bit informal--"

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.180
"Sorry, but you were saying like it just-- like it all happened really quickly and like when your mum went to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.540
the hospital you didn't actually know she was ill before..."

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.520
The other great surprise about conversations is how much we like it when people show vulnerability.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.160
We always think that what we need to do to get other people to like us is to show how well things are going

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.660
for us. Surprisingly, that's actually not very appealing.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.360
"It's so well paid, um... and which is great in terms of, you know, now I can afford, you know, to live in

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.440
Canterbury which is gorgeous and I love my flat, um... so yeah, it's been really, really positive, actually."

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.240
It's not that we want others to fail; we just need to know that our own sorrows have echoes in the lives of others.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.360
That's what connects us; strength may be impressive, but it's vulnerability that builds friendships.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.060
"Yes, I guess I've... missed her every day since then... which is mad because, you know, I'm a grown man now...

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:30.180
got a responsible job, got a family, got my own home, but when it comes down to it... I just miss my mum."

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.420
It's so poignant that we make so much effort to come together, but often don't manage to connect.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.400
The good news is, we can learn how to. The connections we long for are just waiting for us to make the right

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.260
moves, to secure them.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.880
We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place, and to that end, we've now also

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.060
published some extraordinary books, as well as other merchandise that reinforces some of the themes
