00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.990
 In the 1790s only two countries existed: 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.080
 Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of England. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.469
 England and other European powers were serving themselves well and expanding 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.190
 Their empires by the furtive use of their flags. 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.200
 Scotland was not an empire but wanted to join the game, so I needed to create 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.410
 Colony of its own. 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.900
 But where do you build them? 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.700
 "Panama" announced by Scotland. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.370
 I thought that the strategic location of the colony would make trade with the Far East safer 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.900
 And speeding down the long journey around the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.120
 Where both winds and waves help break ships on rocks and ice. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.540
 "Who will lend me money to make this great idea a reality?" I asked Scotland. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.360
 No one, that was the answer. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.109
 Instead of helping, European empires began a trade war with Scotland to reduce power 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.289
 Their future rivals. 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.609
 So, Scotland alone has to fund the project itself. She collected all the money she could, 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.899
 Literally it was put into a large box, and so the capital was collected, and the ship was sent 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.149
 Colonialism. 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:51.749
 400,000 pounds, 8,000 miles and after 111 days, 2500 Scots arrived for beaches 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.469
 Panama, and renamed it "New Caledonia" and immediately discovered some minor problems 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 In their plan: 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.499
 First, the mountains on the western side of Panama were slightly larger than expected, 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.109
 Making wild trade impossible. Even if they think of building a channel, 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.259
 The technology to do so is still 200 years from discovery. 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.020
 Second, the woolen products they brought for trade with local people were ultimately useless 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.159
 With heat and humidity. 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.600
 Thirdly, the Spanish colonists had already placed their flags on the sandy beach and were not 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.189
 Very happy with the arrival of the Scots. 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.030
 Fourthly, without adequate supplies, diseases such as tropical mites, diarrhea, 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.110
 It began to spread. 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.229
 After two years and 2,000 Scottish deaths, they decided to abandon the project. 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.439
 Now, this was not the first unsuccessful attempt in the Scottish Empire, old colonies were formed 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.780
 Her experience and abandonment in Nova Scotia, New Jersey and Caroline, but Panama specifically was a disaster 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.390
 Devastating to Scotland because of over-investment. 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 Remember that money in the fund? It turned out that he was a fifth state fortune. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.210
 Excuse me. 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.960
 Scotland's sudden poverty proved the golden opportunity of the Kingdom of England 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.649
 Which is increasingly concerned that its northern neighbor may ally itself with 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.649
 enemy. 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.939
 England offered Scotland an agreement to compensate for its losses if they voted for 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.600
 the Union. In 1707 Scotland was approved and the Kingdom of Great Britain was born. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 While giving up independence was unpopular in Scotland, its economy improved with the arrival 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.909
 One of the English trade lines (now British) and played a founding role in what will be known 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.240
 Soon the largest empire in human history. 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.399
 However, after more than 300 years, Scotland did not give up altogether 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.200
 National identity and ideas of independence.
