00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.520
What happens to clothes after being dropped
off at the dry cleaners is a mystery to most.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.599
We know that our clothes come back a whole
lot cleaner than when we dropped them off,

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.599
but how?

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.410
And who first got the bright idea to clean
clothing without water?

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.720
The earliest records of professional dry cleaning
go all the way back to the Ancient Romans.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.160
For instance, dry cleaning shops were discovered
in the ruins of Pompeii, a Roman city buried

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.710
by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.890
Those cleaners, known as fullers, used a type
of clay known as fuller’s earth along with

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.300
lye and ammonia (derived from urine) in order
to remove stains such as dirt and sweat from

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.300
clothing.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.940
That process proved pretty effective for any
fabric too delicate for normal washing or

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.120
stains that refused to budge.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.260
(In fact, the industry was so prominent that
there were taxes on collecting urine.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.610
Fullers generally used animal urine and would
also maintain urine collecting pots at public

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.610
bathrooms.)

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.220
As for more modern methods, the biggest revolution
in dry cleaning came around in the early 19th

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.220
century.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.360
Traditionally, Jean Baptiste Jolly of France
is generally named the father of modern dry

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
cleaning.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.640
The story goes that in 1825, a careless maid
knocked over a lamp and spilled turpentine

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.260
on a dirty tablecloth.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.430
Jolly noticed that once the turpentine dried,
the stains that had marred the fabric were

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.430
gone.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.100
He conducted an experiment where he bathed
the entire tablecloth in a bathtub filled

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.460
with turpentine and found that it came clean
once it dried.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.940
Whether a maid and an accident really had
anything to do with it or not, Jolly used

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.670
this method when he opened the often claimed
first modern dry cleaning shop, “Teinturerier

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.420
Jolly Belin”, in Paris.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.460
However a patent for a process called “dry
scouring” was filed with the U.S. Patent

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.790
Office in 1821, four years before Jolly’s
discovery.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.270
A man by the name of Thomas Jennings was a
clothier and a tailor in New York, and soon

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.640
the first African American to be granted a
patent in the United States.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.540
(Previous to this, it was ruled that slave
owners were the rightful owner of any inventions

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.310
made by their slaves and could then patent
those inventions under their own names.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.260
Jennings, however, was a free man.)

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.909
So while working as a clothier, he, like so
many others in his profession, was familiar

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.720
with the age old customer complaint that they
could not clean their more delicate clothes

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.510
once they’d become stained because the fabric
wouldn’t hold up to traditional washing

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.510
and scrubbing.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.700
Jennings, thus, began experimenting with different
cleaning solutions and processes before discovering

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.819
the process he named “dry scouring.”

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.010
His method was a hit and not only made him
extremely wealthy, but allowed him to buy

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.310
his wife and children out of slavery, as well
as fund numerous abolitionist efforts.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.581
As for the exact method he used, this has
been lost to history as his patent (U.S. Patent

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.100
3306x) was destroyed in an 1836 fire.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.580
What we do know is that after Jennings, other
dry cleaners during the 19th century used

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.380
things like turpentine, benzene, kerosene,
gasoline, and petrol as solvents in the process

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.150
of dry cleaning clothes.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.380
These solvents made dry cleaning a dangerous
business.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.560
Turpentine caused clothes to smell even after
being cleaned, and benzene could be toxic

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.260
to dry cleaners or customers if left on the
clothes.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.720
But all of these solvents posed the bigger
problem of being highly flammable.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.670
The danger of clothes and even the building
catching fire was so great that most cities

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.130
refused to allow dry cleaning to occur in
the business districts.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.319
In the United Kingdom, for example, dry cleaners
had smaller satellite stores in the city where

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.810
they took in customers’ clothes and then
those clothes were transported to a “factory”

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.050
outside of the city limits where the dry cleaning
took place.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.160
The major risk of clothes and buildings catching
on fire because of the flammable solvents

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
led to dry cleaners searching for a safer
alternative.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.790
Chlorinated solvents gained popularity in
the early 20th century, quickly leaving the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.770
flammable solvents in the dust.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.080
They removed stains just as well as petroleum-based
cleaners without the risk of causing the clothes

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.720
or factories to catch fire.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.000
That also meant dry cleaners could move their
cleaning facilities back into cities and eliminated

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.080
the need to transport clothes back and forth
between two locations.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.530
A chlorine-based solvent with the chemical
name tetrachloroethylene, or sometimes called

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.910
perchloroethylene, became the go-to solvent
for dry cleaners in the 1930s.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.020
Originally discovered in 1821 by Michael Faraday,
“perc” could not only be used in relatively

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100
compact dry cleaning machines, but also did
a better job of cleaning than any of the other

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.660
solvents of the day; it’s still the chemical
of choice for most dry cleaners today.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.690
While perc is considered much safer than most
solvents used by dry cleaners in the past,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.889
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
in the United States is working to phase the

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.490
solvent out of the industry.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.560
The EPA claims that while wearing clothes
treated with perc does not appear to be dangerous,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.249
perc can be dangerous if accidentally released
into the environment as it’s toxic to plants

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.249
and animals.

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.419
Additionally, the EPA also notes that sustained
exposure to perc, such as by workers in the

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.819
industry, can cause health issues with the
nervous system, including potentially drastically

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.350
increased chances of developing Parkinson’s
Disease.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.240
There are also studies done by the EPA that
indicate perc may be a carcinogen.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.639
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
also classifies the chemical as a “Group

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.830
2A carcinogen,” meaning in their opinion,
it’s probably carcinogenic.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.180
So how exactly is this chemical used to dry
clean clothes?

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.290
The process of dry cleaning fabric can vary
between dry cleaning companies; however, the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.969
general method is as so: before placing the
clothing item in the machines, workers pre-treat

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.289
stains by hand, as well as remove any materials
that aren’t suitable for dry cleaning (for

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.839
instance buttons made of materials that may
dissolve in perc are removed).

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:28.159
The machine works in a similar fashion to
normal, in-home washing machines.

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.979
It agitates the garments and adds in the solvents
as it goes, cycling the solution through the

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.199
machine and a filter as the clothing is agitated.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.999
Temperature is also typically controlled at
around 86 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.139
Next, the garments are either dried in the
same machine or workers move them to a separate

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:46.139
machine.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.190
During the drying cycle, the temperature is
raised to about 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.280
helps the chemicals evaporate off the clothes
faster, while still being low enough not to

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.460
damage the clothing.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.189
In the end, approximately 99.9% of the chemicals
used are removed from the dry cleaned item

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.639
and recycled for use again in cleaning.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.240
Once the clothes are dry, workers press the
clothes, potentially stitch back on any items

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.159
that had to be taken off, and put the clothing
into plastic bags for customer pick-up.
