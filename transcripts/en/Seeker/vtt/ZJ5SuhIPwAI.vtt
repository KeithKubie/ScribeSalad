00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.930
Two billion years ago, the earth’s geology
came together to spontaneously and naturally

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.330
form what was essentially a nuclear fission
reactor.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.170
It operated stably for about a million years,
and its radioactive waste has been safely

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.200
contained--again, totally naturally--for millions
of years since.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.130
Surely we can learn from this, right?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.890
And also this DEFINITELY sounds like the origin
story for an awesome comic book hero, I’m

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.890
just saying.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.289
Before we dive into how the heck this happened,
let’s do a quick overview of fission.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.060
Nuclear fission happens when a heavy atomic
nucleus splits into lighter elements and rogue

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.370
particles
and releases a LARGE amount of energy . In

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.590
addition to the energy, those smaller byproducts
are usually lighter atomic nuclei that are

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.940
unstable after the fission process and are
therefore highly radioactive.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.019
This is where the bulk of nuclear power’s
hazardous waste comes from.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.129
Fission also releases stray neutrons, and
these neutrons can excite other nearby heavy

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
nuclei into the fission state, causing a chain
reaction that when controlled in a nuclear

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.859
power plant, can be harnessed to power our
everyday life.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.420
But when left uncontrolled, it can be disastrously
destructive.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.940
So when humans make a nuclear reactor we have
to work pretty hard to get fission to occur.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.620
First, we’ve gotta have that heavy element
to split, which for us is usually uranium.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.870
There are three main kinds--or isotopes--of
uranium.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.080
The most common isotope is U-238, and it’s
found all over the earth and in our oceans--But

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.540
it’s not fissionable by itself because it’s
just not unstable enough, so we can’t break

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.640
it apart to release that energy we need.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.550
Isotope U-235, however, is unstable enough
to be fissionable...but it makes up less than

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.630
1% of the naturally occurring uranium in the
world.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.520
So when we mine uranium, we have to manually
enrich it to contain about 3% U-235 before

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.140
we can use it in a nuclear reactor.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.890
But fissionable fuel is just step one--for
your power-producing nuclear reactor to be

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.820
safe you also need some kind of moderator
that will slow down the neutrons enough so

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.850
that they don’t cause an uncontrollable
reaction.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.450
In most nuclear reactors, we use water for
this.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.040
There are also control rods made out of other
neutron-absorbing materials like silver, and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.630
water is also be used as a coolant so the
whole operation doesn't overheat and go into

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
meltdown.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.010
So how is it that something we’ve spent
decades trying to perfect just magically happened

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.709
all by itself in nature?

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.189
Well, two billion years ago there was a lot
more U-235 than there is now, since it decays

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.189
more quickly than U-238.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:27.319
And in a place called Oklo, Gabon, there was
a high enough concentration of U-235 to induce

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.439
spontaneous nuclear fission.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.439
Wow.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.400
Presumably there was also enough of a moderator,
probably water, to keep the whole thing from

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.579
exploding.

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.379
AND there weren’t enough neutron absorbing
materials around to prevent the fission from

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.970
sustaining itself.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.680
This is the only natural nuclear reactor in
the world that we know of so far.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.489
But that’s not to say there aren’t others--they
may have been subducted or eroded, or maybe

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.219
we just haven’t found them!

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.840
But this one natural nuclear reactor has been
completely mined by humans.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.290
It’s gone now.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.189
That’s how we even know about it in the
first place, we went down into the ground

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.379
looking for uranium to enrich and came back
up and said, ‘Uhhhhh, either someone’s

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.510
stolen almost 200 kilograms of uranium-235
or this is a natural nuclear reactor that’s

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.900
burned it all off already’.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.030
It’s the latter, in case you haven’t been
following along.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.060
But we can learn a lot from Oklo today.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.450
Because again, it operated safely for MILLIONS
of years and NONE of its nuclear waste has

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.439
leaked or adversely affected ANYTHING!

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.659
This is remarkable because uranium fission
byproducts can be highly hazardous, and we

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.239
struggle to know what to do with that waste.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.469
Cesium is one particularly nasty fission byproduct,
and is one of a suite of compounds that could

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.150
cause symptoms of radiation poisoning.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.859
Cesium is one of the elements that makes the
Chernobyl and Fukushima sites so dangerous.

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.080
Researchers recently studying the Oklo mines
discovered that the cesium byproducts from

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.840
the natural reactor were most likely absorbed
and contained by another element that occurred

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.230
naturally there called ruthenium.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.480
Ruthenium’s structure allows it to bind
to these radioactive elements, kinda like

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.730
an atomic hug, making the elements like cesium
less radioactive.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.659
Ruthenium itself is too rare for us to use
on an industrial scale in taking care of commercial

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.319
nuclear power waste.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.669
But this new insight into the world’s natural
fission reactor gives researchers hope that

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.700
they can find or make something similar to
safeguard our modern nuclear waste.

And fun fact, the Oklo reactors isn’t just
one reactor-it’s SIX.TEEN. different reactors.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.060
PLUS one nearby.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.430
