perform better so anything that we can

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390
perform better so anything that we can
 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.540
perform better so anything that we can
do to explain to people that it's not

and the culture we do it in and that's
 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.060
and the culture we do it in and that's
very important I think I actually got my

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
very important I think I actually got my
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.979

really critical for women to be at the
 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.709
really critical for women to be at the
table and in particular it's critical

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719
table and in particular it's critical
 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.089
table and in particular it's critical
for women to have the technical skills

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099
