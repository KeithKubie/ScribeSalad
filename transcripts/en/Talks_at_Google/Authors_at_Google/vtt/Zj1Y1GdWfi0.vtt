MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.560
Welcome to another outstanding
Talks at Google Speech.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.510
We are thrilled and honored to
have Chef Daniel Boulud here

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.630
today from New York.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.270
From his time at Le
Cirque to his current work

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.060
with the Bocuse d'Or team,
and his entire portfolio

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.630
of restaurants,
Daniel has really

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.270
been advancing French cuisine
and also incorporating

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.419
American tastes and
ingredients into the mix.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.960
And so he's here
today speaking to us

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.700
about his new book called
"Daniel: My French Cuisine."

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.780
And it chronicles about
75 of his favorite dishes,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.850
some from the restaurants,
some from France itself.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.770
And so he'll be talking to
us about that in more detail

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.480
today.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810
And we do have a microphone
at the end for questions.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.810
So please join me in
welcoming Daniel to Google.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.626
Thanks.

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:49.084
DANIEL BOULUD:
Thank you very much.

00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:49.583
Thank you.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.210
I got the mic.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.810
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.400
So how many of you
are good cooks?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.900
Pas mal.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.334
Good chefs?

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:07.000
There are a few.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.410
But, no, thank you.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.800
I had a wonderful
lunch here, by the way.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
And it seems like you are
the luckiest people on earth.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.380
Not only you are in California
but you have amazing chef also.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.410
I tasted your
pumpkin soup in one

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:31.590
and then I finished my lunch
with-- which cafeteria was it?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.130
Which restaurant?

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.120
Hangout, yeah.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.320
Exactly.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.470
So, fantastic.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.310
Well cooking, it's,
of course, something

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330
you learn early, often.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.620
I learned it at 14,
but I knew that I

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.290
wanted to be a cook when
I was about 10 to 12.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.050
I was born and
raised on the farm,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.640
and today every chef
dreams to be farmer chef.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.850
It's farm to table.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.440
It's directly garden to
table as close as possible.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.539
And we have seen
models of that growing

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.420
and I think it's fantastic.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.220
I don't have my
farm yet, but I do

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.830
remember the one I
had in France where

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.120
we grew everything, all
kinds of vegetables.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.380
We also had livestock.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.950
Cows, and goats-- 40 goats--
and making goat cheese.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.190
Pigs, and rabbit, and
turkey, and geese,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.610
and squab, and
chicken, and duck.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.740
And every week we would
go to the farmer's market

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.820
and bring all the harvest
we had that particular week.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.330
And it's true, certainly,
about how humble

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.290
and how important it is
about life, ingredient.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.900
And when you're a
chef I think it's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440
the most important
thing you hang on

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.050
and the most important
thing you fight for.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.800
And, certainly, the
most important things,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.710
we need almost a trust
to have access to.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.760
Growing up on the farm,
when I wanted to be a cook,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.990
my parents and
some friends helped

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.650
me to get in one of the
best restaurants in Lyon.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.420
So I started in Lyon at
14, and 2 star restaurant.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.220
Fantastic.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.510
And Lyon is kind of the
mecca of chefs in France.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.470
I right away knew
that I was entering

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.340
a very, very special club,
a very spatial society,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.930
a real community of people
who share the same passion

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.770
and have the same ambition.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.700
But yet, it was at the
local level of Lyon,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.640
except for one man,
Paul Bocuse, who

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.860
was the chef who was
starting to travel the world

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.790
and taking the cuisine of
Lyon to Rio de Janeiro,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.580
to Tokyo, to
California at Mondavi.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.770
Robert Mondavi was
the first one who

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.680
brought French
chefs to California

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.710
and were make them cook
and do demonstrations

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.089
there in Napa Valley.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.850
So now in the early '70s, really
French cuisine is changing.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.270
And I'm this young
chef, so I decided

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.130
to work for some of the
best chefs in France.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.560
For me it was very
important to choose someone

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.280
who had the same
fundamentals as the one

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.380
I started to work with and also
someone who had three Michelin

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.020
stars, because I felt that I had
a start at a two Michelin star

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.650
and I wanted to know more
about the three Michelin star

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.150
restaurant.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.200
But I felt strong with
the two star background

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.090
because I learned a
lot during that time.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.450
And so I went and I did
my tour de France, what

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.220
we call the tour de France,
where you have to-- I

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.240
wanted to work in the south,
so I went to Provence,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.730
and I went to Moulin
de Mougins in Cannes.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.280
It just had three
stars that year.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.350
It was very exhilarating.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.370
I mean the energy, the talent
who is gathering around you

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.360
because, of course, he
received so many resumes

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.200
that he can be a
little selective.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.890
And then after I moved to
the southwest of France

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.450
to Michel Guerard, I moved
to Burgundy in the Rhone,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.610
in Burgundy region
with Georges Blanc.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.750
And then I left France.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.720
I went to Denmark.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.050
And in '80 I came
to America because I

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.110
wanted to be like them.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.180
I wanted to travel.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.760
They seem to have the good
time when they travel.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.890
And they also seem
to bring ideas.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.450
And all the traveling those
chefs in the '70s were doing

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.220
were really also-- not
only they were bringing

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.950
their food and their
culture to a country,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.260
but they were also
bringing ideas.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.560
And I always love--
I wouldn't have

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.420
been a chef if I didn't want to
travel and be able to discover

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.920
where else can we cook and
what else there is out there.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.750
And so came to Washington, DC.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.020
I did two years in
DC as a private chef

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.690
in a residence
for an ambassador.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.820
And that was kind of a very
cushy job, not too fascinating.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.180
But I had a chance to really
go to the market every day

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.490
there in DC, having
small suppliers.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.700
Because I was not cooking
for a large amount of people

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.550
I was depending on
small suppliers.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.190
And that was already
the beginning

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.180
of having local farmers
there and local suppliers.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.920
And there was a great
chef there also,

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.900
Jean-Louis Palladin, who had
a restaurant at the Watergate,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.550
in the basement
of the Watergate.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.840
And he had any other
ingredient I couldn't find,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.820
he had it there.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.190
So he was great.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.990
Then after DC I
felt like New York

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.970
has to be my stop before
I go back to France.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.820
And I made a stop in
New York and never left.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.490
And so from that
I had the chance

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.550
to work in a great restaurant
called Le Cirque when

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.340
the restaurant was in
transition of being famous

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.110
for maybe more its clientele
dining there than the food,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.430
and being famous-- because it
was famous-- but for its owner

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.870
Sirio Maccioni, an
Italian restaurateur.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.510
Incredible professional.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:35.090
But in the kitchen there was a
big gap of direction and focus.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.900
And so I worked there six years.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.820
And that helped
me prove the world

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.110
that I could maybe
raise enough money

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.040
to open my own restaurant.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.580
And 20 years ago
I opened Daniel.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:56.280
And so this book is-- but
it's about the evolution

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.860
and the growth of the last
20 years as well for me.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.950
And I think we see
also the evolution

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.140
at the gross in America.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.890
When I arrived in
New York and I was

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.450
my own executive
sous-chef-- executive

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.600
sous-chef job-- Thomas
Keller was my chef de partie

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.780
in the poisson.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.880
Alfred Portale was
chef garde manger,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.090
which is from Gotham Bar
and Grill in New York.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.500
Billy Yosses, the pastry
chef of the White House

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.060
was my garde manger as well.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.970
And we had all kinds of
rock stars of the moment.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.510
We were just young cooks.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.950
And that was before Thomas
went to France and all that.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.150
And they were like-- every
day we were witnessing

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.100
talent coming in,
talent growing in.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.690
And I went to the Plaza in the
after, and even at Le Cirque

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.200
I have so many
alumni, whereas today

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.980
are very influential chefs
all over the country.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.270
But those alumni have already
produced a new generation

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.610
of chefs, and we
see them coming now.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.580
And I think that's the exciting
part, is then, of course,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.660
they learn with
great chefs like me

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.650
and they understand
tradition, and they

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.810
try to create an
evolution with that

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.630
and try to be really
relevant to their time.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.830
And I think, for me, that's
what I've tried to always do,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.790
but yet I'm still very French.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.320
I am being in
America for 30 years,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.870
you can't take the
French out of me still.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.370
And it's OK.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.630
When it comes to
cooking, it's acceptable.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.269
For other things, I don't
know if it's all acceptable,

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.310
especially with the
politician we have right now.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.830
But it's about ambition.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.620
And I think chefs, it
takes a lot of ambition

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.570
to become a great chef.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.140
But it takes a
lot of discipline,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.030
it takes a lot of hard work,
it takes a lot of sacrifice.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.000
It takes lot of
motivation as well.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.770
And I think we can all
share our own story

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.070
about how to become a chef.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.270
I actually I wrote a book
called "Letter to a Young Chef"

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:22.600
and it's about what it
took for me as a young chef

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.580
to become who I am, but
also what it will take

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.910
you, the young chef,
to eventually succeed,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.760
even if we're in
a different time.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.220
I think it's a
timeless lesson, I

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.290
think, for what I wrote there.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.950
And it's still a lot
of use by students

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.510
at cooking schools for
being inspired, being

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.130
driven, and staying
on the course,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.290
and-- having chosen
that profession--

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.530
to make a difference in
the future with themselves

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.040
and with their teams.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.690
So the book.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.230
And one word also
is to, of course,

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.367
for every one I worked
and for everything I

00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:08.740
expect from my staff, is to
always exceed expectations.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.630
And I think that's
something where,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.460
at a certain level
of perfection you

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.000
have to have everyone
exceed expectations.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.710
And that's the only way
those young chefs will

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:27.220
grow to become the leaders,
the ones who can definitely

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.370
prove that.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:36.160
So the book is about Daniel
today, the restaurant.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.720
It's not the whole story
about the last 20 years.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.820
I wrote seven other
books and they

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.790
were all telling
different story,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.920
but also sometimes geared
more for home cooking,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.680
being more comfortable
with the idea of that.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.550
And this one was
more about capturing

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.910
what the restaurant
represents today.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.730
Many people know
Daniel the restaurant?

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.612
Yes, you have been there?

00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:04.070
Mhmm.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:09.990
So I think it's one of
those restaurants-- it's

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.140
a grand restaurant.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.820
And there is not too many
in America left like that.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:21.180
And I feel that it's a landmark
in New York now after 20 years.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.470
It's not the landmark,
but it will be one day.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.840
But at least the restaurant
has sort of an era of the past

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.000
and a feel of the present.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.060
And I think that's a little bit
also what I do in my cooking.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:44.804
It's about tradition and
it's about evolution as well.

00:12:44.804 --> 00:12:45.470
So I don't know.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.270
Do you have couple of
pictures we can do?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.250
Yeah, let's do a little
video introduction.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:56.590
But otherwise is there
any other subjects

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.080
you would like me
to approach for you

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.820
while I am here,
before the video?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.907
Yes, tell me.

00:13:03.907 --> 00:13:05.990
AUDIENCE: There was an
article a couple months ago

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.370
in "Vanity Fair"
that was talking

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.080
about the generation of
chefs that you mentioned

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.920
and the idea of tasting menus
versus a la carte ordering

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.870
options, and how a lot of it
was the tasting menus just sort

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.964
of give the chef ultimate
authority, make things easier,

00:13:21.964 --> 00:13:24.130
predict how much food you're
going to need to order,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.900
different ingredients,
and so forth.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.200
But then they were sort
of saying that also it

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.480
kind of lost sight of
the patron as being

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.499
like the ultimate boss in
terms of what they want to eat.

00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:36.290
So I was just kind of
curious your thoughts

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.764
on how that works
and do you think

00:13:39.764 --> 00:13:40.930
one's better than the other?

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.714
Your philosophy.

00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:43.130
DANIEL BOULUD: I
think no, no, no.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.030
The tasting menu
and post tasting

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.410
menu work very well if you
have 20, 30, 50 seats, maybe.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:58.390
And your goal is to try to
not worry about any clientele

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.920
locally, any
clientele nationally,

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:07.110
you just want to
really show them

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.530
the restaurant cooks this
way and no other way.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.480
I think it's nice.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.380
For me, this is not what I do.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.080
I like to create a menu
where there is choice.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.950
I can do 10, 12, 14 course
after with the menu,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.280
but I like to offer
options to the customer

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.440
and I like the customer to
decide based on their budget,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.400
based on their ambition, and
based on how much they want

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.990
to spend-- or want
to eat, pardon--

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.370
what they would like to have.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.500
But we customize all the
time things for customers.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.420
But it's true.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.610
And I went the other night
to Saison, and I sit down

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.370
and I had no idea what
I was going to eat.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.375
And 18 courses later,
it was very pleasant.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.220
So I don't blame this formula.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.580
And maybe one day I'll open
a little 25 seat restaurant

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.830
and I'll do only one menu.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.700
That's the dream for
a chef, actually,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:18.100
because you can really
focus on few dishes only.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.310
But for me, I think
it takes the soul

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.710
of being in a restaurant
because I think

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.440
you go to a restaurant
for an experience,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.610
but also for experiencing
as many possibilities

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.570
as the chef has.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.620
And sometimes when
you do tasting,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:42.830
the food cannot get the same
flavor and depth than when you

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.940
cook a little bite size than
when you're making a real

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.500
preparation which is
in a larger scale.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.681
And so I don't know.

00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:56.930
We'll see where the future
goes with the tasting menu.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.490
They'll always be there
because it has been before

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.780
and it will continue.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.840
But I don't think they will
become the central point

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.340
because it'll become too
competitive among them

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.140
and then it's expensive.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.210
It's very expensive.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.590
So if it's to go once in
your lifetime, I don't know.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.150
I want you to come
back once a month.

00:16:19.034 --> 00:16:20.450
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for coming.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.540
I think this is the highlight
of my year at Google

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.252
in terms of people
that we've hosted.

00:16:24.252 --> 00:16:25.668
DANIEL BOULUD: And
we have scratch

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:30.777
and sniff so when you see
the dish-- it's a new app.

00:16:30.777 --> 00:16:32.360
AUDIENCE: It's related
to the question

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.460
I'm going to ask actually.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.070
Since you're at
Google I felt like I

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.470
had to ask a technology
related question.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.630
I just wanted to get
your general opinions

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.650
about so-called
modernist cuisine

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.815
as Nathan Myhrvold
would call it.

00:16:44.815 --> 00:16:45.981
Just your reflections.

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:47.480
DANIEL BOULUD:
Nathan gave it a name

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.880
and I think it was
the perfect name.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:59.240
And I think I have the 55
pound, maybe 60 pound book,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.960
of five, six volumes of
the "Modernist Cuisine".

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.790
And I am in admiration
for what he did

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.810
and the compilation he created
about explaining really

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.750
deeply the
transformation of food

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.900
and how you can also adapt
something classically made

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.780
and make it in a
whole different way,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.180
and yet get even
a better result.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.339
And I think this is fantastic.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.620
It don't always apply to
the restaurant business

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.150
on a every day basis, but we
do have a lot of equipment

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:43.030
in our kitchen will help
us and help us practice

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:48.670
certain elements of
discovery in a way.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.760
Since Ferran Adria in
Spain who was certainly

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.350
the leader in this
cuisine, modernist cuisine,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.850
I think Nathan had
the budget to be able,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.440
than a chef can afford.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.510
That's a thing
also, is then, chef

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.600
has his limitations on
what he can produce.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.160
This is what Nathan produced.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.670
And I think it's going to
become a reference for today.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.680
And it's not taking
anything away

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.930
from the references
of the past as well.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:25.320
I think it's just reestablishing
some solid reference for today.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.380
But do you make a
better cook when

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.260
you ask him to put
the meat in the bag

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.330
and to cook it at a certain
temperature for four hours?

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.390
Or do you make a better
cook when you give him

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.620
a pot, and some butter and oil,
and to roast something by hand?

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.810
Know what I mean?

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.630
I think the cook of
the future, they're

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.650
going to have to go back to the
real cooking in order to do,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.750
because otherwise it's terrible
when the restaurant uses

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.780
too much of sous-vide,
too much of technique,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.820
will take away the
cook because now we

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.150
under the control of electronic
control of temperatures,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.490
electronic time.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.750
I mean everything is
computerized in a way,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.440
and the food is basically
engineered to be perfect.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.800
And that takes away the
art of being a great chef.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.910
That's the only thing.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.870
So anyway, let's go through
the book a little bit here.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:22.490
So this is a snail,
California snail actually,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.250
and spring garlic soup.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.600
It's a sample.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.610
It's sort of a vichyssoise
of garlic with snail.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:37.760
And a little bit of tempura
of snail with purple potato.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.470
And then this is a
veloute also of watercress

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.230
with a little crayfish
tembale, with a little bit

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.940
of chicken liver inside.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.780
And there is the cockscomb
fritter on top as well.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.360
So that's very French in a way--
the crawfish, the cockscomb,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.480
the chicken liver--
is very Lyonnaise,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.200
from where I come from.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.930
And with the watercress as
a warm veloute as a soup.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.910
This is a cod
poached in olive oil,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.270
and slow poached in
olive oil, cured before,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.110
lightly cured,
and then flake it,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:24.920
flake it and served on crushed
beans with almond foam.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.740
This is local Santa
Barbara abalone.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.520
And we have a cauliflower
concasse on the bottom.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.880
And we have the abalone
and it's got a little bit

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.830
sort of a grenoblaise garnish
with the eggs and the chive,

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.330
and we have the
caviar with that.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.630
And so it's a also made
with a sake buerre blanc.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.560
OK, let's show a little video.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.480
We entertain you
in different ways.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.316
This way.

00:20:54.316 --> 00:21:02.544

00:21:02.544 --> 00:21:03.695
-OK, we have to go.

00:22:32.887 --> 00:22:33.512
-Everyone stop.

00:22:48.795 --> 00:22:49.295
-OK.

00:22:49.295 --> 00:22:50.253
Now I think it's ready.

00:22:59.518 --> 00:23:00.611
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:00.611 --> 00:23:01.486
DANIEL BOULUD: Voila.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.480
So that was the making
a little bit of-- I

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.150
mean that was the life
at Daniel, the dining

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.390
room, the front, the back.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.950
And you can slide, just
go through the slides.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.030
I'm not connecting.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.780
But then the book I did
was about restaurant Daniel

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.750
trying to record the time now.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.860
But it was also to bring what
tradition of French cuisine

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.500
means to me.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.250
And so I created a section in
the book called iconic session.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.890
And I don't know if many
of you know Bill Buford,

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.320
but if you have read "Eat",
you know what it means.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.800
And if you have also
read, "Among the Thugs",

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.950
he wrote that
maybe 10 years ago.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.800
And when he was
living in London he

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.660
decided to live with
the hooligans for a year

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.310
in order to understand--
in order to make the book.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.670
And so that was the title.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.690
And he remains alive out of it.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.620
He was very lucky despite
risking his life every day.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:11.270
And so after that he
was, I think, in New York

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.990
and he met Mario Batali
sometime late night in a bar.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.610
And then he asked
if he could come

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.260
and be an apprentice at Babbo.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.050
He did that and then he
felt I got to go to Italy

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.070
and cook with the
Italians because it's

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.120
nice to be in New York,
but I'm going to Italy.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.600
So he moved there for a
year and cooked and met

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.210
some amazing people
to cook with there.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.250
And then after, four
years ago he told me

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.820
I want to move to France.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.440
I think everybody
talks about the French,

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.840
everybody thinks they know
what they are talking about,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.320
but no one really has
spent time to research

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.870
what's going on with the French.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.680
So he has spent four years
in France, four years

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.350
in Lyon, my home town.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.210
And he has been
working on a book.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.330
He's two years
behind, but that's OK.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.240
And the book is going
to come out next year.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.230
It should be, the title
is not maybe official,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.060
but right now it's "Dirt".

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.500
And so from the "Heat"
he had "Dirt" now.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.490
And dirt for the terroir,
of course, what dirt

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:23.490
can bring as incredible
source of supply

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.140
but also the dirt
among the chefs in Lyon

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.040
and French cuisine,
and all that.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.000
So it should be an
interesting book.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.090
And so I asked Bill to come
to New York and cook with me,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.180
and cook dishes who, for me,
represented French cuisine,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.000
through the history
of my cooking.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.800
Like this dish we
were doing in Lyon.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.220
It was a sole souffle,
a much smaller.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.850
And I wanted to do
a turbot souffle.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.624
So you take basically
a 10 pound turbot

00:25:53.624 --> 00:25:55.290
and you have to find
a turbotiere, which

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.790
is this lozenge-shaped pot
which is only made for turbot,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.300
to cook a turbot.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.636
And it costs a fortune
and you can only

00:26:04.636 --> 00:26:06.010
cook turbot inside
of it, you can

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:09.280
cook anything you want but it's
definitely more efficient when

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.140
you cook a turbot.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.580
And this is stuffed
with-- can you go back?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.190
I'm sorry.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:24.180
So this turbot is stuffed
with lobster, and tomatoes,

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:31.510
and basil, and the farce is made
with some lobster and turbot

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.110
filet, as well, and cream.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.380
And then decorated with
the tomato, the zucchini,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.350
and olives, and braised.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.260
And the sauce is made with a
lobster head and a classic sort

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.760
of American sauce but
with a bit more tomato.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.800
And so this was
a turbot souffle.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.420
So with Bill, I told
him, I say you're not

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.510
going to be next to
me with your pad.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.980
You're going to be cooking
next to me your own turbot.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.790
So we both made our own turbot.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.710
And the importance
also is that I was not

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.270
going to give the
recipe to anyone.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.770
I would just going
to want Bill's words

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.470
about the making
of those dishes.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.570
And so sometime
he writes and then

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.150
he goes into a
research direction.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.400
And it's incredible as a writer.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:25.990
I think everybody feels so
captivated by how he writes

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:31.890
about food and how he's
taken by eye's mind

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.690
take him in many directions.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.860
This is a jambon au foin, which
is a baked ham poached in hay

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.330
and then baked in hay
again in this casserole

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.700
with a lot of hay around.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.310
And then the other
one is the shoulder

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.930
which is smoked in hay with all
the vegetables cooking together

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.160
with the shoulder.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.450
And then we smoke it inside
with a smoke gun and then

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:03.130
close it, keep adding
smoke into the hay,

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:07.490
add smoke into the preparation.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.110
And the hay we use
is the same one

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.110
as the mountain
police of New York.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.690
Horses.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.389
We have the same
farm, so it's good.

00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:17.680
And then we serve it like that.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.210
So this was the rustic
French cuisine as well,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:26.280
the one I grew up in Lyon with.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.750
Go ahead.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.810
So this is a tete
de veau en tortue.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.030
This is a classic dish
what was interpreted

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.830
from a recipe from
Careme in the 1800s.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.840
And this is basically in
the center is the head.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.660
So if you look closely
there's the nostril

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.890
somewhere around here.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.190
There's two nostril
of the head and all.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.790
So the head has been cooked
for quite a long time.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.470
Then after it gets
open and it gets clean,

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.420
and we put back inside the sweet
bread, the brain, the tongue,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.170
the cheeks, the jaw, and
take the fat away, and remold

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.210
and then un-mold the head.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.950
We bake it, we cook it
because I make a little farce.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.280
I cook it again and
then un-mold it.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.050
And then I take
the cooking liquid

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:16.590
and I create a green
shell but it's all

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.350
made of herbs and
cooking liquid.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.030
Then there is a
pyramid of crayfish,

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.960
what goes on top, cooked
into a little farce of veal.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.720
And then we have
canard with truffle,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.240
we have a little slow
poached eggs with truffle,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.700
then there is mushroom
with cockscomb.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.180
Then in the front there is some
tongue and brain, fried brain.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.420
And then the crayfish, and
then the sauce is very spicy.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.110
It's made with veal
bones and is very spicy.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.680
And it goes very well with it.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.470
So tete de veau en tortue.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.680
I made some when I was young
but I never made this one.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.080
And that's why I wanted
Bill to feel like,

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.830
woah, I'm getting my ass
kicked here with this.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.720
And so he really felt that way.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.290
Go ahead.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.710
And so this one,
it's a chartreuse.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.790
So chartreuse in France
is you take a mold,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.240
or you take a moule
a chartreuse actually

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.220
is a mold of this
shape, like that.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.550
And we do different
things with it.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.390
We call it also moule
a Charlotte as well.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.780
A chartreuse is
for the game birds.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.230
A chartreuse is basically a
whole bird baked in cabbage.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.500
You take a pheasant
or partridge and you

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.950
have pieces of
lard on the bottom,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.640
and you can put some
potatoes, and then

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.610
you have the braised
cabbage, and then

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.200
you put the whole
pheasant which has

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.310
been pre-roasted and
flambe with cognac.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.130
And then you cover
it with cabbage

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.580
and then you bake it in
the oven like that too.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.980
So the game birds
release all its flavor.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.890
And so here I wanted
to make a chartreuse

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.260
like you have never seen.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.330
So first we have a
young chef, Chad,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.200
who has worked on
the book there.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.130
And he's becoming mathematician
at Columbia, but he was a chef.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.880
He went back to Columbia
to be a mathematician.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.340
So I made him calculate
all the carrot, turnips,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.850
and yellow carrot,
and orange carrot too.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.340
I have the perfect
field of the mold.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.260
And then after we line
it up with cabbage

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.590
leaves, and then we fill it
up with the braised cabbage.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.350
And then this is a
slice of woodcock.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:27.360
Woodcock, add those birds'
heads on top of that.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:35.270
And so we add first a
cabbage molded with the lard,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.410
with the bacon, and this is
filled with crushed potato,

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.970
with foie gras fat,
and then slice of foie

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.560
gras, and dove--
little bird dove.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.410
So those are all
wild birds in a way.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:52.620
And then inside is partridge,
woodcock, and pheasant.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.340
Three types of birds.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.870
And then we take the innards
of the partridge, pheasant,

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.420
and decasse and we make a
little stuffed cabbage on top.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.990
And so that's a little sauvage,
but I have wonderful hunters

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.750
in New York, friends hunters.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.720
And so they bring
me birds to New York

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.810
to play with that
when I want to.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.220
And this is duck a la presse.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.650
So this gentlemen here
has been my best customer

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.810
since I opened the restaurant.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.940
For 20 years, every week,
he eats in the restaurant.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.680
And now he's a retired lawyer.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.830
And so now he works in
the kitchen as well.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.570
During the morning he comes
and spends time with the chef

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.630
and then he go home, he
change and come for dinner.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.260
And there's a whole story about
the duck press in the book

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.960
and how this duck press
was put back to life.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.380
And with the recipe as well,
will belong to somebody

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.920
in the '30s in America who
was a lawyer from Cleveland,

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.050
who was going to the
21 Club all the time

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.969
and took a duck press
home and started

00:33:01.969 --> 00:33:03.760
to make all kinds of
recipes for his friend

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.970
because he was also a hunter.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:12.330
And so I revived the recipe
and revived the duck press

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:13.560
50 years later.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.060
And we have created
a canard au sang

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.710
which is a classic
French recipe as well.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.500
So after the session
of iconic-- which

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.670
there is more in the book, many
more, and very interesting text

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.480
will really touch
every chef-- then

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.800
we have also the home section.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.460
I live right above Daniel
and so that's convenient

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:44.250
because I'm always at work
and I am easily at home.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:49.200
So I wanted to do home
recipe who was also

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.410
approachable to people
who buy this book

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.940
but feel that all the other
recipes, it's a little bit

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.220
overwhelming.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.230
And so this, I chose
different region of France

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.280
for that because I felt the
book is my French cuisine

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.560
and often when I cook at home
I think of regional France.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.620
So this is about Alsace,
Normandy, Provence,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.409
and Lyon, my hometown.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:12.800
So picture as a little mix.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.370
And Catherine, my wife,
is there-- thank you.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:19.239
She is my partner in
the kitchen upstairs.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:25.409
So that's the more
approachable Daniel in a way.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:26.330
But very expensive.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.770
If you want to eat in my home it
will cost you more than double.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.330
Actually I opened my home for
dinner but only for charity.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.429
I'm the co-president
of Citymeals-On-Wheels.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.489
And for Citymeals I sell dinner
at home for usually eight

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:45.330
people, and it sells
for $30-$40,000.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.750
So it's always a good use
of my kitchen that day,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.980
for a good purpose.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.880
But any questions about
French cuisine, anyone?

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.080
Yes?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.621
AUDIENCE: I have to say I'm very
interested in French cuisine

00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:01.460
and equally interested
in French wine.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.000
I have a trouble though when
I go to a fancy restaurant

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.430
I might only bring one bottle
but have a multi-course meal

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.300
with many different flavors.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.360
Sometimes you can order
the tasting menu's wine

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.990
but they're not usually as high
quality as the restaurant food.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.880
What would you suggest
to do in this dilemma?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.970
DANIEL BOULUD: Ah,
well in that case

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.570
you tell them to
skip the pairing

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.170
and order yourself
a nice bottle.

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.400
And usually if you
have four people

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.180
it's easy to have a bottle
of white, bottle of red.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.890
If you have two people it's
maybe a little too much.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.450
So, to me, I like to try a
very fresh, light pinot noir.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:49.590
I mean even American, French,
even it could be Italian also.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.930
There is some light nebbiolo.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:58.010
But I note at
Daniel, for example,

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.610
we purposely choose very
good wine with a pairing

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:05.380
because, I mean, if we
make all this effort

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.760
making wonderful food and
all that and not giving it

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.660
the level of quality to
the wine, no, absolutely.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.027
So put pressure on the chef and
say I don't think your pairing

00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:16.610
is good today.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.660
But there is a new system now.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.910
I don't know if you have seen.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.030
It's something you
put on the bottles.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.800
Yeah, it's fantastic.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.450
Because now we can open vintage
wine without altering the wine

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.650
and keep it over a week.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.430
And so now they can
offer a glass of wine.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.190
So you can have a glass of
white and a glass of red

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.170
of very high-- higher
quality, rather-- than

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.800
have three white and three red.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.480
It's better to have one glass.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.210
And follow the path
of the menu with that.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.140
We are doing it at DB
Bistro right now as a test,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.230
but at Daniel we
usually open and sell.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.190
But sometimes in a bistro
where all the average wine

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:09.050
is between $7 a glass
to maybe $14, when

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.140
you want to sell a
glass at $35 or $50,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.740
then the risk of selling
the whole bottle that night

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.712
is more challenging.

00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:19.700
AUDIENCE: Yes, my
question is how do you

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.720
get your inspiration?

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.545
Is it your family?

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:27.210
You say that you wanted to
be a chef when you were 12.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.270
So what is it your
grandmother, your mother,

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.440
who taught you how to cook?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.290
Is it your wife now?

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.760
Is it your friends?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.410
Your friends who are cooks too?

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.020
And clients?

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.045
How do you get all those ideas?

00:37:44.045 --> 00:37:45.170
DANIEL BOULUD: It's Google.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:55.390
No, actually traveling
is, of course,

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.210
a big source of inspiration.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.050
And then when I think
about French cuisine

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.560
and I want to try to continue
to explore French cuisine,

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.650
then I think of home.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.790
Of course when I think
at home, for example,

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:10.380
when we make a salad
dressing, I teach Catherine

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.220
how to make my grandmother's
salad dressing where you crush,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.280
you take a clove of
garlic, you put salt on it,

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.950
you crush it with a fork nicely
until you get a little paste.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.160
Then you add up a
spoon of mustard,

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.620
and you add a spoon
of vinegar to that.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.170
And then you pour gently
the olive oil over

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.730
and stir the whole thing.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.820
And then toss some nice
crisp salad inside this.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.570
And serve that with a
little fresh fromage

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.460
blanc and some hot
and spring potatoes,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.742
freshly roasted potatoes.

00:38:38.742 --> 00:38:39.700
I think it's delicious.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.390
That's my grandmother's cooking.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.740
I remember we always
made soup also at home.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.030
Soups are something
every night--

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:51.010
it don't matter what
it was-- we made soup.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.240
But then we have
stuff at home too.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.090
For example, we used to kill
the chicken on Thursday.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.810
Yeah, on Thursday
we used to kill

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.800
the chicken for
the farmer's market

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.190
and we would keep the
blood of the chicken.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.380
And on Friday we
would make an omelette

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.730
with the blood of the
chicken, like a blood

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.490
pudding of chicken blood.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.180
And slice that like an
omelette, flat omelette.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.590
But it was very nutritious.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.590
When you are a kid,
you need some iron,

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.850
eat some chicken blood.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.740
But besides that
there is, of course,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:28.390
today traveling
and the young chefs

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.850
traveling with me-- the team.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.710
The team I have, I think
that's where I get the most

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.960
inspiration because they come
from all over the world, some

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.950
of them, and they
all bring something.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.450
We sometimes sit down with
them, we discuss ideas.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.960
I sit down with my
chefs and we always

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.330
talk about what else can
we do new, different.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:54.450
And I have a good
team of chefs and we

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.550
have a great way of
communicating among each other.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.240
And I think it's
at the end we want

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.860
to make sure that
the food feels right.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:11.080
And the food, it's interesting,
it tastes like food,

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.530
and it really-- for me,
sometimes creativity

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.630
is not always what
I'm thinking first.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.490
It's more the
composition of the dish.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.950
I think of the protein.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:30.180
I think of what I want to marry
that protein with, if it's

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.280
a fish filet, I want a
particular texture, thickness,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.990
or feel, and how
I want to cook it.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:41.150
And then from that now
how I want to season it,

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.950
and what kind of acidity
I want to bring around it,

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.340
and what kind of contrast
and texture, and all that.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.050
So it's kind of a
gradual buildup.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.280
And we discuss that with chefs.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.730
And some of the dishes make
it, sometime in the long run,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.220
and some dishes disappear and
we go over it and work them out

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.530
again.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.500
Yeah.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, chef.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.830
My question is-- I
really loved hearing

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.090
the history of how
you grew up with food,

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.140
and grew up on a farm, and
your time as a line chef

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.290
and then moving up.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.970
I'm really curious to hear
about how you sort of moved

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.810
from being an individual
chef, being a sous chef,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.190
and so on, to eventually
opening a restaurant,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.940
and now, obviously, you
have many restaurants.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.220
How have you been able to do
that successfully to scale,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.470
to many different restaurants?

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.680
And what have you learned
from that process?

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.096
DANIEL BOULUD: I
know I think what

00:41:34.096 --> 00:41:39.680
I've learned is to
choose your partner well.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.100
I was very lucky
when I was looking

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.930
to raise money to open
my first restaurant.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.900
I was almost 3/4 there.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.470
I mean I had maybe $1.5 million
and I needed $2.5 million.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:59.690
So I sit down with a
gentleman and he told me,

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.990
say, you know, I'd rather be the
one with you than one of them.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.430
And we'll do much
better business

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.030
together if we are
just the two of us.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.820
I think that was maybe
the best day in my life

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.430
because then I
found a partner who

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:23.430
was the CEO of a very large
company in America before

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:24.540
and he was retiring.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.070
20 years ago he was retiring.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.450
Now he is 81.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.850
And he didn't know what he was
going to do in his retirement,

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.950
and he felt I'm not
risking too much money.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:39.090
So I'll help that
little boy there

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.430
with his first restaurant.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.970
And then from that
he, of course,

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.810
guided me through the business.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:48.410
He counted on me to
take care of everything

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:52.000
and he counted on me to
build my team to do it,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.470
but he was always a good
guiding line for business.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.550
And I think trust is
the most important thing

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.000
in this business
because when a business

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.420
where you could be tempted
to steal from your partner,

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.100
you could be tempted to
steal from your business,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:13.950
and so it's the most important
thing, I think, trust.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:15.990
And that's why, I
think, 20 years later

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.380
we're still very good partners.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:24.290
He's not too young anymore,
but I think the team

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.560
after the team I have
built over the year,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.260
the CFO today is
with me 20 years.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:34.820
The COO is with me 16 years, but
he was already a cook with me

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.210
25 years ago.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.060
And then in between he went
to Cornell hotel school

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.200
and he did hotel management
and different things.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.670
And then he came back with
me as director of operations

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.100
and now he's CEO.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:54.380
And then director of operations
has been with me for 16 years.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.880
The chef de cuisine
at Daniel, 17 years.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.110
The executive chef, 17 years.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:03.250
Jean Francois.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.700
Eddy, 11 years.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:09.620
And I have a maitre d' who is in
the book also with his family.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.005
And now I have the second
generation, his son, also

00:44:12.005 --> 00:44:12.630
as a maitre d'.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:14.930
And the two of them,
father and son.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.410
And you work with me
for 30 years almost.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:24.990
But beside that the
average age at Daniel,

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.230
and the average age in the
group is about, I would say, 25,

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.639
26 years old because there's
a lot of young people.

00:44:32.639 --> 00:44:34.930
AUDIENCE: I just want to tell
you, first of all, Daniel

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.490
has not only been the
best dining experience,

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.620
the food is phenomenal,
best I've had in the world,

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.120
but also the dining experience
itself is very, very special.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.170
But I wanted to ask
you, as much as I'd

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.830
like to eat Daniel cuisine
every day at the level

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.730
that you have it,
what do you eat

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.680
on a regular basis
for a casual day?

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.150
DANIEL BOULUD: Today?

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.110
I had that wonderful vegetable.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:01.100
I had a salad,
wonderful vegetables.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.240
The pan roasted fish
with fennel and raisin,

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.230
a little bit of turkey.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.860
It was very healthy,
the lunch today.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:13.260
And at lunch usually I have a
salad or a soup and one course.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.100
I don't eat bread
so much anymore.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.540
I try to be careful
because that's often

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.470
the hardest thing to shed away.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.430
And I try to eat healthy.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.770
I drink a little bit of wine.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:30.300
I try to control what I do.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.750
And now Catherine wants
to be a nutritionist.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.760
She wants to pass a
master in nutrition.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.730
So very soon she'll tell
me what to eat every day.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.440
But I am very concerned
about nutrition.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.720
And I'm very aware
that the food I make

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.710
is always with the
consciousness of healthiness,

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:57.010
except the iconic dishes
where you get transported

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.640
into another time,
another world.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.590
And so you don't look
at that that way.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.340
But the food we do
at Daniel is always

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.980
with healthy components
of preparation.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.110
And even if we poach
the fish in butter,

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:13.290
it does not mean we're
going to serve it in butter.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.580
So the butter enrich
the cuisson of the fish,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:21.870
but still don't really
effect the quantity

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.310
of butter going
in the dish also.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.985
AUDIENCE: With so many different
restaurants now all over

00:46:26.985 --> 00:46:30.240
around the world, and your name
is on, I guess, all of them,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.740
right?

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.376
So how do you still
manage to spend time

00:46:33.376 --> 00:46:35.750
in some of the restaurants
and keep your influence there?

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:39.210
And do you find
that there is chefs

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.200
that tend to stay more in
the kitchen versus chefs

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:42.740
that expand?

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.050
How do you look at that?

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.160
DANIEL BOULUD: Well
we do a Google Hangout

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.990
with all the guys.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.850
For example, I just came
back from Singapore.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:54.450
I did a tour.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.030
Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.410
I have a restaurant in
Beijing and Singapore.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.690
So I go there.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.560
I taste new things there.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.340
We do also special events
and we meet some media

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.050
and have a pow-wow
with the team.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.260
But I have a
corporate management.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.620
And the corporate
management-- so either right

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.160
now, our COO in Asia.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.880
But then after
that following will

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.010
be a director of
operations who might go,

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.140
then maybe my corporate
chef, and I'm going back

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.280
in spring, I think,
or after spring.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.590
And so I go about
twice a year there.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:36.100
But every week we
have a conference call

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.290
via video, and video call.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.090
And we have the team
there sitting down--

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:46.360
sommelier, manager, chef,
sous chef, pastry chef, maitre

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.380
d'hotel, and the key
people, management.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.250
And we have also
the key management

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.030
of the corporate
group in New York.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.940
And for one hour
they have a meeting

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.510
recapping on what they have
done that week in everything

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:04.400
in food, in wine, clients,
promotion, training, and all

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:04.900
that.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:10.360
And then they get also some
new information from that,

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.690
from the headquarter.

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.800
But also we designed
a program where

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.860
we have all the menus, all
the recipes, into one program.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.260
And every chef can
have access to that.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:26.380
And so Singapore can inspire
himself from London chef.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.650
And the chef from
London can look at what

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.590
the one in New York [INAUDIBLE]
what kind of new dish he did.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.030
So it stays within
the DNA of Daniel.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.810
And they have the freedom
to be able to also come up

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:40.150
with ideas themselves.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.860
That's more or less
the way it works.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.310
But now it's almost 1,400 people
so it's not as much as Google.

00:48:50.192 --> 00:48:51.150
I think it's different.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.370
I think the Bay Area-- I
mean you go from, of course,

00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:00.310
north of Napa from Yountville
and even Sonoma to all the way

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.405
down to south of LA.

00:49:02.405 --> 00:49:08.030
I think there is an amazing,
amazing collection of chefs.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.610
And different styles, some
of them, different ambition.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.710
Of course, I mean
in New York we have,

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.440
I think, our own style
of restaurants as well.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.780
Here, I love
restaurants like Saison.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.490
Last time I went to Benu.

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:30.400
I went to a state
bird provision.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.640
It was fantastic.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.960
I love his cooking also.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.900
Great, great food.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.490
Tastes well.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:38.010
Fresh.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.290
Great seasoning.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:42.250
Not too esoteric.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.230
I mean it really
tastes what it is.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:50.100
And I think the talent
here is incredible.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:55.450
It's incredible but it's a
little bit more free spirited

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.460
than maybe in New York where you
have French, you have Italian.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.920
But the Italian restaurant I
went to, SPQR, last night--

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.700
it was fantastic also.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.970
Great, great meal.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:10.350
And, of course, I know Queens
also, the restaurant Queens,

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:11.266
for a long time.

00:50:11.266 --> 00:50:12.390
And then there is La Folie.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.860
There is Piperade,
the French chef.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.069
Hubert Keller.

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:19.110
I love those restaurants.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.070
But I'm not coming to see
the French because-- I

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.150
may have a drink
with them, but I

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.380
wanted to see what
the other chefs.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.110
So I would like to go
to Koi and Manresa.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.080
I missed it because
of the weekend.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.010
And Menresa, as well,
who is really fantastic.

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.330
But there is a lot happening.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:44.450
And what I'm looking forward
is to see the next generation

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.210
who are working now
with those young chefs

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.084
and what they're going
to do themselves next.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:56.380
But there's definitely
a concern and a return

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.530
to tradition sometimes.

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.160
Like I see, for
example, at Saison.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.470
It's doing a very
creative cooking

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.070
but they still have
this wood fire.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.720
You need the fire
to cook as well,

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.690
to smoke, to flavor,
to cook, and I

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.470
think it's fantastic
to combine the two.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.960
Thank you very much for
spending time with me here.
