00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.690
The artificial intelligence
arms race is on.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.955
Who will be the first to
achieve full self awareness?

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.920
Earlier this week,
Mark Zuckerberg

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.130
revealed on an earnings
call that Facebook

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.560
has formed an artificial
intelligence group, which

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.040
will develop new AI tools using
the vast collection of images

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.360
and other data that users
have uploaded to the site.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.320
According to the
project's lead researcher,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.170
the first goal will be to
implement image recognition.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.040
Meaning when you upload
a photo, Facebook

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.610
will know, without
you tagging it,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.240
what it is, what's going
on, or even who's in it.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.640
That might sound like
an unexciting use of AI.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.480
But even that
requires a huge amount

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.710
of computational power relying
on layers of trial and error

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.160
and analyzing an image.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.340
Google already has an
opt-in "find my face"

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.910
feature for Google+, though I
haven't seen it used that much

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.410
yet.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.951
And on Google Glass,
which would seem

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.170
like a natural medium
for face recognition,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.490
that tech is currently banned.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.340
And as a side note,
some designers

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.030
are already coming
up with creative ways

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.430
to thwart facial
recognition software.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.550
But beyond just image
scanning, the real dream of AI

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.190
is to build computers
that work just

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.050
like the brain with the
ability to self learn

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.900
and to teach itself new tasks.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.880
Google, for example,
is partnering with NASA

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.180
on a quantum AI project with
the goal of vastly speeding up

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.080
that process.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.590
With that quantum
twist, computers

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.450
could analyze visual or
other cues exponentially more

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.170
quickly.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.430
But already existing
AI tech is being

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.540
used in training simulations
for military and commercial use

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.330
where users can program
simulated human agents

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.414
to respond autonomously to cues.

00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:32.330
And of course, personal
assistants, like Siri,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.460
can respond to our questions,
even if they don't always

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.240
get them right, at
least not right now.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.550
And for more on current
advances in robotics,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.240
check out Trace's
video on Valkyrie,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.207
one of the latest
beasts from NASA.

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:43.040
Thanks for watching.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.025
See you next time.
