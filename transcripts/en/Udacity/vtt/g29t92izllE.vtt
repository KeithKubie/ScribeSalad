00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Three of these solutions won't work already for the reason that they would lead

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to an increase in temperature even though the forest is warmer than the ambient temperature.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With this solution, the rate of change of our temperature would always be positive.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That doesn't look like heat loss. The same happens here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If the temperature of our forest is larger than the ambient temperature,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we again get a positive rate of change here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This does not make sense. This is the right one. Think about two compartments.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have one compartment with temperature capital T

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and another compartment with a temperature of 300 K.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The difference between these two is what controls the decay of the temperature, and of course,

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
this difference is negative as it needs to be for our temperature to decrease.
