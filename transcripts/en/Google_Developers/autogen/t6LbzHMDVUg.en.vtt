language that was based on the Doge meme
and<00:13:02.490><c> would</c><00:13:02.700><c> compile</c><00:13:03.060><c> to</c><00:13:03.390><c> JavaScript</c><00:13:03.500><c> like</c><00:13:04.500><c> how</c>

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:04.770 align:start position:0%
and would compile to JavaScript like how
 

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
and would compile to JavaScript like how
all<00:13:05.190><c> of</c><00:13:05.250><c> this</c><00:13:05.579><c> you</c><00:13:05.790><c> know</c><00:13:05.850><c> CoffeeScript</c><00:13:06.570><c> in</c>

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:06.690 align:start position:0%
all of this you know CoffeeScript in
 

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.410 align:start position:0%
all of this you know CoffeeScript in
typescript<00:13:07.050><c> and</c><00:13:07.410><c> so</c><00:13:08.100><c> I</c><00:13:08.399><c> kind</c><00:13:08.820><c> of</c><00:13:08.880><c> did</c><00:13:09.000><c> it</c><00:13:09.149><c> one</c>
