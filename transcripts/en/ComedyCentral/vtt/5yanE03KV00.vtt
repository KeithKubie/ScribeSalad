00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:00.820

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:03.189
The president fired me.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.992
You know, I watched "The
Celebrity Apprentice."

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.360
I used to watch that show.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.062
And I thought, "I could win
that.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.632
I could win
that business competition."

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.667
So when they asked me to do the
show, I thought,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.536
"This is great; I'm gonna do
'The Celebrity Apprentice.'

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.205
I'm gonna win this thing," and
I studied the show.

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:21.807
I studied all the strategy.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.843
I got the tapes.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.413
I was gonna win this thing.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:28.648
Episode one.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.683
[laughter]

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.552
I showed up.
I didn't know who the other

celebrities were gonna be.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.423
In walks my good friend
Andrew Dice Clay.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:38.991

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.661
One of the great stand-up
comedians in history

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.162
and my good friend.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.231
I'd known Andrew Dice Clay for
ten years.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:48.267
He used to come do my internet
television show.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.837
I was doing an internet TV show
on the internet

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.039
from my living room.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.074
[laughter]

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.876
Yeah, my career was going
pretty well.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.079
[laughter]

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.422
[sighs]

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.023
Immediately
when Andrew walked in,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.358
I thought, okay,
this is gonna throw

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.260
my whole strategy
out the window.

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.895
'Cause whenever I'm hanging out
with Andrew Dice Clay,

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.064
we like to mess around
with people.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.565
We'll get in fake arguments

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.802
just to confuse people
around us.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:27.039
So on the first episode
of "The Celebrity Apprentice"--

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.475
season two--

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:32.445
the president gave us
a challenge.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.248
[laughter]

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.084
We had to make cupcakes.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.619
I guess the President figured

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:43.256
that would be a good
business competition.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.592
So I'm making cupcakes
with Andrew Dice Clay.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.427
[laughter]

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.763
And we start messing with
the people around us.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.498
Andrew gets mad, he says,

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:56.135
"Tommy, you're not putting
enough sugar in the batter!"

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.771
I say,
"Calm down, Andrew, calm down!"

00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:01.841
Clint Black and Scott Hamilton
are looking at us.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:05.478
"Wow, these guys really seem
to know each other."

00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:09.015
So now we got an alliance
against us, right?

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.417
Andrew Dice Clay and I
were too familiar.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.819
Clint Black didn't like me.

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.655
Country star Clint Black.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.423
I don't want to say anything
bad about Clint Black,

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.458
but that guy's
a fucking asshole.

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.127
[laughter]

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.628
No, no, he's a good guy.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:27.466
He's a good guy.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.536
[laughter]

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.974
So we finish
our cupcake challenge.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:36.676
We go to the boardroom.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.112
Everyone hears that we've been
yelling at each other.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.649
The President
of the United States...

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:45.217
says to Andrew Dice Clay,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.686
"Andrew, I hear
there was a problem today."

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.554
Andrew Dice Clay looks
at Donald Trump,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.990
he says, "Donnie, there wasn't
enough cream cheese

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.859
in the bagels
in the greenroom!"

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.295
The President says, "Andrew,
whose problem is that?"

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:58.164
And he says,
"It's your problem, Donnie!

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.566
It's your problem!"
"Andrew, you're fired."

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.501
[laughter]

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:06.205
So now my friend, my only ally,
is fired.

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:09.509
[laughter]

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.682
I'm all alone with Jesse James.

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.085
[laughter]

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:22.221
Clint Black.
Herschel Walker.

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:24.223

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:27.393
[laughter]

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.999
Episode two.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.669
[laughter]

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:40.873
Olympic gold medalist
figure skater Scott Hamilton

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:44.443
is the project manager.

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:48.514
Our task is to make
a commercial campaign

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:52.251
for a shoe company
that starts with the letter Z.

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.120
Okay?
Doesn't matter which one.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.588
But it starts with the letter
Z.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.924
He suggests to us that we do
a campaign

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:01.360
called EEE.

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:04.563
Energy, Enthusiasm, Excitement.

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.432
I look at Scott, and I say,

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.734
"That's the stupidest fucking
idea I've ever heard."

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.804
[laughter]

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:19.712
This did not ingratiate me
to my team members.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.415
[laughter]

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:24.250
We lost the challenge.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.918
We go into the boardroom.

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:28.721
I don't know if you're familiar
with the rules

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:30.156
of "The Apprentice,"

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.591
but the President
of the United States...

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.060
[laughter]

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:39.098
Says to Olympic figure skater
Scott Hamilton,

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:41.834
"Scott, you get to
fire one person.

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.637
"Who are you bringing into the
boardroom today?

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.439
"You can bring two people
into the boardroom.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.107
Who are you bringing in?"

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.576
And Scott Hamilton says,
"Mr. Trump, I know I can bring

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:52.778
"two people into the boardroom,
but I'm only bringing one

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:55.281
"person into the boardroom,
and that's Tom!

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.016
'Cause Tom deserves
to get fired."

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.752
And he says, "Fine," and we
walk out into the hallway,

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.288
and we wait around, and the
other cast members leave,

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.957
and then we go back into the

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.805
"that Scott doesn't think
I did a very good job,

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.507
"but I think the reason
that we lost this challenge

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.643
"was 'cause his idea was
to call the campaign EEE

00:07:29.414 --> 00:07:30.850
And Donald Trump looked at me,
and he said,

"You know, Tom,
I think you're right.

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:33.152

Yeah.

I got Scott Hamilton fired.

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.636
I'm not bitter or anything, but
I...

[laughter]

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.739

I'm fine now.

00:07:53.772 --> 00:07:56.843
[laughter]

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.181
Episode three.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:05.684
[laughter]

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:07.086
The President
of the United States

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.488
walks into the room.

00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.190
He says,
"Now we're going to decide

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:13.659
who is the project manager
of this week for each team."

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:17.229
It was the men
versus the women.

00:08:17.262 --> 00:08:18.931
I raise my hand,
I say, "Mr. Trump,

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:22.268
I would like to be
the project manager."

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.203
Our whole team looks
at each other.

00:08:24.236 --> 00:08:25.504
They say, "Fine."

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:28.541
On the ladies' side,
the late,

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:32.211
great, legendary Joan Rivers
raises her hand.

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:36.348
[cheers and applause]

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.552
She is the project manager for
the ladies.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:43.355
Then Mr. Trump, the president,
says,

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:45.257
"Okay, your challenge this week

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.260
is, who can sell
the most wedding dresses."

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:51.564
[groans and laughter]

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.602
Who do you think's gonna sell
more wedding dresses,

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.237
me and Dennis Rodman

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.738
or Joan Rivers
and Khloe Kardashian?

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:02.775
[laughter]

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.415
So needless to say,
things didn't go well.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:13.786
My entire team now had an
alliance against me.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.088
They mutinied.

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:17.890
Everyone had a job.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.259
Clint Black was supposed to do
the promotion and marketing.

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:21.260
He didn't do it.

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:22.962
[laughter]

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.064
Brian McKnight was supposed to
do some stupid thing.

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.065
I don't know what the fuck...

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.066
[laughter]

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.901
He didn't do it.

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.436
[laughs]

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.938
We lost the challenge.

00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:37.176
At the end of the day,
after working hard

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.778
trying to sell wedding dresses,

00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:41.747
Dennis Rodman leaned to me,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.118
and he said, "Hey, Tom,
you wanna go out for a drink?"

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.420
So I went out for a drink.

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:51.490
With Dennis Rodman.

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:53.525
The president fired me
'cause I went out drinking

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:55.694
with Dennis Rodman

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:58.998
on the night I was the project
manager.

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:02.034
I mean, this is why, sometimes,
I question

00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:04.103
the president's judgment.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.472
[laughter]

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:07.606
I mean, what are you supposed
to do?

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:08.974
You're a kid from Canada.

00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:10.643
You're in New York City.

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:12.645
A 7-foot-tall cross-dressing
basketball champion

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.313
asks you out on a date.

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:17.282
You say yes, right?

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.451
It's Dennis Rodman, right?

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:24.023
[cheers and applause]

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.658
It's Dennis Rodman.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.559
The guy's a legend; he's
probably gonna pick you up,

00:10:27.592 --> 00:10:29.028
take you out for a steak
dinner.

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.496
You head out for a night on the
town.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.664
You have some cranberry vodkas.

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.365
You hit the strip club.

00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:35.134
At the end of the evening, you
head back to the hotel.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.835
If you're lucky,
he doesn't have sex with you.

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:38.837
[laughter]

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.973
That's what I call a backcourt
violation.

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.508
Okay.

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:46.045
No, that's just jokes,
a little basketball joke.

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.479
I don't know.

00:10:47.512 --> 00:10:49.148
I-I guess--
I guess as a Canadian,

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.517
sometimes I feel...

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.752
odd talking politics

00:10:53.785 --> 00:10:57.356
during this strange year in
America, you know.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:59.024
I mean, at the end of the day,
what do I got to do

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.859
with it, right?

00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:02.528
And I know things could go bad,
but if things really go bad,

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:03.595
I'm just gonna move home to
Canada.

00:11:03.628 --> 00:11:04.863
We're building a wall.

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:06.532
[laughter]

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:09.868
Gonna make Donald Trump pay for
it.

00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.604
But if I can say one thing,
I will say that...

00:11:12.637 --> 00:11:16.375
it does demystify
the presidency

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:19.678
when you know the president.

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:22.214
I know the president
personally.

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:24.783
The president knows me.

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:28.220
Anyone who knows me should
probably not be president.

00:11:28.253 --> 00:11:30.689
[laughter]

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:34.526
Hey, thank you very much,
everybody.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.363
<i> - Tom Green, everybody,
 Tom Green!</i>

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:38.564
