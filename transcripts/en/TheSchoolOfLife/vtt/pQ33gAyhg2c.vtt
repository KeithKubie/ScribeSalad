00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.500
A lot of unhappiness comes about in this world

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
because we can't let other people know

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.500
what we mean clearly enough.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.280
One of the philosophers who can help us

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.300
with our communication problems

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.660
is Ludwig Wittgenstein.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.060
He was a recluse.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.060
He had a stutter, paused for ages in the middle

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060
of his sentences and had a habit of

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.120
storming out

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.080
if he didn't like what people were saying.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.260
It was weirdly the ideal background

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.600
for someone intent on studying how easily

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.340
communication between people goes wrong.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.440
Ludwig Wittgenstein

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.040
was born Vienna in 1889.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.860
The youngest child of a wealthy,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.820
highly cultured

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.960
but domineering steel magnate.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.680
Three of Ludwig's four brothers took their own lives,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.480
and Ludwig himself was frequently

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.640
troubled by suicidal thoughts.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.280
When he was young, he was interested in engineering.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.580
After studying at Cambridge,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.960
his father died and he inherited a lot

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.560
of money.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.860
He gave it all away,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860
mainly to his already very rich relatives

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020
and went to live in spartan solitude

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.060
in Norway.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.720
Then he started writing a book published in 1921

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.140
called Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.800
It was a short, beautiful

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.080
and baffling work.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.740
The big question that Wittgenstein

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.720
asks in it is:

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.860
How do human beings

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.160
manage to communicate ideas to one another?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.280
And his answer,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.820
which felt revolutionary,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.380
is that language works by triggering

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.260
within us

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.280
pictures of how things are in the world.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.660
Wittgenstein thought of this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.480
while reading a newspaper article about

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920
a Paris court case in which,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.500
in order to explain with greater efficacy, the details of

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.300
an accident that had taken place a road junction,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.500
the court had arranged for the accident

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
to be reproduced visually

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.820
using model cars and pedestrians.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.200
It was a Eureka moment.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.080
In Wittgenstein's view words enables us to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.200
make pictures of facts.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.460
To say: The palm tree is by the shore,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.720
paints a rapid sketch

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.580
that like the model lets another person see

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.200
the situation in their mind and understand.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.120
We're constantly

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.420
swapping pictures between us.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.220
But the Paris court needed to resort to an actual model

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.220
for a very important reason.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.060
Because on the whole,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.880
we're very bad at managing to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.100
make good pictures in the minds of others.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180
Communication typically goes wrong

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180
because other people have, as we put it,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.680
the wrong picture of what we're meaning.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.640
It can take an age for two people to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.700
realize divergences over quite basic things.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.520
Problems of communication typically start because

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.560
we don't have a clear and accurate enough picture

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.220
of what we mean in our own heads.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
We say quite meaningless or modeled

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600
or unelaborated things

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.500
which therefore can go nowhere in the minds of others.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.960
There's another danger:

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.560
That we read more meaning into the words of others

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.000
than they ever intended or than is warranted.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.660
You tell your partner you had a conversation with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.600
an interesting person at the hotel reception.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.200
The picture in your mind

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.540
is an innocent one.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.920
But your partner swiftly forms

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.000
a very different impression.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.720
The Tractatus is a plea

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.160
by a very taciturn, silent and precise

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.240
Austrian philosopher

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.640
to speak more carefully and less impulsively.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.900
As he famously put it:

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.100
"Wovon man nicht sprechen kann,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.760
darÃ¼ber muss man schweigen."

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.460
When he published it,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700
Wittgenstein thought somewhat grandly

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.800
that the Tractatus was the last work of philosophy

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.600
that would ever need to be written.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.240
So he looked around for how to fill the rest of his life.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.080
He turned to architecture and spent a couple of years

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.540
designing a house for his sister in Vienna.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880
He spent ages getting the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.920
door handles and radiotors right.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.100
Very late on in the project, he got increasingly

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.100
bothered about the ceiling in one of the rooms

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.180
and came to the conclusion

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.760
that is was too low.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
At immense inconvenience to everyone,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.320
he insisted on having it raised

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.580
by three centimeters.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.600
It made all the difference, he thought.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.920
Then, in 1929

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.180
Wittgenstein suddenly returned to Cambridge

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.400
and to philosophy

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
because he realized he had some new things

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.680
to say about language and communication.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960
And so he began to write a second book

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.460
published posthumously,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.800
and that we know know as

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.680
Philosophical Investigations.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.160
Instead of thinking that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.740
language is only just about pictures,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.900
he developed the idea

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.940
that language is like a kind of tool

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.020
that we use to play different games,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.380
which doesn't literally mean

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140
games, more patterns of intentions.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.560
So if a parent says

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.060
to a frightened child:

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.780
"Don't worry - everything's gonna to be fine",

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.140
they can't know it really will be fine.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.220
They aren't playing

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.480
the Rational Prediction From Available Facts Game.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.720
They're playing another game:

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.620
The Words as an Instrument of 
Comfort and Security Game

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.540
Wittgenstein's point is that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.520
all kinds of misunderstandings arise

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.240
when we don't see

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.240
which kind of game someone is involved in.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.360
If one's partner says:

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.780
"You never help me. You're so unreliable."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.700
The natural inclination might be

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.060
to hear this as a part of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.980
a Stating the Facts Game;

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.480
like saying:

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040
The battle of Waterloo was in 1815.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.620
So one might respond by citing facts about

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.860
how actually you got the car insurance yesterday,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.260
and you bought some vegetables at lunch time, too.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.120
But actually,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.800
this person is involved in a different language game.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.080
They're using words

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.560
not to capture facts.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.580
They're playing The Help and Reassurance Game.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.840
So in the language game, they're involved in,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.020
"You never help" means

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.360
"I want you to be more nurturing."

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.020
Working out the game in question,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.540
is, Wittgenstein realized,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.660
key to good communication.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.380
In the Philosophical Investigations

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.760
Wittgenstein also wanted to draw attention

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.780
to how much of our self-understanding

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.780
depends on the words of others,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.960
on languages that have

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.760
developed publicly and communally

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.120
over many centuries

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.720
long before we're born.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.000
For example, on Sunday afternoon

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.560
I might fall prey to a worried, confused mood

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.280
as I think about the week ahead

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.880
and everything I've got to do.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.820
My ability to know this very private side of myself

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.860
and to help others know me

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.340
will be hugely enhanced if I have to hand a word

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.940
that's been around a while:

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.000
Angst.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A word which was helpfully formulated

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.800
by the philosopher

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.060
Kierkegaard in 19th century, Copenhagen.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.320
Words like angst or also

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.440
nostalgia,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.800
melancholy or

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.580
ambivalent

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.760
and many others

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.400
help us to name elusive areas of our own experience.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.100
Language is a public tool

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.040
for the understanding of private life.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.840
The richness of the language we're exposed to

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.660
is therefore really important to our self-knowledge.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.140
Reading many books

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.220
gives us tools with which to help to know

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.140
who we are.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.220
Though a lot of Wittgenstein's philosophy

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.360
is deeply complicated,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.380
it's underpinned by a desire always to be helpful.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.800
The task of philosophy, said Wittgenstein,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.300
is to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.040
The particular fly bottle, he was interested in,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.160
was language.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.640
And before his death from cancer in 1951,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.580
he managed to let out for us

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.180
a lot of word flies

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.180
usefully for us all.
