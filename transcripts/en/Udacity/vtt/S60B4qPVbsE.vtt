00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:07.543
the square root of the quantity 2x plus 4 is equal to 5. And just to jog your

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.697
memory of the relationship between exponents and square roots, please rewrite

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.617
this entire equation with the square root replaced by the proper exponent.

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:19.653
Remember to take into consideration what the exponent should apply to, which

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.988
terms it should apply to.
