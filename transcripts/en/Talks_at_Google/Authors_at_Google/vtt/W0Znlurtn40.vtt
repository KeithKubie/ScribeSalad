[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.560
RAY MOUNT: I'd like to introduce
my partner, Don Tyler, who's

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.640
helped me develop
this new program.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.073
Don?

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:16.239
DON TYLER: So I'm Don Tyler.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.130
I'm helping Ray develop the
program as a co-founder role.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.160
My background is, I
own a dessert business.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm an executive coach
and a guide in training.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.810
I've done the program with him.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.560
We did a weekend.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.101
We went away.

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:29.730
We did hiking.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.440
And since then,
I've been working

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.570
on my own daily
practice in the woods

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.757
to kind of deepen this work.

00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:37.590
And I'm here to support
Ray in any way I can

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.960
and answer questions later.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.170
RAY MOUNT: How many hikers
do we have in the group?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.250
Yeah, OK.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.890
So after 30 years
as a psychologist,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.990
seeing individual
clients in groups

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.180
and all different issues,
I decided to retire

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.100
and needed a break.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.320
So where did I go?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.720
Out on the Appalachian Trail.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.030
So I went out with the lens
of a psychologist and an IFS

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.730
therapist.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.380
IFS stands for internal
family systems.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.360
So that's how I saw
the Appalachian Trail.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.230
Although I had spent years
going into the White Mountains

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.010
and climbing all the 4,000-foot
peaks and running the trails,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.220
my real interest in going out
on the Appalachian Trail was

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.530
to spend time with me.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
And so that's what this
presentation is about.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.220
I'm going to try to
take you on a hike,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
or offer you an opportunity to
take a hike by watching some

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.030
of the pictures that I have.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.480
There are over 5,000.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.960
So I didn't bring
them all today.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.750
Not to worry.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.400
And then what happened during
my hike developed into a program

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.190
that Don and I are
trying to roll out now.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.800
Basically, it's
therapy in the woods.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.070
So if you have any
questions about that,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.060
we have a website that
you can check out.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.070
What is the Appalachian Trail?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.480
Well, 2,200 miles.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.810
It goes from Georgia to Maine
and passes through 14 states.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.480
It's hard and it's long.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.700
So here's a little history.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.220
It's kind of a crowded slide.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.720
I didn't really put it
up there for information.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.520
I think I just put it up
there because I was impressed

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.170
with the number of traumas and
use of the trail as a place

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
to go to kind of relieve
yourself of burdens.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.060
So the founder of the
Appalachian Trail,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.510
the guy who came up with
the idea, Benton MacKaye,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.467
he had just lost his wife.

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.800
So what he did, he connected
with all his hiking buddies

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.990
up and down the
coast, and he said, I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.370
had this vision to put together
a hiking trail from south

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.680
to north along the east coast.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.590
Send me your favorite hike.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.580
So think about that.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.740
You have a friend,
and you're going

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.080
to send him your favorite hike.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.270
So that really describes
the Appalachian Trail.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.820
This thing goes up and
over the craziest places.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.010
And it really is challenging
in every section of it.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.070
The first person who really
hiked it was Earl Shaffer.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.330
He was a frontline radioman
in the Second World War.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.390
And he hiked it to
hike off the war.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.120
And today, every year,
hundreds and hundreds

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.650
of veterans coming back from
combat are hiking off the war.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.210
So I got to meet
a number of them.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.030
And I always ask,
what is it about being

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.370
out here that's helpful to you?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.500
So that was my curiosity.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.020
Emma Gatewood is
one of my heroes.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.400
Grandma Gatewood,
they called her.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.430
And she was a domestic
abuse survivor

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.630
who went out and hiked to hike
off the abuse, if you will,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.590
on the trail.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.720
She did it three times.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.870
And she did it with a gunny
sack thrown over her shoulder

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.029
and tennis sneakers.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.060
So the other thing
impressive to me

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.410
is, in 1968, Congress
passed something.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.470
The National Trails System Act.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.730
OK, let's play "Stump
the Google Staff."

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.710
I couldn't help
myself with this.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.940
So what is the highest point
along the Appalachian Trail?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.200
AUDIENCE: Mount Washington?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.730
RAY MOUNT: Say again?

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.120
AUDIENCE: Is it
Mount Washington?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.530
RAY MOUNT: Nope.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.750
It's Clingman's Dome.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.570
I thought it was
Mount Washington too.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.020
Clingman's Dome is in the
Great Smoky Mountains,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.170
between Tennessee
and North Carolina.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.610
It's 6,643 feet.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.460
And Mount Washington's
only 6,266.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.540
So I went running up Clingman's
Dome, got to the very top,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.880
and there's a tower
that you walk up on.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.260
And it was pea soup fog.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.930
So I didn't get to see anything.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.275
What's the correct
pronunciation for Appalachian?

00:05:19.275 --> 00:05:20.760
AUDIENCE: "Appa-latch-un?"

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.830
RAY MOUNT: Well, that's good.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.680
It's "Appa-latch-un"
when you're in the south.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.780
And as soon as you get
to the Mason-Dixon line,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.700
then you call it
"Appa-lay-chun."

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.530
So they all knew that
I was from the north.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.438
What's the length of
the Appalachian Trail?

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:39.295
AUDIENCE: 2,200 miles.

00:05:39.295 --> 00:05:39.920
RAY MOUNT: Yup.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.180
[LAUGHTER] You
heard me say that.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.070
All right.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.460
2,189.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.440
It changes.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.640
It was 2,000.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.396
And it's grown over the years.

00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:52.020
How long does it take
the average hiker

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.992
to hike the entire trail?

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:55.962
AUDIENCE: Four months.

00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:56.920
RAY MOUNT: Four months.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.770
Kids!

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.316
[LAUGHS] It took this
guy seven months,

00:06:02.316 --> 00:06:03.910
with a lot of zero days.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.500
Zero days means that
you try to recuperate.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.975
How many calories per day does
a 150-pound person hiking the AT

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:11.475
burn?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.370
AUDIENCE: 4,000.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.500
5,000.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.350
RAY MOUNT: 4,000, 5,000, 6,000.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.130
That's right.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.365
So if you break that down
into weight of carrying--

00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:30.480
weight to carry-- it's about 10
to 15 pounds of food you carry.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.490
When you go out in
the bush, you go out

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.900
for five or six days,
four or five days.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.050
So we were always trying to
balance number of calories

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.870
with amount of extra weight.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.260
So that's why we all
ended up very skinny.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.290
The good old days.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.082
I miss it.

00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:49.410
[CHUCKLES]

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.050
So lessons along the trail--

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.340
165,000 white blazes,
and they became precious.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.680
Wow, another white blaze.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.110
Except they're the same whether
you're going north or south.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.970
So I discovered
that several times.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.960
One story is that
I had just seen

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.900
the second time the same spot.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.910
And I thought to myself,
isn't this wonderful?

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.360
Wow.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.970
I climbed the mountain and the
same exact spot on that side

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.600
is this side.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.570
That's really interesting.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.720
And as I finally got
reoriented and turned around,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.840
I saw a guy my age at the top
of the mountain going around

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.990
in circles.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.214
He said, hey, are you on
the Appalachian Trail?

00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:39.880
So I didn't know what
to say, because it

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.060
was the wrong way on the trail.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.540
So he said, stop,
don't go anywhere.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.030
So he came down and we talked
about these two old guys

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.090
disoriented and
really not knowing

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.110
which way they're going.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.270
But at least we were
on the trail together.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.020
So that was fun.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.380
262 shelters with
campsites along the trail.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.430
In the Smokies, they want you
to stay there in the shelters,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.010
keep all the campers
in one place.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.490
But as soon as we could, we
got away from the shelters

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:21.030
and into the wilderness.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.770
27-pound pack, which included
all the food and water.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.900
I usually carried
about a liter of water

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.095
and then a filter to filter
water from the streams.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.070
There's a hand-pump-- three
to eight liters a day,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.549
so my hand got kind of tired.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.299
This is a typical meal.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.820
You see the 6,000 calories.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.170
There's cheese,
rice, and hot dogs.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.560
These damn hot dogs could
stay in your pack for a week.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.580
I couldn't understand
why they never spoil.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.782 --> 00:08:58.740
I got to love hot dogs.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.170
Here's my Jetboil.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.810
And here's the
different campsites.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.530
The one in the lower right
was about the third night,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.530
fourth night out, in Georgia.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.930
And that night is
the first time I ever

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.707
slept under a lightning
storm, holding onto the tent,

00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:21.540
because of the wind.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.850
I had it staked down,
but I was holding on.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.410
Lightning, and aware of
that were dead trees around.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.386
So I put my pack
frame over my head,

00:09:33.386 --> 00:09:36.960
so only my body
would get crushed.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.460
So this was a real
interesting experience.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.940
And that picture always
reminds me of it.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.640
This is what the
shelters look like.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.390
I avoided them as
much as I could,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.350
except one night
in North Carolina.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.650
It got down to seven
degrees, and it was snowing.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.570
It snowed about a
foot that night.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.790
And so there were 12 of us
spooning in the shelter.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.540
And I was glad to
have my buddies there.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.910
It was really a great night.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.850
This was the
preferred way to camp.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.540
This is Jane Bald near
Roan Mountain in Virginia.

00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:22.570
OK.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:28.390
So here's the arch at the
beginning of the Appalachian

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.490
Trail, not quite.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.670
From this arch, you still climb
another eight and a half miles

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.460
to get to the start of the
Appalachian Trail, which

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.830
is at the top of
Springer Mountain.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.680
But I remember the
wonderful feelings of--

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.580
wow-- letting go.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.502
And this was going to
be a wonderful sojourn,

00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:51.880
a spiritual journey.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.130
And I was going to do
all this work on myself.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.640
Great expectations.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.710
So how many people here have
it on their bucket list?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.640
OK.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.210
Be careful.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.990
That's what happened to me.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.370
I put it on my bucket list.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.651
And then, once it's
there, it's got to happen.

00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:13.150
AUDIENCE: What time
of year is this?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.380
RAY MOUNT: Pardon?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.930
AUDIENCE: What time
of year is this?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.910
RAY MOUNT: Yeah, so March
6 was my start date.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.660
And at the base of
the Appalachian Trail,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.090
right at that arch,
is this quote.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.310
I love this quote
from Harold Allen.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.500
"Remote for detachment, narrow
for chosen company, winding

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.860
for leisure, lonely
for contemplation,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.880
the trail beckons not merely
north and south, but upward

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.210
to the body, mind,
and soul of man"

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.180
So would you like
to take a hike?

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.070
All right.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.802
I'll see if I can
pull it up for you.

00:11:56.802 --> 00:11:57.510
I have a warning.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.240
Music.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.155
I sang my own music.

00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:08.520
I made up songs.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.810
I whistled.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.620
I did drumming with my poles.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.190
I was all about music.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.500
So we have a little bluegrass
band, my partner and I.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.462
And so that's where
this music comes from.

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:26.340
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.410
Sit back and relax.

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:49.757
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:52.500
How'd you like the music?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.490
AUDIENCE: It was great.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:53.985
RAY MOUNT: [LAUGHS]

00:22:53.985 --> 00:22:55.568
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking how wonderful

00:22:55.568 --> 00:22:58.165
it is that you're
talented enough that you

00:22:58.165 --> 00:22:59.373
could provide your own music.

00:22:59.373 --> 00:23:01.410
RAY MOUNT: [LAUGHS]
Well, thank you.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.090
That's good.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.510
So how many of you use
nature and wilderness

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.080
to unwind, to rejuvenate?

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.620
How many?

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.590
Just put up your hand.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:19.890
Really, it can be a tree, a
squirrel, chipmunks, deer.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.620
Oh, my god.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.320
The deer are beautiful.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.700
And the bears really were
scary until I encountered them.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.110
And I realized that
they have a soul.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.670
They have thought,
wonderful feelings.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.500
They raise little kids.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.130
So that's what I learned
after this story.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.930
So I went down the trail,
listening to my music,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.550
unaware of anything.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.560
And all of a sudden,
this little black bum

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.100
ran out in the middle of
the trail, shot ahead of me,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.510
and right up a tree.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.310
I thought, what was that?

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.280
So I turned, and
I'm looking around.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.080
And this growl came out of the
bushes with this huge mother

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.730
bear right next to me--

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.180
closer than that-- five feet.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:09.810
Yeah.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.850
And so she was
fumbling another cub.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:19.110
And so I did my procedure, which
is to make myself really tall

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.030
and hold up my poles
and click them.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.270
And I backed up like this.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.090
Mother bear came down
the trail like this.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.410
And I was not afraid.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.320
I'm afraid now when
I think back on it.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.360
[LAUGHS] But I wasn't afraid.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.310
And what I realized was, I
had practiced this procedure

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.410
if I ever encountered
a bear enough times.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.530
I had actually rehearsed it.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:51.120
And I was able to get
beyond my panic, my fright,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.530
and feel compassion.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.750
Because this was a mother,
two kids out of control.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.070
One of them shoots in
front of this crazy hiker.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.520
And the other one, she
didn't know where it is.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.150
And she just wanted to
take care of her kids.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.330
So those moments really
connected me to nature

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.760
and to the magic of it.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:14.280
So I'm glad to see so many
of you are equally connected.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.060
So I look at these two pictures
before and after the trail,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.330
and I ask myself,
what's changed here?

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.330
More than what's changed,
how do I keep it?

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.080
So since then, I've been
going out into the woods

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.690
every day to do some
variation of a practice.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.075
I thought of myself as
a trail yogi years ago

00:25:37.075 --> 00:25:38.700
when I'd go up into
the White Mountains

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.970
and meditate on the
top of the mountain.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.540
But after the hike,
I've really gotten

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.240
into finding that
energy from nature,

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.360
connecting with it, and
then, from that place,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.330
examining all the stuff
that I'm going through,

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.660
all the stresses
that I put on myself.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.590
So we're trying to roll
that out as a program.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.990
This is my quote.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.660
"The ideal of hiking the
entire trail in one season

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.340
was indeed romantic.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.780
The reality, perhaps
a bit harsh."

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.490
Here was the trail.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.690
I thought, March in Georgia
is going to be spring.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.880
This is what we found.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.790
This was a foot and a
half of snow on the tent.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.460
The night before, we had
all spooned in the shelter

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.390
together.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.340
And I said, ah, this is
just too close for me.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.160
Seven degrees, though,
made it worth it.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.055
This night, it was
recorded zero degrees.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.210
I woke up, and my
sneakers were frozen.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:50.670
And so the good and the
bad of it-- and sometimes,

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.755
it happens together--

00:26:52.755 --> 00:26:56.900
was, I figured out how to thaw
out a sneaker by bending it.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.210
And then finally, I was able
to get my Jetboil working

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.710
and boil a little water.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.670
And just seeing myself
do these survival

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.650
things was a beauty
in itself, and really

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.590
made up for the cold.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.720
I woke up to my bear bag.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.580
We have to hang
everything in trees

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.130
to get the smell out
of the tent and food

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.410
away so the bears don't
come into the tent

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.300
get your food and you.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.130
So there's my bear bag, that
orange one up there, hanging.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.400
And I woke up, a coffee
addict, knowing that's

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.680
where the coffee was.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.050
So fortunately, I got it.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.690
And my granddaughter taught
me how to do selfies.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.470
So I enjoyed a lot of selfies.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.900
This is that day at the top
of Standing Indian Mountain.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.190
It was "blizzardy."

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.700
Oh.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.570
So it's not all bad.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.700
We had what's
called trail magic.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.890
And that is, all
of a sudden, when

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.380
you're really thirsty
or hungry, you

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.810
come upon this
little thing that's

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.940
been put out for you by another
hiking club or an individual.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.770
And we call it trail magic.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.500
One day, there was a
guy cooking breakfast

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.340
from the back of
his pickup truck.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.010
Quiet Paul, his name was.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.010
So this was trail magic.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:23.190
So this was a terrible
day, mile 650.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.380
It was a nine and half hour day.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.390
I was hot, sweating.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:32.340
I was just not in a good place.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.790
And I came to the
War Spur shelter.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:43.360
And lo and behold, I came
down at 6 o'clock, and I look.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.520
There's an empty
shelter, the War Spur.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.540
And there's wood
already to make a fire.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:57.230
And you see the
Pabst Blue Ribbon.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:02.440
So somebody left two
full cans of beer,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.850
which I'm going to go take
and put them in a tree.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.550
This is, like, my lucky day.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.239
This is a lucky day.

00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:13.534
[LAUGHS]

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.310
I'm glad I have video.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.460
Because as the memories
fade, these things were real.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.740
[LAUGHS] All right, trail names.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.440
I didn't know
anyone's real name.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.920
We all had trail names.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.110
There's mine in the middle--

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.770
Mountain Music.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.890
And yeah, I play
bluegrass music.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.650
But it was really
about when I got going,

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.300
really got humming, and
got to be one with nature,

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.820
I could hear music
from the mountains.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.060
And so I realized that
that was my trail name.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.120
So I was Mountain Music.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.590
Toodles worked for
the Democratic Party

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.700
somewhere in Washington.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.400
When they were gone, he
said, to hell with this.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.720
I'm going out on the trail.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.750
So he was a friend.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.990
X-Ray is from here--

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.540
X-ray technician from Boston.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.130
Kaleidoscope was a woman.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:07.710
She said she had a
kaleidoscope of issues

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.930
she was trying to
work out on the trail.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.250
She was fun.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.560
And Ghost Hiker was great.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.900
Ghost Hiker would
hike along with us.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.000
We'd see her now and then.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.080
And all of a sudden, at
night, she'd disappear.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.480
She had a hammock.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.180
She would go into the
wilderness and find a place

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.680
for that hammock and come back.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.170
One day, I asked her, how
are you so brave to do that?

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.710
I was trying not to be gender
thing about it, but the woman.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.140
And she said, oh, yeah,
I love it out there.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.020
She said, I'm not afraid at all.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.900
Why not?

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.080
She was LAPD, retired.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.590
[LAUGHS] So she was fun.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.640
But spending six months alone
in the beautiful wilderness

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.620
with nothing but
my mind to keep me

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.360
company might have been boring
if I had been hiking alone.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.800
But I wasn't.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.140
Let me introduce my friends.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.580
How many people meditate here?

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:12.740
OK.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:18.800
When you begin, do you
go down and it's chaotic?

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.660
So that's what I experience too.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.370
And this is a
representation of that.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:30.560
But as we do trail meditation--

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.930
and here are the steps.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.030
I've got it broken out
into the word PEACE.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.400
The first step is to prepare and
to try to connect with nature.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.530
But I'm able to find
this Mountain Music guy.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.350
And my psyche can show up.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:51.230
And from that place, I try
to examine parts of me--

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.920
see the parts in
the back of my head?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.050
Parts that might be up.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.490
In this case, this
one here in the center

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.460
is the pilot navigator part.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.820
So I really got to know this
part and really respect it.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.200
It was a pilot who's always
working for efficiency.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.675
You've got to hike just
the right speed, just

00:32:14.675 --> 00:32:17.240
the right amount of
water, the right weight.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.240
Navigator was trying to keep
me in the right direction

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.800
on the trail.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.080
So I got to know those parts.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.780
But then this guy
over here showed up

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.160
in the back of my head.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.980
And I had to look at him.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.120
And he says, I'm not
going to make it.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.800
So I very much had that part.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.780
And so as I worked through
my trail meditation,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.760
I spent a lot of time
in that higher place,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.910
trying to connect with
the part that was afraid

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.910
and didn't think he was going to
make it, especially the climb.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.140
Some of the climbs were
ferocious in the rain

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.960
and in storms.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:05.690
So I spent a lot of time
quelling those fears.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.020
And from that, this guy emerged.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.540
And I call it The Mule.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.230
And The Mule says,
we're going too fast.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.460
Of course you're afraid.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.820
We're going to slow down.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.640
I said, well, that
sounds like a good idea.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.280
So I tried it.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.560
And what happened
in my head was,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.620
the pilot part showed up again.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.740
And The Mule-- see,
he's trampled him.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.390
The Mule says, no,
we're going to go slow.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.380
The Pilot says, whoa,
we've got efficiency here.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.590
You're never going to make
Mount Katahdin in Maine.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.090
You're not going to make it.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.540
So I had a real battle.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.180
Does anybody have battles in
their head to do the work?

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.140
OK, good.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.570
So I had a real battle.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.865
And what I did differently
was to take them on a hike.

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:54.560
I'd say, OK, this
is our hike today.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.060
I want to hear from
both people, both parts.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.820
And so I began to see how
much like good management

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.690
this really is--

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.409
applying all your
good management skills

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.909
to managing the
different voices,

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.010
different aspects of yourself.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.550
That's what this program
we're trying to roll out

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.870
is all about.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:22.070
What I did with these two
parts was to negotiate peace.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.750
And it went like this.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.400
When the slope gets
tough, inclined,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.550
The Mule can stop and
stand there and not

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.230
move until he feels like it.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.929
And that's OK with The Pilot.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.380
It's OK with The Pilot
because it's not on the clock.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.860
So I said, I'll take
responsibility for the time.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.480
We'll figure out a way.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.130
But right now, The
Mule gets his time.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.725
So I was able to
plod up these hills.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.460
So "Mountain Music--" me--

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.110
"could best manage
our inner world.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:04.130
But at times, he would get
tired and disappear, burn out,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.660
leaving a management vacuum."

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.670
That kicked my butt.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.180
You're too damn
slow, he would say.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:19.750
And so it brought up a child.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.296
I like this little
cartoon picture--

00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:24.170
I have the certifications
for each of these--

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:28.880
[LAUGHS] with a little
backpack on, sitting on a curb.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.230
Does anybody have that
part once in a while?

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.590
Go there?

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.740
So he's called Slowpoke.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.220
And so I did my
wilderness meditation

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.430
with Slowpoke and
Drill Sergeant.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.870
Convinced Drill
Sergeant he was good.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.500
I like him.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.790
I need him.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.530
He drives me through things.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.210
I need discipline.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.880
But you're hurting
the younger part.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.680
You're hurting the
more vulnerable part.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.430
So I got the drill
sergeant to see that.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.490
I didn't know before
that we can really

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:06.930
work with the different
aspects of ourselves

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.620
if we pay them attention
and focus on them enough.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.930
This is the guy that
developed, Good Step.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.540
He became Sure Step, the
guy that could go down

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.660
the slippery rocks, have fun.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.260
I like him.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:23.310
He showed up-- Dead Man Walking.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.700
This was July 27.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.230
Today is-- what--

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.570
August 3.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.585
So I did a blog.

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:32.460
You can check it out.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.850
It's RayMountPsychologist.com.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:41.730
But here was my jog entry on a
year ago today from this guy.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.750
"The march up to New Hampshire's
over 4,000-foot mountain peaks

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.220
has been grueling.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.640
So I'm taking a few days
off to rest, sail, and eat.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.227
My legs feel like rubber.

00:36:52.227 --> 00:36:54.060
And the thought of
climbing another mountain

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.440
seems torturous.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.220
Last year, I would look forward
to coming up to the Whites

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.580
and climb two or three in
a weekend, all in good fun.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.530
I miss the joy of climbing.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:08.720
So I've decided to do it in four
day chunks, three days off."

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.230
Four-day hiking.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.950
So I was able to renegotiate
and give my system what

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.380
it needed to enjoy this hike.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.210
All right.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.820
Who can guess what
the other part

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.440
is that's in my head
causing this guy?

00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:28.950
AUDIENCE: Drill Sergeant?

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.490
RAY MOUNT: Got it.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.320
That's a beer.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.580
Drill Sergeant.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.760
I want to leave some
time for your questions.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.110
Team Meetings.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:42.660
I'm a big believer that we both
become better outside managers

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.030
when we become better inside
managers, and vice versa.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.110
When we become good
outside managers

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:56.160
and we can take those lessons
inside, it becomes seamless.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:03.870
So I'm learning to be a
good manager of my guys.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:05.970
We put a team through
this training.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.050
And here's the team.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.060
We had a great
time in the woods.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.830
It was here at Hale Reservation.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.330
Anybody go out there?

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.430
And there's wilderness
camping out there

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.650
and wonderful trails
to hike and run.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.190
So we would do a
two-hour solo hike.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.349
It's all solo hike.

00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:22.890
And then we'd come
back and circle up

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.180
and talk about the experience.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.180
And so we had our first class.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.070
You see Don.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.950
He's right in the center of it.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.060
He was there.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.140
We'll be doing more of that.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.470
So the team wishes to
say goodbye and thank you

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:39.810
for listening-- my team.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:45.870
And I want to dedicate this
presentation to the friends

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.810
that got me here.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.640
So I'm drinking a beer
out of my water bottle--

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.080
I'll confess that--
and smoking a cigar

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.040
when I get down
from Mount Katahdin,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.950
thanking my parts
that got me there.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.072
Questions?

00:39:03.072 --> 00:39:05.904
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.230
AUDIENCE: I have a somewhat
technical question.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.930
You said that, going up
on one of the mountains,

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.675
you kind of lost the direction,
didn't know whether you

00:39:17.675 --> 00:39:18.800
were going north and south.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.790
I will figure that I
want to a hiking GPS

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.789
if we go up on our own.

00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:25.580
How does that work?

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.890
RAY MOUNT: I have a GPS.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.940
And let me tell
you how it works.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.420
Take this thing into the
shower and try to move it.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.860
It doesn't work.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.220
A lot of times--

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:37.730
here it is.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.420
This is my cell phone--

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.620
I couldn't take a picture.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.340
I couldn't work a GPS.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:47.390
And at other times, the Pilot
part and the navigator part

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.320
likes to fake it.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.210
He says, don't worry about it.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.580
We'll get there.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.250
So I'm in a lot of
denial around that.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.060
So I got in trouble.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.650
And I learned about that
part and how important it is.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:05.240
When it's chirping at me,
I need to stop and make

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.000
sure I know the directions.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.570
I was a hyperactive ADD kid.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:17.230
So working with
that is interesting.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.530
GPS-- this iPhone
7-Plus was great.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.760
Pictures, videos, GPS.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.144
It gives internet at all
the hostels you can stay in.

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:33.860
So good question.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.060
How'd you get lost, jerk?

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.360
There's only two ways to go.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.096
[LAUGHS]

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:45.040
AUDIENCE: Ray, let me ask you
two, I hope, quick questions.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.900
One is, I'm curious about how
you prepared physically to do

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.540
this before you went on it.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.730
And my second question
is, during the course

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.240
of this thing, did you have
any really serious injuries

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.060
or illnesses that caused you
to actually get treatment

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.760
off the trail that you
couldn't deal with yourself?

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.480
RAY MOUNT: Yeah.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.560
I had no injuries that I had
to get treatment off the trail.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.730
But I had severe shin
splints for three weeks.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:17.050
And that's when I started
calling myself Slowpoke.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.770
And that's when I really had to
work with that part, Good Step.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.920
And we limped into Damascus.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.880
And when I got into Damascus,
I knew I was done for a while.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.340
So I took a room
for three nights.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:35.100
So the first day of rest, I
was so excited to get back

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.390
into the mountains,
but I rented a bicycle,

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.050
and I went up that way.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.260
So that was a little rehab.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.760
And then the second day,
I took a slack pack,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.780
which is, you dump your heavy
gear, take just a small pack,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.700
and do a short distance.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.380
Cut my distances down, soaked
my ankle regularly in streams,

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.310
and massaged it.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.860
And I worked through it.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.248
There's also some cannabis
cream that's pretty good stuff.

00:42:03.248 --> 00:42:05.638
[LAUGHS]

00:42:05.638 --> 00:42:07.900
AUDIENCE: How did you
prepare before the hike?

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.691
RAY MOUNT: Yeah,
preparing before the hike.

00:42:09.691 --> 00:42:11.890
Well, you know,
I've always tried

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.750
to stay in some kind of
shape, physical condition.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.250
And my method of choice
is usually trail running.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.230
So I'm in the trails.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.120
I'm running or hiking.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.820
And then I did a lot, over
the 4,000-foot peaks--

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.430
I have all 48 of them now.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:31.060
So I'd go up to the peaks
and I'd load my backpack up

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.970
with cans of food, and
I'd hike up and down

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.920
the peak for practice.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.950
But in reality, you really
can't train for this.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.050
You get in shape
as much as you can,

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.830
and you just start off
with what your body can

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.350
take and slow down.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.580
Because the difference is
this is not a weekend thing.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.460
It's chronic.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.470
It changes everything.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.940
And so it'd slow down.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.350
So we would start with
only eight, 10 miles a day.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.740
And then, as your body
and spirit can handle it,

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.670
you build up your distance.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:12.760
AUDIENCE: I've heard about
youth programs related

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.170
to this, like wilderness
therapy programs for kids

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:22.480
through DYS and the juvenile
system and so forth.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.150
I guess, as an
open-ended question,

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.910
in your mind, what's the
relationship between what

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:28.990
you're doing and that?

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.140
Is there any at all?

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.160
Can you imagine young people
being involved in this?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.900
RAY MOUNT: Yeah,
I absolutely can.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.860
And I'm in touch with--

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.500
I have not met yet--

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.300
Michael Glass, who's at the
University of New Hampshire.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.810
And he's kind of a guru
of the programs around.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:50.350
He does the certification
for youth programs.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:55.240
But it's about using the magic
healing powers of nature.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.710
You know, part of our
belief is that, as we've

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:05.170
evolved from nature, physically,
spiritually, in other ways,

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:09.680
also, our healing has
evolved from nature.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.490
But it ended up the hospital.

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:17.260
So if we return to
nature, we can heal

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.650
spiritually, heal mentally.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:25.240
The difference is that I'm
an IFS-trained therapist.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.420
IFS-- Internal Family Systems.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.560
And you go on the
website and check it out.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.655
And it deals with parts.

00:44:35.046 --> 00:44:36.670
Like, you're going
to work on your car.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.060
So you think of your car,
your mind, as one thing.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.945
So does the mechanic
think of it that way?

00:44:43.945 --> 00:44:47.480
The mechanic's testing
which system it is.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.635
Ah, here it is, a carburetor.

00:44:49.635 --> 00:44:51.010
Now, I'm going to
take this apart

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.370
and I'm going to fix that.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.280
That's this kind of therapy,
and that's how it's different.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.190
You saw the slide with all the
mess of all the different parts

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.880
in it.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.090
So what we're trying to do
is meditation to get down

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:08.410
to isolate one of those
parts until we feel good

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:12.280
towards the part and then,
really, work with it.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.170
And in my case, I hiked with it.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.690
We had many conversations.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.090
We have a political part.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.524
We ran for president--

00:45:20.524 --> 00:45:24.400
[LAUGHS]---- gave
political speeches.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.760
But it was all important for
me getting to know these parts,

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.080
like on your committees.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.000
You get to know the
members of your committee.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.940
And you'll be a better
manager as a result of that.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.047
Did that answer it?

00:45:36.047 --> 00:45:36.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.359
RAY MOUNT: OK.

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.400
AUDIENCE: Completely
different kind of question--

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.720
why south to north?

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.970
Is that what everybody does?

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:43.886
How did you pick that?

00:45:43.886 --> 00:45:44.720
RAY MOUNT: Yeah.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.420
It's the traditional
way, south to north.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.300
It works out, weather-wise.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:57.350
But the trail folks today
advise not doing it that way.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.540
Actually, they
advise flip-flopping

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.950
so you can do sections of the
trail when they're not crowded.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:05.960
I went with a bubble--

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.170
very crowded.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.245
We have maybe 5,000
people that started.

00:46:09.245 --> 00:46:14.180
And maybe 1,000 finished
out of that group.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.600
But resources were difficult.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.520
If you can not do it
south to north, go for it.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.320
If you can not do it in one
season, that's advised too.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.370
[LAUGHS]

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.260
AUDIENCE: How much
does it matter

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.710
to do a line instead
of a loop when

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.430
you're thinking about
enjoying the wilderness

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:41.070
and experiencing it and
you're experiencing yourself?

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.820
RAY MOUNT: A line?

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.475
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
doing it end-to-end.

00:46:43.475 --> 00:46:46.100
Something at the end, instead of
coming back where you started.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.154
RAY MOUNT: Yes, yes.

00:46:46.154 --> 00:46:47.528
Well, you know,
what I've learned

00:46:47.528 --> 00:46:50.870
about the wilderness
is, one, I haven't

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.190
known how to approach the
wilderness in a way that allows

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.760
me to really do meditation.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.890
I'm too fast.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.000
I have parts that push me

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.660
I want to get exercise in.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.240
And I want to get time in.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.000
And I want to go
end-to-end, you know?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.070
And what I discovered
is that there's

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:16.400
a pace that I need to stay
at in order to really let

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.010
my mind open and empty.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:26.240
And Don, if I can
use for an example,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.400
his trail meditation is
sitting in the wilderness.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.010
So here's what I'd suggest.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:36.470
Go into the wilderness
stand there.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:40.160
[LAUGHS] And see where
your body takes you.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.650
I know a guy that plays with
the water in the stream.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:53.120
But it's allowing yourself to
connect with what's around.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.810
Can you do it here in the city?

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.610
Maybe.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.170
Do you need nature?

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.630
Can you do it with a brick?

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:03.200
Maybe.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.255
Or a computer?

00:48:04.255 --> 00:48:05.690
I don't know.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:06.524
No.

00:48:06.524 --> 00:48:08.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:08.800
I agree.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.110
But you know.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:16.520
Inside, you know what
you need to have peace.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.110
AUDIENCE: I always
thought that people

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.568
hiking the Appalachian Trail
would try to do it one season.

00:48:20.568 --> 00:48:23.600
But it is recommended not doing
it in one season if you can.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.790
Now, my question
is, how long do you

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.970
think you would need to be on a
hike to get really to the point

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.470
where you can let
go and meditate

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:35.180
and really get to the point,
whatever that point is?

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.700
RAY MOUNT: Well, I would say
that seven months is too long.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.300
[LAUGHS] But on the
other hand, parts

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.880
came out in that
seven months when

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:49.910
I was burnt out that I
hadn't really seen before.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.940
I think, in a couple
of minutes, some people

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.710
can get into a good meditation.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.640
Who said they meditate here?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.540
All right.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.718
So how long?

00:49:00.718 --> 00:49:03.442
AUDIENCE: Definitely 10
minutes, five minutes.

00:49:03.442 --> 00:49:05.010
RAY MOUNT: 10
minutes, five minutes.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.600
I think the answer is the same.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.560
It's that you're unique.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:15.942
So if you experiment and find
your place, find your way.

00:49:15.942 --> 00:49:17.400
AUDIENCE: Ray,
there was a question

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.420
before about how you prepared
or didn't beforehand.

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.390
What was the longest
continuous hike

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.120
that you had done, in terms
of days out or nights out,

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.164
prior to doing the AT?

00:49:28.164 --> 00:49:28.830
RAY MOUNT: Yeah.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:34.560
So I did the Pemi
Wilderness for three nights.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.080
I did three or four
peaks out there.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.260
I did Owl's Head, came
down at nighttime.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.870
I was frozen and
crossed the river.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.980
So I'd done a lot of that.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.850
I like to do that.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.060
So I think that was my longest--

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.436
three days.

00:49:56.436 --> 00:50:00.180
But it just changes
when it's three weeks.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.970
When you're out there five
days, and you say, jeez,

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:04.410
did I talk to anybody today?

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.290
No.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.220
Did I talk to anybody yesterday?

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.370
I don't think so.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.731
Have I had reception
on my phone?

00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:13.230
No.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.250
It changes.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.900
But it's fun.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.320
You get to really know yourself.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.000
That's the draw.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.560
AUDIENCE: You mentioned many
times about hiking the peaks.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.690
And I just wanted to say that
it's not just about hiking

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:34.290
the peaks.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.760
I think you can have the same
experience just hiking flat,

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.450
or the peaks, or up and down.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:48.330
And it's just about being where
it feels like you should be.

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:49.830
RAY MOUNT: Yes.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.640
Yeah.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.240
May I tell a story about that?

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.760
So I've been in the
Fells-Winchester reservoir.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.450
Most days I go there, and
then I'll go other places.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:05.190
One day, I was just so open.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.420
It was my birthday, actually.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.870
And I had someone call
me and sing to me.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:15.600
But I was just so there,
connected to nature.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.760
And I was running very slowly.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.760
And I came across a deer.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.480
And I slowed down, and I walked.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.450
And the deer was on
this side of the road,

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:31.290
saw me, walked across the
road to the other side,

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:35.270
stood and looked at me,
and wagged his tail.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.080
Have you ever seen
a deer wag its tail?

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.090
They flip their tail
up and they take off.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.890
This deer wagged his tail.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.560
And I felt like I could have
gone over and petted him.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.150
But I didn't want
to invade his space.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.190
So I walked--

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:50.210
I don't know-- this
far away maybe,

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.780
and we looked at each other.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.750
And I was the one that
broke the contact.

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.810
I'd never had that experience.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:02.080
And I can only attribute
it to, I was that open.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:02.580
SPEAKER: OK.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.330
Thanks, everybody.

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:04.161
Thank you, Ray.

00:52:04.161 --> 00:52:04.660
Thank you.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:04.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:05.805
RAY MOUNT: Thank you.

00:52:05.805 --> 00:52:07.240
Appreciate it.
