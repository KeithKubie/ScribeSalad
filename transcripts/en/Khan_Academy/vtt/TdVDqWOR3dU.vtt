00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.469
- [Voiceover] So we have
g of x being defined

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.636
as the log of 3x when zero is
less than x is less than three

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:11.389
and four minus x times the log of nine

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.056
when x is greater than or equal to three.

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:19.421
So based on this definition of g of x,

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.279
we want to find the limit of g of x

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.415
as x approaches three, and once again,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:27.735
this three is right at
the interface between

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.722
these two clauses or these two cases.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.709
We go to this first case when
x is between zero and three,

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:37.359
when it's greater than
zero and less than three,

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.908
and then at three, we hit this case.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:42.318
So in order to find the
limit, we want to find

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.315
the limit from the left hand side

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.303
which will have us dealing
with this situation

00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:49.282
'cause if we're less than
three we're in this clause,

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.897
and we also want to find a
limit from the right hand side

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:54.911
which would put us in this
clause right over here,

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.179
and then if both of those limits exist

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.891
and if they are the same,
then that is going to be

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.560
the limit of this, so let's do that.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.957
So let me first go from
the left hand side.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:09.615
So the limit as x
approaches three from values

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:12.572
less than three, so we're
gonna approach from the left

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.322
of g of x, well, this
is equivalent to saying

00:01:18.564 --> 00:01:22.758
this is the limit as x approaches three

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:24.444
from the negative side.

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:27.936
When x is less than three,
which is what's happening here,

00:01:27.936 --> 00:01:29.946
we're approaching three from the left,

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:32.022
we're in this clause right over here.

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:33.889
So we're gonna be
operating right over there.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.568
That is what g of x is when
we are less than three.

00:01:37.568 --> 00:01:38.651
So log of 3x,

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:46.439
and since this function
right over here is defined

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:50.089
and continuous over the
interval we care about,

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.903
it's defined continuous for
all x's greater than zero,

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.142
we can just substitute three in here

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:58.016
to see what it would be approaching.

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:02.183
So this would be equal to
log of three times three,

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:06.759
or logarithm of nine, and once again

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.240
when people just write log
here within writing the base,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.823
it's implied that it
is 10 right over here.

00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:15.963
So this is log base 10.

00:02:15.963 --> 00:02:17.853
That's just a good thing to know

00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:20.688
that sometimes gets missed a little bit.

00:02:20.688 --> 00:02:22.892
All right, now let's think
about the other case.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.218
Let's think about the
situation where we are

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:27.440
approaching three from
the right hand side,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.764
from values greater than three.

00:02:29.764 --> 00:02:33.222
Well, we are now going
to be in this scenario

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:36.576
right over there, so
this is going to be equal

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:39.646
to the limit as x approaches three

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:42.994
from the positive direction,
from the right hand side

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.660
of, well g of x is in this clause

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.854
when we are greater than three,

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.937
so four minus x times log of nine,

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:56.193
and this looks like some type
of a logarithm expression

00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:58.503
at first until you
realize that log of nine

00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:00.848
is just a constant, log base 10 of nine

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:03.546
is gonna be some number close to one.

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:06.710
This expression would
actually define a line.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.708
For x greater than or equal
to three, g of x is just

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:12.175
a line even though it looks
a little bit complicated.

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:16.030
And so this is actually
defined for all real numbers,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.197
and it's also continuous for
any x that you put into it.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.681
So to find this limit, to think about

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.278
what is this expression approaching

00:03:25.278 --> 00:03:27.824
as we approach three from
the positive direction,

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:29.950
well we can just evaluate a three.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.852
So it's going to be four minus three

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:35.876
times log of nine, well that's just one,

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:39.126
so that's equal to log base 10 of nine.

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:44.091
So the limit from the left
equals the limit from the right.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.758
They're both log nine,
so the answer here is

00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:50.787
log log of nine,

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:55.079
and we are done.
